        "additional_details": "Every MP, regardless of party politics from every area around the country should be raising questions over this in parliament. The positive effect of local radio can not be measured in \u00a3, as I bet every MP can attest to the exposure it has given to constituents/groups/charity's & given their voice reach on important topics in local communities UK wide. Reduction of unique local programming must surely raise questions on fulfilment of charter & if public funds are being used in a effective manner",
        "background": "BBC is a publicly funded service that's supposed to be for the people & big part of delivering that promise within charter is local TV & radio output that's unique to areas it's broadcast in. The removal of this output is a disservice to local communities up & down the country that must be stopped.",
