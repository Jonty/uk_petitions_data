        "additional_details": "Over the last two years my partner and I have been trying to conceive. We both have our own problems and we were told we were eligible for IVF. The CCG rejected our application due to the males BMI. I am a healthy and very active and for me to reach the desired BMI I would be unhealthy. The NHS is meant to treat but this rule is creating mental health problems for Men & Women across the UK. We were made to take more tests when the NHS knew the criteria and never informed us.",
        "background": "The CCG has set out criteria for IVF to the NHS and this information is not readily available. In January this year the CCG added criteria that men's BMI had to be under 30. BMI is not a true measurement of someone's health and this is advised from NICE who the NHS use. This rule should be scrapped",
