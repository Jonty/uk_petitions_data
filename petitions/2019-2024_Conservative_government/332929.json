There is consistent talk of substance misuse, mental health, domestic violence, self harm and abuse increasing during this period - Social Workers are the professionals that tackle these issues in families or individually on a daily basis and work to keep people together. We love our work but are continuously criticised & forgotten about. Things have to change!",
