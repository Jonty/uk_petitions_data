        "additional_details": "Aside from remedying the unfairness of the current situation, it would encourage young people to save more towards bigger ticket items such as cars, mortgages and retirement if the returns were reasonable.  For those living on a basic pension that have savings it would boost their income and make them less dependent on Gov handouts.  It would also help people find that extra cash needed for energy/care bills and high cost of living expenses if they have savings.",
        "background": "Banks are quick enough to pass on interest rate rises to borrowers but fail to pass the same rises onto savers.  Legislation is now needed to ensure that this happens across all financial institutions in the UK.",
