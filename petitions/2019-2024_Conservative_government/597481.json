        "additional_details": "After wasting precious blood and treasure in Afghanistan for the past two decades, Britain \u2013 along with Nato allies \u2013 simply deserted the long suffering people to the brutality of puritanical zealots. For 20 years, the UK championed democracy & human rights only to lamely hand over the country to its former religious tyrants. Britain must tangibly show its lasting commitment to gender parity \u2013 in the face of vile Taliban sexism \u2013 by sponsoring 10,000 at-risk young women to be educated in the UK.",
        "background": "Britain's shameful retreat from Afghanistan has gifted that war-torn country to the misogynist Taliban, who viciously opposes female equality. To redeem itself, the UK must welcome a minimum of 10,000 bright Afghan women to pursue their education here. This partly atones for Britain's ugly betrayal.",
