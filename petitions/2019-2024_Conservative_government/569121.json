        "additional_details": "I would like the government and parliament to cancel them as many pupils are stressed out and very anxious as they feel that they will fail as they haven\u2019t been in school learning and for a lot of students working from home has been very hard especially if they can\u2019t get online or live in a house hold that has a bad working environment. Students and teachers can\u2019t form bonds and work together online. Work and help can\u2019t be the same and isn\u2019t the same online which stresses students out.",
        "background": "Current year 10s and 12s haven\u2019t had a proper year at school since year 8 (for year 10s) and year 10 (for year 12s). So it\u2019s been very hard as, in the two years we haven\u2019t had a proper year at school is vital and so many have missed out vital parts of their education because of struggling at home.",
