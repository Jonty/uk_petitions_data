Figures from the BMA showing a 1 in 10 survival rate for someone who is suffering cardiac arrest wheras in many European Countries where CPR is widely taught the survival rate can be as high as 1 in 4. By teaching more people the way to perform CPR we could help increase the number of people who survive Cardiac Arrest every year.",
        "background": "I am calling for the Government to make CPR lessons widely available to the public for free, this action could save thousands of lives a year. I believe the Government should fund these lessons and encourage as many people as possible to take up this opportunity which undoubtedly would save lives.",
