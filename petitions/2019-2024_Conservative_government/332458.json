For the last few months nurses have been risking their lives to help yours and its time they/we were shown apprieciation for it. Nursing is tough at the best of times, 12.5 hour shifts, nightshifts, caring for the sickest people in the country. It shouldn't have taken a world pandemic to show our worth- but now that it has- we need you to back that up and treat us with some respect.",
