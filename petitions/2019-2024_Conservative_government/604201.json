Parents are splitting up over their child's needs, on top of 24/7 care whilst they work to earn a living.  Every person in the Country should have a basic knowledge of what Autism means.  Every public service provider, e.g. restaurants, shops, medical service, should have trained their staff to make Autistic children and families feel PART OF SOCIETY, without any stigma.",

To legislate all diagnosed autistic children receive appropriate therapies/education necessary to develop potential, rather than rejection for their needs.",
