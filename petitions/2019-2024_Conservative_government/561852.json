        "action": "Reduction in University Tuition Fees",
        "additional_details": "Reasons why tuition fees should be reduced during the pandemic. The first and probably most important reason is that students are paying full fees for services they are now not receiving. For example, mental wellbeing services, face to face lectures and guidance from lecturers. Anyone doing a practical based degree is also unable to attain the practical based knowledge they need. Students have had to adjust to home learning, despite being more successful with usual university attendance.",
        "background": "Because of the Covid pandemic, many students are studying at home and still paying full yearly tuition fees (\u00a39000+). This has been shown to have a huge impact on their learning and in many cases falling behind on their studies, often causing a negative impact on mental health.",
