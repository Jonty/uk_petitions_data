These food parcels are inadequate and not a true reflection of the value they should be worth. Families are being let down by the government when they need help most, children require a healthy balanced diet, they\u2019re expected to home learn all day, the very least the government can do is provide them with a nutritious & varied diet",

Proof of poor quantities of food has been freely shared across social media",
