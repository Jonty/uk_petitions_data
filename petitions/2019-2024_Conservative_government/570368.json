        "additional_details": "It should be written in law that you can attend funerals to have closure & say goodbye, not only for yourself but to support others around you as this is a difficult time and something that impacts people\u2019s physical & mental health. To let employers decide if you work or not shouldn\u2019t be an option, they don\u2019t know your relationship with whom passed away, it is injustice to who passed as they would want everyone together. Law should be you are entitled to that day off whatever your relationship.",
        "background": "Employers should allow family and friends by law to attend a funeral whether it be immediate family or not, dis-allowing close friends/partners to not have the option to attend is extremely unfair and puts more pressure on the mental health of those already upset about the death.",
