        "additional_details": "I whilst working in Early Years for 7 years, I have came across children and adults who are unable to verbally communicate and need to use BSL. Majority of people I have spoke to know very little BSL and find it awkward as they\u2019re unaware how to communicate/sign with those who need BSL. If BSL was taught in schools this would give everyone the right to freely communicate and be understood.",
        "background": "I would like Parliament to consider making BSL mandatory in schools. Those who are non verbal find it difficult to communicate as not everyone knows BSL (British Sign Language). If this was taught in schools from a young age, this would help those who struggle to communicate",
