        "additional_details": "This has become a part of our history. There have been so many people that have died from this virus and died alone. There has been so many who have died, that only a small percentage of those people have had their deaths acknowledged. Thousands of families have had to conduct funeral services with a limited number of family members and many have not been able to full fill their loved ones final wishes. I feel that these deaths should fully be acknowledged with a large memorial.",
        "background": "I would like the government the employ a range of artists or freelance creatives who have been made redundant or furloughed to design and build a large commemorative wall that lists all those who have needlessly died following the Corona virus in the UK.",
