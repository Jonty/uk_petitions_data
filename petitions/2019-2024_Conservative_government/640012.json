        "additional_details": "This has come to my concern as people with driveways have a extra parking space so dont need to pay as much but residents who do not have to pay extra for a permit. I would like the Goverment to change the prices of parking permits because me and my family live in a walkway in the borough of Hillingdon and many houses around us have driveways. My family have to pay \u00a3110 a year just to park on the road they live in and can bearly afford that so other familys must be in the same position as mine too.",
        "background": "The Goverment need to change the prices of parking permits as my family can bearly afford anything because of the cost of living. I would like the Goverment to change the price to \u00a320 max per permit as \u00a375+ is way too much for a family like mine.",
