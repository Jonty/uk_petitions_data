        "additional_details": "Earlier in 2020, Belarus held the first seemingly competitive election since the country's conception, Alexander Lukashenko has held the office of president for the entire existence of the nation. The country has some of the worst records on human rights in Europe and is often referred to as the last dictatorship in Europe. It is imperative that the free & democratic nations of Europe stand resolute against the abuses, irregularity and torture used to crush opposition and democracy in Belarus.",
        "background": "Call upon the government not to recognise the recent Belarusian Presidential Elections due to the irregularities, accusations of torture, widespread violence and unrealistic majority claimed by Lukashenko. Further calling upon the UK government to participate in multilateral action against Belarus.",
