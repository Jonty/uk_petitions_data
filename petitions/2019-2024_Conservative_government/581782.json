        "additional_details": "Every where you turn, the radio, social media, tv, sport, papers the list is endless....gambling adverts. This needs to stop. 20% of gambling addicts have suicidal thoughts. 66% of young people see gambling on tv and social media. And here the spiral begins. It is lethal and claiming lives so promotion needs to stop! We do not advertise smoking or drugs. Gambling is as dangerous. \u2018When the fun stops, stop\u2019 is simply not enough. It is an illness and advertisement and promotions feed the need",
        "background": "An absolute ban to promoting any sort of advertisement in relation to gambling. Gambling is as addictive as any other issue such as drugs, smoking, food. All these have restrictions in place regarding advertisement so why is gambling being overlooked when that also claims lives",
