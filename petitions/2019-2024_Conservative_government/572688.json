        "additional_details": "Firstly, I am one of those patients waiting for life saving treatment, I'm in my 30's & definitely not ready to die! \r\n\r\nThe NHS are doing an amazing job, however Covid, bed capacity & staffing, amongst other issues are impacting the lives of non-Covid patients. We are hearing many sad stories of life saving Transplants cancelled, Cancer treatments postponed & other critical services on hold. People are dying needlessly.  Non-covid patients are just as important, more lives can & should be saved.",
        "background": "We must remember that both Covid & non-Covid patients are equally as important. Thousands of non-Covid life saving procedures have been cancelled due to resources being redirected to treating Coronavirus. Cancellations include Transplants & Cancer treatments. This is causing many avoidable deaths.",
