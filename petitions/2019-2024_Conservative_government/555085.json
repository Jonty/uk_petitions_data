        "additional_details": "Put an end to the seemingly endless restrictions and let this virus run its course. Still suggest things such as hand washing and keeping a distance from strangers, but let the economy fully reopen and allow people human contact with friends, family and loved ones. Isolate all vulnerable people to stop the NHS being over run and unnecessary death and put measures to help stop the virus reaching the vulnerable through carers and nurses with stricter rules for them.",
        "background": "While the Economy is for the most part open, all of the Covid-19 restrictions are still having a huge impact on the way businesses run, and peoples daily lives. People are struggling with mental health issues, national morale is decreasing and the economy is restricted from growth.",
