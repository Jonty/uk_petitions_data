        "action": "Introduce majority fan ownership in English professional football.",
        "additional_details": "The recent announcement of the European Super League (ESL) has shown, clearer than ever, the need for fan ownership in English football. Wealthy owners now threaten the fabric of communities that clubs represent, driven by greed and power. The only way to protect clubs and their communities is to return power and voting rights to those who the club genuinely means everything to. Such an intrinsic part of English culture cannot be allowed to become the plaything of a few rich and powerful.",
        "background": "We want the government to introduce legislation that enshrines majority fan ownership of professional English football clubs into law to ensure that the patrons of these clubs are the ones who are in control of it - similar to the German model of football club fan ownership.",
