        "additional_details": "There must be a common place where the virus is spreading and we all go shopping. Most supermarkets are not even doing the basic hygiene clean and we have a virus which is highly transmissible and fatal. Most supermarkets have just put up sanitisation stations for customers to use rather than taking the responsibility for ensuring that each shopping trolley and basket handles are cleaned and sanitised after each use. Thousands of hands are being touched and we have a pandemic.",
