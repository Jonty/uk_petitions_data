In addition, this will reset the disastrous shelter system.\r\nWe can save lives, save money, expand testing, get more business back to normal and go a long way to emptying dog shelters. The cost is be magnitudes smaller than the benefits.\r\nThis needs to be fasttracked!",

All suitable dogs would be deployed and have its financial needs met for life wherever it lives",
