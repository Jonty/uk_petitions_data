For years I\u2019ve tried every option phoning contacting police , file reports , contacted local council , spoke with ASB in relation to my neighbours and there behaviour. Which is from damaging property, vandalism/ scratching cars throwing stones , smashing glass , drugs setting out of control fires and exploding gas canisters etc ive tried every route and it all seems for nothing. It\u2019s been years and nothing is being done . Police and council need more powers to deal with neighbours like these . It\u2019s unfair on the rest of the neighbourhood who feel they have to move away because they can no longer tolerate the behaviour.",
        "background": "To give police and council more powers . So they can provide more help in relation to nuisance neighbours. Who are causing vandalism, being noisy , etc . Allowing them to have a more stricter approach to deal with these situations so it don\u2019t continue on for years .",
