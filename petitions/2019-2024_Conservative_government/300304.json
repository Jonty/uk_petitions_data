        "additional_details": "The government should close schools across the UK due to a huge amount of pupils who visited Italy during February half term. This could be threatening to the lives of citizens within the UK and could possibly lead to death. Allowing schools to close will prevent the spread in large public places. This will maintain the number of current cases and ensure no new cases are confirmed in the future. We need to prevent lives being taken by enforcing strict procedures NOW!",
