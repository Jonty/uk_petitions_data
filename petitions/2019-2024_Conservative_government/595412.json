        "action": "Make sanitary products free in supermarkets, schools and public bathrooms.",
        "additional_details": "Period poverty is when those on low incomes can\u2019t afford, or access, suitable sanitary products. With average periods lasting approximately 5 days, it can cost up to \u00a38 a month for tampons and pads. According to Plan International, more than 1 in 10 women had to improvise sanitary wear due to affordability issues. This means currently 1.8 million women in the UK are unable to afford sanitary products.",
        "background": "Last year Scotland became the first nation to provide free period products for all after the Period Products (Free Provision) (Scotland) Our goal is to achieve the same thing in England. We want local authorities to ensure that tampons and sanitary pads are easily accessible to those who need them.",
