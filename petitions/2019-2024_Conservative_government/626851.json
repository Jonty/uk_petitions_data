        "additional_details": "The Blair government did not anticipate the rise of the courier/delivery economy. Consequently there is now constant high-intensity pedal-bike traffic on pavements everywhere in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe Blair govt. did not foresee electric bikes, so high-speed powered are also using pavements illegally, camouflaged among normal bicycles.\r\n\r\n\"Decriminalised\" pavement cycling was an experiment. It failed.\r\n\r\nRoads are now safer for cyclists, but pavements are unsafe for pedestrians. Get cyclists back on the road.",
        "background": "The Blair government took a political decision to stop enforcing the Highway Act 1835 (s.72) and Road Traffic Act 1988 (s.51). Both laws are still in place today, and recent alterations to the Highway Code mean that cyclists are now safer on roads. It is time to enforce the 1835 and 1988 laws again.",
