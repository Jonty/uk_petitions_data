        "additional_details": "Pay for majority does not stretch far enough for basics bought locally. These regulations have cut off access to reasonably priced basic goods and care parcels/presents sent by loved ones. The tax applied to these parcels is usually overcharged and difficult to challenge. Parcels are being opened despite having a customs declaration, we are now threatened with parcels being returned if declarations aren't seen/present. These regulations have a significant negative impact on the BFC community.",
        "background": "Revoke the new regulations that are penalising British Forces and their dependents that are serving overseas. Put an effective system in place and provide transparent guidelines for all before it goes live. Inform UK sellers of goods that customs declarations are needed for BFPO or BF1 addresses.",
