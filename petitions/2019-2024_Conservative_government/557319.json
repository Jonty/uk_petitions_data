        "additional_details": "Services such as the Friday Prayer for the Muslim community , Sunday Mass are vitally important for their respective attendees  - as mentioned above there is no fear of the spread occurring within the place of worship due to the appropriate measures being taken. \r\nMP\u2019s around the country have in fact seen these measures but we believe they have not been consulted.",
        "background": "The Government\u2019s decision to limit \u2018places of worship\u2019 being open for private prayer is uninformed. All places of worship since July Re-opening have implemented measures such as maintaining 2 metre gap, mask mandatory , sanitising liquid that make the spread of virus within them extremely unlikely",
