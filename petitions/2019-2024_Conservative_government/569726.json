        "additional_details": "Following the governments decision yet again to cancel driving tests leaving 1000's in a state of panic at this already stressful time it seems almost spiteful to do this again since many tests have been cancelled 4 or 5 times already. if the government are trying to discourage us from using public transport at this time, shouldn't they be encouraging us to drive? Moreover, many of us are key workers and it is imperative for us to be able to drive!",
        "background": "with the ever-changing regulations regarding driving leaving i and many others with cancelled driving tests, some already for the 4th or 5th time I am asking, if a test is only 45 minutes with masks and gloves and all windows open is it not feasible to allow driving tests and lessons to continue?",
