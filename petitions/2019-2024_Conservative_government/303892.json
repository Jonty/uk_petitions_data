        "additional_details": "Parents are concerned that removing their child, prior to a Government instruction to close schools, could lead to penalties imposed on Parents for unauthorised absence.\r\n\r\nGiving the parent the option to remove there child, if this is a viable option, will allow for smaller class sizes and less chance of community transmission. \r\n\r\nAlthough children appear to not be affected as badly as the older generations, they can still carry this virus, and spread it through their families, and community.",
        "background": "Given the current situation in the UK with growing concerns for the Coronavirus Pandemic, many parents feel that the decision as to when to remove their child from the school environment should be theirs. \r\n\r\nParents should be allowed to remove their children from school, when they feel it is right.",
