        "additional_details": "Taking in to consideration the current Corona Virus situation, it is NOT possible for people to \"self isolate\" and miss work with the current Statutory Sick Pay levels without leading to extreme hardship. \u00a394.25 will not even cover rent or mortgage payments. Many people will have to return to work whilst still suffering from the illness purely to ensure they will be able to make ends meet. This will result in increased numbers of victims",
        "background": "It is vital that the UK Government increase Statutory Sick Pay to the same level of the UK minimum wage (back dated to the beginning of the Corona Virus situation) to reduce the extreme hardship that will be caused by self isolation.",
