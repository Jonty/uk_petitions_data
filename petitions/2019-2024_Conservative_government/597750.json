        "action": "Stop media outlets reporting shortages of food & fuel too early, causing panic.",
        "additional_details": "Media outlets continuously spark panic and a buying frenzy by reporting on food and fuel shortages when they do not need too. A tiny fraction of fuel stations were reportedly closed as they have ran out of fuel, due to the shortage of HGV drivers. A similar issue was happening with food on the shelves. \r\n\r\nThis was reported as being very low and suddenly it has caused long queues at the pumps causing the issue to get a lot bigger than it would have been if it wasn\u2019t reported so early.",
        "background": "Prevent media companies and outlets from reporting on food and fuel shortages etc until directed, or it passes below a certain stock level to stop the public panic buying when it is not needed.\r\n\r\nThe way the media report things is very misleading, especially with the headlines on social media.",
