        "additional_details": "In the last general election, 44% of the votes were for the conservatives, but they got 56% of the seats. Also, the green party should have got 20 seats but they only got 1. \r\n\r\nSTV allows people to vote for who they really want to and not worry about tactical voting, because every vote counts. \r\n\r\nIt is disingenuous to say that people are voting on a local scale, because parliament makes the laws for the country which everyone must follow.\r\n\r\nThe following videos explain why STV is a lot better than FPTP:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8XOZJkozfI&t=1s",
        "background": "The 'winner takes all' nature of the seats means that nearly half of the votes are ignored in many constituencies. This makes the seat distribution not proportional to the vote distribution.\r\n\r\nFPTP also results in a two-party system which dissuades many people from voting.",
