        "additional_details": "It is a widely known fact that a lot of the UK population use and or are for the legalisation of Cannabis. The public would recognise that you have listened to its opinions and if it was to be legalised it would most definitely bring crime rate down and may lower the use of much harsher substances. All or a percentage of tax made from sales should go towards the NHS\u2019 fund.",
        "background": "Legalise Cannabis in the hope that people will be more understanding of new legislations put in place to tackle Covid-19. I think if the government legalised Cannabis people would in return be more inclined to agree to new legislation.",
