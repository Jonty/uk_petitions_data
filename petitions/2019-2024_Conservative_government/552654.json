        "additional_details": "I have managed a small village pub for over four years. Our clients and patrons are friends, family and occasionally new faces. Since the current new guidelines we have had to reduce our custom by 50% whilst increasing our staffing by 50%. The business model will not work and we will be forced to close our doors within the next month. This situation will result in the loss of jobs, the loss of lifelines for many of our older patrons and the end of a business that has been well managed for nearly two hundred years. We ask that community and village pubs are able to trade with limited numbers, PPE and social distancing. But we request that small pubs without menus and food be able to serve drinks from the bar in order to break even and hopefully make a profit.",
        "background": "Remove table service legislation so that small community pubs who have a capacity indoors for under 40 allow patrons to order at the bar before being seated. Allow people to congregate within the rule of six and social distancing measures. Allow the businesses to trade effectively and make a profit.",
