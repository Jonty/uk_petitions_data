        "additional_details": "Older people in the UK are being trapped into poverty by the state pension and benefit system, namely the state pension isn't enough to live on, and unemployment benefit does not apply. It is therefore necessary work to top up one's income.\r\n\r\nHowever, under the present Covid climate and with ageism barely disguised, it is very difficult for older people to find new jobs, and are therefore finding it hard to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the UK government to conduct a full review and substantial increase to the state pension, to enable pensioners to live in retirement with the dignity they deserve.",
