        "additional_details": "MP Reece Mogg recently explained that a petition signed by over a quarter of a million brits was thrown out of government on the basis that it hadn't been through the government website. However, the website the petition was on (change.org) follows the same screening process as the parliament website. Under parliamentary procedure petitions signed by 10,000 people will get a response from the government, with those signed by more than 100,000 people considered for debate in parliament.",
        "background": "Discuss all petitions posed to government regardless of whether these are created through the government website or other petitioning websites or platforms. The names signed on other websites are just as representative of public concern as those on the government website.",
