        "additional_details": "I am extremely passionate about supporting people with mental health issues.\r\n\r\nConsidering mental health is positively promoted in society more than ever, it seems ludicrous that there is not a Police Code of Practice specifically on engaging with people with a mental health diagnosis.\r\n \r\nI had a personal experience which had a significantly negative impact on my life and my mental state of mind. I managed to overcome it but others may not so I want to fight for those people.",
        "background": "I want the Government to introduce a Police Code of Practice on how police engage with people with a mental health diagnosis, to ensure that there is a framework for how the police should engage with people who have such a diagnosis.",
