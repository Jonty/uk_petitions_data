        "additional_details": "An estimated 700,000 UK citizens have no fixed postal address;  either as a result of lifestyle choices, or in response to financial imperatives.  These include canal boaters, fulltime motorhomers, those living on static caravan sites, or travelling constantly for work.\r\n\r\nAn accommodation address with mail forwarding or scanning, supplied by a professional, approved and compliant provider, is both more secure and would meet the DVLA's stated criteria of contactability far more effectively.",
        "background": "Persuade the DVLA to rescind the current blanket ban and implement a mechanism by which providers could be 'approved' to supply this much needed service.\r\n\r\nWe suggest that the same strict compliance standards, demanded by HMRC for Trust & Company Service Provider status, would be ideal for purpose.",
