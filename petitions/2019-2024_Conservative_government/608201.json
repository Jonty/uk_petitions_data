        "additional_details": "The government is forcing zero carbon on the country before the technology exists to implement it sensibly. As we only contribute one percent or less to the World total carbon emission it would be an act of gross self harm to implement zero carbon before the technology exists to do so. Achieving zero carbon should not be a step function but a steady rise dictated by advancing technology.",
