        "additional_details": "Every year schools are closed to be used as polling stations during local elections, general elections and referendums, causing disruption to education and cost to parents. Given that the Government has placed such high importance on school attendance (with parents facing fines of \u00a360 for a day missed) we believe it is hypocritical to allow schools to be closed during elections, particularly when additional costs can fall on parents. Schools cannot remain open with the general public on the premises so alternatives should be found",
        "background": "Thousands of schools close during elections for use as polling stations. This is disruptive to children's education and can cost parents in terms of lost earnings, annual leave or childcare, not to mention the impact this has on children with extra needs when their routine is disrupted.",
