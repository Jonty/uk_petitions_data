        "additional_details": "Why are the working class paying the price for a national problem? When food bank usage and the proportion of children living in poverty is steadily increasing why add to the problem? A \u00a31.50 bus fare twice a day is the same price as a school dinner - for families who don\u2019t qualify for Free School Meals but who struggle to pay for lunches, this may force them to choose between feeding their child or sending them to school. \r\n\r\nChildren have missed enough school due to the Covid-19 pandemic already",
        "background": "As part of TFL\u2019s government bailout, the congestion charge will be increased, under 18\u2019s will no longer be able to travel for free on London\u2019s buses. \r\n\r\nCharging under 18\u2019s to use public transport will bring down school attendance and prevent social mobility for children from disadvantaged families",
