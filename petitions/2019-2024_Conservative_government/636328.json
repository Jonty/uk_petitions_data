        "additional_details": "It is unfair and unjust that men get a police NFA record even though they are totally innocent of all charges. We then have to go through the costly tedious procedure to get the record deleted. Why should the innocent have to go through this process.  There is no support for men. Women who falsely accuse with the intention to pervert the course of justice should be automatically arrested and charged. Compensation for the innocent should be made available",
        "background": "Innocent men who are accused of sexual assault automatically get a police record to say NFA even though they are Innocent of all charges. This affects mental health, employment chances and standing in community. Meanwhile the woman is not automatically arrested for perverting the course of justice",

Your petition refers to innocent men who are accused of sexual assault, but a decision by the police not to take further action does not mean an alleged perpetrator has been found innocent.\r\n\r\nYour petition also calls for women to be automatically arrested in certain circumstances, but decisions about investigating and prosecuting alleged crimes are a matter for the police and Crown Prosecution Service, not the Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nMake reporting false allegations of sexual offences a specific criminal offence: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/628918\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to require that the police not record details of investigations where it decides not to take any further action, if that's what you want to happen."
