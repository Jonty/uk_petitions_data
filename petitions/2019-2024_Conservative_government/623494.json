        "additional_details": "It'll take years for the fracking industry to develop and become economically viable if ever so it won't address the current cost of living crisis.\r\nA large scale fracking industry will destroy swathes of our countryside that we need for growing food, for wildlife and our own wellbeing. \r\nInstead, we need to focus on developing renewable energy rather than fossil fuels that will pollute the planet and eventually run out.",
        "background": "The fracking ban was lifted on 22nd September against the wishes of many communities and without addressing the concerns about earth tremors and other issues.\r\nThere's no democratic mandate for lifting the ban wasn't in the last Conservative manifesto and it hasn't been approved by Parliament.",
