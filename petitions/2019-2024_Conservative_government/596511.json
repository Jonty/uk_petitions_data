        "additional_details": "Dibetes is widely known around the world with type 1 or 2.  Sadly for 1000s of us with dibetes who suffer from type 3c which is rarely known about and very lacking in information. With 3c treatment can be very hard and monitoring you glucose level is needed due to pancreas not working.  Having a libre machine fitted to your arm would help in managing your dibetes and be in better control of your treatment. These machines are funded but not to all who need it and this would save lives.",

With type 3c is not very known well and is hard to manage. But with a glucose machine can help a patients treatment of their dibetes.",
