        "additional_details": "This is significant to do this as current year 13s have had 5 months off of school. Most schools start to introduce coursework around May time of year 12, however as we know in May 2020 we were in a lockdown struggling with the drastic change to online learning and coursework was neglected. When the current year 13s started school again in September of 2020 schools had to prioritise many missed months of knowledge gaps. So cancelling coursework would significantly help the mental health of current year 13s.",
        "background": "Grant year 13 students the full percentage of what it contributes to the particular subject  or let teachers assess the situation.",
