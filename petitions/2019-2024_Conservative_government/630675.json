        "action": "Change the High Income Child Benefit charge to a household threshold.",
        "additional_details": "The way the charge is worked out means taxation falls on households that are less well off. It unfairly penalises children of single parent households or households where only one parent is able to earn an income. The Government has already been asked to look at this issue and the reason the petition was rejected was because of the administrative costs/ requirements. This is not good enough. Families who may have lower household incomes should receive full benefit for their children.",
        "background": "The High Income Child Benefit charge is unfair. The charge is imposed against individual salaries of over \u00a350k rather than against total household income - this means children who are supported by joint parental salaries of \u00a398k do not lose out, but children who rely on a single income of \u00a351k do.",
