        "additional_details": "Many people are struggling to make ends meet on minimum wage or zero hours contracts. If you have to self-isolate, or become ill, the money goes down even further, but the bills don\u2019t.\r\nIf a freeze on these bills could be imposed during the current crisis, that would help a lot of people to survive better. Warm houses, food on the table, all will help in recovery from the virus.",
        "background": "For many of us, it is not the infection that is the worry but knowing that SSP will not cover the bills. Rent, rates, mortgage payments will all mean that less than \u00a3100 per week is soon gone.\r\nIf these bills are suspended during the pandemic, people can feed themselves and their families.",
