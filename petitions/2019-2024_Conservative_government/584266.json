        "additional_details": "On Feb 1, Myanmar\u2019s military attempted to seize power from the democratically elected government and dissolved parliament. Elected MPs have since formed the National Unity Government (NUG) to continue to represent the people.\r\nThe NUG has the support of Myanmar\u2019s existing Permanent Representative. The General Assembly will consider credentials of any representative sent by the military in August. We ask that the UK endorse the NUG credentials, and reject the military\u2019s claim to represent Myanmar.",
