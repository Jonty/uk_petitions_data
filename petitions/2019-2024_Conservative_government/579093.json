        "additional_details": "The UK sex offenders register should be easily and publicly accessible over the internet within the best interests of the safety for the general public. Sex offenders do not deserve anonymity from their crimes, the trauma and disturbances they create should not be gifted privacy. Residents of any constituency should, without question, be able to know where danger lies for theirselves and for their children. Memories of sexual assault are never forgotten, as should be the case for the offenders.",
        "background": "The full list of names of residents of the United Kingdom who have been convicted of sex crimes should be easily and publicly accessible, preferably over the internet on the UK Government's website. People should be able to search for sex offenders in their constituency.",
