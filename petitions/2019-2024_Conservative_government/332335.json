        "additional_details": "The Government need to accept that the Agenda for Change pay rises were agreed in 2018 and do not reward NHS staff for their hard work and dedication through this COVID-19 pandemic. Clapping for NHS staff is not enough! If the Government can reward other public sectors including doctors, surely they should be rewarding the other crucial NHS workers in line with this.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson has announced pay rises for public sector staff including teachers, doctors and dentists and more. But there will be no pay rise for the rest of the NHS including nurses, ambulance staff, HCAs and many more who have worked throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This needs to be addressed.",
