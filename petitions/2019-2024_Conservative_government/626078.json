        "additional_details": "In light of the high turnover of UK Prime Ministers, and the current economic situation, it is not ethical for each Prime Minister to qualify for the PDCA. In her 45 days as PM Liz Truss earnt \u00a325k in salary & severance. She will also earn \u00a3115k a year from the PDCA. In a situation where people are unable to afford energy bills, the PDCA is an unacceptable use of public money. The public should not fund Prime Minister\u2019s and political party\u2019s inability to organise themselves and do their jobs.",
        "background": "The Government need to alter the eligibility criteria for Prime Ministers to receive the Public Duty Costs Allowance (PDCA) of \u00a3115000 once they have resigned from the position of Prime Minister. The criteria needs to be changed so that you have to have served a full term in order to qualify.",
