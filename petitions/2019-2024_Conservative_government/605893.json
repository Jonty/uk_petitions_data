There are families in 1 or 2 bedroom homes with 4+ children having to share 1 bedroom including those with medical needs or older children. The councils acknowledge the need for a bigger property but due to the lack of 4 bedrooms it\u2019s making the situation worse by keeping them in cramped conditions for longer and therefore it should be allowed that tenants can bid on 3 beds",

It should be that they can bid on 3 bedrooms to alleviate their situation until a suitable home is available",
