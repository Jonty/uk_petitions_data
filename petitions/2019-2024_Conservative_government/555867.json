        "additional_details": "Psilocybin (the psychoactive chemical found in certain types of mushrooms) has shown a very high level of potential in improving mental health,  fighting depression and also aiding the symptoms of people who suffer with PTSD.\r\n\r\nCOVID-19 has been hard on us all, we need to find new ways in which we can improve the quality of life of people in our Country, and potentially avoid further strain on our already stretched NHS in future.",
        "background": "Psilocybin is listed as a Schedule 1 substance, meaning it is thought to have no medicinal value and cannot be studied. \r\n\r\nResearch from other Countries has shown that the OPPOSITE is true. I would like this substance reclassified for scientists to find ways to avert a looming mental health crisis.",
