        "additional_details": "This should happen to: \r\n* protect more individuals who have worked on the \u201cfrontline\u201d of this crisis\r\n* supermarkets are one of the highest places COVID-19 is likely to be transmissible, due to mixing of households in the shop itself\r\n* ensures staff can continue to work without the threat of the virus \r\n* reduced chance of virus transmission in the working environment\r\n* staff anxiety and stress-levels reduce due to protection from virus",
        "background": "Advice from the JCVI on the priority groups for a Covid-19 vaccine does not include supermarket retail staff. This petition calls for these workers, who have worked at the frontline of this pandemic, to be kept safe by being put on the priority list (when such a list is adopted by the Government).",
