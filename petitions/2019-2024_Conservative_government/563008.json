        "additional_details": "Unemployment is the highest in many decades while the job is not done at DWP. This is not acceptable! The DWP must hire more people to cope with its mandatory job ahead of them. It is not acceptable to come with an excuse and stop issuing NI number to anyone legally eligible for it.\r\n\r\nI demand the government and Parliament to force DWP to issue NI numbers to all legally allowed to get one. No excuse! They must hire and train more people if they are short handed or improve their IT system to do the task, especially when all details are requested and uploaded by the applicant.",
        "background": "The Department of Work and Pension suspended issuing National Insurance numbers to EU citizens due to the COVID pandemic until further notice because EU citizens are allowed to work without one.\r\n\r\nWhile at the same time, in reality, no employer will employ anyone without an NI number.",
