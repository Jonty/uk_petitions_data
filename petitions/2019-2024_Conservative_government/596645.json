        "additional_details": "I want the Prime Minister to look at reasons why England is the only country in the UK to make patients pay for vital prescriptions and to realise that many people struggle. Health is not about profit, but about everybody's right. Please ask Sajid Javid to consult with health ministers in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland and look at how the devolved nations manage. It's archaic that one part of the UK is different to the other parts where something as simple as Prescriptions are concerned.",
        "background": "Bring Free Prescriptions to England in line with Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Other parts of the United Kingdom  manage to put the patient ahead of profit, and it is high time that happened in England too. Many people struggle to find even the yearly payment system. It's an unfair system",
