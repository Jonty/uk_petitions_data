        "action": "Add \u2018proof of recovery\u2019 from Covid as another entry requirement into the U.K.",
        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to consider this as there are many people out there that are fully vaccinated that are now catching Coronavirus, and are being unfairly treated as they can now not travel for up to 90 days after recovery from Covid as they have to have a negative test on arrival and there is no option for those that have already recovered from covid. I believe the Government should accept proof of recovery as a way of entry into the U.K.",
        "background": "Currently the government make those flying into the U.K. take a 2 day test on arrival as an entry requirement, however those with \u2018natural immunity\u2019 from recovery from Covid can not take a test for up to 90 days. Therefore proof of recovery should be added as one of the entry requirements.",
