This should be an act of national, rather than political recognition.",
        "background": "To pay tribute to all our NHS and other emergency services professionals, and key workers who contracted Coronavirus, and then died from Covid-19 in the line of duty, I would like Parliament to debate the erection of a national monument in London, or monuments in each of the UK regions.",
