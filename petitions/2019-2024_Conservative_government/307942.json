This has led to tens of thousands of EU Nationals leaving the NHS.\r\n\r\nHe has since been instrumental in government decisions on coronavirus (mitigation rather than suppression) which means we're soon to be the epicentre of the disease.\r\n\r\nHe's also been instrumental in limiting information to the media, especially if its those that do not support the government.",
