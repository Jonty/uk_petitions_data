        "additional_details": "The government seem to be wasting money by funding other companies to provide services such as gyms, exercise equipment & nutritional advice. A vast majority of people who overeat & struggle to lose weight are not happy, do not want to be the way they are but find it near impossible to make a lasting change before reverting to food for comfort. Obesity is as damaging as other addictions. If people could understand WHY they are driven to eat and address those issues greater success would follow.",
        "background": "Have a full review of the way obesity and weight issues are managed in the UK. Listen to those who struggle and live a life effected by obesity. Realise that education and tools are only a small part of the answer but mental health is far more important.",
