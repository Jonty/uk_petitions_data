        "additional_details": "Furthermore, we have to walk out of the ward everyday worrying that we may pass on Covid to other negative patients merely due to the inadequacy of the PPE. If the government doesn\u2019t protect us, how can we protect you? \r\n\r\n Having looked at the guidance by the CDC it says 'Put on a respirator or facemask (if a respirator is not available) before entry into the patient room or care area.' \r\n\r\nWe decipher from the above that there must be a shortage so we are not being provided with adequate PPE. If the respirators are being held back from us, as they are worried about running out of them later, have they ever thought that this may lead to you running out of doctors later? Which is worse? \r\n\r\n'Protect us NOW, so we can help you LATER.'",
        "background": "Public health England\u2019s current advice for personal protective equipment when attending to a Covid positive patient is a simple surgical face mask, apron, and gloves. We work on the respiratory ward every day and enter a bay full of Covid patients without an FFP3 mask multiple times a day.",
