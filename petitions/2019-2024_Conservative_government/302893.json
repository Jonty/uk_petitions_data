This means There is no Proof that you had the virus and would probably not be entitled to support with financial loss. Scientific Proof that their radical theory of herd immunity worked is important. The data we have is currently flawed. To do this they need to track all cases. This is also important for potential future pandemics",

Necessary/unnecessary isolation. For evidence for financial loss/support. For scientific and theoretical evidence for possible future pandemics.",
