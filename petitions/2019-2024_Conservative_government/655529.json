        "additional_details": "We want the government to do this as children from 4-18 spend a huge chunk of their lives in school. Introducing school on Saturdays means children have less time for sporting and social activities on weekends and even less breaks for our mental health. This also means children get to spend less bonding time with their family meaning their relationship will be less strong which could be really damaging for both parents and children. If you really cared about the children of the uk summer holidays would be extended.",
