        "additional_details": "Online marketplaces have been flooded by malicious sellers looking to profiteer from the panic buying, and no doubt many contributed to the shortages by bulk buying retail stock to resell. \r\n\r\nTo help people receive goods they need, a ban of sale above RRP on certain goods will allow that stock to be sold at a fair price and stop people from buying further stock to profiteer with price gouging. \r\n\r\nFor example, Calpol for babies is unfairly being sold at \u00a310+ a bottle on eBay. Normally sold at \u00a33.50",
        "background": "Ban the sale of goods such as medicines, household essentials, sanitising, food, etc. on all online marketplaces, and other markets as necessary, above the Recommended Retail Price (RRP) to restrict profiteering whilst COVID19 is present in the UK.",
