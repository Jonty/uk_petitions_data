        "additional_details": "For people who live on their own in their own home, this isolation means that even going out for daily exercise, they feel lonely. Many do not like to break the rules but these rules are affecting their mental health because they feel like they cannot spend time with others. At least one man has already committed suicide due to the current lockdown rules. Many others will become a burden on the NHS because of a mental illness that has developed as a result of these rules.",
