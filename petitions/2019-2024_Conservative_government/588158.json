In many parts of the country an \u2018average\u2019 house price is more than ten times that of an \u2018average\u2019 salary.\r\n\r\nWages have risen by 43% in the last forty years, yet house prices have risen by an incredible 1010%.\r\n\r\nWe need a new solution which serves the man on the street and not just the elite.\r\n\r\nBringing the global tiny home movement to the UK with a transparent rent-to-own model  would make home ownership accessible to everyone.",
