The max. sentence for drug dealing is 14 years, whereas assault is only 1 year. Some dealers admit to assaulting police to conceal evidence as the sentence is significant lower than dealing. Make criminals think twice before they assault workers.",
        "background": "At present, the maximum sentence for assaulting an emergency worker is 1 (one) year custodial. This is no deterent to criminals. I'd like to see a minimum of a 5 (five) year custodial sentence introduced to deter criminals from assaulting the people that protect the public and save lives daily.",
