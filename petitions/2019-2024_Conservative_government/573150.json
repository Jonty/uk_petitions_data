        "additional_details": "The House of Lords is inheriantly undemocratic as they are not elected nor chosen by an elected official yet they are paid to do a significant role in our Government. They are old, outdated, undemocratic and a financial drain on the goverment and I am of the belief that they should no longer have our place in our government. I understand thier massive historical and cultural importance and as such I am not advocating thier abolishment, they could take on a community role for example.",
        "background": "I ask that the House of Commons discuss the House of Lords and more specifically wether thier position in our government is still relevant and needed in our governemnt. They are undemocratic and a drain on our goverments finances and it shouldn't be alowed to continue.",
