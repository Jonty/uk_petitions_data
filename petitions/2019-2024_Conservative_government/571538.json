        "additional_details": "It is the governments role to keep us active, outdoor gyms will not do us justice as they don\u2019t have the good equipment. Suicide rates are increasing and to be honest the rate of people who will be unhealthy will be high. To prevent this, open gyms. Everyone wants gyms open. The gym can also be a getaway place for some people where they can work on themselves and actually do something during lockdown. Also, things such as increased workload gives us students even more stress and we need a gym.",
        "background": "Gyms are key for a healthy mindset, the gym allows for a stress/angry/depressed free place whereby everyone can forget about what\u2019s happening, be it lockdown and other things. Through the gym people can improve their moods and they\u2019re mental health.",
