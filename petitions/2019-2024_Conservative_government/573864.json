        "additional_details": "The hospitality sector, in particular nightclubs, are very close to going under, after very little amounts of assistance from the government during the social distancing measures. The government should assist nightclubs by reducing ticket and drinks prices, for example by removing VAT or helping to make them half price as with the eat out to help out programme.",
        "background": "Once social distancing measures are removed, the nightclub industry is in desperate need of a large number of customers. A \u2018night out to help out\u2019 initiative should be implemented, similar to eat out to help out, to help the sector to recover. The government could rebate clubs for drinks and tickets",
