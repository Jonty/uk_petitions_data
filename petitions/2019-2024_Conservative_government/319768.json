        "action": "Scrap HS2 and use the money to fund the NHS and elderly care",
        "additional_details": "By not building Phase 2 of HS2 and using the money for NHS and elderly care would ensure these causes would be adequately funded, the countryside and wildlife would be protected by not destroying woodlands and people would not be forced from their homes to make way for HS2, air quality would be improved and pollution lessened.  The abuse of nature would be less and people would be living in a better environment.  The rail network we have needs improving and this could be done at much less cost.",
        "background": "Use the money destined for HS2 to fund the NHS and elderly care.  This money would be better used for these causes which have been underfunded for years. Elderly care is disjointed and unfair on people who have saved their money.  Scrap Phase 2 of HS2 altogether and improve the rail network we have.",
