        "additional_details": "There is a significant increase of the amount of vunerable family's loosing their children to forced adoption, Aswell as the section 47 Children's Act 1989. \r\n\r\nOften family's are penalised by social worker's who have a high case load and are unable to provide the necessary intervention & support for the family to stay together.\r\n\r\nIn a criminal court the person who is on trial is only punished for a crime once the evidence proves that they are guilty so why is it any different in family court?!",
        "background": "I want both the Government & Parliament to put a stop to forced adoption, I also want the section 47 of the children act 1989 which enables a child to be removed if it is  suspected that a child is likely to suffer Significant Harm.",
