        "additional_details": "I feel it would be entirely in keeping with the mood of the nation to award such a medal. The NHS are doing a sterling job on a low wage and would benefit from a morale boost. My partner is a Nursing Associate at Milton Keynes University Hospital so I know full well how hard she is working. I understand it would be difficult to award a pay rise, with 1.2 million employees so a medal would mean a lot to them.",
        "background": "I would like the government to acknowledge the dangerous and hard work currently being undertaken by forward facing NHS staff by awarding a special medal of dedication in the fight against the Corona Virus 2020.",
