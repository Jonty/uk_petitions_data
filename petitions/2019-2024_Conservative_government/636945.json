        "action": "Abolish administration fees on insurance when changes are made online",
        "additional_details": "Administration fees are no longer necessary when account information can be changed online by the policy holder. For example changing address on car insurance can now in most cases be changed via the web by the policy holder, meaning insurance companies are charging upwards of \u00a320 for administration fees where they have not been required to do anything. It makes changing address or personal details costly which is normally during costly life events such as moving home when finances are strained.",
        "background": "The UK government should force insurance providers to abolish administrative fees when changes to a policy are made online by the policy holder as no input is required from the insurance provider to make the change.",
