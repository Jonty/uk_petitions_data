        "additional_details": "Kids are being sent home if there\u2019s a confirmed case within their year, and are made to isolate for at least 2 weeks. Online learning is made an option HOWEVER, if you\u2019re a working parent - this is almost impossible.\r\n\r\nOur kids future & education should not be put at risk purely because of these rules - I believe that children should be giving the option to sit and extra year at school to put them in the best position possible to achieve what they deserve to as they get older.",
        "background": "Our children\u2019s education is being destroyed due to the rules around isolating linked to Covid. They\u2019ve missed half of their last school year & having returned to school in September, most schools have had to close classes again, some more than once. \r\n\r\nThe rules in general need reviewing.",
