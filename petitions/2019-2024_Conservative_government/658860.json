        "additional_details": "The Koh-i-Noor diamond holds immense cultural and historical significance for India, having been mined from the region centuries ago. Its return to the Indian government would symbolise rectification of colonial appropriation and honour the rightful heritage of the Indian people, specifically the Hindu faith. Also, repatriating the diamond would serve as a gesture of goodwill, fostering diplomatic relations and acknowledging the importance of cultural artefacts in preserving national identity.",
        "background": "The British Government must return the Koh-i-Noor diamond to India, recognising its cultural significance and colonial injustices. It has become so contentious the royal family no longer use it for official occasion.",
