Why should this only be taught in schools?\r\nWe have just taken our 6 year old daughter to Spain who has spoken Spanish to the locals and also French to tourists which she is learning is school now and she has been able to apply that learning in a foreign environment. So why punish parents who are able to take their children away.\r\nHoliday are far more expensive in the holidays so this is the reason parents choose to take their children out of school.",

A child learns when they are happy and content. Why is this seen as a disadvantage, when it is cultural and already has good attendance",
