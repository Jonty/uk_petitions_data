        "action": "Provide free menstrual products across the UK",
        "additional_details": "Since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, period poverty has increased sharply, putting pressure upon charities aiming to combat this issue to donate products.\r\n\r\nMenstrual products are not a luxury, and it is unfair to see women suffering in an endless cycle which they do not have control of. Many resort to using inappropriate and potentially harmful alternatives, such as socks or newspapers, or to using pads or tampons for far too long, with serious health consequences; or use nothing at all.",
        "background": "Scotland has become the first nation in the UK and in the global world to provide free and universal access to menstrual products through the passage of the Period Products (Free Provision) (Scotland) Act. We wish for Parliament to pass a bill allowing for this expansion across the rest of the UK.",
