        "additional_details": "Keeping schools open is key for young people\u2019s education and mental well-being. Future generations could be seriously impacted by gaps in their education but staff still need to be safeguarded as well, as they each have their own families, health issues and fears. Anxiety is  spiralling among staff and some guidance is not viable e. g. there isn\u2019t space in all classrooms in schools for staff to stay 2 metres away from pupils yet is expected to be in a room with 30 pupils for an hour at a time.",
        "background": "All teachers should have access to weekly testing whether they have symptoms or not to monitor and cull the spread of the disease in schools and colleges. Older children can spread the disease just as easily as adults but may not show symptoms whilst still be spreading the virus.",
