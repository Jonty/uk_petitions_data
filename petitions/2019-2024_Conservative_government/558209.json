        "additional_details": "I believe driving tests and lessons should remain open during this lockdown because it\u2019s an educational setting which is seen to be very essential to certain people. What about everyone going to college, work, helping the vulnerable shop etc? I think it\u2019s a disgrace that schools can remain open and I can see 100s of people a day but I cannot take a test or lesson with a driving instructor (even though masks are worn and windows are constantly open). People who have had their tests booked for months are now forced to wait even longer due to the new restrictions, I believe if work places and schools are staying open, driving tests should remain open too!",
        "background": "Driving tests should remain open and instructors should still be able to teach during England\u2019s four week lockdown. This to me is seen as an educational setting and I see it as an essential to get to and from work and school etc. \r\nMany learners across the UK are missing out on tests and lesson time",
