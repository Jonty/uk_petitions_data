        "additional_details": "One of the very few good things to come out of the Covid-19 pandemic is witnessing the House of Commons act like a place of work rather than a frat house party.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour in the House prior to this was a constant source of national embarrassment. Now that we have proven that we can have our politicians behave like grown-ups with important jobs to do, let\u2019s keep it.\r\n\r\nNow is not the time for a return to jeering and laughter and hi-jinks. Enough is enough.",
