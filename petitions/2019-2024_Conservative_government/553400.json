        "additional_details": "The restrictive timescale means that many thousands of people will miss out. The surge in demand is causing huge pressures and delays for conveyancing firms, mortgage lenders and surveyors. It has been estimated that 100,000 people will be involved in a conveyancing transaction that fails to complete by 31st March 2021. \r\n\r\nExtending the holiday will spread the demand, supporting the housing market and the many businesses that rely on it - removal companies, home ware, white goods, trades etc.",
