        "additional_details": "It's legal to self medicate with alcohol and nicotine, to the detriment of one's health\u2014 some cannot drink without severe harm due to preexisting health conditions. Drunkenness has contributed towards breaches of lockdown, causing societal harm, overworking our police. Yet the public is trusted to use these equally harmful drugs in moderation. \r\n\r\nLegalise the personal use of cannabis within moderation\u2014 rethink reboot rebuild\u2014 create jobs in a legal cannabis trade; tax it to bolster the economy.",
        "background": "The Government has previously claimed cannabis cannot be legalised as \"There is clear scientific and medical evidence that cannabis is a harmful drug which can damage users' mental and physical health.\" The same can be said of alcohol.\r\n\r\nAlcohol brings money into our economy. Cannabis could too.",
