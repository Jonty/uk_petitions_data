        "additional_details": "High-street vouchers would help people to get back on their feet and provide a vital stimulus for local businesses. As the Resolution Foundation says, such vouchers 'would kickstart demand in the right parts of our economy, boost living standards and deliver targeted support to the businesses that need help the most'. We, the undersigned, ask the Government to implement a high-street voucher scheme that gives \u00a3500 to every adult and \u00a3250 to every child.",
