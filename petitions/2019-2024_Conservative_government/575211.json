        "action": "Provide vaccination for education staff before 8th March.",
        "additional_details": "In September, schools reopened and as a result, COVID-19 cases increased massively. This has led to schools having to close classes, year groups and more and lots of COVID cases stemming from schools.\r\n\r\nIt is concerning that government intend on repeating the same mistake despite a vaccine being available. By giving education staff the first dose, you provide the best chance of reopening schools successfully and safely and then everything else can reopen safely without another lockdown.",
        "background": "The UK government intend on reopening schools on 8th March, yet have provided no plans for education staff to be vaccinated before then. I want government to prioritise education staff for the vaccine in order to safely reopen schools.",
