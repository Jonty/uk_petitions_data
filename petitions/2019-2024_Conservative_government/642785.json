        "action": "Force energy companies to remove standing charges from prepay and smart meters.",
        "additional_details": "Standing charges are harsh on vulnerable groups, perpetuating inequality and social disparity. Energy poverty is prominent in the UK, and households often choose between heating their homes and meeting other essential needs. Standing charges compound this issue, further hindering access to basic energy necessities.  The present system's lack of proportional pricing contradicts fairness and transparency principles, as customers are charged arbitrarily regardless of their actual consumption.",
        "background": "The standing charges on gas and electricity prepayment meters exacerbates the financial challenges faced by many UK households grappling with rising living costs. Removing these charges would provide relief to vulnerable and low-income individuals, lessening their financial strain.",
