        "additional_details": "The Government has an obligation to protect it's people and has sworn an oath to that effect, the increasing pressure the country is facing due to the current situation will not be helped in any way by allowing the continued spread of the virus, keeping construction sites functioning at present will exacerbate an already perilous situation for employees and their families and due to cross country travelling to reach workplace the construction industry will further fuel the fires of this pandemic",
        "background": "Close all UK construction sites in line with national lockdown rules due to rapid transmission of mutated Covid-19 strain. Construction sites contain workers travelling from all over country to place of work which in turn will lead to further rise in cases and increase pressure on NHS",
