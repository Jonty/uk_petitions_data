        "additional_details": "Golfers play on their own or in two, three or four balls (this could be limited to three players) and they start playing 10 minutes apart from the next match. They play in a space of approximately 100-200 acres; they only really meet on the green. When anglers fish, they fish alone in designated spots over thirty feet apart; they generally have very little contact with other fishermen. Quite simply, there is no need for a golf club to be open for people to play and the same applies to fishing.",
        "background": "Allow people to play golf and to fish during Isolation because these two hobbies are easily enjoyed in wide open spaces while still complying with social distancing guidelines. And it would benefit people's mental and physical health, especially the retired those with certain medical issues.",
