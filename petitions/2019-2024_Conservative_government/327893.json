        "additional_details": "In a time when many people are facing uncertainty over jobs, the highest levels of poverty ever seen, and chronic NHS underfunding is taking place - it is unfair to the tax paying public of this country for the government to spend close to \u00a31million painting an aircraft.",
        "background": "It has been reported by various mainstream media outlets that the plane use to transport the prime minister and royal family is set to be re painted, at a cost of circa \u00a3900,000. This is simply unacceptable, and a massive waste of public money. These plans must be scrapped.",
