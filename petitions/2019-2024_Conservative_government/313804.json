        "additional_details": "The George Cross (GC) is the second highest award of the United Kingdom honours system. It is awarded for gallantry not \"in the presence of the enemy\" to both members of the British armed forces and to British civilians. It has always been able to be awarded posthumously. In my view this sums up perfectly the gallantry shown by the members of the NHS, especially those in the front line.\r\nThis was previously awarded to the people of Malta for similar gallantry in World War 2.",
