        "additional_details": "We would like for the MPs to take responsibility for poor actions and behaviour throughout this current crisis.\r\nAllocating this money to areas that are more in demand would reduce the future economic impact on local areas or the NHS. While at the same time bring MPs to the same 80% pay as the current furlough scheme.\r\nI feel that this is more than reasonable and would in no way be obstructive in an MPs life. In addition to helping to restore the currently negative image of parliament.",
        "background": "We ask that MPs take a pay cut of 20%, Which would bring them to a yearly salary not including their additional covered expenses of \u00a365,545. The cut to every MP of \u00a316,386 would then leave \u00a310,650,900 available to be distributed among other areas in the civil service sector or the local MPs areas.",
