The hospitality industry is a lifeline of hundreds of thousands of skilled and valuable workers who can help keep our country properly fed and healthy during these critical times. Forcing these people into unemployment will not only be an additional strain on the economy, but is denying vulnerable members of our society access to healthy, live saving food. Social distancing yes. Societal destruction, no.",
