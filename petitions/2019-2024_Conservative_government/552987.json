        "additional_details": "Seeking asylum is not a criminal offence, it is a legal right. Detaining people who have already experienced torture, violence and human trafficking is particularly cruel.\r\nProlonged and indefinite detention has driven people to breaking point, with alarming levels of trauma, depression and other mental health conditions.\r\nPlease do not allow any plans for offshore detention centres to proceed, and please reduce the use of immigration detention centres.",
        "background": "The government should commit to reducing the use of immigration detention centres, and never to use offshore detention centres (for example by using ferries or islands).",
