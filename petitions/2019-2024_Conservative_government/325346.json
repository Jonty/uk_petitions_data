        "additional_details": "They recent protests in the UK are clear breaches of lockdown laws and are unauthorised protests by their very nature and the police as the enforcers of law should not be permitting them to take place  let alone participating in or expressing sympathy with them.\r\n\r\nIt's clear the police have failed. Officers have showed sympathy or failed to enforce the law as it stands. \r\n\r\nDiscipline officers demonstrating sympathy with the protests and send in the army to restore order where the police fail.",
        "background": "The current protests inspired by Black Lives Matter have been violent and have caused damage to important national monuments.\r\n\r\nWe should therefore sack or discipline any police officer participating in or expressing sympathy with these protests.\r\n\r\nThe army should step in to restore order.",
