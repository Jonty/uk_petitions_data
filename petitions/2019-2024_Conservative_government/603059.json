        "action": "Recognise people vaccinated abroad as fully vaccinated in the NHS COVID-19 app.",
        "additional_details": "We should not be penalised for having to be vaccinated abroad due to various circumstances. Britons returning to the UK for short periods cannot see family or friends in fear that they will be forced to isolate for the entirety of their trip. The UK embassy in Seoul has urged South Korea to accept Korean nationals fully vaccinated overseas yet fails to do the same for their own citizens? It is discriminatory. This is unjustified to those of us who have followed advice to keep others safe.",
        "background": "We want the Government to recognise that people vaccinated with UK-approved vaccines abroad as fully vaccinated in relation to all restrictions and guidelines as if we were vaccinated in the UK. The Government promised over the summer that they would load vaccines given abroad into the NHS database.",
