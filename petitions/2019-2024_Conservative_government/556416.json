There\u2019s more people currently suffering with depression, anxiety and potential suicides, than there are people dying with Covid. The impact will be greater over the next 10 years on these people than the people who have had Covid.\r\nThere\u2019s no support currently for those suffering with new mental illnesses that have been impacted by the governments decisions where jobs have been lost and livelihoods ruined. People can\u2019t feed their kids! Re look at this",

People are losing their lives, losing their sanity at a higher rate than Covid is killing people. The impact on the next generation, and the follow on impact will be huge. Do something now!",
