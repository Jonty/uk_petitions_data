        "additional_details": "It is time to act together in the national interest,  put Brexit on hold and work with our neighbours  for the good of all. Cooperation in an international crisis will not undermine sovereignty. We need workers from Europe for our medical and food needs \u2013 we are flying in agricultural workers now. Even if coronavirus is curtailed by next year we will not have a working health and food infrastructure without our European alliance by then. Business and industry will also be worse outside Europe.",
        "background": "Just as the IMF has pleaded, this is not the time to risk the economic uncertainty of leaving Europe. Coronavirus demonstrates the need for international cooperation. Our failure to participate in the EU PPE bulk buy may cost lives. We mustn't jeopardise health and food work let alone industry.",
