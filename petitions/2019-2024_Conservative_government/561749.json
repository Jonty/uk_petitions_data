        "additional_details": "Every year I spend most of my time in the kitchen while the family is in another room. I am not the only one thousands of people spend the majority of Christmas Day in the kitchen. Boxing Day is cold meats and salad a relaxed day you can all spend together. Retail ruins this and a lot of people have been separated from family this year so just this year give people a chance to enjoy being with family",
        "background": "We only have 5 days to see family but when you work in retail that\u2019s just Christmas Day. Give retail a break on Boxing Day, the stock, sales and offers will still be there on the 27th. One day when you are not cooking a huge dinner when you can really be relaxed with your family is on Boxing Day.",
