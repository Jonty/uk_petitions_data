        "action": "Cancel the 2021 A level exams",
        "additional_details": "After having 6 months of no physical lessons there are now local lockdowns and school closures occuring across the country due to coronavirus outbreaks. Some students have had constant online lessons throughout while others were left to learn the content by themselves. So far the only changes might be a few weeks delay for exams. With all this disruption and uncertainty for A level students the 2021 exams should be cancelled to avoid having disproportionate exam results like in the 2020 exams.",
        "background": "Cancel the 2021 A level exams so that there is enough time to assess students in class with assessments. This would avoid disruption and uncertainty and would allow a fair center assessed grade to be given to students, whilst allowing universities to better evaluate students.",
