It\u2019s sad that university students are now being told they need to stay at university during the winter lockdown.\r\n\r\nStudents sometimes feel alone, unsafe, at risk, and there isn\u2019t always the level of support they need to get through what we all know is a tough time.\r\n\r\nWhatever the reason, students are likely to be more at risk of COVID-19 and mental health challenges by remaining on campus.",
