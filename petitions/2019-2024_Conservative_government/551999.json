I don\u2019t believe this is for our \u2018safety\u2019 I think it\u2019s a way of trying to scare people into a new way of living...the way you want them to live. Worse things have happened before, this has to stop and we all want these new rules, laws and regulations to stop. Why do we want you to change this is one of the questions asked..because it\u2019s our right!",

You cannot possibly say a curfew will help stop the spread of a \u2018virus\u2019 so does this \u2018virus\u2019 not spread after 10pm? Does the \u2018virus\u2019 only spread if your around more than 6 people? This is not for our protection!",
