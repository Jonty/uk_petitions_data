        "action": "Prioritise vaccination of frontline workers potentially exposed to Covid-19.",
        "additional_details": "Common sense dictates that vaccination of those potentially exposed to the highest viral load will reduce the chance of super spreaders and will protect the most vulnerable. Our children's education has already suffered a year of disruption; elderly are at risk as care home staff come into work; frontline workers are expected to keep our country functioning with no protection offered. We are now approaching a stage when vaccination of key workers is not only possible but our responsibility.",
        "background": "Ensure that maximum protection to the greatest number of people is achieved by priority vaccination of frontline workers potentially exposed to high viral load,  including but not limited to, NHS staff, teachers and school support workers, care home staff, social workers and police.",
