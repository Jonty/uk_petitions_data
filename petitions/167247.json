Instead of receiving a new mattress I got the old one from the previous tenant, plus some new friends - fleas! \r\nThis year, I moved into a property and discovered the old mattress was infested with bed bugs! Thanks previous tenant! \r\nWhilst it may be expensive to replace mattresses, no tenant should have to live through bug infestations.",

Thanks to not being provided a new mattress when I moved in to a property, I have had both fleas and bedbugs. I am asking that the government require new mattresses for new tenants.",
