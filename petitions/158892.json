        "additional_details": "By facilitating EU nationals to acquire British citizenship, UK Government has the opportunity to counteract the inability of EU nationals living and working in the UK to vote at the latest Referendum. Additionally, UK Government, by allowing free citizenship applications from EU nationals, will also send a strong message to those who wants to divide our society that UK is a truly tolerant country which values those who contribute to its prosperity.",
        "background": "Future Brexit negotiations, might restrict the rights of EU nationals to continue living and working in the UK. By allowing free citizenship applications UK Government can put this right, avoiding discrimination against those with low income. Applications should be accepted until 23 June 2022.",
