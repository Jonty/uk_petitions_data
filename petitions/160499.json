        "additional_details": "A convicted offender has just been moved into the street I live in with my children and other children.  This offender had 13 offences and over 10,000 media files that were catagory A, B, C.  He received a 8 month suspended sentence, a probation order and a sexual prevention order.  He was then allowed to move into our community that is full of children.  This needs to stop . Our children have a right to privacy and protection and allowing them to live near our children takes these rights away .",
        "background": "We need to stop child sex offenders from living in the same community as children and suspended sentences need to be stopped for every child sex offender whether it is physical, mental , grooming and download of media . Better laws are needed to give these offenders a custodial sentence. ",
