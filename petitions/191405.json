        "action": "Stop the spraying of our skies with chem trails from planes",
        "additional_details": "Our skies were once blue, but no longer. Proof that it's happening is visible & obvious. You only have to look up. Condensation trials which we all know disappear after a few short seconds. But these trails now spread out across the skies and form wide linear bands of ever widening haze which turn the skies milky white. A full enquiry is required into what's being sprayed and why. It's odd that mainstream news or politicians never ever discuss the issue. These chemicals harm us and our planet.",
        "background": "UK skies & globally are under attack from chem trails sprayed by planes. Aluminium barium man made fibres & smart dust are sprayed daily. Our childrens health is under attack. Our planet is fragile and the elite only desire profit and are playing God which they are unqualified to do & this must end.",
