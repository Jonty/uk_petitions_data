        "action": "Call a referendum so London can decide to be part of the UK or remain in the EU.",
        "additional_details": "London and its population has stronger ties to Europe than it does to England.  e.g. our dependence on financial services.\r\n\r\nLondon voted by a similar margin in favour of Remain as Scotland.  By the same right that Scotland has to now decide its future, so does London. \r\n\r\nOur population is significantly more European and culturally diverse than the rest of the UK.\r\n\r\nLondon gives more to the UK in tax revenue than the UK gives to London.  We would be stronger if financially independent.",
        "background": "London, as defined by all postal codes with a LONDON prefix, voted by overwhelming majority in the recent European referendum to remain part of the EU.  \r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, believe that London should be allowed to decide its own future as separate from the rest of the UK.",
