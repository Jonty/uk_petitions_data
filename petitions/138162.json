        "action": "Trigger a 2nd EU referendum that does not exclude 16-17 year old from voting.",
        "additional_details": "Having allowed 16-17 to vote on the Scottish independence referendum, provides evidence that HM government believes people in that age group are capable of making decisions about the future direction of the country. Thus having deliberately excluded them from the EU referendum amounts to unjustifiable age discrimination, which, as well as being unworthy of a modern democratic country, also casts serious doubts on the referendum validity as a democratic process.",
        "background": "Unlike for the Scottish independence referendum, 16-17 year old citizens, the people who will have to live longer with the consequences, have not been consulted. For the above reason we believe a 2nd referendum should be called on the basis that the democratic process of the 1st was flawed.",
