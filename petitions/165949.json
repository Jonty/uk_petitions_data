        "additional_details": "A vet can offer a service but then change their mind at a later date, for example offering to put a animal to sleep for free as they animal had surgery on their advice which made the situation worse and the animal to suffer more, and then charge the owner at a later date. \r\nVets also prey on owners whose animal is sick and put profit ahead of the animals well being, and the RCVS can do little to help.\r\nThey are not answerable to anything and this needs to change.\r\n",
        "background": "Vets are not regulated by any real governing body at present, and can charge as much as they like, and go back on their word. \r\nThey can give the wrong advise to a owner which can be costly and put a animal through unnecessary treatments.\r\nIt needs to be regulated like all other services.",
