        "additional_details": "I wanted to ensure that if the previously mentioned petition garners enough signatures to be discussed in Parliament, that there is also a petition which directly contradicts it, that can be discussed simultaneously. \r\n\r\nIf you believe women should have the right to choice; to choose if they carry a child, and this choice should be given freely & safely by trained medical professionals, with aftercare and access to additional support with no charge, please sign this petition!",
        "background": "There is a petition stating that the NHS should not pay for abortions, and I was shocked and appalled by this stance. \r\n\r\nBeing pro-choice is the understanding that each person deserves full body autonomy and no religious, governmental, or personal opinion should impact that freedom for individuals.",
