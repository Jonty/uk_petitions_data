        "additional_details": "We don't want my daughter ingesting methane and being exposed to chemicals. We want her to have the best start in life. She is at her most vulnerable stage and for me to be able to protect her we need to stop Igas who want to destroy the land which my family and others make a living from by growing food. Polluting this greenfield land will be catastrophic on a local level and national level. This soil grows carrots, barley, wheat, peas and potatoes on it. We believe clean healthy food is important.",
        "background": "I am a mother to my 3 year old daughter, a farmer\u2019s daughter and a resident of Bassetlaw. We never want to see any land used for high pressure hydraulic fracking in this area. This company is happy to gain much from this while we all stand to gain nothing. \r\n",
