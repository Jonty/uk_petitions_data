        "action": "Revoke the invite to a State Visit for the new US President Donald Trump.",
        "additional_details": "Donald Trump's policies are an affront to long held British values of freedom, equality and justice for all.  He has denigrated the human rights of women, whilst boasting about sexual assaulting them. He has banned people from entering the US simply because of their religion.  He has silenced scientific bodies, restricted press freedoms to report on the environment and supports torture. These policies represent an alarming shift to fascistic policies that we should not appease.  ",
        "background": "The US President's attitudes and behaviours are not those befitting of a world leader to whom the esteemed honour of a State Visit are worthy.  His attitudes and behaviours are deeply alarming to British people and a state visit would be seen as an endorsement both in the UK and around the world. ",
