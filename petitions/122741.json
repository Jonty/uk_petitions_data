The government has now ignored that advice not accepting infertility as a major problem! Infertility is a terrible thing to suffer from and the government should step in immediately! Nice recommendations should not be ignored I ask you to attend this assisted conception unit so you can see first hand the devastation of the women who fail and have no other cycles left! We should all be equal as UK citizens!",
