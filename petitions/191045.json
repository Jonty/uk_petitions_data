        "action": "Allow parents the right to remove children from sex and relationship education.",
        "additional_details": "Education can shape a generation. Currently there is pressure on schools from lobby groups and some MPs to promote homosexuality and impose inappropriate sex education on younger children. There are also attempts to remove the freedom that parents currently have to withdraw their children from sex education. We believe that ultimate responsibility for educating children lies with the parents, not the State. ",
        "background": "The Government will table an amendment to the Children and Social Work Bill that will make sex and relationship education (SRE) part of the national curriculum in schools compulsory for children as young as 4. Its proposed parents will not be allowed the right to withdraw their children.",
