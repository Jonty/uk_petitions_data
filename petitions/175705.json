        "additional_details": "It is completely unfair that we have to pay to use a service which has made us so unhappy - the company has a complete monopoly over the network (Southern, Gatwick express and Thameslink are all owned by Govia). All throughout the year there were multiple days with reduced service, short formation of trains and cancellations meaning that commuters are late or start the day feeling sweaty and unhappy. The cherry at the end of the year was the strike action with Southern simply saying we advise you not to travel. What about our jobs?! ",
        "background": "This year was by far the worst service provided by the rail service. Thousands of commuters have felt completely helpless and degraded every morning and evening having to pack in to a train designed for half the amount of people. ",
