        "additional_details": "Sadly these innovative new personal vehicles, that are small enough to pack away, are being grouped into similar categories as cars. \r\n\r\nWith even more emphasis on green living alternatives to normal travel are being taken away. Unlike cycles these can't even be used in bike lanes.\r\n\r\n\"PEV's are mechanically propelled they require registration and a tax disc. There is no process for obtaining a licence, tax or insurance for hoverboards\" - Wired.co.uk\r\n",
