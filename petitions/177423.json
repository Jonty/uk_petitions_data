The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has worked alongside local and national campaigners in partnership with business and local councils, to promote provision of these facilities, which have increased in number from 140 in 2007 to 918 now, but we recognise we need to do more.\r\n\r\nCurrent guidance in Part M (Access to and use of buildings) of the Building Regulations refers directly to \u201cChanging Places\u201d and the British Standard BS8300 (Design of buildings and their approaches to meet the needs of disabled people). Both advise that these facilities should be considered in large buildings and complexes, but it is not stated as a requirement. The British Standard recommends how to create an enlarged \u201cChanging Places\u201d cubicle in a separate-sex toilet washroom with additional functionality.\r\n\r\nThe Government has commissioned research to evaluate how well the current guidance in Approved Document M is working in meeting the needs of disabled people, including consideration of toilet provision. Once we have the results of this research we will decide if changes are needed to the current requirements of the Building Regulations.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Communities and Local Government",
