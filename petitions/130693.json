        "additional_details": "Our view is that attempts to regulate this form of fundraising activity seem ineffective and as such our petition is for an outright ban to make the position clearer on what is and is not allowed.",
        "background": "This method of fundraising can be intrusive and where high pressure tactics are used by the fundraisers (who may in cases be remunerated based on the level of donation commitments they secure), can potentially put elderly or vulnerable persons in a position where they are taken advantage of.",
