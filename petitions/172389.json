        "action": "Exempt all properties with a broadband speed <10 Mbps from Council Tax",
        "additional_details": "Various government initiatives have failed to provide the necessary service to all, indeed they have been specifically excluded from the programmes.  The option to move is not available with low speeds, and this disadvantage should be recompensed through exemption from Council Tax.  The USO is still some years away, by which time further improvements in speed will be required,  Therefore, the 10Mbps rate should double every 2 years in line with Nielsen's Law of Internet Bandwidth.",
        "background": "Broadband is an essential service, but due to local and central government decisions, many millions of people do not have sufficient access.  A lack of good broadband makes property unsaleable, i.e. essentially worthless, and so should not be subject to Council Tax.  ",
