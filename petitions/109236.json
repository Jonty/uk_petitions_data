        "action": "Make all establishments selling halal meat advertise the fact in English.",
        "additional_details": "Many restaurants are reluctant to advertise this fact and are even reluctant to confirm they serve halal meat when asked because they do not want to lose a sale. In many places it may be obvious while many others it is not. For example Pizza parlors and Indian restaurants may be assumed to have no links to Muslim halal meat because of of their perceived Italian & Hindu origins but they are in fact selling halal meat. This action is urgently needed to allow people to make a more informed choice.",
        "background": "Make all establishments selling halal food advertise the fact prominently. This must be done with clearly displayed signs in English & another locally prominent language e.g. Polish. This includes their websites and any printed advertising. These establishment must have  transparent sales policies.",
