        "additional_details": "Drag hunting is not an option as foxes have been known to run into the path of the hounds. We are living in the modern age where 83% of the population are against fox hunting. Changes have to be made and if the hunters still want the thrill of the chase Clean Boot Hunting is the ideal way to replace the \"sport\" of hunting with hounds. This petition is asking for the end of hunting with hounds and to replace it with Clean Boot Hunting. This is the only way the foxes can be safe.",
        "background": "Clean Boot Hunting where bloodhounds pursue a running man rather than a terrified fox is the only humane option & should replace all forms of hunting with hounds. The current ban has been treat with total disregard as hunters are \"accidentally\" killing foxes as if the ban does not exist. ",
