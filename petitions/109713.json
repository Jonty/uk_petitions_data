        "action": "Stop GPs being paid NHS funds as cash incentives to limit patient referrals.",
        "additional_details": "This amounts to the diverting of NHS funds into the pockets of already well paid GPs, is a direct conflict of interest for them, and a huge waste of taxpayers money intended to fund treatment. If cash is available why limit referrals anyway ?  Allowing this to continue will inevitably lead to patients dying needlessly through lack of appropriate diagnostic testing and treatment, which will then lead to litigation, costing the taxpayer even more. This milking of the system needs to be stopped.",
        "background": "Media reports that thousands of pounds are being paid to GPs as cash incentives from NHS budgets, in return for limiting the number of patients they refer to hospital for further testing, scans and consultant appointments. One surgery is reported as profiting by over \u00a3500,000 from the practice.",
