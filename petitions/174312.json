        "action": "Reverse the Government's decision to 'ban' Lettings Agency applicant/tenant fees",
        "additional_details": "The announced plans to 'ban' (outright) the ability for Lettings Agencies to charge fees to applicants/tenants is based on a fundamental misunderstanding by the government as to how Lettings Agencies/Landlords are required to operate. The Government implies that tenants do not have a choice as to which property they wish to rent or which agency they wish to use, which displays an inherent lack of understanding as to how the property industry functions and what is required of it. \r\n",
        "background": "The decision by the Government to 'ban' applicant/tenant fees is poorly conceived and of little benefit to tenants or the economy of the UK. In addition, this 'ban' goes against the very grain/ideology of a 'free market' economy. \r\n",
