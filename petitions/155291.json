The options are to reject the referendum or to have a second referendum now that the truth is becoming clearer after the event. ",
        "background": "Politicians defined the need for a referendum to leave the EU. They have defined the rules and have failed to guide the public; in fact they have misled/not informed the public. Many people as a result have regretted their decision. As such, the result does not reflect the true will of the people. ",
