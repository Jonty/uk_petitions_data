If just over 600,000 voters had gone the other way, 2%, the decision would be a nullity. \r\n\r\nIt has been widely claimed by voters that many voted Leave as a protest, assuming it would make no difference to the result. \r\n\r\nA large majority of those most affected - young people - wanted to Remain.

If 2% had voted the other way, the result would have been different. \r\n\r\nThis means the country is divided almost 50/50 on an issue which fundamentally changes our future.  ",
