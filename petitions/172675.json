        "additional_details": "The RSPCA has a 92% conviction rate for cases that they take to the courts, this is more than the CPS.\r\n\r\nThe Environment Food and Rural Affairs Committee want prosecutions given to the CPS instead.\r\n\r\nThe RSPCA should have more rights to take animals rather than having to wait 24 hours, or calling the Police as animals could be going through torment whilst waiting for the RSPCA to return.\r\n\r\nFor emergencies that the Police call them too, they should be given some form of emergency lighting as it can take them hours to arrive.",
        "background": "The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee wants the Government to take away private prosecution rights for the RSPCA. Instead of taking away powers, we should be delivering the RSPCA more rights to be able to seize without Police needing to be present.",
