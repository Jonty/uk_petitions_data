        "action": "Parliament to reject EU referendum advisory as voters were wilfully misinformed",
        "additional_details": "The EU referendum result is advisory not mandatory and Parliament is not legally bound to follow it. Though rejecting the \u2018will of the people\u2019 is normally politically unacceptable, the circumstances are extreme and the democratic process was flawed.\r\n\r\nAs campaign claims were dis-owned within hours, many Leave voters became angry about the intentionally misleading claims that led them to their decision. The basis for their vote is under question, Parliament cannot therefore act upon the outcome. ",
        "background": "The EU referendum result is flawed as various campaigners made claims and statements of fact that they knew to be incorrect. They have since admitted they cannot deliver on many of these claims. These claims had a material effect on how people voted and therefore the overall outcome is not valid.",
