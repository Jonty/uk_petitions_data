        "additional_details": "Men who sleep with men (MSM) are being stigmatised by this rule as being dangerous.\r\n\r\nAll blood samples used for donation are subject to rigorous testing to ensure that various illnesses, including HIV/AIDs, cannot be transferred to a recipient of blood. \r\n\r\nThis also draws away from the fact that a promiscuous heterosexual male who has multiple partners is in fact a higher risk of infection than a monogamous homosexual male.\r\n\r\nThis unjust ban must be lifted if we truly live in a modern society!",
        "background": "In the UK, men who engage in sexual acts with other men are banned from donating blood, unless they do not engage in these acts for a full 12 months prior to donation.",
