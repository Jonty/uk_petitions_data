        "additional_details": "LGV means Larger Goods Vehicle so why does a motorhome over the weight of 7,500kg suddenly become a goods vehicle? A motorhome is not designed to carry goods and is not a commercial vehicle. It should be classified either as Cat C1 or a new category should be introduced to allow it to be driven without the need to take a goods vehicle test.",
        "background": "At the moment people with C1 on their driving license can drive a motorhome up to 7,500kg MAM. There are many coach conversions and american style RV's that go over this weight which then fall into the C category and require taking a LGV test. This should be changed as the motorhome is not a LGV.",
