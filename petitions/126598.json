        "additional_details": "A horrifying story, which should have been long relegated to the annals of history, sadly still the reality for a woman living in Northern Ireland in 2016\r\nconvicted under ancient laws passed under Queen Victoria & sat untouched on Northern Ireland\u2019s statute books for over 150 years. Regardless of Northern Ireland\u2019s contested constitutional status, when it comes to human rights law we are just as much British citizens as women living in Blackpool or Birmingham. Westminster could easily overturn the abortion ban by passing legislation in the House of Commons. There is a particularly clear case for doing this as a High Court found in November that Northern Ireland\u2019s abortion ban breaches international human rights law. \r\n\r\nArticle by Siobhan Fenton The Independant",
