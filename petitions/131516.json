        "additional_details": "Customers are paying the price for banks giving poor financial advice in the past by seeing the closure of smaller branches especially in rural areas.\r\n\r\nThese proposed closures effect a wide range of people from local businesses to those who are not internet savvy. \r\n\r\nThese changes mean that people will no longer have face to face contact with real people. Should they want this contact they will have to travel some considerable distances to a larger branch to deposit cash or pay in cheques.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "It is time for a debate in parliament on the issue of closing small bank branches especially in rural areas. In England the HSBC is cutting rural branches and in Scotland it is the Royal Bank and the Clydesdale Bank. This must be stopped now..",
