        "additional_details": "Although the attraction of having a simple question is obvious it is irresponsible to offer the option to disengage from the EU without setting out a plan for what would be put in its place.  It is governments that enter into treaties on behalf of citizens and it is there incumbent upon government to clearly set out the implications of the options in any referendum held.  The government should be given 18 months to set out a clear plan with a second referendum being held in 2018.",
        "background": "The EU Referendum just held provided a clear indication of national sentiment. However, the simplistic approach taken meant that there was no timetable or policy framework set out to explain exactly what would happen in the event of a vote to leave.  ",
