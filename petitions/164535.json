        "additional_details": "The right to live and enjoy life was taken from James at 25 by the callous actions of Majid Malik and Kiaz Mahmood as they raced their cars at 90mph in a 40mph zone. Since that day the judicial system has continually provided opportunities for these serial criminals to exercise their rights, protecting them from facing the consequences of their actions. We have had no such rights, James' rights are ignored in favour of the criminals. Time for a change, it's the rights of victims that matter.",
        "background": "Since our son James was killed in a hit and run, little if any consideration has been given to his rights or that of his family. Conversely, the rights of those responsible for James' death have been a constant course of consideration, allowing them to exercise those rights on more than 12 occasions",
