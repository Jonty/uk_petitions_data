        "action": "Make a legal requirement for realistic road crash simulations of child car seats",
        "additional_details": "Currently UN UCE R129 standards require seats to perform well in the following, totally unrealistic, crash simulations: \r\nFront impact: 31 mph\r\nRear impact: 18.6 mph\r\nSide impact: 14.9 mph\r\nThese of course are not representative of many car accidents. If you hit another car head on, both driving at 20mph (a lower speed limit than in most residential areas), there will be a 40mph impact, which isn't covered by the existing required testing, putting children's lives at risk.",
        "background": "Having done countless hours of research on car seats, I purchased a Nuna Rebl for my son based on positive reviews. However, it has now been listed as a dangerous car seat, yet meets the UN ECE R129 standards. Worryingly, these standards are extremely poor, and not representative of actual crashes.",
