The onus should not be on the individual to contact the Crisis Team on their own. There should also always be a one to one therapy option, rather than group therapy.\r\n\r\nMany people will know I haven't had an easy time with life or with mental illness; I suffer with depression anxiety PTSD and OCD. Recently, I've hit rock bottom and have screamed for help but have been let down by mental health services who I thought would help, instead they have let me down majorly.",
