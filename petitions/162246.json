        "additional_details": "In addition, Parliament is requested to consider the impact on a non-expert electorate of all misinformation provided by both sides during campaigning, but to take into account the advice the referendum has provided to Parliament. Parliament is also asked to obtain and consider expert legal, financial, political and constitutional opinion and to consider potential implications concerning Scotland, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar and the possibility of Brexit triggering the dismantling of the U.K.",
        "background": "To reach their decision Parliament is asked to establish what is in the best interest of the United Kingdom, considering that prior to the referendum 73% of MPs favoured remaining within the E.U. and that the 51.9% of votes cast in favour of leaving the E.U. represented only 34.7% of the electorate.",
