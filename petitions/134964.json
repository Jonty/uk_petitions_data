        "additional_details": "We also feel that 16-17 year old's are active members of the British society and contribute to the UK economy and so have the right to vote on key issues that will effect their current or future lives like general and by-elections and referendums. With convicted criminals of the most violent and heinous crimes being able to vote we find it laughable that they can decide the future of the UK but 16-17 year old's cannot.",
        "background": "In the light of the recent EU referendum we feel that 16-17 year old's were unable to voice their opinions effectively and feel unfairly treated as we are the people who will have to live in a non EU society when we had no say on the matter at all as we were unable to vote in this referendum.",
