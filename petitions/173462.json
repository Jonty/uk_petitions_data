        "action": "Repeal the snoopers charter. Don't allow the government to take away our privacy",
        "additional_details": "On Wednesday the 16th of November, a law was passed allowing the government to access your internet search history, messages and records of ANYTHING you do online. The law also gives the intelligence agencies the power to hack into computers and devices of citizens. The bill was opposed by representatives of the United Nations, all major UK and many leading global privacy and rights groups. And that\u2019s not even counting the three-quarters of people who think privacy is a human right.",
        "background": "If you believe in your right to privacy, you should sign this petition. This law gives the government powers alike to putting cameras in your house, because it certainly allows them to hack into your devices. And after that cameras aren't far off. Support this petition and help keep us free!",
