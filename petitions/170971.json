I dislike litter and the mess it makes,but when you see ladies as I have twice, being interrogated in the street,by someone in a paramilitary uniform,stab vests etc,it smacks too much of Big Brother.I get the need for stab vests.The officers I have seen have acted professionaly,but the process is cringing to watch.I object to my council tax being used this way.",
        "background": "I feel that the practice of fining people \u00a370/\u00a380 who drop litter,mainly cigarette ends is disproportionate to the \"crime\" commited.\r\nThere is no mitigating the fine,unlike a criminal offence.",
