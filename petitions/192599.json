        "additional_details": "Many nurses are relying on payday loans, pawning possesions and remortgaging their homes to scrape by. Many nurses are forced turn to food banks just to eat.\r\nThe trust bank system is not fit for those that work in specialised areas. It is also difficult for others as each trust requires you to complete their own training, and take a long time to get approved. If forced to choose a lot of staff will choose agency work over NHS, this will cause further staff shortages to an already short NHS.",

Those that remain often have no choice but to top up their wages with extra shifts.\r\n",
