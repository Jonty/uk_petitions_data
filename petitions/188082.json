        "additional_details": "All that the fans are asking is that the games set to be televised are either decided before the season start or at very least, some common sense is used.\r\n\r\nFor example Moving a Newcastle United vs Brighton Hove Albion match from Saturday 3pm to Friday night 8pm with barely a fortnight notice causes a 700mile round trip to be made during increased traffic on the roads and also means there is no public transport home.\r\n\r\nAs fans, we're not asking for much, just to be met half way!!",
        "background": "Regularly throughout the football season SkySports air live football fixtures that aren't planned.\r\nThe kickoff time and even the day can be moved to suit the TV companies and the Football Association with complete disregard for the fans.\r\nTravel plans, hotels and even family schedules are effected.",
