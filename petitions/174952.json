        "additional_details": "I would as that we stop the practice of refusing to accept tenants with housing benefit and ask that we put caps on how much rent can be charged. \u00a31400 pm for a house is impossibly high! This requires you to be earning \u00a334,000 and pay almost \u00a33000 up front (figures on a recent viewing of a property) The average UK wage of \u00a326,500 would not cover this. We have houses. People simply cannot afford them! I would also ask they they stop houses being split into rooms for rental reducing family homes. ",
        "background": "Currently in the SE private rents have become ridiculous, with  a single room costing as much as \u00a3700 pm. This is useless to a largely working class area. To add to this most letting agents and landlords refuse to accept any form of housing benefit, even as a top up.",
