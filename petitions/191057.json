        "additional_details": "The Independent recently reported that girls from low income backgrounds are truanting from school, on the days they are menstruating, due to lack of sanitary protection. In some cases, girls are using socks and sellotaped toilet paper in their underwear on these days, just to make it through the school day. If we can supply free eye tests, dental care and medical care, could we not supply young girls with sanitary protection within our schools or GPs? \r\n",
        "background": "New research has shown that British girls from low-income families are missing school because of their periods, as they simply can\u2019t afford tampons and pads. This deprivation affects them further within their education, by missing out on valuable learning. \r\n ",
