        "additional_details": "Welsh representation on the Jack would be to include either the Red Dragon or the colours of St David in the flags design. It is important that the Union Jack isn't changed beyond recognition as it is a uniques part of British culture, identity and tradition. However Weksh representation is equally important. ",
        "background": "How can the Union Jack be the national flag of the United Kingdom when not all regions of the country are fairly represented? For hundreds of years English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish(1800-1921) soldiers have fought and died for Great Britain and at times Ireland. They all deserve to be honoured. ",
