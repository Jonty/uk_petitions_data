        "action": "Make it an offence to bring animals into food establishments",
        "additional_details": "I use the Caffe Nero in Upminster, and due to a previous managers decision, dogs are allowed in. The owners put them on seating, people have nearly tripped over dog leads, and often dogs bark at each other when close to each other. One of the baristas also told me that a dog had defected on the floor. I find it disgusting that food is on display and being served with animals in the cafe. There is external seating available, which could be utilised by pet owners. I was astonished there is no legislation in place to prohibit this.",
        "background": "At the moment no legislation exists which prohibits animals being brought into places where food is prepared and served, it is generally up to the discretion of the manager, and many organisations do not have a clear policy on this matter",

You could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
