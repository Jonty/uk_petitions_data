        "action": "Require proposed Great Reform Bill to give Parliament a veto on terms of BREXIT.",
        "additional_details": "We the people have the undisputed right, per the 2016 referendum to leave the EU. If the terms of leaving are unacceptable, it should neither be disputed that we have the right to change our minds. While it appears the Prime Minister intents to trigger article 50 without Parliamentary consent or knowledge of a likely deal, Parliament and the people can be given a say by the mechanism described above. The Act means the proposed Great Repeal Bill referred to by Mrs May in Conference on 02/10/2016.",
        "background": "A repeal bill has been proposed to enable BREXIT, as of the date BREXIT takes effect. We propose this bill contain provisions for a Parliamentary vote or referendum approving the terms of BREXIT, and that for the purposes of the Act BREXIT shall not take effect until such approval has been given.",
