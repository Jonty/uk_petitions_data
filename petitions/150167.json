        "additional_details": "David Cameron has resigned, but is still in the driving seat. \r\nHe cannot step down yet because his party needs time to select a new leader, but considering the mess we are in following the EU referendum, it would be best for the nation if he stepped down as soon as possible.\r\nBoth main parties are in disarray and the nation needs a strong leader now.\r\nCaroline Lucas has consistently proven to be a sensible, level headed yet passionate individual who is well respected on both sides of the house.",
        "background": "Considering the conduct of the front runners during the referendum campaign, it is clear that none are fit to be PM.\r\nFurthermore the government may yet lose its majority over election expense errors\r\nWe need a PM who has the respect of both sides of the house and is not embroiled in these concerns.",
