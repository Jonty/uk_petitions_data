        "additional_details": "We are working with our Patener charity Let Us Play, an organisation that works with disabled and vulnerable children from the ages 5-19. They do amazing work to help the children have a fun filled life. However they struggle to get the essentials that they need due to the government cuts towards disabled people for example, there used to be 27 rest bite beds in Wolverhampton alone and over the past few years it has reduced to 3. How unfair is that?",

They have cut back too much on the funding for the disabled and we want to make a change, this petition will help us make that difference that could change lives. ",
