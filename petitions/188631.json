        "action": "Theresa May: Reverse the crippling cuts to local government",
        "additional_details": "In Eastbourne this has amounted to a savage reduction of almost 60% of the grant - \u00a36m p/a. We call upon Eastbourne\u2019s MP and MPs from across the country to lobby the Prime Minister and the government for a better settlement and to continue to do so until such time that funding for local authoroties reaches the level it was pre-2015. Whilst the petition originates in Eastbourne, it draws attention to the impact of government grant cuts to local authorities across England.\r\n",
        "background": "In recent years annual reductions in the grant paid by central government have crippled local authorities\u2019 ability to respond effectively to local needs. Local government has borne a disproportionate share of central government\u2019s austerity measures and it is now time to say \"no more\".",
