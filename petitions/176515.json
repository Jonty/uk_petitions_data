The MOD accountants have left this once great Maritime Nation defenceless. Utter madness to dispose of essential defence equipment before the replacement has been thoroughly trialled and allowed to enter service.\r\nI want our Government to immediately find a solution to this massive capability gap and implement it without delay.",
