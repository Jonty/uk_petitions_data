        "action": "Legalise the use of cannabis and decriminalise drug usage among the UK.",
        "additional_details": "People convicted of drugs possession should go to rehab, not prison cells. We need more time catching violent criminals. We also don't need to spend a ridiculous amount of money (like in the US) enforcing this policy. Instead we could take Portugal's lead and decriminalise drug use altogether. Convicts can have good job opportunities when they finish rehab and drug use has been cut in half, while the US still has the highest drug use rates in the world and convicts can't have a second chance.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Our policies on drugs are failing. The War on Drugs is failing. In light of recent media coverage on cannabis, I believe it is not only time to legalise, tax and regulate it like the alcohol and tobacco industries, it is time to decriminalise all drug possession.",
