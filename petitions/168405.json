        "additional_details": " I challenged GWR( the rail company in this instance but other tail companies are also guilty) and I was told that there is a 16 - 25 year old 1/3rd off discount card which sounded brilliant except you can't activate it before 10am or you pay \u00a312 flat day rate which works out more expensive than an adult season ticket.The 1/3rd discount card is a fraud as it does not do what it says!!. What 16 - to 25 year old goes anywhere meaningful daily after 10am? Students and workers take earlier trains.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "My 2 sons best mode of transport to School is the train.We just paid \u00a3191 for my 15 year old for this term(6wks) and my 16yr old \u00a3382 for the same journey just because he turned 16!!He is still in the same school.16 -18 year olds in full time education should not be paying adult fares\r\n",
