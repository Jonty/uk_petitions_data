Voters on issues affecting UK politics should be required to reside within the UK, be over the age of 18 and be required to provide proof of such, for example national insurance number.  The identification number should also be used to ensure people do not vote more than once and that they are who they say they are.  This validation should be applied before votes are added.",
        "background": "At present, to vote on an electronic petition, one need merely tick a box to declare they are a British national and they are permitted to vote.  The system requests also a UK postal code.\r\n\r\nDespite the above, after examining the 'json' data of many petitions it would seem this is poorly vetted.",

It's clear that you'd like us to change the rules about who can sign petitions, and that you'd like people to be required to give a National Insurance number to sign a petition. However, we're not sure exactly how you'd like this to work. \r\n\r\nFor example, we're not sure what you mean by \"UK voters\" - whether this means people who can vote in UK general elections, or also people who can vote in local elections in the UK. We're also not sure whether you would like British citizens who live abroad, but who are eligible to vote in UK general elections, to be able to sign petitions. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
