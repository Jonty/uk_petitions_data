        "additional_details": "The e-petition system was created to provide us with \"an easy, personal way for you to influence government and Parliament in the UK.\"\r\n\r\nDespite 577k and 449k signatures for recent petitions about Donald Trump and asylum seekers respectively, our government was obliged to do no more than discuss them.\r\n\r\nA third threshold to force a parliamentary vote on any given petition would offer real democracy, not just meaningless rhetoric.  More people would use the system if given real democratic power.",
        "background": "Recent petitions have attracted enormous levels of public support, but delivered little to no democratic value to UK citizens and residents.\r\n\r\nA parliamentary debate is not enough.\r\n\r\nPopular petitions should be able to force a parliamentary vote if a threshold of 500,000 signatories is reached.",
