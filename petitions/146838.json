        "additional_details": "There is a great deal of uncertainty around the upcoming negotiations and what Brexit will actually look like. Negotiations will conclude before we vote at the next election. The shape of the settlement will dramatically change what the post-EU UK looks like.\r\n\r\nMany people voted leave and remain for many different reasons and it is only right that the actual terms of our exit should be shaped for and voted on by the public, rather than politicians and other lobbying interests. ",
        "background": "Following the UK's vote to leave, there will be a 2 year period of negotiations. The final settlement should be put to the public in a referendum where the public can vote with a clear understanding of the impact, risks and benefits.",
