        "additional_details": "In everyday life individuals sometimes make a decision after which it becomes apparent that the present and future consequences are more serious than was foreseen, but they can usually put matters right by reconsidering the original decision. Each individual who voted, and those who did not, needs a similar opportunity to reconsider their opinion regarding the EU Referendum. Without this opportunity there is a danger that the close and otherwise irreversible original outcome is resulting in the pursuit of a policy which no longer represents the will of the people.  ",
        "background": "In view of the consequences which have followed the result of the EU Referendum the undersigned request Parliament to give the people the opportunity to reconsider their opinion by arranging for there to be a second referendum on the issue.",
