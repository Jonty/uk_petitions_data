        "action": "Lower the voting age to 16 so that young people can have a say in their future",
        "additional_details": "Given how much of the 'public opinion' was influenced by a demographic split with regards to the decision to Leave the EU, or to Remain, with an overwhelming majority of young people wanting to remain, with a large majority of older people wanting to leave, I believe we need to lower the voting age, and give 16 year olds the opportunity to be a part of the democratic process, and voice their opinions as well.",
        "background": "In our modern day society younger people are more informed, more educated, and more aware than ever, and there is no reason why 16 year old's cannot be involved in the democratic process.  Following the #EUReferendum I believe we need to let 16 year olds join the debate and have a voice in democracy",
