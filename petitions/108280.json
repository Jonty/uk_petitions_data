        "additional_details": "As you're reading this people are dying in slow agonizing pain, willing it to come sooner. Their suffering was dictated by merely a few hundred people who they're likely to have never met, who will never know their name and will not shed a tear for them.\r\n\r\nReligion has a place in our society, however it should not dictate each individuals choice on this issue; therefore we, as a nation, need to decide whether we feel it is right to empower already dying individuals to stop their own suffering. ",
        "background": "The public should choose, via referendum, whether to accept the bill put forward by Wolverhampton South West MP, Rob Marris.\r\nIt should be a national decision; not a politically motivated one. ",
