For so many students to express their discontent on twitter and other social media sites following this exam, something needs to be changed and therefore grade boundaries should be lowered. ",
        "background": "Following the examination on the 15th June 2016 I feel that it is only fair the grade boundaries are significantly reduced. Some questions such as Q9 should be taken into consideration or removed from the paper. The paper is described as harder than FP3 and a large majority of students left crying. ",
