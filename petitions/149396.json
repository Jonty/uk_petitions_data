        "additional_details": "It is time for us the people to send a unequivocal message to the political elite we no longer want unelected leaders making decisions for us. We need a democratically empowered party to handle our negotioations as it is clear the current elected parties have had no policies of negotiation as far as leaving the EU. The only way this can be achieved is by electing a party to represent the uk in negotiations.Not a party that has been elected on a pro euro ballot other than holding a referendum.  ",
        "background": "Due to the Brexit vote and the current disarray in the main political parties we the undersigned believe an immediate general election before we invoke article 50 is the only way we will be democratically represented in negotiations whit the EU. All other options can only be considered undemocratic.",
