        "additional_details": "the face value and more since have been added.  This is blatant profiteering and touting.  I am a real fan of the event and tried to get tickets, but if I now want to go it will cost me in excess of \u00a3300 to go. I want to make it law that resale can be for the face value of the tickets and postage, or be returned to the ticket vendor for a full refund to be resold on thier site. I don't mind missing out fairly on events but want protection for all who are desperate to see them.",
        "background": "As a fan of music and Football, getting tickets can be difficult at the best of times.  The latest example which I have experienced was for an event which had limited tickets at \u00a35 each 5 minutes after the event had sold out, I checked stubhub.co.uk and found the same tickets for sale at 50 times",
