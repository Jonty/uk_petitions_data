        "additional_details": "I belive in technology and its development but not when it directly effects peoples and family lives in a negative and destructive way, more and more employers replacing human workers with robotic technology and more in manual jobs something a large proportion of people rely on for their very existence.  I think this is destroying peoples lives and instead of assisting humanity it is taking it down a dangerous slope, assist yes but no further this has to stop and be limited immediately",
        "background": "In todays world technology can do amazing things, it can assist, cure and save lives however I believe it crosses a red line when it changes from assisting and supporting humanity to that of replacing.  Currently technology is being applied more and more and replacing livelihoods, THIS MUST STOP",
