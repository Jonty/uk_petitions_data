Many of them are still paying tax in the UK in one way or another and they should have a say on where their money goes. It is essential we have someone to represent us and fight our corner after the June 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union. The referendum unsettled global markets, including currencies, causing the British pound to fall to its lowest level in decades. There is a likely chance that we will remain in Europe however we do not have a representative, although it has been tried in the past. ",
