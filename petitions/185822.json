Why should they earn so much whilst the driver struggles to make ends meet. It's a absolute farce and needs some sort of regulation where the agency earn something like 1/8 of what the worker is earning. ",
        "background": "Having worked in the construction industry for the last 12 years I've watched wages plummet mainly due to greedy recruitment agency's taking more and more of a cut of the workers wages, praying on people who have no choice but to work for low rates, it needs regulation. ",
