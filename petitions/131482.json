        "additional_details": "Company tests should be top speed test whether it's greater then 25mph maybe, breaking speed test (how long it takes to break). All companies should supply safety wear such as a helmet and a pair of gloves, in the end if these are in place then the board would be just as safe as a bike if not more because the capped top speed. If any of the rules aren't followed by people then if seen by law enforcement they should have their board confiscated and fined \u00a3500",
        "background": "Electric skateboards are banned due to them being motorised, they should be allowed because they have low emissions, cause less congestion along with appropriate breaking to prevent accidents. They should be allowed as long as you have safety wear and the companies do appropriate government tests.",
