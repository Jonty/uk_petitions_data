        "additional_details": "MP's are set to receive 1.4% pay rise in April 2017. Yet public sector pay rises have been stuck at 1% for years. This was after pay freezes and increment freezes. MP's can not fall back on the defence of \"we don't choose how much of a pay rise we get, this is decided by an independent group\". MP's have the power to change this unfair process and give public sector workers the pay they deserve for keeping the country running. With these vital jobs the county would ground to a halt.",
        "background": "In 2015 MP's received a pay rise of around \u00a310,000. This was after years of other public sector workers having their pay and increments frozen meaning in real terms they missed out of thousands of pounds. MP's continue to cap public sector rises at 1% yet they are set to receive more than 1%.",
