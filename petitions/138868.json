        "action": "Say \"No\" To Second EU Referendum",
        "additional_details": "We need our country back, for security, national health, sovereignty, immigration control and so so SO much more. If Leave won again, would we have a third referendum, and a fourth?! USA, Germany and Canada have already said they want to trade with an independent Britain. The FTSE and GBP did rise again by evening after originally falling only hours earlier. Our independence isn't being given a fair chance. I say it should. Send this petition to Parliament, to stand up for what we believe in.",
        "background": "The vote to Leave the EU was conducted fairly and confidentially, with a narrow margin in result, but a result nevertheless. Britain can be a strong, independent country if it was given the chance, so join me and 17,410,741 other Leave voters and say no to a second EU referendum.",
