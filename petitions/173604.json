        "additional_details": "The national wage for a NQT teacher within the U.K starts at \u00a322,244 and I as a class TA earn \u00a311,000 a year. I feel at times I can work just as hard and spend the same hours at school as some teachers. I'm not asking for the same wage as teachers but i believe TA/LSA should be earning more money so we can make a living for ourselves. ",
