        "action": "Provide increased educational support to refugee children in Calais.",
        "additional_details": "The story of a 13 year old refugee named Sajev, with dreams of attending Oxbridge inspired me to create this petition, I am a 15 year old girl who also has dreams of attending Oxbridge, and Sajev's story opened my eyes to how privileged I am to be able to go to school each day. We can and must make a difference to the lives of these children, who have had their education stolen from them by conflict and so I call upon my country to stand for these children, who are not so different from our own.",
        "background": "The vast majority of refugee children have no access to education whilst waiting for refuge, meaning their aspirations are cruelly taken away by the likes of poverty and violence. We must strive to make a difference to the lives of these children, who are innocent victims in a dreadful conflict.",
