        "additional_details": "Small schools with a smaller wage bill that are maintained by the LA will also be expected to pay the Levy and will need to account for this in their separate small school budgets. \r\nAcademies and faith schools are exempt from this - small schools are being treated unfairly, and their already struggling budgets are surely taking the hit! ",
        "background": "The Apprenticeship Levy, being introduced in April, will see all businesses including schools with a wage bill over \u00a33 million a year contributing 0.5 per cent of that wage bill to fund new apprenticeships. \r\nSmall schools are being treated unfairly and this needs to be reviewed! \r\n",
