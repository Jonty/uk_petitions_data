        "additional_details": "This happens to prevent victims giving evidence to help a convict the abuser. This needs to change! When an abuser has a history of violence or the poilce have concerns then more action needs to be taken to protect the victims, aswell any children or close family members as they can also be in the abusers firing line. We as a country don't tolerate verbal or physical threats made towards our police and NHS staff, so why aren't threats of violence etc taken more seriously when a victim of domestic violence is being threated?",
        "background": "When victims have the courage to report abuse, the police and the courts need to take better action to protect them for the whole process. More often enough the abusers are let out with pitiful bail conditions that they don't stick too and end up threating and in some cases murdering their victims. ",
