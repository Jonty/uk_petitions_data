        "additional_details": "They are a real danger, they slow emergency vehicles, cause flooding when drains are blocked, icy when freezing, hard to see when covered in snow, stop leaves and debris being naturally blown and washed away, damage road users suspension, wheels etc, and make driving anywhere a real pain if you have back problems, pregnant, old and infirm. \r\nPlease use another method to control traffic, road humps waste tarmac, close roads whilst they are being installed and waste money which could be used for crossings e.t.c.",
        "background": "These have proliferated to such a extent, they are the single biggest hazard to road users.\r\n\r\n",
