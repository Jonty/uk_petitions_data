        "action": "Motorist caught using a mobile phone become uninsured for 24hrs & vehicle seized",
        "additional_details": "If motorists knew they would lose their vehicle including commercial vehicles for 24hrs it is my belief that the use of a mobile phone whilst driving would be significantly reduced, thus saving lives. \r\n\r\nIf insurance companies added to their terms and conditions the wording: The insured will be automatically uninsured if at the time of being involved in an accident was proved to be using a mobile phone whilst Driving their vehicle.  Your claim will become a fault claim. ",
        "background": "My Insurance company dismissed the evidence I provided which I believed proved the third party was on her phone at the time of my accident by stating:  We don't believe using a mobile phone does contribute to causing an accident.  Insurance companies are ignoring the dangers & need to make changes.",
