        "additional_details": "The latest story created outrage on social media sites. We are seeing far too many convictions for child sex offences which are inadequately punished.\r\n\r\nAny adult who does this to a child deserves no leniency whatsoever and no option for parole. I petition for a full review of sentencing for any child abuse convictions, including online grooming and downloading images etc.\r\n\r\nI also have a petition on Facebook and Change.org supporting a full review of child sex abuse sentencing where convicted.",
        "background": "Another sickening news headline, a girl of six is raped,  the rapist receives just 3.5 years prison. Disgusting and wholly unacceptable and a huge issue for the vast majority of people, especially parents. Convicted child rapists should receive no less than 25 years imprisonment. Sign now please    ",
