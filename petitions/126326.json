        "additional_details": "There are workers aged 21-24 doing the same job as those aged 25+ but will be earning pocket money compared to them.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching adulthood, you would expect to be paid like an adult. Since we pay adult rates for train fairs, cinema tickets etc, why do the 'younger' few pay at the same rates but have to be spared an increase in wages, when high majority of us work at the same level doing the same job?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The new national minimum wage is now in full swing as of 1 April 2016. However, given that 21-24 year olds are classed as adults, it should be fair that us workers aged 21-24 should also be given an increase in our wages.",
