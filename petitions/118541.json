        "additional_details": "The failure to teach our children about the Barbary/Islamic slave trade or officially recognise it, in the same way that the Trans-Atlantic slave trade is both taught and recognised, creates a false perspective and risks inducing a sense of self-loathing amongst the indigenous British population. Sadly slavery has been practised since time immemorial by a wide range of peoples, races and Nations and it is arbitrary and unjustifiable to place such emphasis on the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. ",
        "background": "The Barbary/Islamic slave trade continued from circa the 15th to the 19th Century and involved approximately 1.25 million victims.  The perpetrators were non-white and the victims were white, some of whom were British.",
