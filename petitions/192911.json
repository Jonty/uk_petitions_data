        "additional_details": "I live in the North West of England and regularly see vehicles parked up with their engines running when there is no one in the vehicle or the driver is talking or on their phone, etc. It really angers me to witness this, as I think of the number of people that die each year and we all know the effect global warming is having on our planet. It is an unnecessary waste of fuel and it is having a huge impact on the environment.",
        "background": "As we all hear in the news, over ten thousand people in the UK die each year due to air-pollution related diseases. I regularly see stationary vehicles with their engines running whilst the occupants are texting, talking etc. and I believe something should be done.",
