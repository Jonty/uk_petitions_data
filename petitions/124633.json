        "additional_details": "I'll give you an example; when I reach 16 years old I will have to pay double the fare on the Midland Metro every Friday when I go and see my boyfriend? Yet, I'll only just be looking for a job that will pay up to \u00a32 less per hour compared to over 18 year olds. That \u00a32 that I'm potentially losing in my wage may aswell be doubled as I will have to pay an extra \u00a32 on the Metro? You constantly see articles raving about equality so how is it 'adults' of 16 and 17 years not entitled to Adult pay?",
        "background": "I don't see how it is fair that as soon as you hit 16 years old, you have to pay full adult fare on public transport. Yet, when it comes to working; you can't receive adult pay until you hit 18 years old. How does that make sense? Should 16/17 year olds - most commonly students have to pay double?",
