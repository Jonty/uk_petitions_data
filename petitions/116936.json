        "additional_details": "More than 30 elephants get killed for their ivory everyday. Every YEAR about 10,950 elephants are killed. This means that there will be no more elephants in 2025. Organisations like the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust or the Pams Foundation and many more do a great job, but more has to be done. We know which countries deal with ivory, why don't we use this to our advantage? I hope you understand my point and see the importance of saving our wildlife for the future.",
        "background": "I am a 12 year old boy. I am facinated and passionate with animals and think it is wrong to poach them. My grandparents live in Tanzania, so I have seen lots of wildlife conservation efforts and the beautiful elephants in the wild. I would like others to have the same opportunity.",
