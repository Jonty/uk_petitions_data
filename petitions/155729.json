        "action": "Discuss the establishment of a rival EU 'London based Global trading group'.",
        "additional_details": "The UK's decision to leave the EU is a fantastic chance to create a truly global trading group. With the UK's strong links to her commonwealth countries(both former and present), the United States, China and Japan, the establishment of a new economic trading group based in London in new, purpose headquarters will undoubtedly attract existing members of the EU who are reluctant to leave. The strengths of the new Pan trading group, is the absence of politics and its location in a truly global city.",
        "background": "The United Kingdom's decision to leave the EU has created an ideal opportunity to create a separate trading group outside of and free of the influences of the EU. Based in London, the new trading group will operate in a new purpose built center, whose sole focus will be economy and trade.",
