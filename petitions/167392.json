        "additional_details": "Its unfair that car users, after passing their driving practical exam at 17 years of age can go a buy any car they want (assuming they can afford it , e.g  Ferrari, BMW or any higher performance vehicle) whereas a motorycles user cannot ride anything over 47bhp (A2 license) until they are 21 or 24 years of age. Those who misbehave and abuse such a privillege (if changes commence) must accept and deal with the consequences even if it results in their own injury/death",
        "background": "Objective is to increase BHP on a motorcycle for those who ride on an A2 license (19 years of age)",
