        "action": "Introduce a compulsory driving refresher course or re-test at the age of 75",
        "additional_details": "I propose a new driving test be instated at the age of 75 and then a refresher course every 2/3 years to make sure the drivers are still safe. It's a fact of life that as you get older you get weaker and less responsive so it makes sense to me to make sure the older generation are still safe to drive! ",
        "background": "The reason I am starting this petition is because I believe the older generation should have to prove they can keep control of a vehicle and are fit to drive still. As a mechanic i have customers that come into me that can hardly walk yet get back into a car.",
