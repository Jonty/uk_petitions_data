        "additional_details": "Why do young adults/ adults get their choice of colleges/ university's made for them, but the families who have special needs children/family have to try and find something suitable for their child, which does not involve re locating or sending them away. We need better choices and more help to make sure our families get the life lessons and education they deserve, to help them grow as adults and to help them obtain their independence, and to also help them to defy the odds set against them. ",
        "background": "There are a lack of places special needs people can go after high school. Either due to lack of funding, lack of trained people and lack of facilities. There are only a hand full of placements a special needs adult can go, which normally results in them having to travel quite a distance to attend. ",
