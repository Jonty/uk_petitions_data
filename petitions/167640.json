(AVG \u00a32k) Tenants are being charged for admin, tenancy + check in (\u00a3450 AVG) Fees are being kept if credit checks fail. Amounts being charged are high and disproportionate to cost. 500% mark ups for services. Tenancy agreements are blank templates & almost universal. Renewals for \u00a3150? This is just money grabbing. Only one digit needs change. Credit checks are \u00a320. Citizens Advice + Shelter now agree it is out of hand! Help us!",
