        "additional_details": "At least 1 in 10 people suffer from panic attacks (NHS) - meaning on average at least 1 person in every small business may be a sufferer. Many people will be afraid of the symptoms which can be similar to those of a heart attack - so people need to be made aware of the tell-tale signs and how to manage them.\r\nHours of work are lost from anxiety related issues, so let's make our nation more open to talk and comfortable when dealing with anxiety and panic attacks.",
        "background": "If we are going to treat mental health the same as any other illness or condition, it needs to be normalised and people need to be trained on how to manage a situation if someone has a panic attack. They are becoming increasingly common, particularly in the workplace.",
