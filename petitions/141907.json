        "additional_details": "We now must deal with the uncertainty wrought by a narrow victory and the division created by having two nations impose their will on two others. \r\n\r\nOnce this Europe mess is sorted, we propose the next referendum subject be answered in less divisive manner:\r\n\r\nFirst it must be passed by both Houses of Parliament, that's what they're for.\r\n\r\nThen it must gain a majority of voters, which must also total at least 50% of all registered voters.\r\n\r\nIt must also get a majority in each of our four nations.\r\n",
        "background": "No matter which way we voted in the Brexit referendum, we all woke up to a UK where massive economic, political, and social changes in our collective futures were enacted by 51.9% of the voting public and 50% of nation's in the UK. \r\n\r\nPlease reform how we do this to avoid it ever happening again.",
