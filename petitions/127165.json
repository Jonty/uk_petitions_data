        "additional_details": "Bel\u2019s nature religion corrupted ancient Israel & choked Mosaic law & blessings, leaving agricultural/economic misery. Baal nature worship yielded poverty, depopulation & child sacrifice, as fertility was linked with killing children (2 Kings 17) In the North Israel kingdom, what began in freedom, turned into nature mysticism &tyranny (1 Kings 21), coups, Assyrian invasion & exile. Judah ended in child sacrifice & cannibalism in a Babylonian invasion 120 years later (Jeremiah 19) ",
        "background": "The Palmyra  Bel Temple was central to a culture of nature worship, sexual abandon, & child sacrifice- inconsistent with British values. Celebrating such a monument  because others were destroyed is poor reasoning, & disgusts those who know of the temple origins & what the religion stood for. ",
