In Australia most if not all children in costal school are taught about the dangers of the sea and how they could potentially avoid it, we should take note from this and apply it to our own schools, potentially saving lives.",
        "background": "We should make it mandatory for all costal schools to teach their pupils about sea safety, as they do in Australia, this information has the potential to save many many lives and should be taught in schools. ",
