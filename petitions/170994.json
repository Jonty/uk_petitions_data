        "additional_details": "For every year I teach my own children, the tax payers save between \u00a33000 and \u00a36000 This is the case for every home educated child. No funding is provided in anyway. I am a single parent and we are a low income family because of our choice, we accept that this will be the case until I have finished teaching the children. \r\n\r\n However, we do ask  the same free provision of GCSE and A Level examinations  for home educated children,  who should have equal opportunities in this area at the very least.",
        "background": "Thousands of UK citizens home educate!  School failed some of these families,  others simply home educate out of personal preference. \r\n\r\nIs it right to disadvantage children educated at zero expense to tax payers? Why then the fees for home educated children to sit GCSEs and A levels? ",
