        "action": "Ban group interviews for all job applicants in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Group interviews are by many seen as a lazy recruitment practise, to root out 'unworthy' candidates quickly.\r\nIn many cases, I find group interviews to be discriminatory and unfair to certain demographics.\r\nPaid employment is and should be for everyone.\r\nOne of the major flaws with group interviews is that introverted personality types are left out in the cold. \r\nWe need to introduce a fairer system that forces employers to evenly and fairly judge ALL potential job candidates.",
        "background": "In the harsh times we live in, employment and specifically, unemployment is one of the most painful things a person can face.\r\nThe indignity of group interviews where people are made to beg around a table for jobs, is unfair.\r\nWe need to empower jobseekers, not crush them and ban group interviews.",
