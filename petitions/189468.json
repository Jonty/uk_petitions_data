I think it is wrong for us to have to end our life because we live in fear and dread of going to school or even out side. It needs to stop and I'm crying out for something to stop it and I feel strongly for this to be heard and stopped. People record it on there phones and laugh it's mostly on YouTube the bullying and its sad. I want it to stop I want someone to do something about it and not just brush it away like its nothing. We are to young to kill ourselves and we have a future and dreams.\r\nRegards Caitlin Gray",
