        "additional_details": "Many people around the UK paying extra car insurance premium just for getting involved in an accident, despite it wasn't their fault at all. I have been hit by a speeding vehicle while waiting in the traffic light and my insurance now gone up by 110%. I spoke to many people around the country and they are suffering from the same fate. This is very fraudulent behavior of the insurance companies to form out money from both parties with any excuse. \"No blame\" accident sufferers should not pay extra",

Many driver got hit from behind by another driver while on stall position and ended up paying 30% extra insurance premium during their next renewal. This is unfair for many drivers.",
