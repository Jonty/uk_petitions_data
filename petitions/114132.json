        "background": "Swegways and segways are currently illegal to ride anywhere apart from private property. This is because they aren't road worthy but are motor vehicles.\r\n\r\nThey are small and as safe as bicycles. So I don's see any reason why they can't be made legal to use in public, like in over 40 US states etc.",
