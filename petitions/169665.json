        "action": "Introduce a TV License Discount for Full Time Students",
        "additional_details": "Unlike a typical home where only one license is needed, students staying in halls of residence are required to purchase an individual license for their room. For example, if a hall has 8 rooms on it, each student is currently required to purchase their own license for just one room at full cost. This is a large amount of money and it is unfair to charge students so much more despite them being on limited budgets. By introducing a reduced rate for single rooms, more students would pay the fee.",
        "background": "This petition calls on the government to take advantage of the TV license freeze ending in March 2017 to introduce a reduced rate TV license for full time students living in single occupancy rooms. By introducing a reduced rate, more students would consider buying a license.",
