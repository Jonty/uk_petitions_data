        "additional_details": "Having been assaulted myself where the perpetrator was given a concurrent sentence, where this left me feeling let down by the justice system. More recently a colleague was hit 4 times with a metal pole over his back while dealing with another incident and the perpetrator was given a 4 month concurrent sentence. This is during the zero tolerance to violence which the civil service champions, but when the prisoner is given a concurrent sentence it doesn't send the message of zero tolerance.",
        "background": "If a civil servant is assaulted doing their duties and if the person is convicted in court they should get a consecutive sentence to any other convictions and not a concurrent sentence. If that person is serving a life sentence, when granted parole it is then added past their parole date.",
