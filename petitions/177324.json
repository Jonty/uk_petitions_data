        "action": "Make \"sex and relationship\" education compulsory in all schools.",
        "additional_details": "This is especially crucial for young LGBT+ people because it is unlikely that many parents/carers will cover LGBT+ issues with their children. Look at the \"legacy\" that Section 28 has left, including a high proportion mental health issues among LGBT+. Faith schools are not exempt from this because they do not agree with homosexuality, if anything it is even more crucial that LGBT students here are set up for a healthy adult life.",
        "background": "All teenagers need to learn about appropriate, consensual relationships and sex. Some young people are lucky enough to have appropriate and necessary talks with parents/carers but this is not always the case so needs to be the responsibility of schools.",
