        "additional_details": "They are being used currently by employers as a way to place 'no other options decisions' on the employee and there is not enough safeguarding process to resolve relationship issues through other steps first. Much like you can't go to tribunal without a certificate from ACAS, employers should not be allowed to have these types of conversation without all possible other avenues exhausted first.\r\n\r\nI'm not suggesting that the option shouldn't be there, it should just be limited to the final ones.",
        "background": "The current laws regarding 'Settlement Agreements' or 'Without Prejudice Conversations' or 'Protected Conversations' or 'Off the record Conversations' are shockingly lacking in safeguards for the employee.\r\n\r\nThey can be sprung upon an employee as a way of getting rid of them without red tape.",
