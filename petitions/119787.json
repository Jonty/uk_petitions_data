        "action": "Stop the government scrapping Attendance Allowance (AA)",
        "additional_details": "AA is a non-means tested benefit for people over 65yrs needing help with personal care (i.e. washing, dressing and eating etc), because they are physically or mentally disabled.\r\n\r\nIt helps people to remain at home for longer and enables them to decide how, where and when their care is delivered; removing pressure on an already overstretched NHS. \r\n\r\nAbolishing AA removes valuable financial support from people who may not meet the increasingly substantial criteria that Social Services use when deciding if a person is entitled to their support.\r\n\r\nIt will remove people\u2019s choice, diminish their independence, and have a hugely negative impact on our elderly's health. AA can make all the difference between living and existing \u2013 without it people will suffer.",
        "background": "The government's Local Government Finance Settlement 2016/17 (published just before Christmas), suggested plans to abolish all new claims for Attendance Allowance in favour of handing the money over to local councils to pay for support for older people.",
