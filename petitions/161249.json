        "additional_details": "If funds are not available or a payments going into account are not there on time due to bank errors or delays in employee payments or benefit payments it can cause LIFE THREATENING problems for those on a low budget as bank fees are taken from allowances put aside for food or essentials. This puts incredible pressure those on a tight budget who are hit the most with unrealistic fees for returned direct debits forcing them into further debt.\r\n\r\nThis is immoral for modern day British Companies.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Direct debit gives a third party open access to your wallet and bank account at any time and at will. Those who pay by other LEGAL methods are penalized with higher fees. In effect its a stealth tax charged by companies who want easy access to YOUR money. Its not right, Its not moral and its unjust.",
