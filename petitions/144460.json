        "additional_details": "Those who are demanding a second referendum on Brexit are desperate to have their own way, but it is unthinkable that we keep asking the question until we get an answer which we want. If the Remain Camp had secured their will, would they consent to a re-run of the Referendum? Of course not! The people of the UK  have decided that they want to leave the EU. Question over!",
        "background": "On 23rd June The People spoke and made their choice. This is democracy and the decision should stand. A Petition to have a re-run of the Referendum has attracted over a million supporters. They have their opinion and are disappointed but, again, the people have spoken and vox populi vox dei.",
