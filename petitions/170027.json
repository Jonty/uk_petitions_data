        "action": "Lower the voting age to 16 in all votes, referendums and otherwise.",
        "additional_details": "There is a multitude of reasons to support this change, not least of which are that 16 year olds are just as competent as any 18+, have all the same rights as an 18+, and are able to make political decisions like any 18+. Especially with the recent change to education, ours is the most politically educated generation yet, and is arguably better equipped to make political decisions than many adults. It is vital that we change the voting age to allow 16 and 17 year olds to be included in society.",
        "background": "The government should alter the legislation to allow 16 and 17 year olds to vote at all opportunities.",
