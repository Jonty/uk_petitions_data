        "action": "EU Article 50 affects rights of those aged under 24 and should not be adopted.",
        "additional_details": "Initially I only considered that currently all UK citizens, by virtue of the fact they hold dual EU/UK nationality have the right to work in any Eu member state. Implementation of Article 50 would cause this to cease, possible in contravention of Article 23, Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nI then considered the rights obtained by those born since 1992 who have dual UK/EU Citizenship, this being due to legislation not of their making. This is their birthright and not to be taken lightly.",
        "background": "My belief is that such action would not only contravene Articles 15 and  23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but also contravene sections of the Human rights Act that was adopted into the UK Constitution in 2000, as well as the European Convention on Human Rights, Articles 5 and 14.\r\n",
