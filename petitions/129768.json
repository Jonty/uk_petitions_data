        "additional_details": "All children have the right to education. In my personal experience and in my job role i have encountered many children with ADHD/ADD that have struggled their whole school life. They go on to secondary and end up being expelled. Their need is high, but is displaced as disruptive or a nuisance.\r\nSchools are yet to accommodate these children.  These children struggle in crowds and then are expected to sit in a classroom of thirty children and focus. They are being let down by the education system",
        "background": "Children with ADHD/ADD are unable to concentrate in a highly stimulating environment and are suffering academically. Some are even considered a nuisance in the class room and quite commonly called disruptive.  Having their own space with specialist teachers will give them the help they deserve. ",
