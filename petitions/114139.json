        "additional_details": "1. We support the BMA and Johann Malawana (Chair, JDC) unreservedly and the talks that are occurring through ACAS.\r\n2. Upon calling off the strike today, Jeremy Hunt continues to show a complete lack of regard for junior doctors as displayed by his comments on Twitter and in the general media.\r\n3. This has angered junior doctors and we wish to raise this with him and Parliament as a separate issue from the BMA talks.\r\n4. This is a second, continuing and resounding vote of no confidence in him. ",

We have a continuing and resounding lack of confidence in our Health Secretary and wish to discuss this directly.",
