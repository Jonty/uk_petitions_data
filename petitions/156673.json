        "action": "Stop Britain from being subjected to all new EU regulations and treaty changes.",
        "additional_details": "At this point in time the EU Commission could rush through all manner of legislation to frustrate Britain's amicable exit from Europe.  They could at a stroke of a pen extend the time covered by Article 50 from two years to five or more.  They could bring in treaty change legislation to literally milk our country for all the money they can get before we leave.  This petition is designed to encourage our government politicians to seriously consider this eventuality and prevent it from happening.",
        "background": "The British people democratically decided to leave the EU.  The government could have revoked the European Communities Act 1972 and left straight away.  However it has decided to use the much slower European Union Article 50 route.  It now makes no sense at all to be bound by any new EU legislation.",
