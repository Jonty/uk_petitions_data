        "additional_details": "As we enter this new age of equality between the sexes and gender identities, it's only fitting and fair that women be held accountable for acts equally as damaging physically and mentally to men, as it is to women. It's our firm belief that rape should refer to any non consensual sexual acts, be it by force, intoxication, intimidation, blackmail or any other means which forces an unwilling participant into the act.\r\n\r\nThe section in question:\r\nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/1 ",
        "background": "The Sexual Offences Act of 2003 is a law which discriminates heavily against men and excludes women, describing the act of rape as something only a man is capable of. As we strive for equality, it's only fitting and fair that women be held to the same standards and laws as men.",
