        "additional_details": "It is scientifically proven that people pick things up faster from a young age. Thus if we want to have safer drivers in the country it is better to start young so you pick it up faster. There are many nonsensical arguments about how much more dangerous the roads would be if we let 16 year olds drive - but then why do we let 17 year old's drive?",
        "background": "In many countries around the world (including the US) 16 year old's are allowed to drive contrary to here. It simply does not make sense that the UK should not allow 16 year old's to drive considering that many 17 year old's are in the same school year group. It makes life very difficult.",
