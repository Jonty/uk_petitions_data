        "additional_details": "some of the residents including myself on the estate have gone down the complaints route to the CEO and it's still not been resolved and no foreseeable dates for a resolution either. Only BT install phone lines then rent them to other providers. There is literally nothing any of us have been able to do. Every week we chase for an update to be told it's still being looked at. No dates no resolution and no phone line and Internet ",
        "background": "As consumers in this day and age we should be able to have options to use a company for a service or not. BT have not been able to provide myself and others on the estate with a phone line or internet services, myself since June 2016 others longer than 8 months",
