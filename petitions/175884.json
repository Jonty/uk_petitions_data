        "additional_details": "My husband moved over from highest level care and lowest level mobility Disability Living Allowance, to the the new PIP system. He has a number of conditions including ASD and mental health difficulties, yet scored 0 on his PIP claim, and as a direct result became suicidal. Those with ASD can mask difficulties, and behaviours can vary; how can an assessment which takes place in their own home environment, with their trusted person present, be a true representation of their usual daily struggles?",
        "background": "Those with Autism (ASD) can find verbalising difficulties challenging. When considering PIP, the DWP should more carefully assess those with social and communication difficulties, by discussing more with medical professionals, rather than relying on the opinions of an assessor who briefly met them.
