        "additional_details": " These incidents have to be declared for 5yrs! A non fault accident can cause higher premiums for driver for 5 whole years! My insurance was \u00a31400 this year with a \u00a31350 excess because of 3 non faults in the last 5 years with a 5yr ncb. It looks set to remain this high for 5years, maybe even go up next year. It would have been \u00a3700 otherwise. People are reduced to not reporting things and sorting it out themselves. Or worse, forced off the road. They have us over a barrel and abuse this power.",
        "background": "Insurance premiums are sky high already. It is totally unfair that insurance companies ask about these incidences and charge higher perimiums as a result. They already charge the driver who was at fault a higher premium, why do they also need to penalise the driver who was innocent! This is unfair",
