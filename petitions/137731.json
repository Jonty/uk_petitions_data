        "action": "MPs should reject the EU Referendum because the public have been misinformed.",
        "additional_details": "If a Referendum (rather than a General Election based on party and candidate manifestos) must occur on EU Membership (the most important issue for the UK since WWII), a panel of respected and independent persons should be tasked to produce a body of accurate information; the public should be allowed to submit factual questions to the panel.  Sufficient time should be allowed for panel reporting and then for all MPs and other community leaders to offer the public their advice on a solid basis. ",
        "background": "The public have been grossly misinformed, voting on 23 June on incomplete information and misleading statements in the media and  partisan fliers.  We beg MPs to fulfil their elected function to act in our interests and to reject a result which would utterly undermine the principles of UK democracy.",
