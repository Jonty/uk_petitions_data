Southend Council have introduced LED lighting and it has been a great success, lower emissions and safer for the public. We all need to stand up and have our say instead of complaining about it! Help get our point of view across,stand together and get our lights switched back on! ",
        "background": "If Essex county council replaced all the bulbs with LED lighting, as they have done in the Southend area, we could all rest easy at night and not worry about our safety. It would reduce crime rate and accidents and safety see our much needed night works a safe journey home.\r\n",
