        "additional_details": "I was advised to join an online group just for younger people with breast cancer and within 1 week of me joining there was 21 new members after me. A lot of the girls had gone to their GP with a lump in and got told that it wouldn't be anything to worry about as they were 'too young' for breast cancer, this should not be happening, cancer doesn't care how old you are and every lump should be investigated. It's a horrible thing to be going through and i really think some things need changing.",
        "background": "I want the age you are first called for a mammogram lowering. Also anyone who goes to their GP with a lump in their breast should automatically be referred to the breast clinic for further investigations, regardless of their age. I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 33, still young.",
