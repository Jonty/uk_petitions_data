        "additional_details": "I know a student who has three siblings going to the same school. His mother has to pay \u00a38.85 each day just for her children to go to school. \r\n\r\nI believe that the American system of having government run school buses is greatly superior to our system now.\r\n\r\nI understand like most things in this world this will cost money, my suggestion is to raise council tax by \u00a31-3 and use that money to set up a government run bus system. There are 27 million households in the UK, meaning \u00a381 million a month.",
        "background": "As a student I understand the ridiculous bus prices which we have to pay to even go to school. I believe that as we have a right to education it is wrong that parents have to pay up to \u00a312 a day For us to go school. As well as this students who ride on private coaches have to pay up to \u00a3300 a year.",
