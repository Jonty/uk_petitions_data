        "action": "Re-commit \u00a31 billion in funding for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology.",
        "additional_details": "The UK Government has been promising support for CCS since 2007, and in 2012 opened a commercialization \"competition\" offering \u00a31 billion in venture capital. The funding was withdrawn in November 2015. \r\n\r\nThe latest carbon budget will not enable us to meet Paris targets, but CCS can close the gap. The Energy and Climate Change committee and Oxford climate scientist Dr Myles Allen both recommend the Government develop a clear strategy for development of CCS infrastructure and expertise in the UK. ",
        "background": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) takes the CO2 produced by power plants and locks it safely away underground. We need Government investment in this technology if the UK is to have any hope of meeting the carbon targets agreed in Paris 2015 and effectively fighting climate change.",
