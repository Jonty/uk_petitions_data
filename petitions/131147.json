        "additional_details": "Above the \u00a310,600 tax-free personal allowance there are three bands of income tax people pay on earnings: 20pc (basic rate - from \u00a310,600), 40pc (higher rate - from \u00a342,385) and 45pc (additional rate - from \u00a3150,000). \r\n\r\nBut people earning over \u00a3100,000 gradually have their personal allowance removed at a rate of \u00a31 for every \u00a32 earned above the threshold, up to \u00a3121,200. This means a \"fourth\" band of \"marginal tax\" is created in which they pay 60pc on income in between these levels, plus 2pc for national insurance, a total rate of 62pc. \r\nWorkers pocket just 38pc of the income they earn between these levels. It means, ludicrously, that they pay a higher marginal tax rate than people who earn far more. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
