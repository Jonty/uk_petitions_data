This is a petition to show our awareness of the government's lack of empathy towards what we the people, the true power, actually want. \r\n\r\nNo doubt there will be a similar response to this as there has been to everything else, but we can start by simply showing we stand united and will not be treated like children who cannot make our own decisions.

Petitions here need to be taken more seriously and prioritised above the personal agendas of our elected candidates.",
