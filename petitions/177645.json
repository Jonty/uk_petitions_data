        "additional_details": "This year marks the 19th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, when peace was brought between the Nationalist and Unionist sides in Northern Ireland. Yet for many young people, they are now receiving their first at a time when our politics is in turmoil following the RHI scandal and the breakdown between power-sharing Sinn Fein and DUP. The only way to change this is by giving young people the chance to have their voice heard and move on once and for all for a better future!",
        "background": "After the collapsing of the devolved government in Northern Ireland, it is so important that young people are able to have a say. Yet those who are under 18 still have no voice in our future. 16 year olds were allowed to vote in the Scottish Referendum, so why not the youth of Northern Ireland?",
