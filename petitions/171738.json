        "additional_details": "If you are held up at the till because there are not enough staff at the checkouts, is it fair to be charged by the parking company that the store employs? Is it right to receive a ticket because you pulled up at your door to unload shopping before taking your car to the official car park? No, it isn't. These charges are exhorbitant and unfair. They should have to allow at least a few minutes grace before pouncing and issuing a fine.",
        "background": "Many retail parks, housing developments and busimesses use private parking companies to control parking in their carparks or roads. We believe these companies should be legally required to allow the driver to overstay by a maximum of ten minutes, just as traffic wardens and council wardens have to. ",
