        "background": "A PSV holder is a person who holds a licence to drive a bus, with this they can drive any type of bus from a minibus & double decker, right up to a bendy bus. They carry very precious cargo (the general public). But yet holders of these licences can't drive a class 2 lorry. It doesn't make sense.",
