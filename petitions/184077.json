Passports, too, also levy a similarly heavy cost with a simple renewal costing more than \u00a3100.\r\n\r\nThese fees should be reduced and brought in-line with admin fees charged at home.",
        "background": "Obtaining necessary documents like passports, birth certificates or registering births etc seems to be incredibly, and unjustifiably, expensive for overseas nationals. \r\n\r\nBritish nationals living overseas should not be penalised in such a way.",
