        "additional_details": "16/17 year olds are paid a child wage so why should we pay an adult fare for a bus or a train? Until 18, we are not treated as an adult by the law. Until we are 18, parents and doctors can legally consent medical treatment which over rules our say. It seems to be all that is cared about is getting more money. As a 16 year old preparing for the cost of insuring a car and saving for university, it is essentially unaffordable, and this is the reality for most of us.",
