They already make up 30% of our country, and they are still letting more in.  A few foreigners and no one would have been bothered, but it has went WAY beyond that by now.  What are we going to do, just keep allowing immigration until our own race is outnumbered in our own country (genocide)?",
        "background": "We have to stop immigration and begin a repatriation program to get the numbers back down to a reasonable level.  Is China 30% foreign, and still letting more in?  Is Japan?  Is Pakistan?  etc.  We are not doing this to our own race in our own country either.",
