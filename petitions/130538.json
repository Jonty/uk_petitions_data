        "action": "To ask Government for additional funding to postpone closure of UTC Lancashire",
        "additional_details": "UTC Lancashire opened in Aug 2013-My son is flourishing in his subjects, he's hitting distinctions,despite never being a distinction pupil. He loves this learning environment and to have this taken away now half way through his GCSEs is so unfair.  The level of apprenticeship quality that is coming out of UTC is second to none. Learners are taught the skills, work ethic & given work experience to find employment.  The syllabus is so specialised no other secondary school can take on these pupils.",
        "background": "Parents and learners were told on the 03/05/2016 that UTC Lancashire would be closing on the 31/08/16. This will majorly impact on current learners from completing their GCSEs and A-levels in the summer of 2017. Please provide additional funding to postpone closure and to allow completion of exams.",
