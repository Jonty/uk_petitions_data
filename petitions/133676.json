        "additional_details": "Almost 49% of the UK electorate voted to remain in Europe in the recent referendum on EU membership. As the UK is a member state of the European Union all British Citizens have enjoyed by default European Citizenship. This provides the right to freedom of movement, to live and to work in Europe member states. \r\n\r\nMany UK citizens enjoy these rights but will loose them, something many of them have had since birth, when the UK leaves the European Union. ",
        "background": "Now that the UK public has voted to leave The EU, we call upon the Government to negotiate a settlement, as part of the exit from the EU, that will allow British Citizens to retain their European Citizenship if they desire.",
