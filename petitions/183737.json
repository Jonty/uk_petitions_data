        "additional_details": "1. Neither HM Government nor the President had raised the possibility of an address to Parliament. Mr Bercow\u2019s comments are therefore a gratuitous insult to the Head of State of Britain\u2019s closest ally. \r\n2. Mr Bercow made his statement without any reference to the Lord Speaker or the Foreign Office, which conducts our foreign relations.\r\n3. Mr Bercow has previously been happy to invite world leaders whose words and actions have been far more abhorrent than anything Mr Trump may have said or done.",
        "background": "On 6 February, the Speaker of the House of Commons made a statement opposing the US President being invited to address Parliament during his planned State Visit. He made hostile comments concerning the President\u2019s character and policy positions. These actions were an abuse of the Speaker\u2019s office.",
