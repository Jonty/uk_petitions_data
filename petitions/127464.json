        "action": "Ban plastic shopping bags for a greener UK",
        "additional_details": "Plastic shopping bags are a huge source of pollution and have a severely negative impact on the planet's ecosystem, with few redeeming advantages. Even some African countries, not to mention other European countries like Italy, have already imposed bans on plastic shopping bags with great success. Banning plastic shopping bags would enable the UK to greatly reduce its carbon footprint and ecological impact on the planet in an simple and cost free method.",
        "background": "Plastic waste is a huge ecological issue today. 6kg of CO2 emissions are produced per kg of plastic. Plastic bags are not disposed of properly and pollute our ecosystem by clogging sewers, taking up landfill site space, and ending up in lakes, rivers and oceans killing animals and birds.",
