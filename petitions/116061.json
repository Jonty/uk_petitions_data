        "action": "Accelerate the pace of greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the UK",
        "additional_details": "With the historic international agreement on climate change reached at COP21 in Paris, the UK has committed to \"global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible\", with \"developed countries taking the lead\". However, the Committee on Climate Change has stated that \"action is needed in this Parliament to ensure the pace of emissions reduction accelerates\". Clearly there is a now a gap between our international obligations and domestic action, and this needs to be urgently addressed.",
        "background": "To support the Paris agreement on climate change, the UK must: enact immediate measures to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies; increase public & private investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and low carbon technologies; decarbonise the transport system; and promote sustainable consumption.",
