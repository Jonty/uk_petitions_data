        "additional_details": "In the UK in 2015, there were 700 000 attacks and 24 043 rapes. At least half of these could have had a less brutal outcome had the victim had a good level of self defence knowledge. For example, in 2012 in Manchester, a 22 year old lady was able to fight off her attacker as she had her own martial arts school and so was able to respond effectively.\r\nMy own brother, having been verbally and physically bullied for four years, was able to put a stop to it by taking up kickboxing.  ",
        "background": "I propose introducing classes where students learn techniques such as disarming an attacker and how to get out of holds, as this knowledge could one day save their life. I think this would be best incorporated into primary schools so we can learn this from a young age.  ",
