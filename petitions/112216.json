There is nothing that can prevent a baby or child from having a heart defect but heart screening should be made an essential at every unborn baby scan, it is only a requirement if there is family history but this is not always the case. Also every doctors surgery should have a paeds sats monitor and make it a required neonatal/baby protocol ",

If an In depth heart scan was done or if the doctors surgery had a sats machine we could have got our little girl to hospital sooner. ",
