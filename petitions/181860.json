        "additional_details": "Pregnancy and maternity discrimination is subtle by nature. For new and expectant mothers, dealing with this can be overwhelming. Many women won\u2019t have the strength to tackle the issue immediately. Attempting to deal with this could put the health of the mother and unborn child at risk.\r\n\r\nA 6 month time-limit would give mothers that little bit of breathing space. Help us reach 100,000 signatures so the 54,000 women a year who lose their jobs for being pregnant have greater access to justice.",
        "background": "Mothers are being let down.The Equality and Human Rights Commission reported that 77% of women had experienced discrimination in the workplace due to pregnancy or maternity. However, a restrictive time-limit of 3 months is one of the reasons less than 1% of these are pursued to Tribunal. #GiveMeSix",
