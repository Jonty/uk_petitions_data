        "additional_details": "The prison service is in crisis. The service hasn't seen a pay rise in years and due to increased pension contributions, has actually seen staff have pay cuts and earn less than they did 10 years ago. The current imbalance on pay means new officers earn 5 thousand pounds less than old terms and condition officers, for doing the same job, the most dangerous in this country, except in the south east! It's a national service with national pay, all grades should be equal and increased inline with inflation, nationally.",
        "background": "The government have increased new prison officers pay on Fair & Sustainable contracts to be inline with old officers pay in the south east! This is a divide & conquer tactic and should be rolled out across all fair and sustainable officers nationally! It is a national service!",
