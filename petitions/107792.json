        "additional_details": "Many high ranking ministers also see the foolishness of this program, I believe the the governement should step in an prove it is able to control the greed of the NHS and the chief executives and promote ingenuity if funding is short.\r\nA greedy society, will breed greedy people and a contempt for authority. We should be sensitive to families whose families are in critical care and not impose costs and fines for caring about loved ones, it is moraly and socially unjustifiable.",
        "background": "Visiting families is a right, many hospitals are already located in areas where parking is controlled rigorously by local councils. Visiting seriously ill family carries a burden, made a lot wise by uncaring traffic wardens and Hospital staff.\r\nCan society really ignore this trait further.",
