        "action": "Recognise and allow for psychological assistance dogs in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The onset of psychosis and recovery left me feeling uneasy being in public on my own. The anxiety I felt was crippling and I lost a lot of my social life during this time. In situations where I am expected to cope with more spontaneous or unusual trips, I still find the anxiety coming on.\r\nIn these situations the benefit of a service dog would be incalculable. This country has come a long way in the understanding and treatment of mental illness, but there\u2019s a long way still to go.\r\n",
        "background": "In the UK there is no government backed scheme that provides service dogs for those who suffer mental illness. There is no legislation to allow any animal serving as a therapy or psychological assistance to have the same access rights to public places as guide dogs or physical assistance dogs.",
