        "action": "Keep open the 'Dubs scheme' to resettle 3000 unaccompanied refugee children.",
        "additional_details": "The 'Dubs scheme' is named after Lord Dubs, who got an amendment to the Immigration Act passed last year. His amendment did not specify a number of children, but campaigners made clear that thousands of vulnerable refugee children were stranded and alone, and called on the UK government to help up to 3000 of them. Announcing that the scheme will only help 350 children - about one for every local authority - is a callous, inhumane act which leaves children at huge risk of deprivation and abuse.",
        "background": "The Home Office has announced that the 'Dubs scheme' to resettle unaccompanied refugee children in the UK will close after just 350 children are helped. At the time of its creation, campaigners called for it to aid 3000 children. The UK is turning its back on the most vulnerable people in the world.",
