        "additional_details": "Leading campaigners\r\n1. made representations about the supposed benefits of\r\nleaving that they have now admitted were false\r\n2. irresponsibly dismissed the warnings of experts about the effects of leaving, such as the financial turmoil already occurring\r\n3. failed to warn of the divisive effect of a vote\r\nto leave, particularly its potential for breaking up the United Kingdom\r\n4. despite this, may now form the government of what remains of the UK, if the 1st referendum is allowed to stand",
        "background": "The result of the first referendum cannot be seen as containing informed democratic advice fit to guide the government, because of the quality of the information provided by campaign leaders. It should be rerun or parliament should decide on our behalf after principled and honest debate\r\n",
