I'd like to clarify that this petition  calls for NO trade deal and NO customs union with the European Union and i would like the government to take this call into account.",
        "background": "Having recently seen the petition to 'ensure that the U.K. leaves the EU single market & customs union.' I can't help but think that the Government is playing semantic games in it's response so I would like to reiterate a position.",
