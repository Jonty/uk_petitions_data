        "additional_details": "This brutality based only on a person\u2019s religion was seen in the concentration camps of the Second World War. At the time, we didn\u2019t know what would happen; we can no longer hide behind this excuse. The developing system bought holocaust victims time; now there is a perfectly working system to use, and it is being used. Surely, we owe it to the survivors and the victims of the Nazi regime not to forget and to do something about it when we see such atrocities emerging again.",
        "background": "Re-education camps in China force Uyghur Muslims to go against their religion, eating pork and drinking alcohol; escapees described torture and beatings. Response to a petition in November 2018 stated; \u201cWe have raised it at senior Ministerial level and at the UN.\u201d There has been no further action.",
