The man I bought off refuses to give details of his agent. I wanted to rescue and give love to a poor lost soul but he was very very poorly and heavily under nourished. The veterinary surgeon was disgusted. I want all puppy farms closed down. People heavily fined and long jail sentences given . This barbaric farming of dogs for quick cash needs to STOP !",
        "background": "Puppy farming in UK and worldwide is becoming more & more common. Badly treated under nourished dogs are being bred in disgusting inhumane conditions and after approx 4 years are shot dead as too old. Dirty cages.no food. Female dogs are constantly pregnant and kept in cages too small & crammed high",
