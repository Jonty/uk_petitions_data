        "additional_details": "All emergency services work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, all year round. Sometimes the government calls upon them to work extended tours of duty, taking them away from their loved ones and friends at short notice. It is often the case that the overtime that is earnt in these situations is heavily taxed. Emergency service personnel do not have a choice of they are kept on or have to work late due to an incident. This money should not be taxed as heavily as it is, every penny is well earnt.",
        "background": "Emergency services personnel work hard to make sure the people of Britain remain safe. However, this sometimes comes at a cost as they work extra days and are off late having to give up time with their friends and families in order to maintain peace, order and more importantly keeping everyone safe.",
