        "additional_details": "To stop the printing of child abuse and half dead children on cigarette packaging. It\u2019s absolutely absurd that this would even be considered. Let alone commissioned within the UK. How this would benefit anyone I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s basically forcing people to look at these images. And should not be legal. It shows the mentality that plagues the English governing system today.",
        "background": "The pictures are explicit pictures of children on the packaging of cigarettes and tobbaco. There is also one of an adult blowing smoke into a baby\u2019s face. People have to look at these pictures in their everyday life and can be traumatising for many people.",
