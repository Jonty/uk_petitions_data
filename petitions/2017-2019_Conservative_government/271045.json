        "additional_details": "The government is pushing the environmental recycling agenda with plastics but there is no provision for car seats which are made up of mainly plastic which manufacturers also create expiry dates for.\r\n\r\nThey encourage us to buy new for safety but then that leaves us with a lot of baby/child seats to throw away after use.",
        "background": "As parents we can easily get through up to 5 car seats/booster seats through a child's lifetime and are encouraged not to use secondhand for safety reasons but we currently have no way to recycle them so they end up going into landfill.",
