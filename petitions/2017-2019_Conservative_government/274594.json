        "additional_details": "Prorogation marks the end of a parliamentary session. It is the formal name given to the period between the end of a session of Parliament and the State Opening of Parliament that begins the next session.\r\nThis power can be used without cross-Party support or acknowledgement from either House, this opens avenues to deeply un-Democratic practices. This power needs to be limited so both or either Houses need to consent to the date and length of the prorogation.",
        "background": "The power to prorogue (suspend) the parliament lies in the hand of the Government and the Privy Council, the ongoing legal case might start a precedent where it will be used more frequently and for political purposes which will erode our democracy",
