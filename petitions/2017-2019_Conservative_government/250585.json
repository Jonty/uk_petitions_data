        "action": "Make free sanitary products available in all secondary schools in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "One in ten girls cannot afford sanitary products. As many as one in four girls have missed school because they're too embarrassed to attend whilst menstruating with no protection. They feel ashamed and dirty. Girls should be in school getting an education. Periods should not be dictating lives! We want to see every secondary school in the UK issued with free sanitary dispensers, ending the misery of period poverty and giving every girl the confidence and freedom to just get on with their lives.",
        "background": "Socks, kitchen roll and toilet paper are being used by thousands of young women and girls in the UK during their period, purely because they cannot afford to buy pads or tampons. This is not 1919, this is the 21st century! It's bloody madness! Help us end period poverty now by giving your support.",
