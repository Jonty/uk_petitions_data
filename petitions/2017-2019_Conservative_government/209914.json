        "additional_details": "They both lied from the start to cover up the true reason for her injuries. They delayed seeking treatment causing her months of suffering. The injuries were intentional against a totally defenceless  baby and were sustained over a period of time, not just a one off incidence. They have shown no remorse and actually went out partying to celebrate the delay of the case. The sentence is wholly inadequate given the child's suffering, which will no doubt be life-long. This sentence is shameful and certainly no deterrent to anyone considering similar abuse.",

However their sentences do not reflect the child's life long injuries and 3 months worth of suffering. Injuries included broken ribs a fractured skull and broken arm\r\nHe was charged with 4 years and her 2",
