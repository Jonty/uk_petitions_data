        "additional_details": "Many women do not realise that despite alternatives to conjugated oestrogen based HRT being widely available, (eg estradiol, estrone and estriol), they are being prescribed a product which is derived through incredible cruelty to horses.  Brand names using pregnant mares' urine which are prescribed on the NHS are Premarin, Prempak-C and Premique, produced by Pfizer.  In addition to Canada they are now contracting with PMU farms in Poland,China, and Kazakhstan with even lower welfare standards",
        "background": "Conjugated Oestrogen is produced in Canada, by confining pregnant horses in narrow tie stalls for 6 months of the year with a urine collection harness in place. It is an inhumane life for an animal designed to be in near constant motion.   Many of the resulting foals are slaughtered as a by product.",
