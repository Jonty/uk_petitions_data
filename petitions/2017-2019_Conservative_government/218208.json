        "additional_details": "China has the second largest economy in the World but the UK is allowing China to flood the UK selling through platforms such as Amazon and ebay etc.  This is extremely harmful to UK businesses who are faced with much high postal rates just to send parcels domestically/inland.  The International Postal Treaty must be ended immediately in relation to China to safeguard British business.",
        "background": "China is classified as a developing country by the UK and receives subsidised postal rates from the Royal Mail under the International Postal Treaty. These rates means that Chinese companies can send parcels to the UK for less than a 1p a parcel.",

We think that you're concerned about the current rules under the UN's Universal Postal Union, but we're not sure what you mean by \"End International Postal Treaty with China.\" \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Government to urge the UN to change the rules on postal rates."
