        "action": "The rule that students not being able to wear makeup needs to have flexibility.",
        "additional_details": "Teachers argue against this because makeup affects students education, despite students are being told to take there makeup off during school hours and when students refuse to remove makeup they are missing lessons by being put in detentions/isolations. Schools could have lessons at breaks/lunches for students who want to wear makeup to explain to students what makeup is allowed to be worn, how much and how to apply it.",
        "background": "Wearing makeup makes students feel confident because they are hiding those blemishes that put them down. Some students have blemishes and don\u2019t feel confident unless they can cover them up. I do understand that they\u2019re rules but the point I\u2019m trying to make is that this rule should have flexibility.",
