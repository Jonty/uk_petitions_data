        "additional_details": "I have seen my younger brothers use their Christmas/Birthday money to be rewarded with nothing worth while because of the profusely low probabilities in FIFA \"packs\". Which is why this petition is important to me.\r\n\r\nWhen Belgium introduced its loot box ban last year it defined the practice as an \u201cillegal game of chance.\u201d EA was defiant, and said loot boxes were not a form of gambling and that its games were \u201cdeveloped and implemented ethically and lawfully around the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nPLEASE SIGN/SHARE.",
        "background": "FIFA points are an in game currency on EA sports' football game that can grant an unfair in game advantage. In some cases children are spending huge sums of money for limited reward. In Belgium it was ruled that the FIFA points system was a form of gambling and was banned in early 2019.",
