        "action": "Make the video recording of PIP and ESA assessments mandatory.",
        "additional_details": "The DWP rely on assessors supplying accurate reports of PIP and ESA face-to-face assessments, many reports contain errors and false or inaccurate statements of events. This leads the DWP to reject a claim or make lower awards than the claimant is entitled to. A claimant may then have to request a mandatory reconsideration or appeal. A video recording of the assessment could help stop errors and would provide a point of reference to DWP staff and appeals panels.",
        "background": "Many PIP and ESA claims are being rejected by the DWP due to errors being made by assessors in their reporting of face-to-face assessments. A video recording of the assessment would assist Claimants, the DWP and appeal panels by giving an indisputable record of the assessment.",
