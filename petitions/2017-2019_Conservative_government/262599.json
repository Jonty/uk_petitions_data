        "action": "Stop the Hong Kong SAR government from enacting the China extradition law",
        "additional_details": "The bill will also remove the legislature\u2019s power to scrutinise such extradition arrangements, thereby centralising the decision-making to the executives.\r\n\r\nThis controversial bill would allow the authorities in mainland China to arrest people in Hong Kong, or even confiscate their properties, through issuing extradition requests to the Hong Kong government.\r\n\r\nThe UK govt should stop China from extraordinary rendition to protect 300,000 valid British citizens and British nationals (overseas) here.",
        "background": "The Hong Kong govt has proposed a bill to amend the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, which will allow the govt to extradite fugitives to countries without extradition agreements with HK, including mainland China. Prisons are inhumane, court trials are unfair and the death penalty is rampant there.",
