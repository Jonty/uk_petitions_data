        "action": "Permit the use and control of Fireworks including Pyrotechnics to be licenced",
        "additional_details": "Lots of People on the Autism Spectrum, Animals and many more people and things suffer from the noise of Fireworks, They get set off weeks before Bonfire night when Bonfire Night should be the 5th of November and not on any other day. The risks of people holding Fireworks without a licence is more of a risk than someone who has been trained on how to use Fireworks and Pyrotechnics. Fireworks can easily catch fire and I urge the Government to change this legislation",
        "background": "As a Trained Fire Marshal, I am against Fireworks being used before Bonfire Night, I would like the Government to consider the current position on Fireworks to only to be let off on bonfire night. I would like only Licenced events to have Fireworks permitted to them under the Law",
