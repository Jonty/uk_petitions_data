        "action": "Establish \"fit and proper\" tests for football club ownership",
        "additional_details": "There have been a number of ownership issues in recent years which have led to huge financial problems. Players and staff haven't been paid for months and league fixtures are not being fulfilled. Many football clubs have been at the centre of communities for over 100 years, and without an overhaul of the ownership test, it's only a matter of time before we see more football clubs ceasing to exist. The FA and EFL seem powerless to prevent this so it's time the Government stepped in.",
        "background": "I'd like to call on the Government to set out \"fit and proper\" tests for football club ownership in law, taking the responsibility away from the FA and EFL. The current test is not fit for purpose and the football authorities are not prioritising the improvement of this crucial process.",
