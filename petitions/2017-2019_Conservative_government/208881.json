It does not lie directly, relying on selective omission, repeating favoured politicians' inaccuracies and evasions without challenge and ignoring or behaving aggressively towards the non orthodox. Currently the BBC displays right wing bias; in the past it has been accused of left wing bias.  Licence fee levels must not be changed other than by primary legislation.",

Neither commercial interests, nor governments and government agencies can be trusted as guardians of the truth. A public service broadcaster is required which covers current affairs without a bias towards 'orthodox' opinion.",
