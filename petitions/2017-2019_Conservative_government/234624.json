For MPs to refrain from going against the will of the voting public whose desire is to leave the European Union as shown by the results of the referendum held on 23rd June 2016.\r\n2. That MPs respect and abide by the outcome of the referendum.\r\n\r\nFailure to abide by 1 and 2 will lead the voting public to hold all MPs, from every party, responsible as it  will clearly signify the death of democracy in the UK.",
