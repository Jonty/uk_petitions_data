        "additional_details": "Fellow commander on the raid, SAS Major Roy Farran, wrote Lees MC citation, hailing his \"gallantry, initiative and unequalled courage.\" While both commanders may have disobeyed orders in proceeding with the raid, they did so believing it was the right decision on the ground. Farran was duly awarded the Legion of Merit for the raid and foremost SAS commander Bob Walker-Brown hailed it as, \"One of the most dangerous and effective ever undertaken by this Regiment.\" Lees MC should be reinstated.",
        "background": "Michael Lees of SOE commanded the spring '45 mission to destroy the key German Army HQ in Italy, with the aim of shortening the war and saving Allied lives.  Leading from the front he was shot five times but miraculously survived. Written up for a Military Cross at war's end, it was wrongly denied.",
