Also viewing the horrific and unimaginable stories on the recent Madeleine McCann documentary which highlights in graphic and chilling detail the extent of these most horrifying of crimes that as we speak are being perpetrated against young and vulnerable children across the UK and the globe. This most evil of crimes requires innovative ideas, funding and support from central government.",

More needs to be done and NOW.",
