HMRC seem more interested in winding-up their small businesses than helping them. British businesses help the local community, they provide jobs and training, they can provide travel and tourism...they could easily provide HMRC with income for the improvement of the country, or at least they could if things were made easier for them.",
        "background": "VAT is a huge issue in the UK, yet the answer is so simple. The moment a company hits \u00a385,000.01 in turnover, they have to pay a staggering 20%. If VAT were staggered at 5, 10, 15 then 20%, more businesses would be able to pay. If more businesses were able to pay, HMRC would end up better off.",
