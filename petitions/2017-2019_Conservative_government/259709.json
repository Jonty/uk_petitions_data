        "action": "Compensate tenants for appointments missed by council and landlord repairers",
        "additional_details": "However, the tenant is expected to wait in throughout, for what may only be a brief repair. Yet when tenants take unpaid days off work in order to meet these appointments, and repairers then do not attend, (sometimes not even contacting the tenant to inform them of the cancellation) tenants have no recourse for reimbursement of their lost earnings. This is unfair.\r\nMake it law that tenants be compensated for missed appointments: equal to the fine or the lost earnings, whichever is greater.",
        "background": "Many councils, and some private landlords, now levy a 'missed appointment charge' when tenants are not at home to allow repairers access. Basically, a fine. Appointments are usually scheduled by councils or their trades-persons for either the whole morning, the whole afternoon or even a whole day.",
