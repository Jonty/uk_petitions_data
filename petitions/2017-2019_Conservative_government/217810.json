        "action": "Ban unsustainable palm oil from all products sold in UK supermarkets",
        "additional_details": "I witnessed this deforestation first hand in Borneo. According to the World Wildlife Fund, an area the equivalent size of 300 football fields of rainforest is cleared each hour to make way for palm oil production. Findings show that if nothing changes species like the orangutan, our closest relative, could become extinct in the wild within the next 5-10 years.  Currently, 30% of all mammal species in Indonesia are considered to be critically endangered due to our incessant demand for palm oil.",
        "background": "Palm oil is used in over half the products we consume in the UK, 85% of which is produced and exported from Indonesia and Malaysia. Unsustainable production through mass deforestation has led to habitat degradation, climate change, animal cruelty and extinction and indigenous rights abuses.",
