        "action": "Give the people a final say on Brexit in a Referendum vs Remaining in the EU",
        "additional_details": "Currently there are two large groups of voters who never got a say in the 2016 referendum - any British citizen living in the EU and people now aged 18-21 who were not 18 in 2016. These people should be allowed the opportunity to vote. We all know a lot more about what Brexit will mean for the UK and everyone should be allowed to vote with this new information, either for the Brexit deal or to Remain in the EU.",
        "background": "Over 3 years have passed since the 2016 referendum. Brexit has moved from a vague idea with broken promises to a real and workable deal that is likely to be damaging to the UK economy. This final deal is only one of many options presented in 2016 so should go back to the people for a final say.",
