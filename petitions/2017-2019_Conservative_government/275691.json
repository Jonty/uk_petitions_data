        "additional_details": "Through a clinic it will cost thousands of pounds, only way we can get help from nhs is if we have tried 6 times at a clinic which is a lot of money. We think same sex couples should be entitled to some help from the nhs from the start of trying to Conceive am not saying it should be free but some help would go a long way. We didn\u2019t ask to be gay. If people out there can get help with stuff like boob jobs, nose jobs etc on nhs for free why can\u2019t we get help. It gets us feeling down and stressed feeling like we will never be able to have a baby of our own just because of how much it will cost through a clinic.",
        "background": "Am a 29year old female in a same sex marriage me and my wife have been married just over two years and been together over 7years and we would love to have a baby of our own it\u2019s been something we have been wanting for ages. Just like any other couple we would like to experience having our own baby.",
