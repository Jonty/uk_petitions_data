        "additional_details": "It is much better for the temptation to not even be there than trust the person driving to adhere to the current UK laws prohibiting mobile phone use whilst driving. Wouldn't you rather know that it's impossible to do than trust someone not to kill your child? Or to trust your child not to kill someone?\r\n\r\nMobile phone use 2017:\r\nUK - 33 fatalities, 90 serious injuries (neither include pedestrians) plus hundreds of lives ruined of loved ones, witnesses, support workers etc",
        "background": "The UK should make it a legal requirement for mobile phone companies to disable a screen for anybody driving a car. \r\nThe mobile phone makers and app makers purposely make their products addictive, making it more difficult for drivers to resist.\r\nThe technology is available, they just won't use it.",
