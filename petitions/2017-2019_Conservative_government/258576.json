        "additional_details": "Every year in the UK, an estimated 8.5 billion plastic straws are used. Adding up to 130 straws per person every year in the UK. The national geographic has estimated that 0.025% of plastic thrown into the sea is plastic straws each year. By giving people the choice to buy metal straws, we can lower that percentage.",
        "background": "To help reduce the amount of plastic straws people buy in bulk. Large superstores should sell metal straws. It\u2019s rare to see them off the internet, so by having them sold in stores (like Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrison\u2019s) many people would have a chance to buy and help reduce plastic waste.",
