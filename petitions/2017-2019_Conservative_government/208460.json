        "additional_details": "It is now essential to reduce the cost of travel in this area.  East ham is a zone 3 yet the amount of passengers that start and finish their journey at Barking is significant more than East Ham.\r\n\r\nThe population of barking is increasing at a rapid rate and the amount of people commuting to and from there is reaching unprecedented levels.\r\n\r\nThe cost of a monthly zone 1-4 travel in 2018 will be 181.20 and the cost of a 1-3 will be 153.60.  Obviously the rezoning of barking station will be welcome.",
        "background": "More than 12.7 million journeys either began or ended at Barking Station last year.   There is an obvious shift eastwards in London and there is a significant amount of regeneration going on in Barking with a new shopping mall also being planned.",
