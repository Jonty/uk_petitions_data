        "additional_details": "Being a democracy, UK citizens and her political leaders and institutions can run effective campaigns for or against the two choices.  Now that facts, risks and consequences are better understood than the previous referendum,  the outcome will be better, as the will of the people. It also can't in anyway be detrimental to the outcome of the first, if indeed that was the will of the people. It can only affirm the first referendum was defective in its construct, got wrong answer to wrong question.",
        "background": "It appears the PMs deal with EU is the only deal acceptable to the EU as of now. The parliament, being a representative body shall not be doing any damage if they approve the only deal and check same with the people they represent. Together with an option to remain, a referendum is in order.",
