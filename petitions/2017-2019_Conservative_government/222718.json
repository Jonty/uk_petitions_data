        "action": "Cancel Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom",
        "additional_details": "The UK government is by no means leading the way in terms of our treatment of migrants and citizens (as the recent 'Windrush' scandal has shown). However, for us to go ahead with the state visit of Donald Trump is a gesture to the rest of the world that we value economic benefit over and above the humane treatment of others. It is vitally important that we show President Trump that the racially divisive actions and rhetoric that is encouraging are not welcome in the United Kingdom.",
        "background": "Donald Trump's imprisonment of thousands of migrant children that have been separated from their families is one of the most appalling acts ever committed by a U.S. President. The UK government should cancel his visit to this country, to show the world that we do not support or condone such actions.",
