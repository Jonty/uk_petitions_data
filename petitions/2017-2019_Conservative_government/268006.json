        "additional_details": "Education in the UK has evolved not through considered and careful design, but through a series of ill-conceived and oft-reversed policies by successive governments that have left us with a messy and ineffective system which perpetuates and exacerbates its own weaknesses while reproducing and legitimising the complex social divisions and inequalities embedded therein. Remove political meddling and harness the incredible insight and knowledge from actual educators and other leading experts.",
        "background": "Education ought to and must become apolitical; we call for powers to be devolved to an independent, democratically elected body that can reform and govern the education system with the purpose of making the UK global leaders in education.",
