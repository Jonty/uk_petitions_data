For example, you could start a new petition asking for the Government or Parliament to fund the MHRA to spot-test 10% of all insulin, glucose meters, pumps, CGMs, and other critical diabetes treatments supplied in the UK and to introduce large fines and serious criminal penalties for manufacturers found to be non-compliant with standards, if that's what you'd like to happen.
