In addition, over 150 parliamentarians from both Houses signed a letter calling for an \u201cinsurance policy\" to grant second citizenship or right of abode in other commonwealth countries to Hongkongers.\r\n\r\nAs Brexit is expected in the near future, it is the golden opportunity for the UK to right the wrong and show  that the UK stands with Hong Kong to uphold universal values.",
