        "action": "Stop PIN protection on TV content for households with no minors.",
        "additional_details": "The PIN input ruins an expensive pay TV experience, and is not necessary in a lot of households, & also takes away parental responsibility from restricting viewing. There is a high likelihood that households with minors will share a PIN, so this control serves very little purpose apart from ruining TV services.",
        "background": "OFCOM insists that PIN protection is implemented on all pay TV services which show age restricted material before their respective watershed. This leads to films rated 12 requiring PIN input before 20:00, and so on. For households that do not have any minors living in them, this is a major hindrance",
