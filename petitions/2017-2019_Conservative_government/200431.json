        "additional_details": "Grandchildren & Grandparents, as close blood relatives, should have automatic contact within the confines of safeguarding. We should consider a child centred approach where a child has enjoyed safe and regular contact. It is damaging & harmful to deny this, and results in the child's rights not being exercised (Ref: UN Convention article 12). Grandparents should not have to force contact via the courts. This is expensive & traumatic for all involved. We should follow the example set by France.",
        "background": "Although they are greatly affected and often left scarred, children's views are not taken into account when the parent/s decide to end family contact. I now have no contact with my Grandson, who I know will be anxious, hurt, and confused by this. Give children a voice.",

For example, you could start a new petition asking Parliament or Government to change the law so that grandparents can apply for contact with their grandchildren without needing the leave of the court."
