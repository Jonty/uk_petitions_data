This is free for people who receive Disability Living Allowance and has an exemption from paying vehicle tax as a result. However anyone in my position is still required to pay due to being too old to apply for Disability Living Allowance.",

For example, I\u2019m disabled but too old to qualify for disability living allowance which means I can\u2019t use the Dartford river crossing for free.",
