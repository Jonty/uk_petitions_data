        "additional_details": "In the UK, human rights are protected by the Human Rights Act 1998. The Act gives effect to the human rights set out in the European Convention on Human Rights.\r\n\r\nArticle 8 - the right to respect for your family and private life, is one the rights protected by the Human Rights Act. The Spouse visa law fails this as the law requires sponsors to be earning \u00a318,600 whereas the minimum wage delivers earnings of approximately \u00a313,500. This law doesn't respect family life and we want to see a change!",
        "background": "Spouse visa laws are heartless, they mount to an injustice and it could be argued they mount to a violation of the European convention on Human Rights, a convention the UK was bound by when this policy was introduced by Theresa May as Home Secretary in 2012.",
