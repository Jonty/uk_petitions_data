        "additional_details": "The Abortion Act of 1967 legalised abortion on certain grounds in Great Britain, but this did not extend to Northern Ireland. Women are risking their lives procuring illegal abortions, or incurring great expense travelling for the procedure.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, the High Court in Belfast ruled that Northern Ireland\u2019s law on abortion was not compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, as it lacks provision for cases of fatal foetal abnormality, and pregnancies caused through rape or incest.",
        "background": "It is currently illegal to have an abortion in Northern Ireland, under laws dating back to the Offences against the Person Act 1861.\r\nWomen are being put in desperate situations by these laws, sometimes risking their lives to end a pregnancy. Our government should ensure a woman's right to choose.",
