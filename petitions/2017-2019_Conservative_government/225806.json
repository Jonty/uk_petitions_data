        "additional_details": "It is virtually impossible to find a home at the price the government claims is available for renting. Recipients are penalised for renting a place with two beds, even when one beds are limited, and many people cannot meet the cost of rent in this country. This is forcing many people into homelessness and rewarding greedy private landlords, while many renters are trying to meet excess costs out of their limited finances. Market value is not being taken into account where Housing Benefits are concerned.  Social Housing and cheap, good homes are not available, and market costs are ridiculously high, resulting in a dismal market, and a head in the clouds response from the government in tackling the housing crisis on all levels. Raise the level of Housing Benefit in line with the market.",
        "background": "The benefits system offers a miserly level of rent , expecting recipients to  manage in a housing market with prices far outstripping the benefit available.",
