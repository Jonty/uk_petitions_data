        "action": "Make selling and homing hamsters in a cage less than 80x50cm illegal.",
        "additional_details": "Our current animal welfare laws are designed to prevent suffering and yet so many hamsters are sold every day who will stay in tiny cages with little to no enrichment. \r\nThey are not throwaway pets, they are living, breathing creatures and they should be protected by law. These cages should only be marketed as carry/temporary cages and never as a habitat.\r\nHamsters are one of the most neglected pets but there are so few laws and guidelines protecting them.\r\nIf you care about animals, sign this.",
        "background": "If you go to a pet store you'll see cute, tiny little cages marketed at hamsters. These cages are way bellow the 80x50cm minimum set by the RSPCA and yet it is perfectly legal for a store to sell these type of cages.",
