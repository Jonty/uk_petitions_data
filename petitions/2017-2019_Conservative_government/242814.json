Willingly travelled to Syria and lived there for many years. she has expressed a  fondness for live there. now with her citizenship being revoked and rightly so and Bangladesh and Holland refusing her entry the best course of action is to pressure the Syrian government to grant her citizenship. this will allow her to continue living the life she has been accustomed to in these last few years allowing her to remain with her child and husband. Turkey should also be considered",
