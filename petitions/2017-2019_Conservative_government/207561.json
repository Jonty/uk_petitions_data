        "action": "Home office investigation into Surrey Police targeting an innocent child of 12",
        "additional_details": "Currently the IPCC and Police & Crime Commissioner do not investigate complaints or obtain records where the police have self-investigated/cleared themselves. There is no system that protects innocent people from poor backgrounds/ethnic minorities & due to government cuts no legal aid is available. Innocent law-abiding citizens who find themselves on the receiving end cannot access justice & may find themselves with a criminal record without any wrong doing. The UK must not become a police state",
        "background": "Surrey Police targeted an innocent 12 year old child on school premises & we call on the UK Government to repeal the Police Powers that allow them to block complaints by withholding records. In the light of the Hillsborough tragedy where records were withhold for 27 years urgent reform is required",
