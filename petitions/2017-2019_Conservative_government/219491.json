        "action": "Introduce a White History Month to celebrate achievements & learn from mistakes.",
        "additional_details": "We live in an era of virtue signalling & guilt trips. White people are told that white privilege is real & profound. However, with big demographic changes taking place due to open borders & birth-rates, many white folks feel like a minority in towns & cities. Resentment & fear is up. No-one knows what 'British Values' are. The subtext espoused by educators & the media of the Empire legacy is negative & obsessed with politicianry. Most inventions & institutions the world over stem from this Island.",
        "background": "We've had a Black History Month for years now but with many white people unaware of their own history with cultural & historical confusions due to political correctness, it's time for White History Month to help bring racial & religious harmony given that multi-culturalism has failed to assimilate.",
