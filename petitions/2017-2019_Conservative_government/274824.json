        "action": "No trade deal with Brazil until deforestation of the Amazon rainforest stops.",
        "additional_details": "The Amazon rainforest absorbs millions of tons of carbon emissions every year. When those trees are cut down or burned, they release the carbon they were storing, and a vial tool to absorb carbon emissions also disappears. President Bolsonaro has relaxed fines on illegal forest clearance and is unwilling to accept the G7's help with managing wildfires, instead accusing them of undermining his sovereignty. The UK must lead global efforts to ensure the Amazon is protected for future generations.",
        "background": "Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest is at its highest rate in a decade, dramatically undermining our ability to prevent climate change. The Brazilian Government is responsible for one of earth's most vital resources- until they take that responsibility seriously the UK should not do a trade deal.",
