        "action": "Revoke the Royal Charter, Abolish TV Licence & all tax paying funding of the BBC",
        "additional_details": "Numerous occasions over the years, the BBC has distorted events & news, falsely edited news films & false reporting specifically to show events or news items in a different light; more towards their own specific agenda.  This has become more profound on EU funding & Brexit.  In such, they have shown more towards one side of the argument (Remain), have falsified events/news, and have consistently shown Brexit in a negative light instead of a fair, truthful & impartial journalistic manner.",
        "background": "The BBC is a public funded service organisation but no longer serves its purpose. The BBC is supposed to act in the public interest, serving impartial, fair and unbiased news & media.  We no longer wish our taxes to be used for their lies and propaganda.  Remove all Government funding as well.",
