        "additional_details": "Our school have described 99% attendance as a \u2018special achievement that deserves reward\u2019 \r\nThey have also stated that it would be unfair to not reward it just for the sake of upsetting those children who didn\u2019t achieve it. \r\nWe have been told we should manage their expectations if we know they won\u2019t achieve high attendance. \r\nThey count all illness and medical appointments as absence. Even my child having a life threatening illness was taken off her attendance for the year",
        "background": "Recently one of my three children were rewarded with a trip to the coast - fully funded by the primary school, because she had 99+ attendance - yet my children who both suffer with chronic health conditions - were excluded due to lower attendance. \r\nThis is discrimination towards vulnerable children",
