Tax avoidance is a problem of globalisation and needs to be tackled on an international basis. To have high quality services we need tax revenues.",
        "background": "The EU has created the ATAD to ensure that the burden of supporting services through taxation falls fairly on individuals and businesses. Employed people have no choice but to pay tax but some individuals and corporations avoid paying their share by exploiting loopholes and tax havens",
