Why should a single bad comment ruin the rest of a brilliant plan. Hopefully this will encourage Councils to be required to provide a minimum level of information into why community projects are removed, knowledge of who complained, and council by council voting and petitions to ensure a community ideal is kept",
        "background": "Mackie Park was given a swing by the community, however it was taken down to to a single complaint by someone in the community, while overwhelmingly the community feedback was positive. Why is negativity more important than positivity? It\u2019s the wrong message.",
