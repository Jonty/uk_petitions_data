        "additional_details": "If a mother was earning \u00a31,000 per week (gross) then she would be entitled to initial 6 weeks maternity pay of \u00a35,400 (\u00a31k X 90% X 6wks), compared to \u00a3892.08 under shared parental leave. \r\n\r\nThis can be a significant financial penalty for those looking to take shared parental leave and often means it is financial unviable to do so. This policy currently financially discriminates against mothers on an income higher than \u00a3148.68 per week looking to share leave.",
        "background": "Current maternity pay allows for a mother to receive 90% of their average pay for first 6 weeks of leave followed by \u00a3148.68 for the next 33 weeks.\r\n\r\nStatutory parental leave only pays \u00a3148.68 for the duration of 39 weeks.",
