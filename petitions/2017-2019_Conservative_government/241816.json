        "additional_details": "Bioptic driving began over 30 years ago in the US and is currently accepted in over 37 states as well as several European Countries, for both car and motorcycle licenses. Current UK standards for driving have taken away the freedom and independence of thousands of individuals that would otherwise pose no additional risk to road users. Consideration, in particular, should be given to those with stable non-progressive visual disorders, where Bioptics would allow them to meet the vision standard.",
        "background": "Bioptic Lenses are small optical scopes, that are mounted onto the spectacle frame, to help people with sight loss see extra detail in distant objects or texts. Often used to assist visually impaired individuals that still have a functional level of vision to complete everyday tasks such as driving.",
