Just as we do with the elections and just as we did with brexit!\r\n\r\nSign this petition, spread awareness and let's make a change!",
        "background": "Since 2011 Syrian families have been living in conflict. It's April 2018 and Syria still remains in conflict. \r\n\r\n7 years of murder, terrorism and extremism to such extent is unacceptable.\r\nTheresa may recently voted in to bomb Syria with deadly missiles along side the US and France. \r\nWE VOTE NO!!",
