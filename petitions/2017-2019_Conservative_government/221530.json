You could start a new petition calling on the Government to change this rate, or a petition asking for other changes to the way in which train fares are set, if that's what you want to happen.\r\n\r\nYou could also start a new petition asking the UK Government and Parliament to change the rules to make rail franchises refund train fares if the journey is delayed for more than a certain amount of time, if that's what you'd like to happen. \r\n\r\n"
