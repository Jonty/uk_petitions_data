        "additional_details": "After the camps were visited by Democrats from the House of Representatives, it emerged that people are being forced to drink from toilets, woken at random hours, degraded by officers, and denied access to basic human rights.\r\n\r\nWith Brexit looming nearer we are finding ourselves dependent on the US for trade and much more, but can we really live with ourselves if we don\u2019t speak out against a humanitarian crisis that is only set to escalate?",
        "background": "The UK government is yet to condemn the horrific treatment of people in the US Border Camps. Stripped of their Human Rights, they need our help.\r\n\r\nWhat will our government do to condemn these concentration camps and what action will they take to ensure this never becomes a reality in the UK?",
