        "additional_details": "Only 15% of sexual violence is reported to the police and approximately 90% of those who are raped know the perpetrator prior to the offence. \r\n\r\nA victim of a crime of this nature should be able to speak emotionally and freely in a safe space, with a counselor, without being worried about potential repercussions in court.",
        "background": "Approximately 85,000 women and 12,000 men are raped or sexually assaulted in England and Wales each year; that works out at roughly 11 assaults (of adults alone) every hour. \r\n\r\nThis petition is to stop access to victims' private counselling notes, by the defence, in rape and sexual assault cases.",
