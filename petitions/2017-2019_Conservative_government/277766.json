        "action": "There is strong protest for and against Brexit. A second referendum is needed.",
        "additional_details": "This comes at the cost of our national interests in other areas of domestic and foreign policy, as well as to our unity as the British public. We are now more divided than ever. The people of the United Kingdom must be reunited.\r\n\r\nOur public has clearly done as much thinking on the Brexit matter as have our politicians. Three years later, we now possess an array of positions, for and against. We must once again have the opportunity to be heard. \r\n\r\nA second referendum would help reconfirm or adjust the mandate of the Government and allow it to take new, meaningful steps towards a sustainable resolution of the contest.",
        "background": "After more than three years, the Government is failing to implement Brexit. Parliament and the public continues to engage in heated debate. Progress seems unlikely and politics at an impasse. We are weakened as a nation and a people.",
