Yet despite this, you must pay for these drugs either per item or via a PPC. The same is true for mental health medicines, which do save lives too.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d like the government to include more chronic illnesses in the list of conditions that qualify for free prescriptions in England.",
        "background": "Currently there are only a small number of medical conditions that qualify for free prescriptions in England. Asthma, COPD and mental health are not included, they should be. Yet these conditions can threaten life, just like epilepsy and diabetic illness.",
