        "action": "Extend the Brexit date to 29.03.2021 to negate the backstop & agree trading deal",
        "additional_details": "The headline objection within Parliament to the Government's Withdrawal Agreement is the NI Backtop. Both UK & EU say they are confident it will be solved within the withdrawal period of 2 years. Extend the current notice period by 2 years and solve the Backstop issue before leaving the EU. Further this would be a coincident period for negotiating our future trading arrangements as currently intended.\r\nIf the EU do not agree the extension then rescind the notice and immediately issue another one.",
        "background": "There is a logjam in the Brexit process due to there not being a majority in Parliament for any of the potential or proposed ways forward. The UK and EU are both confident that the NI Backstop will be resolved within  two years and this period also allows for agreeing our trading relationship",
