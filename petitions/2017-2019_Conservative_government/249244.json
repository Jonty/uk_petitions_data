It is proven that a false name and any genuine, but randomly selected postcode will suffice. For instance Basil Brush & SW1A 1AA was accepted. This vulnerability is not in the public interest.",

For security reasons, we don\u2019t tell people when their fraudulent activity has been unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t comment in detail about the security measures, but all petitions are subject to checks as part of due diligence and any concerns investigated. We're therefore not sure exactly what further action you'd like to see."
