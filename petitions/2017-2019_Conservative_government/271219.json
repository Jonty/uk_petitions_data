        "action": "Ban the use of single use plastics + make it mandatory to reuse plastic bottles",
        "additional_details": "Plastics require oil to make and also release greenhouse gases during the process of being made, recycled and if they aren't binned or reused they are left in the environment where the scenery is disturbed and wildlife suffers. Killing animals is the less brutal side to this problem because with global temperatures on the rise we may go extinct as a species one day along with every other creature on Earth.",
        "background": "We are in a climate crisis and in order to get a foothold on the problem we need to first completely ban the use of single plastics and bottles that are reusable but only get used once. For example, buying milk, we should refill old containers rather than buying a new bottle every time.",
