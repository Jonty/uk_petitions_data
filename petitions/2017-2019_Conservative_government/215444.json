        "additional_details": "A majority of MPs who have voted for this have claimed back their Zone 1 lunches and alcohol on expenses. They are the wealthiest people. Why are they getting free meals and refusing a child of these rights? \r\n\r\nMillions of children are already suffering mental health issues from such a young age, and the behaviour of this government is contributing to this. It\u2019s cruel, it\u2019s inhumane & needs be to brought to attention. \r\n\r\nThe children are our future and we should be doing what we can to stop this.",
        "background": "I was a child who received free school meals, without that meal I wouldn\u2019t have eaten. \r\n\r\nMillions of families in the UK are already forced to access food banks so that their child/children can have dinner, let alone a lunch meal too.",
