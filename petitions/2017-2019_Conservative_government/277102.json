        "action": "To prove that the elderly are more of a risk and danger than young drivers",
        "additional_details": "We wish to lower car insurance prices for those below 60 and higher for those above. As a young driver myself I believe my reactions are quicker and we are more alert  to dangers on the road. Where as with elderly, it is a known fact that they are much slower to reacting to hazzards which in turn would cause more accidents.\r\nNot all elderly drivers should have their insurance raised they should re take a drivers test to see if they capable of meeting standards set by the DVLA.",
        "background": "On behalf of all young drivers on the road I wish to start this petition due to the ridiculous high prices of car insurance that us young drivers have to pay annually. My grievance is that elderly drivers pay such a little amount yet are more commonly known to be the danger of the roads today.",
