These charities train dogs to aid people with a physical disability. One in four people will experience a mental disability each year (Mind) costing the economy \u00a3105 Billion a year (NHS England). Currently, people with Mental Health problems buy and train their own dog. This has a  success rate of 1 in 300 (PAWs foundation).",
