        "additional_details": "The term plus size is a harmful term. Plus, means in 'addition to' making the term translate to \"in addition to standard size\" \r\nThis use of languatge is harmful to so many people. Why cant all sizes be a standard size? Why cant all sizes be accepted? \r\n\r\nI'm not asking for the fashion industry to transform its models.\r\n\r\nI asking for a term to be banned. We have banned many words in the UK due to harmful reasons and discrimination. I feel that plus size should definately be one of them.",
        "background": "In light of Love Island recently getting a plus size person on the popular reality TV show in an attempt to create diversity. \r\n\r\nI want to propose that we ban the use of the word plus size. Not just in the fashion industry but in the media and everywhere else.",
