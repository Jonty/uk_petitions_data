With the amount of scandals repeatedly flowing from Parliament the Public demand a robust and transparent system to hold our elected offials to account. This must have the power to investigate properly. The burden of proof similar to our Police Service and sanctions available for wrongdoing to range from advice to written warnings and dismissal. This has to be the right course of action to bring back public trust and stop repeated wrong doing.",
        "background": "Elected officials behaviour is leading to a lack of integrity and faith in our Politicians. Many have escaped prosecution that would clearly have followed for ordinary citizens. There needs to be a wholly independent investigative unit set up with similar powers to the IPCC to regain trust.",
