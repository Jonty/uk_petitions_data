        "additional_details": "The new GCSE's have seen the highest rate of students leaving the exam due to panic attacks or anxiety attacks. Some students have described crying on the way to and from the exam. Major depression, anxiety, and stress are now more common in students leading up to the GCSE's which can cause the students to work sub-par during the exam. \r\n\r\nOur exams shouldn't be like masked torture. They shouldn't be a memory test. They should accurately measure all aspects of our intelligence from creativity, the ability to learn and small amounts of simple recall And should be spread out across multiple years (coursework) to reduce stress.\r\n\r\nsearch: professor Sarah Jayne Blakemore exams are damaging\r\n\r\nLord Baker said: \"the days of GCSEs are numbered\".",
        "background": "The new GCSE's are an inaccurate representation of intelligence and are inhumane. \r\n\r\nThe new GCSE's are inaccurate. They do not take into account many aspects such as creativity or the ability to innovate etc. They no longer provide the safety net (coursework) that the old GCSE's provided.",
