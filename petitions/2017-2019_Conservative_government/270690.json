        "additional_details": "The rain forest ecosystem relies on a fast turn over of vegetation. The soil does not have a deep nutritional depth. The illegal burning of the Amazonian rain forest is driven by the purchase of beef by Western countries. Yes, eating Brazilian beef in the U.K. is driving the pressure to create cheap beef in Brazil.  Once the new shoots are eaten, the cattle have to move on, as the soil will not support further vegetation growth. Let\u2019s send a clear consumer based message. No Brazilian beef!",
        "background": "The main driver behind the burning of the Amazonian jungle is for the quick turnaround of temporary grazing land for cattle. If there is no market for Brazilian beef, this problem would stop immediately.",
