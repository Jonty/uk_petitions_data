Now I have had 1 night taken off of me with no reason other than it was inconvenient for her, and then she called CSA right away to which they are now demanding \u00a3433 a week!!! How will I then provide for my children when I have them, clothe them feed them and put a roof over their head! A review is needed and all circumstances taken into consideration!",
        "background": "CSA is currently calculated on ones earnings pre tax. The more you earn the more you pay and good parents are being forced to spend less time with the paying parent because their ex partner sees it as an income rather than doing right for the children!",
