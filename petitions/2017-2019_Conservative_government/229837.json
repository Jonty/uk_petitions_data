Different local authorities also have the powers to impose on the spot fines to those caught littering. We're therefore not sure what further action you'd like to see.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. You could also speak to your local council about the enforcement of fines for people who leave their litter on the beach. You can find out who your local councillors are and how to contact them here: \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors"
