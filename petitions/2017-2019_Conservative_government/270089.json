        "additional_details": "Indigenous people have called for the EU to impose trade sanctions on Dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to halt the deforestation because they fear genocide. Also, the UK parliament has recognised a climate emergency. The Amazon rainforest is an important carbon store, absorbing huge volumes of CO2 each year, its deforestation is of global significance. The intrinsic value of the rainforest should also be recognised.\u00a0\r\nSanctions are used elsewhere for important issues as an effective means to force action.",
        "background": "Venezuela's Dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro favours illegal mining of the Amazon rainforest over conservation, escalating deforestation. This activity threatens indigenous populations, loss of a precious and complex ecosystem and a vital carbon store that slows global warming.",
