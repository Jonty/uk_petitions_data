        "action": "Add 'acting contrary to constituents wishes' as condition to Recall of MPs Act",
        "additional_details": "The trigger must mandate that MPs act as representatives of their election manifesto, but as delegates of the constituent majority result in a referendum, and referendum results overrule manifestos as a direct democratic instruction from their sovereign constituents.\r\nThe subsequent recall petition then requires 10% of constituents to cause a by-election. This trigger will revolutionise accountability of MPs to their sovereign constituents.",
        "background": "UK democracy has been severely devalued as a result of MPs directly opposing their sovereign constituents in Parliament.\r\nThe Recall of MPs Act 2015 must have another condition added to section 1: Acting contrary to their election manifesto or their constituent majority result in a referendum",
