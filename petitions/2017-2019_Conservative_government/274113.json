HKers are good in English & provide quality human capital & help the UK to enter Asia.\r\nJohn Major said, \u201cIf there were suggestion of a breach of the JD, we would have a duty to pursue every legal & other avenue.\u201d The UK shall take all necessary actions on China not honouring the JD.",

A resolution of such breach is to resume the status before it's signed. Thus UK should request China to give back HK, by Int'l Court of Justice, by a new treaty with China.",
