The surrounding hospitals have already been stretched due to Stafford Hospital A&E not being open 24hours. Cutting the A&E services altogether is going to put lives at risk not just in Staffordshire but the surrounding areas as well, this makes vulnerable, sick people travel great distances to access healthcare, this is not right.",
        "background": "Cutting Stafford Hospital A&E services altogether will put lives at risk. Stafford Hospital has already had their A&E cut so it has opening times (8am-10pm) Staffordshire is a big place. We need our hospital back, Stafford Hospital needs funding. Cutting funding does not help a struggling hospital.",
