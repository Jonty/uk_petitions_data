        "additional_details": "This country needs to reinforce our laws to the world. We need to let those British born or those considering a life in UK that our laws are here to be abided, they take priority over and above those of any other countries laws or any religious beliefs or ideals you may have.\r\n\r\nThose prepared to commit murder, join terrorist groups deemed enemy of the state and those whom abuse this nations children will face death. If that doesn't dissuade them, the consequences are clear.",
        "background": "In recent years the country has become a safehaven for those who commit crimes. Safe in the knowledge that a soft justice system will protect them even if found guilty of any level of crime. \r\nThe lack of fear of consequences is driving crime up and opening the doors to more serious crimes.",
