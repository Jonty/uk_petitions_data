        "additional_details": "As an example I have a shared care arrangement with my daughters mum who has residency with them, they stay with me Wednesday - Saturday 7.30pm week 1 & Thursday - Saturday 7.30pm week 2. When they are with me they have everything they need E.g own school clothes, daily clothes, footwear Etc. Their mum claims child benefit & child tax credits for them and yet Child Maintanence Service (CMS) still claim I should still be paying more money to their mum. End the Equality for non resident parents!",
        "background": "As it currently stands the resident parent can claim Child Maitanence from the other parent based on how many nights they stay with them. For example up to 57 nights per year is what the child maintanence service class as shared care but still the non resident parent has to pay maintanence.",
