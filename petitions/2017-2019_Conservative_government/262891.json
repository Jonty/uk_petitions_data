        "background": "When a couple start a family, a child grows up with both parents heavily involved in their upbringing.\r\nUnfortunately, after a seperation, one parent is automatically given \"primary carer\" role (97% mother) thus restricting the child's time with the other parent, and they have to apply to the court",
