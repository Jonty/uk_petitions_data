        "additional_details": "Overall JustEat have always had a 50p card surcharge upon paying for meals via card and if paid by cash there will be no charge.\r\n\r\nThis new 'service fee' is a scam and needs to be taken down as this is clearly a replacement of the card charge which is now not permitted within the UK. Please sign the petition to help make a point that us consumers will not be penalised further after this card charge removal, please sign the petition and share it along as JustEat is a service which many enjoy.",
        "background": "Since the government card charge removal JustEat have now added a 50p 'service fee' to cover the card fee which i find is very unfair. As the law now states that people should not be penalised for using card payments anymore JustEat are now adding this 50p 'service fee' to card and CASH payments too",
