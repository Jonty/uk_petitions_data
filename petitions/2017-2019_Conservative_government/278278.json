        "action": "Hold a confirmatory Brexit referendum with only Leave options on the ballot",
        "additional_details": "There must be no Remain option on the ballot paper for the following reasons: \r\n\r\n1. Remain was rejected in the 2016 referendum. Attempts to reverse the 2016 referendum result before it has been implemented are not merely un-democratic, but anti-democratic.\r\n\r\n2. When Parliament approved this latest deal in principle on 22nd October, they accepted that Britain is leaving the EU, effectively ruling out Remain.\r\n\r\nLet the people decide whether Brexit takes the form of this Deal or No Deal on WTO Terms.",
        "background": "The EU Withdrawal Agreement secured by PM Boris Johnson does not deliver the Brexit the British people voted for. \r\nThe only way to break the Parliamentary deadlock is to hold a legally binding confirmatory referendum on the Agreement vs No Deal, and to implement the result immediately thereafter.",
