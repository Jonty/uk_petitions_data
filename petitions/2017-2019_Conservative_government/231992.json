They ask for my name, they don\u2019t care I\u2019m uncomfortable, they have no right to make any girl feel discomfort, think about the minors. This shouldn\u2019t be the norm, this needs to be addressed! Use your voice! And comment your experiences of being catcalled if you feel comfortable.",
        "background": "I, and many other girls, have to quietly endure catcalling or unwanted remarks and harrassment from random men on the street we don\u2019t know or want. I know people who as young as 13, receive catcalling and verbal harassament from older men, it\u2019s disgusting and there\u2019s nothing to excuse this!",
