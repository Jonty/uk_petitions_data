        "additional_details": "I suffered with endometriosis to the point I had a complete hysterectomy at the age of 35 and commenced the menopause and HRT.  I am now 47 and do not get offered screening despite taking HRT for 12 years. Why is breast screening only offered to women over a certain age when younger women are also at risk?",
        "background": "HRT and menopause are risk factors for breast cancer therefore we should offer regular breast screening for those who entered the menopause medically or naturally early to allow them the same protection.",
