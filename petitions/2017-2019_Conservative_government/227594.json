        "additional_details": "DEFRA legislation stipulates that Halal/Kosher meat must be intended for consumption of Muslims or Jews.  However there is clear evidence that religiously slaughtered meat is being passed on to the market place unlabelled / unidentified as religiously slaughtered.  However there is no legilslation to control or monitor this meat and it's distribution.  Indentifying this meat would mean all consumers would have an informed choice as to whether to buy or not by this religiously slaughtered meat.",

This includes animals that are stunned or un-stunned.",
