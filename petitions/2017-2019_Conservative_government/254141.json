        "action": "Vote Leave broke the law - declare the Brexit Referendum result null and void",
        "additional_details": "If electoral law is broken, a fine is not sufficient. The result needs to be challenged as well. A fine alone says \"if you break electoral law and get caught, you only need to budget some extra money for the fines, but you'll get your way\". It essentially says elections can be bought.\r\n\r\nBut if the result (whether it's a parliamentary seat, council seat, or referendum) is subsequently challenged, that sends a strong message that electoral fraud will not be tolerated and elections can't be bought.",
        "background": "The Electoral Commission concluded that Vote Leave breached electoral law by overspending before the referendum. Vote Leave initially appealed against the decision, but later dropped their challenge, ironically on 29 of March, and paid the fine. This should render the referendum result invalid.",
