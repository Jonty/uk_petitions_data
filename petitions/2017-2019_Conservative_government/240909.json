        "action": "To allow international students of UK universities to stay after their study.",
        "additional_details": "International students don\u2019t feel welcomed in UK after they have been permitted only  four months of stay after their studies which leaves them with no valuable work experience. The post study visa was scrapped in 2012 and I have brought this petition to bring it back so that international students who pay 40% more tuition fees than the Home/EU Students can get atleast the basic need of staying for year or two after their studies. Students have also stopped choosing UK because of this regulation",
        "background": "International students from all over the world have been choosing UK as their preferred place for higher education, but they have been feeling unwelcomed as they are asked to leave UK after four months from the time they finish their degree. Please sign this petition for bringing post study visa.",
