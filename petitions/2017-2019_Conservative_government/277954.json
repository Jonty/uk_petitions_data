        "action": "Replace GCSE's and As levels in exchange for Sudbury Education",
        "additional_details": "A Sudbury school is a type of school, where students have complete responsibility for their own education, and the school is run by a direct democracy in which students and staff are almost equaled. Students independently decide what to do with their time, and tend to learn as a by-product of ordinary experience rather than through coursework. There is no predetermined educational syllabus, prescriptive curriculum or standardized instruction. This is a form of democratic education.",
        "background": "Education standards in the Uk undoubtedly have increased over the years however this has caused the mental health of students to drastically drop.  Almost nine in 10 (87.7%) said they struggled with feelings of anxiety. Sign this petition to change the system to Sudbury education.",

In particular, we aren't sure whether you'd like to abolish GCSE and A-Levels or whether you'd like the Government to get rid of the national curriculum and let students choose which topics they study. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
