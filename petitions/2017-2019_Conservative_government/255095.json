        "additional_details": "Since 2016, the last opinion poll in favour of an exit was in 2017. All subsequent are heavily leaning in favour of a remain scenario.\r\n\r\nTheresa May\u2019s deals have been rejected, Parliament is unable to make a clear decision on an option and are deadlocked. In most other situation, relevance is then tested. The most logical way to break this deadlock is to understand whether the requirement is still relevant in the public opinion, requiring them to vote in the extension period granted to the UK.",
        "background": "The change in opinion since the referendum is being ignored. 3 years have passed and better information is available to the voting public. Current opinion must be measured and upheld in light of this, with a 2019 referendum comparator to inform negotiations during the granted extension period.",
