Banks avoid reimbursing the value of stolen funds, or compensation, not least because the Police and Financial Ombudsman are under-resourced and unable to cope with a growing epidemic of digital crime.\r\n\r\nThe Government must step in to protect consumers who suffer - not only at the hands of opportunistic criminals, but also at the hands of negligent banks and an outdated, under-resourced appeals procedure.",
        "background": "Banks are currently allowed to deny card fraud claims without providing evidence for their decision to customers.\r\n\r\nBanks are not protecting our money and personal data from card fraud. At a time when large companies suffer mass data breaches this is not acceptable behavior and should be fined.",

The FCA is also independent of the UK Government and Parliament.
