        "additional_details": "Rawhide chews are known to have following risks,\r\n\r\nChoking or blockages. Rawhide bones and other edible chews can pose a choking and blockage risk. In fact, this is a much bigger risk than contamination or digestive irritation. If it isn\u2019t resolved, a blockage can lead to death.\r\n\r\nContamination. As with pet toys, rawhide chews can contain trace amounts of toxic chemicals.\r\n\r\nDigestive irritation. Some dogs are simply sensitive or allergic to rawhide or other substances used in their manufacture.",
        "background": "It is a sad fact that dogs are seriously injured or die each year following the use of rawhide treats and chews, which owners buy believing they are safe for their pets.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer and use of these is outdated and the risks outweigh the benefits, its time to ban the sale and keep dogs safe.",
