        "additional_details": "Leaked Government papers highlight real concerns surrounding shortages in the event of no deal.\r\n\r\nRemaining in the Customs Union would assuage the concerns of leave voters, as the country would no longer be in a political union with the EU, whilst continuing the benefits of tariff free trade. \r\n\r\nSuch an option would avoid the potential for a hard borer in Northern Ireland and a return to unrest.",
        "background": "The Government are currently preparing to leave the EU without a deal, despite real fears surrounding shortages of fuel, food and medicine. Remaining in a customs union avoids this uncertainty, respects the referendum result and would be a political compromise to bring the country together.",
