There is no need to be regrouped or labelled to take away the individuality already established.\r\n\r\nThis slur is offensive and used as such to speak or write about in an abusively disparaging manner.\r\n\r\nIn a time when Society is already confusing & challenging, there is no reason to name and group people that already have established & sufficient definitions:\r\n\r\nWoman; Adult Human Female.\r\nMan; Adult Human Male.",

This takes away the right to be known as we have always been known as women/woman or men/man.",
