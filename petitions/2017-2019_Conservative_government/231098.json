The government set the rates for a family to live without financial worry and the government need to keep these rates in line with the move over to Universal Credit to prevent more poverty.",

For example, you could start a new petition asking the Government to set universal credit rates so that no-one who is in work would be worse off than under the previous benefits system if that is something you would like too happen."
