Over occupiers are now in the lowest priority band on bidding , while also being stung for having too many bedrooms financially. When you have invested thousands and years into your socially rented home, but appreciate there is a housing crisis and another family in desperate need of your home , where is the help and incentive , moving/exchanging is not cheap",
        "background": "When the \u2018bedroom tax\u2019 came into effect, people under occupying socially rented properties were put into a priority band when bidding for new properties if needing to downsize , this incentive freed up a lot of larger properties and got housing stock rotating , this incentive needs to be reinstated.",

Deciding whether to give people who want to downsize priority in housing is the responsibility of your local council.\r\n\r\nYou could raise your issue with a local councillor, who represents you. You can use this page to find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\r\nYou could also start a new petition asking for something that the UK Government or Parliament are responsible for. For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Government and Parliament to change the law to ensure that local authorities give priority to people who are under-occupying social housing."
