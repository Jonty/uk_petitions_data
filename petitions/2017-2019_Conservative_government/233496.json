        "additional_details": "Such law would be dicriminating against the church and Christians who hold biblical perspective. So now there is no tolerance for Christians in a country where there is freedom of religion by those asking for tolerance. An undercover reporter was sent into a church and the pastor offered a biblical perspective and prayed for God\u2019s guidance. The man came into the church seeking counsel from the church. Christians who believe and live by the bible cannot be penalised for their views in the U.K.",
        "background": "A reporter was sent into a London church pretending to seek counsel from a pastor about being gay. The pastor responded with the bible\u2019s view without condemnation and offered prayers for the person. The government wants to ban christians from sharing these views even in the confines of the church",
