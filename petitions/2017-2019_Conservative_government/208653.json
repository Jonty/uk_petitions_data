We're therefore not sure what further action you want the Government and Parliament to take. \r\n\r\nTrials for war crimes are the responsibility of the International Criminal Court (ICC). You can find out more about the ICC here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.icc-cpi.int/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. If you want the UK Government to ban ISIS fighters from returning to the UK, you may wish to sign this petition instead: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/204079"
