When the Armed Forces do their duties, they are rewarded for their successes and punished for their alleged failures.  This does not seem to apply to the Civil Service, who are given bonuses whether their department has succeeded or failed, and Knighthoods if their failures have been sufficiently spectacular.  From information leaks from the Brexit team, to local council property transactions not being audited.  No one is being held responsible.",
        "background": "Senior and other Civil Servants appear to believe their positions are a sinecure, and that they do not have to carry out the wishes of the Public or the Government.  The law is to be changed to allow immediate dismissal of the head of department in each case of malfeasance or dereliction of duty.",
