        "additional_details": "The airport is going through a face lift which is going to cost hundreds of thousands. They obviously intend on recouping some of these costs through the public unchallenged.  Aren't the public paying enough Airport / Airline taxes that a DROP OFF or PICKUP of their own paying passenger is again asked to pay?  The airlines at peak are already charging ridiculous amounts. We are sick of paying excess fees over and over again. Our government needs to intervene.",
        "background": "Manchester Airport has introduced new charges. \r\nIt now costs to drop off passengers at all the terminals. These charges increase the longer you stay even if its not your fault (traffic jam at their own car park).",
