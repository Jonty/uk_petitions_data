        "additional_details": "On the 4th September 2019, Parliament passed a bill requiring the government to leave the EU with a deal or, alternatively, to extend the date that we leave the EU beyond 31 October 2019.  By excluding the possibility of no-deal, the Government\u2019s negotiating position has been significantly weakened.\r\n\r\nWith no working majority in the house of commons, the Government has been rendered impotent by opposition MPs and Tory rebels.  A General Election is the only way to break this impasse.",
        "background": "The government has lost its majority and its ability to leave the EU \u201cwith or without a deal\u201d as mandated by the people in the 2016 EU Referendum.\r\n\r\nWe demand that parliament allow the government to hold a General Election without delay, in accordance with the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011.",
