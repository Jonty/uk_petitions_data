        "additional_details": "Example:\r\nGreater London \r\nBarnet :blue - paper, plastic and glass; Brown- food waste, green-garden waste, black - Landfill\r\nHounslow : red- plastic and cans; Blue- paper; green- glass; brown- garden waste; black- landfill\r\nCroydon: Blue- Paper; Green- Plastic, cans\r\nEach and every time people move not just within a country but also within a city, they have to look up what materials go to what bins. This creates confusion and most people won't look this up every time they are at different place.",
        "background": "A lot of cities, such as Greater Manchester and Greater London, have different towns within them. Each of those towns uses different colours of bins for recycling. Therefore if you live on the edge of Salford, your neighbours would have different bin colours to you because they live in Manchester.",
