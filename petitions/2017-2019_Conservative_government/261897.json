        "additional_details": "Our Family, Friends and Children are all suffering from lack of funding surrounding Mental Health Issues. 7,000 people take their lives a year. \r\nWe need to push the government to do something fast but we also need to help. Mental Health charity donations compared to charities for other health problems are tiny. But why? 1 in 4 of us suffer from mental health issues and it is just as serious as any other illness.   \r\nPlease sign the petition and donate to https://www.mind.org.uk/donate/.",
        "background": "Mental ill health is the single largest cause of disability in the UK, contributing up to 22.8%, compared to 15.9% for cancer and 16.2% for cardiovascular disease. \r\n\r\n1 out of 4 people a year will suffer from Mental ill health but for some reason it receives just 13% of NHS funding.",
