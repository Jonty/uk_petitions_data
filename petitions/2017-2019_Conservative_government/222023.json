        "additional_details": "Andrew Griffiths MP, Minister for Small Business, Consumers & Corporate Responsibility replied on 7 June 2018 to my MP's letter:\r\n\"We keep all our employment regulations under review, including the Working Time Regulations (WTR) 1998 which contain the statutory requirements on rest breaks. We currently have no plans to review these provisions, the WTR represent the minimum requirements and employers are free to offer more generous terms to their workers through their employment contracts\".",

Therefore, even on a 12 hour shift, you are only legally entitled to ONE 20 mins rest break.  This Petition is asking Parliament to change the law, to require a longer break time.",
