Within 5 years this will cripple families and within a decade will make it impossible to have a functioning household on standard wages. Raises like this supported and enforced year on year is unacceptable and is pushing families and homes into financial ruin. over 5 years council tax will rise roughly 28% over the unacceptable current tax bill. People are already living hand to mouth and is totally unacceptable.",
