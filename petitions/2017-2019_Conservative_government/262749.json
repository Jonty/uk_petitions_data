        "additional_details": "The refinery is located near Southampton which is already most polluted city in the UK. This expansion will not increase the local economy as exxonmobil is an american multinational so profits will be exported. It will only create a few, if any, temporary jobs with and average of 196 temporary jobs during construction (page 13 of the planning statement).",
        "background": "Fawley oil refinery is the largest and most polluting refinery in the UK. The \u00a3800 million expansion will increase the emission of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, both linked to respiratory diseases. This goes against the Paris agreement, and the UK's declaration of a climate emergency.",
