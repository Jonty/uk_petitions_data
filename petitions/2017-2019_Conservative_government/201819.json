        "additional_details": "In November 1974, 12 people were each fined the maximum \u00a350 under the Act for wearing black berets at Speakers' Corner during a Sinn F\u00e9in anti-internment rally. The Public Order Act 1936 was also used extensively against the flying pickets during the 1984/5 miner's strike.The police used it on the grounds of preventing a breach of the peace.It is clear this act is used to suppress groups who do not conform with mainstream ideas and that is a direct infringement of the ideals the UK is built on.",
        "background": "The Public Order Act of 1936 makes political uniform (even something such as a white polo or pin) a criminal offence. This law can be used by government to suppress any movement in the nation by simply labelling a political organisation criminals because they all wear pins. This is clearly outdated.",
