This was often frustrating and disappointing for petitioners. \r\n\r\nIf you're concerned about a particular policy or decision that's the responsibility of Government or the House of Commons, you could start a petition about that. \r\nPetitions calling for action on policy are more likely to be an effective way of achieving the change you want.
