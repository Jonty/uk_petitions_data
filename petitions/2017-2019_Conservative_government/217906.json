        "additional_details": "The rules for dealing with written off cars are clear. Industry body the Association Of British Insurers says car insurance companies must offer a proper payout for the value of your car.\r\n\r\nThis means you must be offered a sum that will allow you to purchase a similar car in similar condition in your local area.\r\nThis is not happening and car insurance companies are paying out less than what your car is worth which leaves the no-fault driver having to fit the bill for other expenses which is a stressful process.",
        "background": "Insurance companies write off cars because the cost of repairs is more than the value. \r\nPolicyholders should be given the choice to:\r\n1. decided if they would like a fair payout\r\n2. decide to keep their car and have it repaired no matter the cost if it's a no-fault claim.",
