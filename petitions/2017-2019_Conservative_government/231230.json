        "additional_details": "Leave voters were voting for a more prosperous, fairer country, not a country where the NHS, farming, hospitality and some manufacturing industries would suffer due to lack of staff or difficulties with trade, border and travelling arrangements, ( particularly Ireland) would be in question and prices for basic goods would rise. Also, voters were not aware of threats to environmental controls and science. The list is endless.",
