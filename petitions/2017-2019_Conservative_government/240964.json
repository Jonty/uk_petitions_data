        "action": "Amend Parliamentary rules to stop minority objections to private members' bills.",
        "additional_details": "Christopher Chope MP, for example, has often shouted \"object\" to stop badly thought-out legislation, arguing that he does it on principle, because he does not agree with legislation being brought before Parliament on a Friday without enough time for a full debate. However, many bills are debated and scrutinised fully in the House of Commons or Lords and have been supported by the government. This is an arcane process and shouldn't happen to bills with overwhelming majorities in favour.",
        "background": "Currently, Parliamentary rules mean it only requires one MP to shout \"object\" to a private member's bill which is listed for a second reading but not debated to block its progress. MPs have used this selectively for partisan political gain even when it's already had considerable debate.",
