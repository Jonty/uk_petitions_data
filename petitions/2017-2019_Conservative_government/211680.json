That person\u2019s health may not be any different since the year before. PIP needs to be considered being kept and not keep changing to another system, so that these people don\u2019t have to worry about financial issues or become ill because of the long assessments and worry.",

ME is a condition that affect someone\u2019s whole life or it can a short term illness of fatigue.  People who have ME are not all able to travel to hospitals for assessments, change is needed",
