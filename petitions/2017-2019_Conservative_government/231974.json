        "additional_details": "A licence that can be applied for by these families, that allows them to buy and hold their own display on a specific date (5th Nov) will then stop others from being able to purchase fireworks and letting them off for weeks before and after the 5th Nov. Fireworks cause alot of distress to pets and wildlife. Limiting who can buy and use them will limit the amount of distress caused to animals.",
        "background": "There are families that have children who suffer with autism and many other issues. Alot of those children love fireworks but cannot be around big crowds of people.",
