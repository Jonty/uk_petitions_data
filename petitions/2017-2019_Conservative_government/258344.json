        "additional_details": "The Government aims to build 300,000 new homes per year yet only 8,400 homes a year install solar. \r\nScotland already has a scheme to encourage solar on new build homes. \r\nThe average solar install costs less than \u00a34,500 per home which is well within most new build incentive allowances.\r\nSolar energy is now the cheapest form of electricity in more than 60 countries, with 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions coming from electricity and heat generation.",
        "background": "Following Climate Change: the Facts, hosted by Sir David Attenborough, it is obvious making use of renewable energy sources must be a priority as the show warns of what could happen if global warming exceeds 1.5 degrees if major reductions in CO2 emissions are not made in the next decade.",
