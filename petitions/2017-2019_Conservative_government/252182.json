        "additional_details": "I understand that the nutritional information and calorie content in food needs to be made available on food packaging so that people can access this to make decisions on food products in order to prevent obesity, but this should be made more discrete as I have noticed that this information being displayed so boldly has contributed to eating disorders and therefore has the potential to increase eating disorders. A balanced focus on managing obesity and eating illnesses should be established.",
        "background": "Many food products have coloured labels and obvious calorific content displayed boldly on the front. I think this information should be removed from the front and made more discrete so people can still access this should they need to, as I feel this can contribute massively to eating disorders.",
