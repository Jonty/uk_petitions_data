        "action": "Make companies reveal hidden plastic in wet wipes on their labels",
        "additional_details": "This petition is to give people the knowledge that these wet wipes contain plastic, as it stands the three big companies; Johnson&Johnson, Proctor and Gamble (P&G) and Kimberley Clark do not mention or reveal anywhere on their packaging a wet wipe is up to 84% plastic. If the packaging is correctly labelled this gives the customer the chance to make an informed decision on wherever or not to purchase wipes.\r\nThe information and statistics have come from BBC's - War on Plastic with Hugh and Anita.",
        "background": "Each year we use over 11 billion wet wipes in the UK, from Huggies baby wipes to Flash floor wipes. Up to 84% of a wet wipe is plastic. This being non recyclable means almost every wipe is yet another piece of single use plastic that will be buried, burned or worse still will end up in the sea.",
