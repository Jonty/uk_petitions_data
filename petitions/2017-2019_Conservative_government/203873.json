Advances are loans to be paid back.\r\n\r\nClaw back rates on work allowances current at 67p per every \u00a31 of earnings.\r\n\r\nChildcare payments need to be made upfront. \r\n\r\nPunitive sanctions regime for low paid workers.\r\n\r\nReducing poor to second rate savers. \r\n\r\nCouncils cracking under strain and at breaking point.",
        "background": "Universal Credit is an unmitigated disaster.\r\n\r\nThis failed policy has only been rolled out to 0.8 % of the total amount of people expected to be on this benefit by 2022.\r\n\r\nIf David Gauke and the minister responsible for its implementation refuse to address issues they must be sacked and replaced.",
