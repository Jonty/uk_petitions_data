        "additional_details": "There isn't enough state funding, however, \u00a39250 is excessive, especially for students from low-income households who aren't even supported by maintenance allowances anymore. Subjects, like the sciences, require more funding, so fees may vary for those students. I don't agree that university fees should be as low as \u00a33000 as it isn't sufficient to pay for further education.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/06/tuition-fees-university-funding-poorer-students-unfair-reform\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-46074099\r\n\r\nhttps://www.shropshirestar.com/news/education/2018/02/21/should-university-tuition-fees-be-reduced/",
        "background": "Students shouldn't have to be in masses of debt after getting a qualification which could give them a more secure future. When thinking about going to university, the financial burden is extremely worrying as it's not easy to pay off, so it should be lowered.",
