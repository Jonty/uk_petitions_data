The Prime Minister has promised to prioritise leaving the EU with a deal and yet 80-90% of the government\u2019s commitment is towards no deal. \r\n\r\nAcross the political spectrum, in the House of Commons, MPs from all parties have been standing up to the Prime Minister to tell him that we will not allow him to force an undemocratic and catastrophic No Deal Brexit on the British people.",
        "background": "We must lock out No Deal and prove whether or not the government are serious about getting an improved deal or not by forcing them to put what they have negotiated so far to Parliament to vote on before 31st January 2020.",

The House of Commons library has written an article explaining what the Act requires.
