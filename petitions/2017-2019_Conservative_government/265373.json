        "additional_details": "Enjoyed by so many families over the years; children allowed to take part behind the scenes & on stage was a great way for all to get involved.  A way for all the forces to show their abilities in a fun way and for the public to show their respect, support and thanks. By adding Veterans, would enable the nation to show their respect & gratitude to those past & present who are prepared to pay the ultimate price for our security & freedom.",
        "background": "This event was stopped by Tony Blair in 1999. It should be brought back to Olympia as it was before.  It increases respect for the military & helps promote the professionalism of servicemen and women. To bring the nation together! Let's say thank you & come together!",
