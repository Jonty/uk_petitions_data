You could raise the issue with local councillors who represent you.

You can find out who your MP is, and how to contact them, here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, a petition calling for the Government to require that local authorities provide school transport for all students or provide increased funding to subsidise school transport, if those are things you'd like to happen."
