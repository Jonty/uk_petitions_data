        "additional_details": "Family Discrimination would make it illegal to use an arbitrary number to define its size or shape.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Telegraph:\r\nIt is the end of two point four children.The shape of families in Britain is changing radically, new figures show, with the country now home to some of the biggest in Europe.  New data from Eurostat, the European statistics agency, shows a growing trend for large families.\r\nIn 2013 some 9.5 per cent of babies born in the UK had three or more older siblings.",
        "background": "Gym memberships, theme park tickets, public transport fares etc almost always define a family in their terms and conditions as 2 adults and 2 children.  As families come in all sizes and varieties this is discrimination in the same way as gender or age which are illegal.  A new law should be passed.",
