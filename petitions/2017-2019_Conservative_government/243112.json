In particular, we're not sure whether you'd like \"domesticated animals\" to include all domesticated animals, including cattle and sheep, or whether you'd like something different. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Government and Parliament to ban the killing of dogs and cats for food, if that's what you'd like to happen."
