        "additional_details": "On May 9 two committees of MPs published a report saying the government's plans will take too long to come into effect and will \u2018fail a generation\u2019. On average, a child waits a decade from the moment they suffer their first symptom of poor mental health to receiving treatment. At such a crucial stage in children's development, mental health issues should be treated as a matter of urgency. Diagnosing and treating issues early will help deal with problems before they develop into something worse.",
        "background": "We call on the government to tackle the mental health epidemic at the root, and fast - to do this it needs to cut waiting times for children (5-16 years old), shortening its timeline to introduce maximum waiting times by 2022-23. If not, our country will lose countless young lives in the meantime.",
