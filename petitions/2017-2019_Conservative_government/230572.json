        "additional_details": "There seems to be an increase in road traffic collisions involving the elderly, just like the one recently which involved a car towing a caravan in the wrong direction of the motorway. The driver was 80 years of age.",
        "background": "Many elderly people are out of touch with modern day roads and become a danger to other road users. A re-test should include a medical, general competence and familiarisation with todays busy roads. Modern day roads are completely different to the ones that elderly people took tests on decades ago.",
