No deals were mentioned and no deals were voted for by the public.. \r\n\r\nIt is unconstitutional and offensive to presume those voting to leave were even thinking of any deal at the time of voting..\r\n\r\nThey were not !! \r\n\r\nThey were simply answering the question Leave or Remain..\r\n\r\nAll deals should be taken off the table and we should now leave with NO DEAL immediately since the result was to leave the EU..",
        "background": "We were asked one simple question, whether we wanted to leave the European Union or Remain in the European Union..\r\nThat was the simple question to which people voted with a majority to leave.. \r\nOn that referendom paper we voted with, no deals were mentioned at all.. \r\n\r\nLeave with No Deal..",
