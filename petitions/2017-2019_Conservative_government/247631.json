        "additional_details": "Racial bias has in many cases proven to exist within the jury system. It is unfair for an all white jury to decide if a black or asian man is more likely to commit a crime in comparison to a white counterpart as people can often make a decision based on racial bias. Racial bias is also hard to prove however by having an ethnic minority in a trial especially for a case involving an ethnic minority they can understand what it is like to be stereotyped against & educate the rest of the jury members",
        "background": "Ethnic minorities are often stereotyped against when convicted. Their defence case is also often overlooked due to the bias & stereotypical image SOME jury members already have against them. Many are convicted without solid evidence by an all white jury who have never been stereotyped against.",
