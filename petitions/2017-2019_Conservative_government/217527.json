        "action": "Extend the remit of Employment Tribunals to include all equality-related cases",
        "additional_details": "The additional burden on the tribunal system would be small compared with the huge difference the change would make to those suffering breaches of the law. If the government won't extend the remit, they must explain why disabled students have fewer rights than disabled employees. An employee with a discrimination claim can go to the tribunal, but if someone other than their employer discriminates against them, they have to file an expensive claim in the County Court or the High Court.",
        "background": "Employment Tribunals should become Employment & Equality Tribunals and hear all equality-related cases. Why have an Equality Act if only employees have access to legal redress? The Government must ensure that everyone, including pensioners and students, has equal access to justice at equal cost.",
