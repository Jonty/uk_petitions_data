Due to a Governmental and a general Political unwillingness to accept the Referendum result of 2016, by the majority of M.P.s, both here in the UK and by M.E.P.s in the EU, this unfortunately won't now happen. PLEASE SIGN THIS NEW PETITION TO RECTIFY THE DATE ANOMALY, which unfortunately, has now been moved to 12th April 2019.",
