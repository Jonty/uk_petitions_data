        "action": "Ban nut products by supermarket checkouts promoted for impulsive purchasing.",
        "additional_details": "I've noticed more and more that supermarkets are stocking shelves at the checkout with nut products to encourage shoppers to purchase them impulsively. Although impulse buying is not something that concerns me, having to weave through the already narrow area to pay for your shopping to avoid having an allergy attack seems totally unnecessary, which is why I think that nut products should only be sold on an aisle in the shop, and not used as a product to promote impulsive buying at the checkout.",
        "background": "For those with severe nut allergies such as myself, avoiding the nut aisle in a supermarket is usually easy, however having to dodge them at the checkout where supermarkets promote impulsive buying, makes shopping in general increasingly difficult and potentially dangerous.",
