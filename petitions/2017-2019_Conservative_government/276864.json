        "background": "IR35 will cut salary of hard working contractors and freelancer. It is depriving UK industry of access to key skills.\r\n\r\nAt this time ALREADY we are seeing firms ditch self-employment people on mass. The banks are shutting their doors to the self-employed and projects are ALREADY going offshore.",
