        "additional_details": "May keeps insisting that her deal or no deal are the only options available, despite that fact that her deal is massively unpopular among voters and it and no deal have been rejected by parliament twice.\r\nA variety of alternative options and compromises have been suggested but the PM refuses to even consider them. Instead she accuses MPs of betraying the people.\r\nRecent polls show that less than 20% of voters trust May to handle Brexit successfully.\r\nShe therefore has to go immediately.",
        "background": "The Brexit negotiations have been going on for more than two years and we are still not much closer to a solution than on day 1. This is in large part due to the PM's refusal to listen and compromise. Her stubborn insistence on her deal will lead us into disaster. Therefore she has to go.",
