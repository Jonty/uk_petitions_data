        "action": "Introduce Religious Studies/ REPS as an EBacc humanity subject",
        "additional_details": "Religious, Ethical and Philosophical Studies (REPS) is an academically challenging subject that it much more interesting and useful for many school students than History or Geography. It encourages debate and gives us the freedom to express our views. It also improves essay writing skills important to other GCSEs such as English, further developing us there, and gives us the knowledge and ability to discuss current affairs and issues, in addition to past issues like history.",
        "background": "So many of us at our school have been restricted due to being forced to do EBacc. We only get given 4 choices, 2 of which have to be a language or a humanity, either history or geography. Many students want to do RS but cannot due to limited options.",
