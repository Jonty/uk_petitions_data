A good overview of the topic can be found at https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39955468\r\n\r\nInternet based voting system is an inevitability considering the impact the internet has had on every other aspect of life.\r\n\r\nThis could also be a revolution in not only how we vote but why we vote as each vote will be from a place where we can research an issue at the same time as voting.",

E.g. it will be more convenient leading to increased participation, it will allow people who can't get to or are uncomfortable going to a voting station to vote and can be used to vote on any topic easily allowing for more issues to be voted on.",
