        "additional_details": "It\u2019s absolutely despicable in the 21st century that girls are being forced to comprise their education simply because an absolute necessity is unavailable and not affordable. Our target is, not only to reach a wide number of the local community, but also to engage and spread the message nationwide to other groups. We are aiming to attract publicity from both local and national media, as well as support from our local Authority, our MP and the manufactures themselves. We are planning to garner support and take a petition to Downing Street. This is a new venture for us. The extensive use of social media will be a departure from the usual methods we have used and we believe this will help generate greater awareness and support.",
