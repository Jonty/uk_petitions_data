        "additional_details": "Braithwaite is one of a  group who were born in the Commonwealth, arrived in the UK as children and now have  immigration problems. Home Office officials request to see preferably 4 pieces of evidence for every year spent in the UK.\r\n\r\nAnyone who arrived in the UK before 1973 already has an automatic permanent right to remain in the UK. This petition calls for grant of British citizenship to anyone legally in the UK before 1 Jan 73 and who has been continuously legally in the UK since then.",
        "background": "The stories of Albert Thompson and Sarah O\u2019Connor have rightly provoked compassion and outrage from the public. Thompson's story is particularly tragic as a man who has lived in the UK since 1973 has been denied life saving cancer treatment. \r\n\r\nMichael Braithwaite arrived in 1961 aged 9.",
