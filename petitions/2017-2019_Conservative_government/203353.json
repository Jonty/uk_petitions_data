        "additional_details": "In recent months examples of 'Conversion Therapy' have grown in representation in the UK. We have seen some therapists who offer this practice appear on television and radio shows. It was also reported that a Church in Liverpool told people to starve themselves for 3 days to cure their homosexuality, despite the Church of England calling on the government to outlaw the practice.",
        "background": "Despite the regulations already in place, it is not a criminal offence to offer so-called Conversion Therapy for LGBT+ people. This is despite all major counselling and psychiatric bodies claiming it is dangerous and it wrongly suggests that LGBT+ people are wrong simply for who they are.",
