I strongly believe that nobody should have to decide between a roof over their heads or their pets. It is just not right in this day and age.",

It was because I have two dogs (both relaxed and obedient) - my family. \r\nThis petition is to change policy and make sure that nobody should have to be separated from their beloved pet(s) just for temporary accommodation.",
