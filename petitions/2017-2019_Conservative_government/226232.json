In reality to this day and near future whales are still being held in captivity for entertainment purposes not for healthcare.",

The UK Parliament can only make laws that affect the UK.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could ask the UK Government to raise this issue with the governments of countries where orcas are kept in captivity."
