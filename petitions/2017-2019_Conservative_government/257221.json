        "background": "Climate negotiations have failed to prevent escalating harm to the natural world. A criminal law of ECOCIDE would impose a legal duty on governments to prevent dangerous industrial practices which exacerbate climate breakdown. It's the only realistic way to force industry to change direction.",
