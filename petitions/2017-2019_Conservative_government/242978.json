        "additional_details": "The UK is a democracy and whatever the views current MP's in the house of commons have, they were elected by the British people and as their salaries are paid by the British tax payer they are employed by us and as such are duty bound to do what we that British public want. The majority of the British public want the UK to leave the EU on the 29th of March and if the only option available on that date is no deal than as our employees they must accept that choice.",
        "background": "In 2016 the UK held a referendum with the majority of voters voting for the UK to leave the EU. Despite claims to the contrary by many MP's the British people knew exactly what they were voting for and leaving with no deal was one of the things that the British electorate voted for.",
