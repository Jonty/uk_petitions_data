General public gets their information about climate change and pollution from conscious people who are very often told to \"cheer up\" as its\" not all that bad\". So that we can make decisions and choices, we need to be educated. And it should be the governments' duty to do so.  We need to know what's happening, how this will affect us, what is being done, what can be done.",

Make it mandatory for every TV and radio channel to broadcast at least half an hour of relevant information on the RANGE of subjects every day.",
