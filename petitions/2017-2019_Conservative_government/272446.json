        "additional_details": "I advocate the idea that a by-election must be forced in the case a MP decides to defect to another party and if the MP is re-elected the people clearly made there judgement on the bases of the character of the MP and not so much the party. If not then the people clearly have shown they voted not on the person but the party and its policy's it holds.\r\n\r\nThis is to ensure those who voted are not betrayed by those who defect.",
        "background": "It has come to my attention that MP personal interests are more important then those who vote them into office to decide to cross to another party when they feel like it out of there own personal interests this is disgraceful to the idea of democracy and how people vote.",
