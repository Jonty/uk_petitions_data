        "action": "Reverse the decision to exclude animal sentience from the EU Withdrawal Bill",
        "additional_details": "Animals have long held the status of being sentient beings in the UK, through legislation created in the EU. This means they are recognised as being capable of feeling emotions such as joy and compassion, but also fear, suffering and terror. The vote in Parliament, narrowly won by the Government, removes this status from all animals in the UK, and is a massive blow for the welfare of wildlife, pets and livestock alike.",
        "background": "In response to the decision by the UK Government, to exclude the status of animals, as sentient beings, in the EU withdrawal bill, is not only a terrible blow for animal welfare but also a significant step backwards for the UK as one of the major nations in the world.",
