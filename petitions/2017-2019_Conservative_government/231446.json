(https://t.co/UdsNlI3mLQ)\r\n\r\nDespite this, a recent study by King's College has shown that 42% of Britons who had heard of the claim still believe it. (https://t.co/9yG1vQQ5xA)\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is important for our democracy that Michael Gove issue a statement to eliminate public confusion over the matter.",

Let\u2019s fund our NHS instead.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe UK Statistics Authority has debunked this claim, we demand from Mr Gove an explanation of his position.",
