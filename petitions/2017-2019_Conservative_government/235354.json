All these 'incidents' and more serve to mislead, misinform, and mask truth for political gain, rather than to achieve what is proven or correct for the country. Any and all such claims and actions should be challengeable and verified by an independant body in a swift and timely fashion to provide clarity before urgent decisions are made.",
        "background": "British politics is becoming more and more influenced by questionable declarations and actions. The result is the potential misleading of parliament and the public. MPs should be trustworthy but currently there is no mechanism to enforce this. They should be penalised if they do this intentionally.",
