        "additional_details": "Although LG*T in itself is still somewhat exclusive, I do believe changing Bi to Pan will be a new milestone in showing how inclusive the community can be. We need to consider those who are not included - in the social construct of gender and sexuality - and be more open minded to others' identity. \r\n\r\nI believe we should move away from indirect ways of oppressing non-binary people, who do not feel included in today's societal view of gender, and let them know they have a place in the community.",
        "background": "I am calling for the debate to take place on making the LGBT more inclusive - changing B to P (Bisexual to Pansexual). As bisexual is an outdated, exclusive and unrepresentative term, I am calling for pansexuality to be on the front of the LBGT, to be more inclusive to non-binary people.",
