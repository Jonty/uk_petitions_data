        "additional_details": "Wales, Scotland and France already adopt the system and have released statistics to show its success, the UK currently benefit by taking donor organs that are not used in these countries. Those not wishing to donate can opt out. \r\n\r\nAs of today there are 6423 adults awaiting organs in the UK and 166 children. 1751 transplants have taken place this year since April 2017. \r\n\r\nIf you, your child or a loved one needed an organ to live, would you take it? Organ Donation saves lives.",
        "background": "Marnie Brace went on the Organ Donation list at 3 month old making her the youngest individual awaiting transplant. Due to a shortage of organs in the UK, Marnie sadly died. \r\nMarnie faced a campaign drive in 2016 and fought hard, her legacy is to bring change in the UK and save lives.",
