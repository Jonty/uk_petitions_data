        "additional_details": "Smaller, more frequent exams could also help to reduce the stress students experience as well as record the progress they make throughout the course. Not only would a clearer representation of a student be seen by universities and other further education routes, but this could help to combat the complicated application process in the UK. Many other countries like France only make university offers when there are grades present and this could guide our system in a similar direction.",
        "background": "GCSE and A level students currently study their courses for 2 years for their grade to be determined on 1-4 exams at the end. This cannot truly reflect a person's ability as the grade is drawn from such a small average. If it was taken from smaller, more regular exams, grades would reflect reality.",
