        "background": "Here in the UK, we are one of the only countries in the world, that does not have a falconry license.\r\nThere is a huge issue where anyone can own and breed and sell birds of prey, to people who have no experience. \r\nI encounter 10-12 owls and Hawks each year kept in parrot cages and rabbit hutches",
