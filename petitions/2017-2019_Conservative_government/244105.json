        "action": "Make cannabis legal for recreational & medical use.",
        "additional_details": "The UK are falling behind other countries, I don't know if this is due to the current money made from the UK growing it medically. But I believe it's because the government are scared to say yes, scared they will be in the paper under bad headlines. This is accepted almost everywhere, the UK could make millions from TAX spend it on the NHS, the police, etc, instead of wasting TAX arresting petty cannabis smokers. Check alcohol & tabbaco deaths and explain why they are legal and cannabis is not.",
        "background": "I'm sure your aware of the benefits of cannabis, many US states, Canada & other countries have made it legal. The UK are the largest producer of medical cannabis so we know it's positive medical effects. Plus this would reduce police cost and time to spend on more serious drug crimes.",
