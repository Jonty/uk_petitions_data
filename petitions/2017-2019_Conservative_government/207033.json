        "additional_details": "Few can do the 9-5 job once they have become parents.Living in London, where the commute time is 1 hour average, one is restricted to apply for jobs in surrounding areas and even when landing interviews they are not flexible. Just last week, a global luxury company was not willing to negotiate 15 minutes as I was restricted with the nursery opening hours. Hunting for a job is daunting once you are a parent, as you constantly have to explain why the office hours are just not working for you.",
        "background": "Becoming a parent shouldn't mean the death of your career ambitions. I request that the government review the law and support and favour business that offer a certain amount of flexible roles for parent job seekers, new employees as well as existing employees.",
