There have been 72,843 in brazil alone. It's reported that some of the land will be used for cattle pastures and planting.\r\n\r\nThe Amazon is the world\u2019s largest and diverse tract of rainforest, with millions of species and billions of trees. It stores vast amounts of planet-warming carbon dioxide and produces 6 percent of the planet\u2019s oxygen.",
        "background": "40% of global emissions come from livestock. People need to know what effects it can do to the planet. The petition is about creating more awareness and making people think twice before buying. If we have to collectively change our diet and reduce industrial agricultural farming then lets do it!",
