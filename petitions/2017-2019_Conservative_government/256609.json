        "action": "Extend article 50 for at least 1yr for a referendum between the deal and remain.",
        "additional_details": "The EU 27 are likely to allow this extension for a second referendum, or People\u2019s Vote, and the longer time would enable further cross-party discussions to improving the deal. We would take apart in the EU elections.\r\n\r\nElectoral laws were broken by the leave side. This alone is enough to warrant a 2nd vote. \r\n\r\nPolling suggests that most voters now want to remain in the EU. \r\n\r\nhttps://endthechaos.co.uk/blog/majority-of-voters-now-want-to-remain-in-the-european-union/\r\n\r\nWe all need a people\u2019s vote.",
        "background": "This is the democratic way forward. At the time of the referendum in 2016, no-one, not even the political leaders, knew what leaving the EU entailed. It would be a betrayal of the people NOT to allow a people\u2019s vote on such a changed situation.",
