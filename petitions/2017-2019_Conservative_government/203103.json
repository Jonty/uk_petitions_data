One small extra step to breathe into a breathalyser before your engine will turn on would be nothing. \r\nThe cost of these units is around \u00a31000, but vehicle (and motorbike) manufacturers could drive that cost right down with bulk orders.\r\nThey have been around for years - why are they not an every day part of cars and motorbikes?",
