        "additional_details": "Theresa May stated in June that we have a \"moral duty to leave this world in a better condition than what we inherited\" - see the following BBC article: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-48596775. Meanwhile, the IPCC's 2018 report states that changes must be made in the next 12 years to prevent warming of 1.5C - see the IPCC report here: https://report.ipcc.ch/sr15/pdf/sr15_spm_final.pdf - and since then, some experts have reduced this to 18 months. Act now, before it's too late.",
        "background": "In June 2019, Theresa May committed to a \"net-zero\" target for greenhouse gas emissions to be reached by 2050. However, given the increasing amount of evidence - notably IPCC reports - that action needs to be taken immediately to combat climate change, a 30+ year target is not good enough.",
