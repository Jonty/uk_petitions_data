The FT reported that it was 'highly anomalous' for those companies to report no gap. Since the FT scrutinised the figures of Hugo Boss, who initially reported zero pay gap, they have amended their submission to a mean gender pay gap of 32.6%. The law was introduced to prevent organisations from hiding their gender pay gaps. Let\u2019s not allow them to  report false data.",
        "background": "The Financial Times recently reported that some companies who have submitted data on the gender pay gap within their organisations have produced \u2018highly improbable\u2019 figures. The government must set up a task force to investigate them and impose fines on companies who have filed inaccurate data.",
