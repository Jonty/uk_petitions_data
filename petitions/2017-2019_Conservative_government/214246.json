        "additional_details": "Schools especially are a sacred place which should lead by example with positive direction and guidance alone.  Speaking negative of people or demonstrating negativity is an encouragement to negative behaviour, not a way of preventing it.  Furthermore, the miss use of power by writing reports based on opinions is not only a false definition of character it is also not based on fact, so with this in mind schools and social services should not be entitled to do so.",
        "background": "Writing reports that are based on opinion would stereotype a child prevent them from the experience of unconditional positive regard and its positive effect.  Furthermore, the negative regard in a report could create a self fulfilling prophecy, which isnt encouraging a positive growing environment.",
