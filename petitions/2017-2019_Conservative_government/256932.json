        "additional_details": "A general election will provide an opportunity for candidates to clearly state their position on BREXIT, including their views on continued membership of the Customs Union, the Single Market, and the jurisdiction of the ECJ. Candidates can also declare their position on whether or not no deal is preferable than a bad deal. This will allow the electorate to vote based on their individual views and remove the argument inherent in a referendum that some options were not presented.",
        "background": "The electorate has no confidence in either the Government or Parliament. The current Government has made a total mess of BREXIT, and Parliament has compounded the chaos. A second referendum will not solve this, no matter what the outcome.",
