        "action": "Theme parks should give financial compensation if queue times reach 1 hour",
        "additional_details": "During the 2019 summer holidays, queues at Chessington exceeded 120 mins for Vampire on several days and even reached 150 mins on one occasion. Thorpe Park, Legoland and Blackpool Pleasure beach have all had 120+ mins queue times at some point in the summer. All major parks had 60 mins queue times on most days so I suggest 50% compensation for 60+ mins queues and 100% compensation for 120+ mins queues.",
        "background": "Millions of people visit theme parks but their dreams of a great day out are crushed by queues. It is rare for the major parks to have queues under 1 hour for their main rollercoasters. Some parks even have queues of two hours or longer. This is unacceptable and guests shoule be compensated",
