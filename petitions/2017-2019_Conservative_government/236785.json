        "additional_details": "Estimates show that 525 million charity bags (2,625 tonnes of plastic) are delivered per year in the UK. Only 3% of bags are used. As a result, 509 million charity bags (over 2,500 tonnes of plastic) end up in landfill each year.\r\n\r\nPlastic bags are made using non-renewable resources and a lot of energy. They are not biodegradable or recyclable. They pollute both land and sea, kill wildlife and end up in the food chain as microplastics. Plastic bags release toxic chemicals hazardous to health.",
        "background": "Large plastic charity bags in wrapped in plastic envelopes are delivered to thousands of households in the U.K. every week. Only a tiny percentage are actually used for donations. These bags contribute to the worldwide plastic issue which we are trying to tackle with the plastic bag charge.",
