        "action": "Increase the maintenance loan for all students, regardless of parental income.",
        "additional_details": "This is because, even if your parents earn \u00a340,000 which is above the \u00a327,000 average salary, they may still be tied into a mortgage and with interest rates rising, they can't just find extra money to fund their children's university living expenses. Therefore, if the maintenance loan was increases to at least \u00a310,000 for all students, those whose parents earn slightly more but don't have a lot more disposable income will not be as disadvantaged and will have improved quality of life.",
        "background": "The maintenance loan is designed to help students with the cost of living, however for certain students it doesn't even cover accommodation costs as the loan is reduced for those students whose parents have certain incomes. I argue this should be increased to a minimum of \u00a310,000 for all students.",
