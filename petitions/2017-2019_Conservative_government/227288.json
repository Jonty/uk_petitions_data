        "additional_details": "This petition is to request that legal aid is made available on all cases regarding child law so that no person fighting for custody or access under private law is penalized or forced into debt by having to fund court cases over their child, every parent has a right and legal aid should be available for all not just the privileged few that are able to represent themselves. Without this those on benefits are unable to have assistance from solicitors to help with their case",
        "background": "Currently the law with regards to legal aid and childrens cases only comes into effect if the case is in a public interest, private cases are not covered under legal aid and because of this those who can not afford a solicitor are being forced to prove they are exempt from paying court costs.",
