        "additional_details": "The Brexit Referendum was a non binding vote on a simple abstract notion of leaving the EU.  No details of the precise meaning of how this would be done were given during the referendum. A negotiated deal and No Deal Brexit has been rejected by MP's, the elected representatives of the People in parliament on several occasions.  Any attempt by a newly formed Government to use procedural tricks to prevent a meaningful approval would seem to violate parliamentary sovereignty and The Peoples rights.",

Parliament must be given a meaningful opportunity to approve. Alternatively the government should seek approval by the people directly",
