        "additional_details": "They have tirelessly attempted to block the referendum result, manipulating the word leave in to deal or no deal perspectives in order to deter the British public. Third party corroborators, EU officials, and biased broadcasters have worked together to deny that democracy be upheld. Involving themselves in political agendas that are not their own. The world is watching in awe, disgust, and disbelief at the corrosion of democracy in its very origin.",
        "background": "We voted for leave in 2016 and parliament has and is doing everything in its power to thwart the democratic will of the electorate. Using unequivocal skullduggery to undermine this vote to leave the unstable corroborative dictatorship that is the European Union.",
