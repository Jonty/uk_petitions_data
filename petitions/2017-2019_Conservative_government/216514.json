        "additional_details": "After investing \u00a338 million on north worle district center, North Somerset council have made cuts to funding towards mental health services, 1in4 people most noticeably. 1in4 people is a safe raven for the struggling; \u201cit\u2019s somewhere you can talk and meet others like you without feeling insignificant.\u201d Indisputably, taxpayers would rather know their sisters, uncles, brothers, aunties, nephews, nieces and parents are safe than to know a car park will, as reiterated by the council, make profit.",
        "background": "Cuts are being made when most detrimental. People rely on these services to keep them going, it gives them hope and allows them to listen and be listened to. places like these give those struggling a mere feeling of safety and content, and as soon as June the 1st, this will be snatched from them.",
