        "additional_details": "In order to take decisive action on the important issues that face us, our Prime Minister needs to have a credible mandate.\r\n\r\nInternal elections within the Tory Party mean that the next UK Prime Minister will be voted in by 0.2% of the population. This means that our next PM will lack credibility within parliament and on a global stage. \r\n\r\nCalling a general election enables us to take the decisive action needed to move our country forward.",
