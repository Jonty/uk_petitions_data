        "additional_details": "Teachers do not have the training nor are they receiving the support to deal with these children's specific needs. Their peers are left frightened, suffer from anxiety and their education is also being affected due to these violent and aggressive outbursts. Children should not be witnessing violence at school and schools should most definitely not be normalising violence. Teaching children resilience is not an adequate solution to being physically assaulted or witnessing violent outbursts.",
        "background": "Every child has the right to be educated in a safe environment, unfortunately violence in schools is becoming increasingly more frequent. The SNP's policy of mainstreaming children with ASN, especially those with behavioural needs is exacerbating this situation.",
