        "additional_details": "Installed solar capacity in the UK at present is woefully inadequate, in spite of its obvious benefits. In combination with decentralised energy & heat storage, maximising our solar generating capacity will make for a more robust and reliable grid which is cheaper to run & less reliant on transmission infrastructure.\r\nThe government must make it a less financially-prudent option for local authorities, property developers, homeowners and landlords NOT to install rooftop solar and storage systems.",
        "background": "Solar, and other renewable forms of power generation, is now more economically feasible than burning fossil fuels. The UK Government must act to accelerate the transition to maximum solar capacity as rapidly as possible. Making power near where it'll be used makes more sense than large solar farms.",
