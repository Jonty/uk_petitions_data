I\u2019m sure people have had a lot of issues similar to this with work and education and by speaking to staff in person and on the phone, I\u2019m telling you, they don\u2019t really care. \r\nThe strikes are making us pay for other forms on transport and ruining the Christmas period for many especially the elderly.",
