        "additional_details": "The Hydrogen for Transport Programme (HTP) already funds Hydrogen infrastructure, through the Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) and will provide funding via an open competition for both Hydrogen Refuelling Stations (HRS) and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. \r\n\r\nThe UK can produce its own hydrogen, using renewables, BUT sale of new electric cars will take too long. \r\n\r\nDevelopment of ENGINE REPLACEMENT KITS, that can be installed by any garage, could accelerate take-up by a factor of 10 or more.",
        "background": "Hydrogen Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells are a far better option than Lithium Batteries for electric vehicles. Investing in this technology could create thousands of new, green UK jobs. Funding the manufacture of Engine Replacement Kits could accelerate de-carbonisation of UK vehicles tenfold.",
