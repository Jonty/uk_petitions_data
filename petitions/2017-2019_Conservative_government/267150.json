        "additional_details": "For a 20 year period between 1999-2018 there were 310 cases of suicide among UK regular Armed Forces personnel: 292 of males, and 18 of females.\r\nCharities like Combat Stress only offer short term treatment. Leaving the men and women to cope alone. Some never have anyone to turn to. \r\nThey are left with feelings that no one outside of the Armed Forces will ever understand.\r\nFamilies suffer too. \r\nWe urge the government to put more measures into place for long term care. Not having to fight GP's for referrals for any kind of mental health care.\r\nWe need action now.",
