        "additional_details": "As a twin mother myself, I am very familiar with the costs of childcare. I currently work part time hours around my twins, but my wage doesn\u2019t touch the surface. \r\nTo work full time and have my twins in full time nursery would be more than I could earn. \r\nMany multiples parents feel the same, and would love to work, or at least benefit financially from working, but cannot due to the costs. Yet non working parents are eligible for free childcare.",

Give multiples parents a chance to get back to work and allow free childcare places (37hours) for twins, triplets & quads aged 2 years - equal to non working parents",
