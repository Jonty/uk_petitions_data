        "additional_details": "It is said that people who spend the night checking social media are more likely to suffer from mood problems such as bipolar disorder, and rate themselves as less happy and more lonely. In a generation where these young adults have adapted their lives around social media, knowledge and especially congruence to these vulnerable individuals can be given which could be said as more effective than someone older who is not able to sympathise with someone who is struggling.",
        "background": "I am a young adult wanting to become a counsellor. I've been told numerous times that I 'do not have the life experience to go into this career at my age'. For young adults in this day & age social media is a big part of our lives and due to our age we really understand it and could be a huge help.",
