        "action": "Ask the Queen to dissolve parliament, and form a national government ala 1931.",
        "additional_details": "In the late 1920s and early 1930s the British government was locked in a party political struggle and had stopped governing the nation. King George took the step of dissolving parliament and asked Ramsey McDonald to form a national government to rule in the national interest, which he did by picking from both parties, those who objected became the official opposition.\r\n\r\nOver the next 8 years this allowed for a functional government to start rebuilding the country and our political system.",
        "background": "Our political system is in disarray, both parties are riven with infighting and Westminster is locked in stalemate. \r\n\r\nOur political system is a historical anachronism, and by placing a national government we can force change and start to develop a new system fit for the 21st century.",
