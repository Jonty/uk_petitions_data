        "additional_details": "Stress, sick leave and even a suicide have been attributed to the amount of work load being put onto the shoulders of untrained individuals. People have lost faith in the service, both consumers and employees alike have been fobbed off for too long. \r\n\r\nMany news outlets have commented on the on going changes at the FOS, none in a good light. The only way the general public will see a positive influence by the FOS, is if a new chief executive is installed, one who can take back control.",
        "background": "The Ombudsman Service was founded in order to bring fair play to the financial market and to help consumers in need. \r\n\r\nUnder Caroline's leadership the quality of work and training given to investigators is shockingly bad. A new direction needs to be taken by the service to restore faith.",
