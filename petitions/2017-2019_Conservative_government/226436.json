Mothers all over the United Kingdom feel judged and a leppor in society for feeding thier babies, this needs to change. Breast milk contains key nurients and fats benificial to a baby and also lessens the risk of cancer and obeseity, lessening the pressure on the NHS in these areas.",
        "background": "I became a mother in 2018 and found that according to recent satistics breastfeeding has fallen dramatically, whilst activists are concentrating on mother shaming, we should be looking at public views and judgement on breastfeeding mothers. It is due to shaming that mothers cannot breastfeed.",

We're therefore not sure what you would like the UK Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could call for the Government to start a public information campaign about breastfeeding in public, if that is what you would like to happen."
