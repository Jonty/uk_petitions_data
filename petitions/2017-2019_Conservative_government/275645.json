        "action": "Introduce regulations on paid lootboxes/'surprise mechanics' in videogames.",
        "additional_details": "The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee recently published a report (HC 1846) which recommended that lootboxes 'should not be sold to children playing games', and that gambling laws should apply to them. Even if certain industry bodies may disagree with this, it's worth remembering that the implementation of lootboxes is an active choice when creating a game, and there is nothing stopping them from just not including lootboxes in the first place. And seriously does anyone like lootboxes?",
        "background": "In recent years, the widespread use of 'lootboxes' in videogames has been a cause for serious concern, as they expose children to gambling, whilst the government and the videogame industry still neglect to regulate them. Whilst they remain unregulated, the problems they cause will only get worse.",
