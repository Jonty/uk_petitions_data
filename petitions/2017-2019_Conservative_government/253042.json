To the average person it was just a simple yes/no vote and all they had to do was read some very simple information from either side. None of this was backed up with real evidence at all. The government have handled it badly.\r\n\r\nI am not asking for one side of the argument to vote here, I am asking both sides to see how badly the government have handled everything so far and how they have put everything at risk.",

We are in a position of power whether you are for staying in the EU or leaving it does not matter. Now is our time to speak.",
