        "additional_details": "Here are the bottom 6 constituencies with percentages less than 35%.\r\nCeredigion with 29.2%\r\nBelfast South with 30.4%\r\nLanark and Hamilton East with 32.58%\r\nNorth East Fife 32.86 %\r\nEdinburgh North and Leith 34%\r\nEdinburgh West 34.3 %\r\n\r\nIn fact there are 174 seats with less than 50% of a vote. Therefore the person getting into the seat only represents less than 50% of the voters. This is not a fair vote",
        "background": "The results for the last general election in a lot of constituencies were not conclusion, e.g. South Belfast won with 30.4% of the vote. Changing to the Single Transferable Vote would be a much fairer way in determining who is the ideal candidate for parliament in a constituency.",
