        "additional_details": "The display is a show of absolute disrespect for democracy.\r\n\r\nMr Khan has always been an avid supporter of the remain camp and has not hidden it. But to use public funding to push this agenda is out of line with Sadiq Khan's role as Mayor of London. \"According to the Mayor's office, a net expenditure of \u00a32.3m was approved for this year's fireworks display\" (Evening Standard article by A. McShane). Why couldn't this funding be used to show the Union Jack in a show of support for the UK?",
        "background": "The New Years Eve firework display is supposed to be a fantastic show to celebrate the end and begining of the years. However, this year it was hijacked by the political motive of the Mayor of London, with what appears to be the EU flag being displayed on the London Eye.",
