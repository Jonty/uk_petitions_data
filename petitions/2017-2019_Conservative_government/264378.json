        "additional_details": "The 'Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill' is a proposed bill that would allow the extradition of fugitives to mainland China, threatening judicial independence & civil liberties. Public opposition is widespread, but the government refuses to scrap the bill, which also threatens the safety of British Nationals & tourists in HK. The Foreign Secretary must speak out against the bill & act, via sanctions or other means, to halt its passage.",
        "background": "The UK Government has a responsibility towards the people of Hong Kong to safeguard the autonomy and fundamental freedoms outlined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which the Extradition Bill threatens to seriously undermine.
