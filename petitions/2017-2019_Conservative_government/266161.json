        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson MP previously auctioned off a picture of a bus which raised \u00a38,000 for charity. As a potential PM his artistic qualities should be well known & shown widely, not left as a hobby for his quiet times. Sir Winston Churchill, Johnson's hero himself made fabulous art works that are inspirational to us all. From a famous quote from Churchill  \"If you are going through hell, keep going\"\r\nsee here https://bbc.in/2J6WD74  https://bbc.in/2xp6BeJ  https://bit.ly/2ZNL1wq  https://bit.ly/2Jd15kv",

We believe as potential future PM and even as the former Mayor of London these would be of hugely historical and political, artistic value to the British people and should be shown publicly & auctioned for charity.",
