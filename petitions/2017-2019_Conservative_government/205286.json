        "action": "the 2016 Referendum was tampered with by a foreign state and is therefore void",
        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister has conceded that Russia has unduly influenced the Referendum, using online methods of subterfuge.  Meddling by a foreign power in the democratic process, allegedly with the connivance of some of the Leave campaign, is grounds for invalidating the result. The implications of this action have not been fully determined at this stage, but the evidence to date shows that Russia meddled with the referendum and it is not a valid vote on this count alone.",
        "background": "Now that it has been shown that Russia has unduly influenced the 2016 Referendum, it must be declared invalid and all courses of action arising must be scrapped. Whatever actions to be taken from this point are a matter of further discussion.",
