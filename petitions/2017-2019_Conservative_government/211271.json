BUT how long with the quarry be there before that happens.",
        "background": "Dartford residents have lately received letters titled \"consultation on the minerals sites plans\", this is for the government to evaluate the site to see if its worth putting a quarry in to mine gravel. This we have been told by the council will create LOTS of noise, dust and mess.",
