        "additional_details": "The Constitution of the USA is a genius piece of writing giving all Americans the freedom of thought, Speech & religion, but the UK is bias and radical Left Wingers control the media. Despite the opinions of the people being split near enough in half, our government still panders to the far left and censors conservative views. Lies are spread but the media & the government, schools & universities continue to shut people down. Bring back the debate and stop shutting people down. Enough is enough.",
        "background": "Freedom of Speech is not a guaranteed right in the UK. After the recent banning of right Wing campaigners from entering the UK and the continuous silencing & censorship of the British citizens that have opinions that differ from Radical left Wing ideologies, enough is enough. Protect free thought!",
