I have often wondered what would have happened if we had no NHS!....we would have both had to sell our homes to pay for the treatment. I thank my lucky stars often for a lot our country has to offer........but it is being dismantled and must stop. We need to fund our services.",
        "background": "Too many services have closed or are at breaking point due to a massive reduction in funding. We are led to believe it is because we are a nation of scroungers; i strongly disagree. If all organisations paid a fair amount of tax, the UK will be able to support our vulnerable and those in need.",
