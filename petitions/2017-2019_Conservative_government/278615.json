        "additional_details": "The 2016 referendum result was based on the illegally funded Leave campaign's lies and deliberate misinformation. We now know that leaving the EU will mean at least 95% of us will be poorer (and not just in terms of money). Millions of people have marched for a People's Vote and more that six million people signed a petition to revoke Article 50.\r\nLet the people have their say.",
        "background": "It is clear that a general election in December will not resolve the current political crisis. While most of our MPs do not seem to realise that the best deal with the EU is the one we currently have it is unlikely that Article 50 will be revoked. We now need a properly structured People's Vote.",
