This needs to change. Trans students should have the same rights and opportunities as cisgender students. \r\nIn certain states in America and countries all around the world, a law like this has been introduced, and the prospect of gender neutral bathrooms has also been explored and sometimes used.",
        "background": "I'm a student at a high school in Norwich who partakes in student council meetings, student support sessions and my main job is to support LGBT+ students & students with mental health issues.\r\nI think that it is wrong that trans students should have to use the bathroom of the gender they were born.",

For example, you could start a new petition calling for government funding for gender-neutral toilets or for legislation requiring the provision of gender-neutral toilets.\r\n \r\n"
