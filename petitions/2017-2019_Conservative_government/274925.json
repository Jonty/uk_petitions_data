Remain MPs have abused the permission we've given them to try and introduce loopholes so they don't have to obey the law and leave the EU on the 31st October. It is disgusting and it is deplorable. There is no other profession in this country that can introduce loopholes if they don't like the law. These remain MPs think because they make the rules they can break them. Well think again. I don't recognise the Benn Bill. A majority of the public does not recognise the Benn Bill",
