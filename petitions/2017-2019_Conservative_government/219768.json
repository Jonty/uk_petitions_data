        "additional_details": "This change will have a serious impact upon many families, especially single parents and the least well-off, many of whom do not own a car. It will also be yet another disincentive for all families to choose to leave their cars at home, and therefore the removal of the child add-ons will negatively impact on Devons air quality, traffic congestion, and contribution to climate. The increase equates to an above normal price increase and is totally unfair.",
        "background": "Stagecoach has announced that, from 29th April 2018, they are abolishing the \u00a31 child add-on ticket for journeys in Devon. These are to be replaced by single fares or a  Child Dayrider costing considerably more.",
