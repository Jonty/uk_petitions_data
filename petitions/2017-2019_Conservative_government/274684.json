        "additional_details": "The \"Carbon-Impact Label\" would be advisory, similar to the \"traffic-light\" labels that indicate food nutritional breakdown. The label could include a clear colour coded score, calculated by estimating the environmental impact of each step in the production chain of the product. Factors could include but not be limited to, the CO2, and wider environmental costs of: raw materials, packaging, shipping, food and livestock growth and deforestation.",
        "background": "Consumers have the right to make environmentally informed purchases. Requiring companies to display a \"Carbon-Impact Label\" on their products would incentivise reduction in their environmental impact, and empower customers. Labels would display the estimated environmental impact of each product.",
