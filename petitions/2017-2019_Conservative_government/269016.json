        "additional_details": "According to MentalHealth.org 50% of mental health problems are established by age 14, this shows the need for support for young people. We also know that 1 in 4 people in the United Kingdom will at some time in their life experience a mental health issue. This is why I believe we need support for young people to teach them about mental health in which they could then carry that information over later in life.",
        "background": "As young people we sometimes feel that there is a stigma around the issue of mental health. We often see and hear stories about people feeling alone in stressful times during school such as  exams. We also feel that people often think about physical health and don\u2019t know enough about mental health.",
