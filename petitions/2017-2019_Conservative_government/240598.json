        "additional_details": "In many other countries conjugal visits are permitted. However, in the U.K. it is not permitted. An advantage of allowing conjugal visits is that prisoners tend to follow the rules for fear of losing their right to have a visit. Although, the biggest advantage is families suffer somewhat less than they currently do.\r\n\r\nNORWAY ALLOWS CONJUGAL VISITS AND IT HAS ONE OF THE LOWEST RE-OFFENDING RATES IN THE WORLD, CURRENTLY STANDING AT 20%. IN COMPARISON, BRITISH PRISONERS RE-OFFEND WITHIN A YEAR OF BEING RELEASED.",
        "background": "Approximately 80,000 people in the UK have a partner incarcerated in a British jail. With a limited number of visits per month, typically lasting for a maximum of 1 hour each, prison can have an almost instantaneously damaging effect on a marriage or relationship.",
