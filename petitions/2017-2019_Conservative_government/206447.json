        "additional_details": "The infrastructure already exists to provide every home in the UK with free broadband and would not be an expensive project. BT Openreach have an undeserved monopoly in this market and should be nationalised to provide this public service. The minimal cost could be added to our council tax bills and would be a lot less than most homes currently pay for broadband. Like most public services those less able to pay, would pay less through means tested lower council tax bills but all would benefit",
        "background": "Broadband is a necessity in today's world and should therefore be accessible to all, much like fresh running water and electricity. Surely if every house was provided with broadband through a nationalised BT Openreach, it would be more cost effective than each person arranging their own.",
