        "action": "Make MPs who support protests against LGBT+ lessons safe from suspension.",
        "additional_details": "Recently, Labour MP Roger Godsiff has faced unfair backlash and calls for him to be suspended only because he had publicly shown his support to parents who have a legitimate concern against lessons that teach primary aged school children about adult same-sex relationships and other LGBT+ related topics. MPs should not be bullied into silence by way of threat of losing office if they show signs of opposing their far-left agenda.",
        "background": "It is now increasingly more and more difficult for MPs and local councillors who represent their constituents to show public support to their residents who have a legitimate concern against the teaching of LGBT+ relationships to their children in our schools without being labelled anti-LGBT+.",
