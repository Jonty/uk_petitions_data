        "action": "Get rid of GCSE's as they are a bad way of finding what students' are capable of",
        "additional_details": "It has been stated that students are tested at the wrong time and age in their life which is even more reason to get rid of them. The system is outdated and why cant it change? Why have students learn work they are mostly not going to need again? why not let them learn without the thought of having to remember every bit of information instead of looking forward to learn. Do you want to portray learning as a chore or something that students want to do? Focus on the mental health of students.",
        "background": "GCSE's cause heaps of stress for all students making them very anxious and they find they hardly have any free time to enjoy when its constant stressing over work they need to do for the test. There would be much more efficient ways of showing the potential of a student.",
