        "additional_details": "Pateley Bridge in 2016 awarded the title by the Department for Communities and Local Government as the best High Street.\r\nIn 2018 Pateley Bridge awarded the title Best Village in Yorkshire in the Yorkshire In Bloom competition. \r\nThe High Street shops are all occupied which is unique in the present retail climate.\r\nThe closure of the bank will undoubtedly impact on the community and in turn High Street businesses. Barclays should be stopped from closing this branch\r\nThe Nidderdale Chamber of Trade.",
        "background": "This is the only bank in Pateley Bridge and Nidderdale. This is a massive blow for the community, visitors, businesses and those without transport or computers. Rural communities decline without local banks. There is only one outside cash point in the village. The nearest banks are 15 miles away.",
