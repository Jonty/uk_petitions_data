        "additional_details": "Currently if a cyclists commits an offence on the road he/she will not be held accountable for it unless a police officer was present at the time. If all cyclists have number plates fitted traffic cameras and cctv can catch those committing the offence and automatically issue a fixed penalty notice over time this alone will reduce offences and make the roads safer for all who use them.",
        "background": "If all cyclists have number plates traffic offences committed by them can be reported. If a cyclists runs a red light lives could be at risk and the cyclists may not be held accountable but if a number plate was present just like a car that cyclists can then be brought before the court for judgment.",
