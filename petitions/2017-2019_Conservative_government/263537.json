        "action": "To only sell school canteen food in cardboard and paper wrappers",
        "additional_details": "Maybe students could even bring in their own containers from home and be able to purchase them at school along with re-usable straws. The healthy promotions for eating the fruit that schools have on offer are being sold in single use plastic tubs and even slush\u2019s are being sold with plastic straws. Schools are selling stationary to students, so why not make use of ways to promote recycling and ways to help resolve the disaster that will end up occurring on this planet.",
        "background": "So many schools are getting away with selling hundreds of students canteen food and drinks in non- recyclable single use plastics. Not many items at my school come in paper wrappers and cardboard boxes, there should be more variety of recycled packaging and an influence to start recycling.",
