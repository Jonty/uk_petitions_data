        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister is attempting to set a dangerous precedence. He is attempting to bypass parliament to exert the will of a minority of MPs. Are we truly in such a crisis that he cannot allow our elected representatives to sit in Parliament? Boris Johnson cannot be allowed to become the \"Emperor Palpatine\" of the UK and bypass the lawmakers. We the people elect representatives to sit in Parliament and direct the country on our behalf - the PM is trying to ignore them.",
        "background": "The Prime Minister has stated that he intends to shut Parliament which is to prevent the elected Members of Parliament from exercising their powers. Whether we are Remain or Leave - we should not allow the Prime Minister to take away the rights of our elected representatives.",
