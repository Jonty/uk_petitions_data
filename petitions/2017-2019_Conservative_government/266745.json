        "action": "Have a internationally recognised annual Women in Cyber Security day on 1st Sept",
        "additional_details": "Increased diversity & inclusion for women in cyber security will provide them with greater financial stability & economic opportunities in the future. An annual International Women in Cyber Day on September 1st, will demonstrate to girls & women in the industry that they are supported & appreciated for their contribution to this industry. Research has shown, more diversity leads to better problem-solving & resolutions. Also, it has shown that more diversity leads to increased revenue & profits.",
        "background": "In the UK, women make up only 3% of the global cyber security workforce. Engagement for women in cyber security in the UK is low at 11%. Women face unique challenges & barriers which aren't being addressed - leading women to exit the industry thus creating more of a skills gap in cyber security.",
