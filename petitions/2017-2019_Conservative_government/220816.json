        "additional_details": "Insurance companies shouldn\u2019t tar all young drivers with the same brush. Give young drivers 1 chance with a reasonable priced policy if they don\u2019t conform to black box restrictions then hit them with higher insurance cost. This will enable sensible drivers to be able to afford car insurance and will reduce the number of uninsured drivers on our roads. Don\u2019t penalise all young drivers. Stop insurance companies from having a licence to print money.",
        "background": "After my daughter passed her test we began looking for car insurance for a 14 year old Ford Fiesta worth \u00a3800 the quotes ranged from \u00a32000 to \u00a38000. With the black box insurance companies can monitor driving almost in real time so why not give them a chance to prove themselves before hiking up cost",
