        "additional_details": "According to a ComRes, over 40% of Leave supporters back a No-Deal Brexit, a Brexit that would truly honour the result from 2016 yet she chose to scrap it in favour of a mediocre deal of which around 15% of Leave supporters. It isn\u2019t just Brexit she\u2019s made a disaster of, knife crime has soared across the country due to a lack of police as a result of lethal budget cuts by her government. Yet she had the arrogance to claim that falling police numbers had nothing to do with a surge in knife crime",
        "background": "Theresa May\u2019s incompetence as Prime Minister has turned this country into a laughing stock. Whether it be with her mishandling of Brexit, or her failure to tackle knife crime causing it to skyrocket nationwide. Theresa May is a politician that should never have been in PM and it\u2019s time for her to go",
