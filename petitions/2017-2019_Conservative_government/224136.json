AKA non important\r\n.Vehicles that use amber flashing lights include:\r\n\r\nRoad / highway maintenance vehicle \r\nRefuse collection vehicle\r\nBreakdown recovery vehicle\r\nthe list goes on.\r\n\r\nMost vehicles that do any kind of civil work have amber flashing lights, they are abused and misused, giving drivers the indication they are not important. This needs to change. All recovery trucks to have flashing reds fitted so motorist understand drivers need the room to operate. Workers to return home safe, not in a coffin.",
        "background": "In 2018 alone we have had some very tragic incidents on the roads that could of been prevented. A lack of concentration whilst driving at speed is killing innocent workers. More needs to be done to protect workers roadside. Hitting a stationary vehicle on the hard shoulder shouldn't happen.",
