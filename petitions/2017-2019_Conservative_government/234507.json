        "action": "Abandon plans to issue a commemorative 50p Brexit coin in March 2019",
        "additional_details": "The decision to issue a commemorative Brexit coin was made without due regard for those who want the UK to remain in the European Union. EU citizens living in the UK have fears about not being welcome to remain in the United Kingdom and are anxious about the loss of residential rights and privileges. Many British citizens resent the loss of EU citizenship, freedom of movement, and associated privileges because of Brexit, and for some it will cause personal difficulties and hardship.",
        "background": "A large proportion of British citizens do not want to leave the EU or lose EU citizenship. They, like EU citizens living in the UK, view Brexit with dismay. It would be insensitive, or even provocative, to celebrate an event which is perceived by so many as a moment of great sadness.",
