        "additional_details": "According to the House of Commons Library, there has been real growth in professional politicians, people who come to the Commons from a job elsewhere in politics. Some 21 of the MPs elected in 1979 were previously employed in politics, 3.4 per cent of the total.\r\n\r\nBy 2010, there were 90 career professionals on the green benches, 15 per cent of the House. The number of professionals (lawyers, doctors, teachers) is also in decline, and business people entering politics is more or less stable.",
        "background": "In the last 30 years it has become apparent that we have a growing number of career politicians entering Parliament.\r\nThere is a disconnect growing in what the electorate demand of their MP and the actions of the MP when they are elected.\r\nThe electorate are by and large only consulted in elections.",
