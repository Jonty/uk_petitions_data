People claiming asylum in the UK because they fear persecution in their home countries are entitled to some support, but they are not \"illegal immigrants\". People who are found to be in the UK illegally are not entitled to any Government support. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could ask the UK Government to withdraw from all agreements that require the UK to accept immigrants and refugees, if that's what you'd like to happen. \r\n\r\nYou might also like to sign and share this petition: \r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/232414"
