        "additional_details": "the bee extinction does not only put us in danger, it puts animals in danger too! if this does happen, a few days after extinction all plants will stop growing. Which leads to birds with no food, leading to eating slugs and snails, then a larger bird will eat something that eventually we will eat! if you don't really know what pesticides are, it is poison towards insects that kill! Many people think they will hurt us, but we are hurting them! please support our petition to get pesticides removed from the world! some pesticides have already been banned in the EU, lets get them all banned worldwide!!! The plan has been suspended before, let's get it in action",
        "background": "What we do if Bees were extinct? well, we wouldn't have much food! 1/3 of our food is made by bees. If this crisis continues, bees will become extinct! These black and yellow friends provide pollen which is used for growth in plants, I am 12 year old worried for our future!",
