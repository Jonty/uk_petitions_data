        "additional_details": "I am a wheelchair user who visits the Orthotics department regularly to have boots specially made. The building is of an inadequate size for a department that is only going to become busier in years to come. The Royal Orthopaedic Hospital had 8-million-pound spent on the new outpatients department but sadly the Orthotics department was neglected and is now in need of re-building.",
        "background": "The Orthotics department provides orthosis which is a support thats corrects or protects part of the body, it can range from splints, braces or orthopaedic footwear. Unfortunately the department size is inadequate for a department that is constantly in use with hundreds of people visiting every year",
