        "action": "Retain our Freedom of Movement arrangement with other European countries",
        "additional_details": "It is irresponsible to drop the Free Movement arrangement without first evaluating its benefits, costs and potential adaptations. \r\n\r\nThe Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) report found EU immigration to be a net benefit, but made no assessment of the benefit of FM to UK citizens.\r\n\r\nFurther, there has been no exploration of utilising the controls available within FM, the renegotiation of FM as the Swiss did, nor public sentiment on FM options.\r\n\r\nFM should not be abandoned without due assessment.",
        "background": "The Prime Minister recently announced her policy to \"end Free Movement once and for all\". \r\n\r\nHowever, this has been done without due public consultation. The 2016 referendum only gave a choice on EU membership, not the Free Movement framework to which all Western European countries subscribe.",
