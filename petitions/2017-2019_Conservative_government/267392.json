        "additional_details": "Currently, the age classifications are archaic & need to be abolished.\r\nThe minimum wage currently is:\r\n25 and over- \u00a38.21\r\n21 to 24- \u00a37.70\r\n18 to 20- \u00a36.15\r\nUnder 18- \u00a34.35 \r\nUniversal Credit Single Claimant Basic Allowance currently is:\r\nUnder 25: \u00a3251.77 per month\r\n25 or over: \u00a3317.82 per month \r\nIndependent companies should be supported by the government afterwards if they struggle to pay their staff. It would also allow job seekers at any age to be on an equal playing field when applying for a job.",
        "background": "It is unfair for those under 25 working the same job as an over 25 and receive less money. Already our younger generations are at a disadvantage when the cost of living is extortionate.\r\nBy equalising the minimum wage and universal credit, more people will spend more which will benefit the economy.",
