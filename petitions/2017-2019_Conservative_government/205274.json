For example, you could start a new petition explaining how you want the Government and Parliament to change the laws that allow the police to stop and search under certain circumstances, if that's what you want to happen. \r\n\r\nYou could also start a new petition asking the Government to launch an awareness campaign aimed at young people, to make them aware of their rights when being searched, if that's what you want to happen.
