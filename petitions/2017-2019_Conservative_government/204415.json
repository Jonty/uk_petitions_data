If they can't live peacefully in society, then keep them locked up. Obviously murder should be a life sentence, but why shouldn't it be life for someone who mugs someone, GBH etc. They are still a menace to society and know it's wrong, so why should they be given a chance to live again when their actions has destroyed someone else's life.",
        "background": "Prisons should be tougher to start with, why should they get sky and pool tables! There is evidence that some people are actually better off in prison, so commit petty crimes.\r\nIf prisons were tougher with longer sentences it would be more of a deterrent.",
