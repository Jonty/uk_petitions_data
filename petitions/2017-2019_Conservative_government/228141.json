        "additional_details": "The current uniform which includes a navy blue blazer, jumper, cotton shirt and tie leaves the students feeling uncomfortable and more irritated. But by introducing a new light-coloured polo shirt, it would decrease the stress of the students. The polo shirt would take a lot of the weight off the students and decrease pressure of the teachers.",
        "background": "There needs to be lighter uniform for the warm summer and spring seasons. There have been more frequent and extreme heatwaves, which results in students becoming over-heated and stressed for lessons and exams. I would strongly suggest introducing a new polo shirt, which is effective to keep us cool.",
