A lot of dog owners are responsible but a few generally have no idea on the risks their dogs may be to others. Too many people are losing their beloved pets due to the careless attitudes of some reckless dog owners. Even if all dogs had to have pet insurance, this would go someway to help with vet bills etc. Obviously can not replace our beloved girl but we should be able to walk our dogs without fear.",

She fought for her life for six days, bit unfortunately her wounds were too severe for survive. This has been the second reported attack from the same dog.",

They may not be allowed to own a dog in the future and their dog may be destroyed.\r\n\r\nYou can find out how to report a dog here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/control-dog-public/report-a-dog\r\n\r\nWe're therefore not sure what additional action you'd like the Government or Parliament to take.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling on Parliament to change the law, to require all dog owners to have insurance for their dog, if that's what you would like to happen. \r\n\r\n"
