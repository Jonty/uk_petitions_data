Any MP who voted remain should honour the fact the majority voted leave. If an MP wins a local election by 51% they win, it doesn\u2019t mean we back the one who came second and campaign and vote again and again until that one wins.",
        "background": "The majority of the UK voted leave, we\u2019ve had time to sort this mess out. If we can\u2019t get Brexit sorted by the March 29th the Government should be dissolved and any current MP should not be allowed to stand for a seat again at any point in their lifetime because they clearly aren\u2019t up to task.",
