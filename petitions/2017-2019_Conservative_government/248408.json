        "additional_details": "There have been a number of amendments and motions in the commons this last couple of weeks, one of which was whether Article 50 should be withdrawn, and MP's overwhelmingly voted it down.\r\n\r\nI would certainly not like to see another referendum on this, however, if a second referendum or so called 'peoples vote' was to happen at anytime in the future the options should be simple.\r\n1.  Leave with the current withdrawal agreement; or\r\n2.  Leave with no deal.\r\n\r\nLet's just get on with it.",
        "background": "The country has already been asked whether they wanted to remain in the EU or to leave, and that has been decided.  The problem we have now is not whether we should remain or leave, but whether or not we should accept the proposed withdrawal agreement or not.  This is what the MP's disagree on.",
