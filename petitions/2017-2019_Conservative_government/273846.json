        "action": "Lower voting age to 16.",
        "additional_details": "A 16/17 year old is able to pay tax; so why are they declined the right to vote?\r\nReducing the voting age to 16/17 will introduce a further 1,500,000 voters to the electorate and will create a larger influence on political issues. \r\nMany 16/17 year olds are already politically active in environmental and European issues and care deeply for the country and the future of our world; yet with their position in society, they have less opportunity to express their views and put forward opinion.",
        "background": "By signing this petition, it would allow government to discuss this issue. The lowering of voting age would enable 16/17 year olds to vote in a possible upcoming referendum or general election for the future of Britain. It would further our journey to universal suffrage and increase equality.",
