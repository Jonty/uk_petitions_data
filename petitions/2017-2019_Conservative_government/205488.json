In total, 57,750 households were accepted as homeless in 2015/16, up by six per cent from the year before. According to Crisis and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), 275,000 families approached their local authority for homelessness assistance.",
        "background": "The government\u2019s recent vote to\u00a0reject the inclusion of animal sentience in the European Union Withdrawal Bill is a vote to say\u00a0animals can no longer feel pain or emotions. This notion coupled with aggressive austerity measures for the public indicates that MPs lack these same emotions.",
