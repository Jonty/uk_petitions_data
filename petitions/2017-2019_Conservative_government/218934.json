        "additional_details": "Currently, after the age of 18, patients are transferred to adult mental health services and placed in an unfamiliar environment, consequently leading to significant mental distress - a cause close to the Invictus Trust family, after the loss of their son due to similar circumstances. By removing the need for this difficult transition until the age of 24 (from 13), patients can maintain essential bonds with familiar staff into adulthood. Following the approval of this plan, we can expect the mental health of vulnerable patients to avoid setbacks associated with unfamiliar surroundings and staff that they have not yet built a relationship with.",
