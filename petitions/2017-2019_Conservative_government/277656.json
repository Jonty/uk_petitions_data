        "additional_details": "The voice of the people decrees \"Leave the EU.\", and you the Government, are elected by the people, and are servants to the people. You must therefore honour the vote of the people.\r\nWe do not need yet another referendum to clarify what the word 'Leave' actually means. For the people to have a voice in this debate,\r\n- well, just support this petition, and with enough support from the people signing this petition, it must be heard in Parliament.\r\nThat is it.",
        "background": "There should be no conditions, no new laws passed (without the people's consent) about delaying leaving, or putting in conditions that we can only leave if there is this deal or that deal, and that we can't leave without a deal.\r\nSorry, leave means leave. Period.\r\nDeals can come later.",
