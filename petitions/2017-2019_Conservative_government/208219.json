The planned destruction of UK sovereignty and the subjection of all UK citizens to political control by a foreign institution (the EU) was a deliberate act of treason of UK citizens. The continual attempts to keep UK citizens subject to the EU laws is a continuation of this.",

This applies to all UK political parties. The system of PD has been hijacked by  interests from outside the UK with the support of UK MPs.",
