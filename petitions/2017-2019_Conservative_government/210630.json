        "additional_details": "Couples who marry within or outside the UK and have been married for over 5 years are obviously sincere. Having children together makes them more sincere. A desire to work and not access public funds makes them value added to British society. Please encourage families to stay together and live happily in the UK. Please stop encouraging mothers to be single and creating dysfunctional children due to absent fathers. UK is the UNITED KINGDOM not DIVIDED KINGDOM. Keep love and unity as the motto.",

Please stop separating families.  The criteria to qualify for Indefinite Leave to Remain is too strict.",
