        "additional_details": "The route chosen by Esso is excessively destructive of woodland and natural spaces, felling trees and inflicting major disruption on communities, schools and leisure facilities along the entire length.\r\n\r\nThe local adverse impacts outweigh the benefits of the project. If Esso don\u2019t change their application to address these serious issues, it must be rejected.\r\n\r\nThis petition concerns the entire pipeline but details of one of the sites affected by it are here: https://queenelizabethpark.net",
        "background": "The government must reject the current Development Consent Order because the proposed route and the methods by which the pipeline will be installed are too destructive of nature, trees, wildlife, communities and open spaces.",
