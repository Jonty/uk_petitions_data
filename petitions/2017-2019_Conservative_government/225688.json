Something needs to be done to help us get on to the ladder. For example: 10% share of a property and rent the remaining 90% at a realistic price. Too much profit is being made out of properties and not enough is being done to help those in need!",
        "background": "Single parents and lower income families find it hard to make ends meet let alone save to buy a property. Even then, help to buy and other government schemes expect applicants to be earning over \u00a350,000 to be able to apply. This is unrealistic for most families on incomes below \u00a335k.",
