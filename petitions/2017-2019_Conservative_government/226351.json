        "additional_details": "A similar pattern to that of the World Cup exists for the European Championships since 2000. \r\n\r\nITV are the \"unlucky charm\" of the England football team and should be banned from showing any England games during tournament football. Not only do they cause significant damage to the chances of the England team progressing but their coverage is dire. When given the choice, in the World Cup final 2018, 9 million people in the UK chose the BBC over ITV. Lets end this farce now!",
        "background": "Since 2002 the BBC have a record of 67% win ratio in England World Cup matches that they broadcast over 90 minutes. ITV only have a 17% win ratio (thats less than 1 win in 5). ITV should be prevented from showing England matches during the World Cup and European Championship finals.",
