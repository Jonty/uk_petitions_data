        "additional_details": "Mr Tusk's speech given on 21 March 2019 confirming that if UK does not inform EU by 12 April of its intention to hold EU Elections; there is no future for the UK in the EU. Also, Mr Tusk inferred that there is no deadline to the extension. \r\nMrs May in her speech on the same day was adamant that the UK would not remain in EU and that there was no point in holding EU Elections on that basis. \r\nWe are being rushed into a historic & irrevocable decision without due care & comprehensive jurisprudence.",
        "background": "Without 1) a Deal 2) all legislation in preparedness 3) Bill of Rights 4) an over-riding majority consensus in Gov nor in public and 5) a clear understanding of implications, we need more time to make right these wrongs. We need EU representation to afford us more time to do that. We are NOT ready.",
