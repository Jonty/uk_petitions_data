        "additional_details": "AnE has always been busy at night. Telford is a big area and emerging Telford AnE into Shrewsbury AnE at night will make the things worse as the latter would get overcrowded.\r\nPlus talking patients 16 miles away would cost more.",
        "background": "Telford town is no more a small town but has grown big with the numerous new built areas and its nearly a city. Instead of making our local hospital more big, we can not afford to lose our AnE and travel 16miles to the nearest hospital with public transports and/or relying on the ambulances.",
