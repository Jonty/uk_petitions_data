        "additional_details": "I would like for legislation to be introduced that require all door to door marketing to have to abide by which is simple, if there is a sign displayed stating no junk mail etc then they can not deliver and can face prosecution if they fail to adhere to these requests. I have had too many delivery people ignore my signed requests on my letter box and swear at me and give me abuse when I try to hand back their leaflets or ask who they work for. We need to put an end to this.",
