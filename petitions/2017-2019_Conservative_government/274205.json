        "additional_details": "73 members have changed party affiliation since the 2017 general election,  some have even changed twice! The prime example of this would be the MP, Chuka Immuna. Who was voted in as a member of the labour party,  who then became a change UK member and who is now a liberal democrat! The list is long and an embarrassment to democracy and to parliament itself",
        "background": "Since the 2017 general election, many MP'S have changed their political party's without the consent of their constituents. Many people find this behaviour unconstitutional and an abuse of privilege! These Mps were voted in mainly, for their political party persuasion and to serve the people.",
