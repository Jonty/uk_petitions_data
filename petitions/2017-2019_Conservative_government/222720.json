        "additional_details": "The detention centres have been widely criticised since images and audio were released, yet Trump has defended this policy and responded with language comparing these parents and children to animals. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44538110\r\n\r\nTo allow Trump to visit the UK whilst this policy remains in place is unjustifiable.",
        "background": "President Trump is scheduled to visit the UK in July, to meet with the Prime Minister and Royal Family. His current immigration policy includes separating families and imprisoning children. The Prime Minister and Parliament are complicit in this behaviour if they allow this visit to go ahead.",
