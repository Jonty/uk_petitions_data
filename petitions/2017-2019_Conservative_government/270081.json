Waiting list times are rising.\r\n\r\nThis is a shameful record and action is required.",
        "background": "The Conservative Government, in devoting time to disastrous attempts to negotiate a withdrawal agreement with the European Union which commands the support of the House of Commons, has neglected crucial issues such as tackling homelessness, problems with NHS and other important domestic issues.",
