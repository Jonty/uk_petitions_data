        "action": "Increase per-pupil funding for secondary schools.",
        "additional_details": "Some schools have had to narrow their curriculum, which means cuts to performing arts, language subjects and even a shortened school day. Although school funding is at a record high, there has been a major increase in pupil intake, therefore income per pupil has been decreased significantly. This means that schools are not getting the funds they rightfully deserve, and desperately need. Therefore, we call on the government to increase per-pupil funding in secondary schools.",
        "background": "91% of schools have had their per-pupil funding cut over the last five years. To maximise pupil potential, schools need adequate funding from the government. The crippling cuts are paralyzing students\u2019 opportunities, including developing confidence and independence.",
