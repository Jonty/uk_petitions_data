If you think someone may have committed a crime, you could contact the police: https://www.police.uk/contact/ \r\n\r\nIf you're worried about the treatment of students in a particular school, you could speak to the school governors. Details of how to contact them should be on the school website. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition that explains clearly what you'd like to happen. For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Government and Parliament to set up an inquiry to look into whether some school policies have a detrimental impact on children's rights. You'll need to give your full name to start a petition. \r\n\r\nYou might also like to sign and share one or more of these petitions:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/245399\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/233644\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/232890\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/234997\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/242410 "
