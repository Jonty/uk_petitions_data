I've seen so many cases where people clearly don't know how to manage their finances and need solid advice on how to budget.\r\n\r\nNational statistics for Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVAs) show that they are steadily on the rise since their introduction.

It will only get worse unless something is done now.\r\n\r\nProper financial management has to be taught in schools from a young age to prepare children for the future.\r\n\r\nThis could be included in maths or done as a separate subject.",
