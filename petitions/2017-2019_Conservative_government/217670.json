        "additional_details": "To call airstrikes without having evidence is reckless, innocent civilians will die and T. May has pledged her support of this without consulting parliament. How do we benefit in the long run from making Russia our enemy? \nIf parliament discuss it, and there is a gross lack of support it may cause T. May to reconsider and back down. There are other diplomatic options that work better than slaughtering civilians on the orders of Trump. \n\nMore info: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-43765976",
        "background": "T. May has pledged her support for Trump in calling airstrikes in Syria. They have began airstrikes regardless of the lack of evidence of chemical attacks which was the supposed reason for airstrikes in the first place. These are acts of war & the repercussions of this could be lethal for millions.",
