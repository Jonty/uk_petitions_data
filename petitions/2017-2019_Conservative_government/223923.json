        "additional_details": "The site could be demolished around Sep time which not only will cost a lot of money due to the building containing aspestos but will also contest the area. \r\nI feel this site contains a lot of memories for a lot of people, young and old and would be a shame to demolish it. \r\nIt would be nice to reopen the site and use it again for something else rather than demolish it. Reusing this site could bring more people to the area, could benefit local businesses and continue the heratige of the site.",
        "background": "The Worcester city council are making sale arrangements with Sanctuary housing and the YMCA to develop a site that provides property for the homeless. This is something which many locals are against and we would like to hear your views on this. Please use the petition to voice your opinion on this.",
