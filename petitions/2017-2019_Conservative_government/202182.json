        "additional_details": "Think about this, currently around 7 out of 10 students receive 5 or more GCSE. So 3 out of 10 gets less than 5 GCSEs or maybe nothing. Is this fair??? Do you want a world where some grows high and some goes low. No!!. I definitely don't, we want equality. People come from different backgrounds and this means different lifestyles and motivation. Giving out rewards is the perfect way to motivate any kind of students, I mean not just certificates which just contains your name and grade on it.",
        "background": "Basically I think we should reward students who do well at GCSE. This is would make students more motivated and even the students with lack of motivation would want to pass. Also this will dramatically improve the country's economically growth in future and that's likely to mean less crime rate etc.",
