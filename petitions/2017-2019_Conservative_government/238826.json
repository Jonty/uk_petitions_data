        "additional_details": "Teen pregnancies are the main cause of young girl deaths in the UK and in other countries. Not only does it carry an enormous risk of the mother dying but it also carries risk of the baby dying or being born with a disabilty/birth defect. Young girls and boys alike should be educated of this before having unsafe sex. My aim is to educate adolosecent minds from year 7 what dangers teen pregnancies have and how they affect everyone. With just your signature, we can help tackle this problem.",
        "background": "In our day of age, many young girls as young as 13-17 are getting pregant without any knowledge of teen pregnancies. Many of these young women proceed with the pregnancy as they do not know the risks it has.",
