        "additional_details": "The government is insisting on pushing ahead with an agenda that cannot be agreed upon, even within it's own majority party. Furthermore; the referendum, itself, was not particularly convincing on either side of the argument. This is a complete failure of the UK government and something that a vast majority of citizens of the United Kingdom can absolutely agree on (74% in polls). Cancel Article 50 before more damage is done to the UK and its reputation and people.",
        "background": "The current government is in disarray. There is a distinct lack of clear leadership and plans set in order to effectively action the UK leaving the EU.  \r\nThe Leave.EU campaign investigation still has outcomes to be decided - including the outright lies that were fed to the general public.",
