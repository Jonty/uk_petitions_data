        "additional_details": "It is our belief that this current Government are acting in a malicious, spiteful and vindictive manner as they believe John Bercow has not acted in their interests but rather in the interest of Parliament allowing a voice to back bench MPs to hold the Government to account over matters of National importance.  Bestowal of the Peerage should not be party political but an acknowledgement of the hard work and sacrifice the office of Speaker entails.",
        "background": "After 11 years of service to the UK Parliament as Speaker of the House John Bercow has announced he is retiring the Chair on 31st October 2019.  A tradition in this country going back 230 years that a retiring Speaker is automatically gifted a life peerage is being refused by the current Government.",
