This move is only deterring sexual assault victims from taking their cases to court- the percentage of victims that get to court is small enough as it is, this move only makes it smaller.

The CPS has said: \r\n\r\n\"It is not true that complainants in rape cases must automatically hand over personal data on their digital devices or run the risk of the prosecution being dropped. Mobile phone data, or social media activity, will only be considered by the police when relevant to an individual case.\"\r\n\r\nYou can read more here: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.cps.gov.uk/cps/news/handing-over-mobile-phone-data-rape-prosecutions  \r\n\r\nIn any case, how the police investigate a crime is a decision for the police, not the UK Parliament and Government. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition about something the UK Parliament and Government are responsible for. For example, you could start a new petition asking the police to require a court order before accessing a complainant's mobile phone."
