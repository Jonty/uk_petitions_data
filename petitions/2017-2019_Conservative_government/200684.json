        "additional_details": "Our rights to bear arms for self-defence have been steadily chipped away over the course of the last century, over fears for assassination of politicians, returning soldiers from 2 world wars, and Communist uprisings. we are more at risk than other time in history, and are powerless to defend ourselves. In the Wake of 5 terror attacks this year, it's clear we are a giant soft target due to unarmed citizens and a skeletal police service. Bring handgun Legislation and self defence laws in line with Northern Ireland for all of the UK",
        "background": "Currently there is no weapon or object that can be used to legally defend yourself and your property. The only thing that is clear, is that the force you use in a self-defence situation, must be \u2018reasonable\u2019. With Rising threats and uncertain future we must take back our rights from our government.",
