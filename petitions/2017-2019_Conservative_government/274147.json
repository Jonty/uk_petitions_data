        "additional_details": "In 2017, there were 23,805 pedestrian casualties. Of these, 25% were children aged 0-15, and 36% occurred during school transit hours (7-9am and 3-5pm). Forty-eight were fatalities. Others resulted in life-changing injuries. In 2016, 19% of the total UK population were aged 0-15 years old. Children make up a disproportionately large percentage of pedestrian casualties. Children who grow up crossing roads safely will become adults who cross roads safely, reducing adult casualties over time, too.",
        "background": "Children's lives are at risk when crossing busy roads to and from school. Pedestrian crossings make this journey safer because children will be less likely to dodge traffic. Children who dodge traffic become adults who dodge traffic. Children who use crossings become safer adults who use crossings.",
