        "additional_details": "Root and branch reform is needed. The Independent Public Inquiry must be granted legal powers to break up each political entity if necessary so they become self-contained and coherent. \r\n\r\nAll signatories pledge that they will not vote for The Conservative & Unionist Party or The Labour Party at a national level until reforms are implemented\r\n\r\nReply\r\nForward",
        "background": "Brexit proves that the 2 main political parties are riven by contradictory schisms rather than representing a single policy position thus failing to deliver on electoral and conference pledges. The electorate has been deceived. Self-interest beats national interest. It's time to break the duopoly.",
