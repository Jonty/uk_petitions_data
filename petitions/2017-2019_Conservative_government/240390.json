        "additional_details": "The recent brexit dabate has shown that the BBC is a bias newscaster with a strong remain bias. It is not independant as it claims. Because it does not have to compete in the commercial broadcasting space it's programmes are poor and do not cater for the majority of main stream viewers. It also provides a worldwide service, payed for by British households, many of whom do not agree.",
        "background": "The BBC is not value for money. A lot of people do not watch it yet it is funded by a mandatory tax on each household. There is no need for a state broadcaster as there are many alternative TV/ Radio channels available.\r\nThe license fee would be better left in peoples pockets.",
