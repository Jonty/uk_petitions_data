        "additional_details": "We can stop this by getting rid of our coal power plants, banning cars that emit the most pollution and start using more renewable energy such as wind and water. If we do this, many species in the UK and Ireland might increase in numbers.",
        "background": "We need to stop and do something about climate change. It is hurting our oceans and wildlife. Many animals are now going extinct because of it, such as the Meadow pipit and Wellow tits. Why? Because our grand-children and their children and so on might not see some of the species we see today.",
