        "additional_details": "It seems very unfair that this event has now a high charge just to enter the park and is bordered off with high numbers of security. As if it is an event that brings trouble. It's an event we're if you have little money you can still enjoy the live performance and the energy carnival brings. It showcases all the hard work people put into the costumes and what the community creates as a whole. The most upsetting thing is that a lot of Leicesters families can no longer afford to pay to go",
        "background": "I am proposing that Leicester city council brings back the Caribbean carnival as a free event as in recent years they have started to charge. I believe it should be free as all other cultural, community based and ethnic events are free. For e.g Diwali, gay pride, Christmas lights.",
