        "additional_details": "I have recently had a child, aberdeen maternity ward, could not provide the basic care for my wife and my newborn child. This is no fault of the midwives! but the pressure and demand put on them is starting to show in the morale. They cannot provide the care that they where trained to give because of the high volume of births. my wife waited 40 minutes for pain relief, no beds available for mothers in active labour in the triage ward! Does something tragic have to happen to get this fixed?",
        "background": "elgin maternity needs to have all services fully reinstated for low to high risks. aberdeen maternity ward cannot cope with the demand of elgin maternity (low risk only ), fraserburgh & banff maternity being closed.",
