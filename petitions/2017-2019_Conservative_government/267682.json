Doctors in UK don't test stomach acid.\r\nDr Paul Pottinger (University of Washington US) says the serology test is unreliable.

According to experts, medicine should be prescribed on the basis of travel history & symptoms, but British doctors are refusing to give medicine without a clinical test result.",

In particular, we're not exactly sure how you'd like to change the system or which medicines you want to be made more readily available.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, a petition calling for increased funding for a particular medicine/s on the NHS."
