They can tell the offender they are breaching an order and what consequences they may face but that is all. \r\n\r\nGiving police this power would reduce the amount of people making a mockery out of the system. It would allow what the court has already decided what is right and safe for the child to continue without dispute.\r\n\r\nWhy should the child suffer any longer then they have to when an informed decision has been made?",

If an order is breached then the only option is to accept it or return to the courts to request enforcement action is taken against the breach. The process takes months, is expensive and emotionally draining.",
