        "additional_details": "Some conditions have obvious signs but not all mental health conditions do. However, they can be acknowledged, supported and helped in the workplace without employers putting their businesses before the lives of each one of us. Why are physical first aiders available for broken legs but mental health first aiders that can save a life not a UK legal requirement? Let's help save more lives now. It is everyone's responsibility to help each other and employers need to see this. UK make this law!",
        "background": "Currently, mental health conditions are one of the biggest killers in the UK with suicide rates in men continuously rising. But why is there no one in UK workplaces supporting all employees with their mental health conditions or having the resources to notice when an employee is suffering?",
