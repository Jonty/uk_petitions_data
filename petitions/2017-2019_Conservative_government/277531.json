        "additional_details": "The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016. At that time no-one knew what Brexit would really mean. We now have a deal on the table. Given the magnitude of this decision, there should be a confirmatory referendum. Not to overturn the previous result, but to confirm that this is the kind of deal that people want.",

The People would like a short extension to allow for a confirmatory vote giving the choice between a) Boris Johnson's deal and b) remaining in the EU.",
