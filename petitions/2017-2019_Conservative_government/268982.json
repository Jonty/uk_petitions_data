        "additional_details": "The general public have been left with no say in regards to whom they wish to lead the country and this must change. This must also include a general election related to the recent appointment of Boris Johnson. Should the voting public agree with the choice of Johnson, then he should be allowed to continue, but only by being elected by us, the people of the United Kingdom.",
        "background": "Three of our last Four Prime Ministers were unelected by the general public (Brown, May, Johnson). This is not democratic and therefore a General Election must automatically be called in the event that a Prime Minister either resigns or is removed from office.",
