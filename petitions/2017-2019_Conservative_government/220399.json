        "action": "Correct the misleading claim that EU cosmetic testing on animals has ended.",
        "additional_details": "Most cosmetic ingredients are industrial chemicals, normally all tested on animals under REACH law. For any chemical to be approved for marketing there are normally 11 required toxicity tests. Of these 11, only 4 non-animal tests have been developed. To get their missing data, cosmetic companies exploit loopholes that permit dual-use industrial & cosmetic chemicals to be tested on animals. This way, cosmetic animal testing continues, also compromising public health & safety. This needs to stop.",
        "background": "Despite an official EU \u2018ban\u2019, most EU cosmetic ingredients can still - by law - be tested on animals. There is now a call for a \u2018global ban\u2019 based on this. So consumers are being misled & the EU Commission even congratulated on \u2018full EU testing and marketing bans\u2019, which in reality do not exist.",
