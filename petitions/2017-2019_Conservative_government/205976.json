        "additional_details": "Why should tenants (most who have no intention of working) receive the luxury of a newbuild house at the expense of the taxpayers cash? Why should Joe Bloggs next door have to work all hours to pay for the mortgage & be away from there children 5 days a week to do this? DSS tenants are allowed this luxury that most working class families simply cannot afford. Working families not able to get on the property ladder, DSS can have this luxury? How fair is our system? Only winners is the landlords.",
        "background": "We are living in a society that allows landlords to rent to DSS in a newbuild house / estate. DSS tenants receive full housing and council tax benefit. Neighbours who are buying 150k plus mortgages (with there hard earned cash) are surrounded with DSS tenants funded by the British Taxpayer.",
