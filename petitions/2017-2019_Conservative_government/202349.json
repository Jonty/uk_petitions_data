        "additional_details": "Several years ago Tameside Council invested many millions of pounds into improving the facilities. This included a new cafe, toilets, floral and shrub beds, children\u2019s play area, a water feature plus a multi games area. The historical conservatory however received no funding and in 2016 was closed to the general public. For over a hundred years this structure has been loved by the local people and created many happy memories. That\u2019s why we intend to raise enough support to re open it",
        "background": "Stamford Park In Stalybridge is an area of natural beauty which is enjoyed by many thousands of local people each year. The conservatory opened in 1907 but last year (2016) was closed by the council without any explanation. We aim to get enough support to re open this to the general public",
