If no deal causes short to medium term issues after we have left on the 29th March 2019 then so be it as this is a price worth paying to avoid having a bad deal in the longer term.",
        "background": "The EU have made very clear that they not willing to give us any compromises, do not respect where our red lines are and want to give us a bad deal out of spite. Their demands are unacceptable and no deal at all is better than a bad deal.",
