I also feel they should receive compensation where due.",
        "background": "The event is a charity auction with such prizes like 'Dinner with Boris Johnson' or the head of bank of England. The problem with the event is that it is male only and all hostesses are required to wear 'skimpy black dresses with matching underwear' and is a completely unfathomable series of events.",
