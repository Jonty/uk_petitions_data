        "additional_details": "Lots of autistic people are probably already in the military but haven't been diagnosed. There are around 700,000 people on the autism spectrum in the UK alone. Autistic people are just as social, gifted and awesome as any other person. I'm not saying all autistic people should get in but I am saying we should at least be guaranteed a fair chance.",
        "background": "I was diagnosed at 16 with autism, I have had no help for my condition, I have complete independance, I have a full time job, I'm social and I have been an air cadet for 7 years! Yet I have been rejected online from the Army and Air Force, the Air Force didn't even send me a letter explaining why.",
