The Commonwealth is a free association of mainly independent countries, which benefit in different ways in membership. Countries like Australia and Canada are progressive in this respect, yet many others in Africa, Caribbean and some in Asia still persecute their LGBT communities and this in unacceptable.",
        "background": "Countries like Brunei and Nothern Nigeria have death penalties in place for homosexuality, and yet are members of the Commonwealth, of which Her Majesty is the head. There are many more countries in the Commonwealth with anti-LGBT laws and this is an atrocity against human rights. This has to stop.",
