        "additional_details": "There have been lots of debate around the issue of UK' membership of EU. The referrendum and the decision by the British people to leave has been quite rightly put in motion. However, there has been many accusations of lies being told, amounts of money to be saved, where its to be spent, impact on the economy, who our biggest trading partners are/will be, effects on aviation, pharma industry, atomic industry, law and order, immigration...the list goes on and on.",
        "background": "It is only right that once the impact of brexit becomes clear and we know exactly what the real effects of brexit are going to be, we the people of the UK should be allowed the opportunity to either accept these terms or reject them and continue to enjoy the status we have within the EU.",
