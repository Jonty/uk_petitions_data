        "additional_details": "Nearly three years of authoritarianism practiced by both larger parties have traumatised the British Public. The media has relished the disarray and aided the depth of pain felt by all from people who wished to leave the EU to those who wished to remain. Both positions were ill-informed when you delve into the complexity of the problem. All subjects are like this and both the public and politicians require greater understanding of any issue that comes before the public and parliament to decide.",
        "background": "Brexit shows that parliamentary procedure cannot cope with new social relationships and is represented unnecessarily as a national split by a media in a feeding frenzy - parties still follow 19th century rules: we need create a new form of democracy now fit for the digital age.",
