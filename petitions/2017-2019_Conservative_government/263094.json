        "additional_details": "17,410,742 people voted to leave the European Union \r\nThe percentage of people who voted to leave was 51.89% Vs 48.11% of people who voted to stay in. \r\nIn a democratic society that result should be honoured. If it was won by 0.1% it should still be honoured.\r\nA second referendum would betray this country and should not be allowed at all in any vote.\r\nAsk the public with a vote on which they want either a no deal or a deal. Simple",
        "background": "It was written in law for this country to leave with a deal or no deal. Recent Media and MPs have put forward the idea of a second referendum. This would destroy our democracy as we see it and betray the people who voted for a type of Brexit. Second referendum should not be an option at all.",
