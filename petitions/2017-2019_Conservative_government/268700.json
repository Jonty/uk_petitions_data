        "additional_details": "\u2022 It would make it a lot harder  for under 18\u2019s to buy cannabis as currently it is actually easier for children to buy drugs than it is for them to buy alcohol. Legalising means hard age limits can be put in place.\r\n\u2022 Legalisation would also raise a lot of money from taxing the product.\r\n\u2022 How can we call ourselves a democratic nation if you do not at east allow the people to have a public vote on the legalisation of cannabis when over 30% of the population have used it?",
        "background": "\u2022Cannabis would be safer if it were legal as it would only be able to be sold from licenced sellers and would be quality controlled and therefore not cut with anything else and the amount of THC and CBD could be controlled as well as the amount of cannabis per person per day.",
