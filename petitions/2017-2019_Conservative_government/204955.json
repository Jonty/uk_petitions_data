        "additional_details": "The Rohingya people are a predominantly Muslim ethnic group and, despite having lived in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state for centuries, they are refused citizenship.  Their movement is restricted, and they have been denied access to education, health care, and other basic services.  Some frustrated and desperate members have taken violent action in response to their plight. \r\n Only Bangladesh, with acute poverty of its own, is helping the Rohingya refugees, putting the rest of us to shame.",
        "background": "More than 600,000  ROHINGYA PEOPLE OF MYANMAR  have been driven from their homes, SUFFERED EXTRA-JUDICIAL KILLINGS, TORTURE and RAPE.  THE MYANMAR MILITARY AND OTHERS are, in effect, engineering an 'ETHNIC CLEANSING'..\r\n\r\nALL THIS IS TAKING PLACE WHILE MAJOR WESTERN POWERS OFFER WORDS AND DO NOTHING",
