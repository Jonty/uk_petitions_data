Small business Owners invest large amounts of their own money, Work long hours and boost the economy but their are little incentives to help them, just more and more rules and regulations.",

It is unfair to place the same legislation on small businesses as large ones as there are not the staff or funds to deal with this.\r\n\r\nEncourage small business, don\u2019t break their backs!",
