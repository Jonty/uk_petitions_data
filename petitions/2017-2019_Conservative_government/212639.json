Many people were also seriously injured.\r\nGeneral Dyer ordered his troops to open fire without any warning and after blocking all the exits to the park. He reasoned that this act was to punish the Indians for holding a meeting by disobeying the British orders. He also stated that he intended to create a feeling of terror throughout the state of Punjab.",
