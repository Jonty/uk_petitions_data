A supermarket delivery driver doesn't get their pay stopped driving between deliveries. \r\nTo make a wage a carer has to start their day from 7am to 10pm in most cases to earn a living daily rate. Going home between calls is not always possible and who pays for the fuel? We use our own vehicle employed and pay our own business insurance! \r\nGetting penalised for doing a job we love \u2764\ufe0f",
