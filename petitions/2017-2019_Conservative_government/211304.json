        "additional_details": "You wouldn't be charged to enter an NHS hospital, why should you be charged to enter science? The British public is paying for 66% of university research (see: http://goo.gl/dnhLfw), but only 37% of it is free to read (http://goo.gl/4asiU8). Researchers give profitable publishers like Elsevier their work for free and can be charged as much as $5000 to hand over their own work (http://goo.gl/7in7LR). The policy fix: \"Publicly funded research must be publicly available\". More: http://goo.gl/sk1Hfa",
        "background": "The Government funds the majority of the UK\u2019s academic research with taxpayer money. The results of this research, academic papers, are not accessible to the public because publishers charge \u00a340 to read an article that is given to them for free. The public should not have to pay twice for research.",
