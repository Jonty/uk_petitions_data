        "additional_details": "In order to ensure the supplier would be benefiting from this investment there would be a number of consultations reguarding the amount of light reaching the panels and the number of panels requested in order to optimise energy production and to avoid unnecessary panel fitting. I strongly believe this is the way forward to a greener more sustainable future due to the amount of co2 produced in the production of solar energy in comparison to other forms of energy production.",
        "background": "I believe that it would be beneficial not just for the consumers and suppliers but to the environment due to the green renewable nature of solar energy. Suppliers  would subsidise the cost of roof mounted solar panels in exchange for 50% of electricity produced by them.",
