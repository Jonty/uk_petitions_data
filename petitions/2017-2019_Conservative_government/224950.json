        "additional_details": "Only when pressurised by the Commons Select Committee, did Govia Thameslink admit to knowing in advance, that their Rail Plan 20/20 timetable wouldn\u2019t work. They didn\u2019t have enough fully trained drivers or a balanced staff roster in place. \r\n\r\nWhat is unforgivable is their total disregard for their passengers, and the mental and physical distress this is causing. \r\n\r\nThe Department of Transport should instruct Govia to freeze all ticket price increases for a period of not less than one year.",
        "background": "Since the introduction of the Govia Thameslink Rail Plan 20/20 timetable, we the long suffering commuters, have had to endure a train service not fit for purpose. There are numerous social media accounts of stranded passengers, overcrowding, and services cancelled with little or no notice.",
