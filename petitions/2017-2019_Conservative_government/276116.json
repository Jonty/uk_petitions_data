        "additional_details": "There are recent examples that show this can work effectively in a democracy. \r\n\r\nIn Belgium, a record for the longest period without an elected government in a democracy was set in 2010-11, 589 days. The country was turned from failing to successful during that time. \r\n\r\nSpain spent the first 10 months of 2016 in a similar position. \r\n\r\nIn these examples, the countries managed very well without the politicians and improved their citizens' lives.",
        "background": "Parliament reflects the UK, polarised between leave the EU or remain, so is paralysed & failing to govern. Give the experts who really run the nation, Civil Servants, the opportunity to repair the UK in an apolitical, thereby effective way. \r\nAn election may be held once  the EU issues are resolved.",
