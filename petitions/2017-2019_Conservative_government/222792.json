        "additional_details": "Tens of thousands of Palestinians in the occupied and besieged Gaza Strip have been peacefully demonstrating since March 30, Land Day, demanding their rights. They have been met with Israeli army snipers who followed a shoot-to-kill-or-maim policy, killing more than 30, to date, including children, and injuring over 1,600. \r\nSince 1948, the British Foreign Office has requested that the British royal family not make official visits to Israel, despite many invitations, to avoid giving a royal stamp",
        "background": "Israeli government has documented record of using such visits to mask its grave human rights abuses. It will use this visit to cover up its ongoing massacre against unarmed Palestinian protesters in Gaza demanding freedom and the UN-stipulated right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes",
