        "additional_details": "Furthermore, this message is directly affecting the mental health of millions of Londoners by causing incredible stress at each bus stop they arrive at. \r\nIn my eyes, this is a prime example of where political correctness and fear of accident claims has overpowered the general public's right to a stress free life. The message is counter-productive and jarring.",
        "background": "The addition of the message notifies us of the rather surprising fact that motor vehicles are capable of moving. The message is unnecessary and is too often played once the bus has started moving, rendering it a complete waste of electricity.",
