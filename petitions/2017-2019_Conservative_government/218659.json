        "background": "The European Membership referendum 2016 has highlighted the fact that far too many politicians follow their own or Party agenda rather than the wishes of the majority of their Constituents.\r\n\r\nMany, in doing so, feel that they can escape retribution at the ballot box due to the fixed date of a GE.",
