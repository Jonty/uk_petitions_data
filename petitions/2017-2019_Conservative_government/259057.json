        "additional_details": "The issue is an assault on British people on two fronts; personal freedom and safety.\r\n\r\nAs British citizens we expect a certain level of freedom of choice, and one of those is the choice to respect the law. By taking that away we lose our freedom to be upstanding citizens. It is another step to authoritarianism.\r\n\r\nIn regards to safety we have seen the RAC, AA and Zurich among others come out AGAINST the idea, calling it unsafe.\r\n\r\nI am limited to 500 characters and therefore cannot reference.",
        "background": "Recently the European Union voted in favour of mandatory speed limiters (Intelligent Speed Assistance) to be in all new cars as of 2022. The British government wants to do the same. We the British people, say no to this new requirement in Britain.",
