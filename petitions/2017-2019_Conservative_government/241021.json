        "additional_details": "Regardless of whether you voted Leave or Remain, the current shambolic behaviour of the government and the opposition is serving nobody's interests. In the meanwhile, the rest of the country falls apart - the homeless die on the streets, the roads crumble, the NHS falls apart. On the current timetable we will have left the EU by the time this petition could be enacted, but regardless of that, we need a new crop of MPs to clear up the mess left by the current crop.",
        "background": "The Parliamentary Conservative Party apparently has confidence in the Prime Minister. The House of Commons apparently has confidence in the Government. We the people of the UK no longer have confidence in Parliament and call for an early general election to introduce new MPs to clear up the mess.",
