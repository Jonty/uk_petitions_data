        "additional_details": "Anti Fracking Groups have evolved in areas affected by Fracking.  Normal people like myself, not an activist, are now involved in local groups trying to raise awareness of the effect on rural communities.  Such proposals will have a detrimental effect on the environment, wild life and rural pursuits.  Industrialisation is not compatible with village life.  Our countryside is there to be enjoyed and not destroyed.  The UK Government should visit areas affected, listen and not ignore the North.",
        "background": "Companies are applying for planning permission in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, North and South Yorkshire to build Exploratory Wells with a view to Frack for Shale Gas. Communities and their supporters are against this and believe investment should be in renewable energy and not fossil fuels.",
