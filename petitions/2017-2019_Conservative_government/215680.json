There are many more hidden laws being made to undo the Brexit process and we need to stop her now before its to late.",
        "background": "We need a new prime minister that doesn't use underhand tactics to disregard the will of the people. We voted to get our country back and make it great again. Teresa May is  ignoring what we all voted for and is trying to ruin what we have left.",

However, the Petitions Committee can\u2019t schedule votes of no confidence. This was often frustrating and disappointing for petitioners. Petitions calling for action on policy are more likely to be an effective way of achieving the change you want."
