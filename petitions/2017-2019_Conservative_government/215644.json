        "additional_details": "A simple suggestion to put this into perspective would be to allow employers to distribute e.g. Plates, stickers to their employees vehicles to easily identify that they are eligible and to also prevent the misuse of bus lanes.",
        "background": "As the majority of bus lanes restrict public traffic from travelling along them between 7am-7pm, a lot of fast food takeaways deliver within these hours and delivery drivers are commonly stuck in traffic during rush hour. This results in orders arriving late, negative customer reviews etc.",
