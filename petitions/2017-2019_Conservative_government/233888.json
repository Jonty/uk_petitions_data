        "additional_details": "VAT on restaurants is so high that the evidence of failures and struggle to pay VAT is 100% evident in the government for many years and is not being addressed. It\u2019s come up in fast food but ignores to be rectified many years ago. We need this change as a factor in the industry. Just looking at the news restaurants are closing and VAT is an issue along with other taxes. It\u2019s destroying business and needs urgent change and not to be ignored. Even the fact of a business turnover under 1 million",
        "background": "VAT on Restaurants is to high and as a low price and low margins is causing more failures. Selling a menu item at \u00a310.00 \u00a32.00 is VAT making it expensive to eat out. \r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t get VAT back on food as it doesn\u2019t have vat. So all cooked food jumps up in price. VAT is not considered by customers.",
