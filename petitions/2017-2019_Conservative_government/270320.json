        "additional_details": "We would like to call for an independent review of IR35, the full impact of the Off Payroll in public sector and the potential impact in each sector. In the financial services industry for example many technology projects will be seriously affected and given the potential, short term resource challenge of Brexit could lead to major challenges. The April 2020 start date should be deferred as businesses have had challenges with Making Tax Digital, GDPR and Brexit and the HMRC (CEST) is not robust.",
        "background": "From April 2020 \u2018off-payroll\u2019 rules that have been rolled out in the public sector to help enforce IR35 will be rolled out to all sectors. \r\n\r\nWe the undersigned would like to see an independent enquiry to the potential impact to each sector and to analyse the impact of a repeal of IR35 in full.",
