On that day, a majority of British citizens decided that we should leave the EU. This decision has not been respected by many in Parliament, and those who believe that we should remain in the EU are taking the opportunity to attempt to circumvent the will of the majority and if democracy itself.",

The country was consulted, and the result of the referendum should be respected.",
