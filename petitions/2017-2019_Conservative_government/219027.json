I want a service where I can help people like myself pursue their real ambitions whether its AI, career in Space, Business analyst, Marketing, Data Science - anything which students would rather decline and choose hair dressing/ travel and tourism instead due to society. I want my voice to be heard.",

I want to help students to achieve their dreams and be the best of their ability. I want more facilities!",
