        "action": "Call a General Election due to the Conservative Gov\u2019s inability to unify.",
        "additional_details": "It is commonly believed that Brexit and the negotiations as they have played out have largely been to quell and resolve divisions within a divided Conservative party.\r\n\r\nWhether true or not, talks have for the most part been unsuccessful in unifying a divided party. With so much infighting the party may now be incapable of leading the country in a coherent fashion and therefore a General Election should be called at the earliest opportunity to establish a working government.",
        "background": "The Conservative Party are thought by some to have served their own party interests before that of the country re: Brexit. Some believe this to be an abandonment of ministerial responsibility. It is possible their government is no longer legitimate and should be confirmed in a GE.",
