        "additional_details": "This is the last term of teaching we have before final essay deadlines and exam season begins. The strike action has resulted in tens of thousands of students still paying for lectures and classes which have been called off, or have been avoided due to picket line action. We are expected to submit perfected essays and successfully pass exams, with no consideration to the effects the strike action has had on our educations.",
        "background": "61 universities have taken part in strike action over the UCU/UUK pensions row. We, the students, have lost almost 4 weeks of teaching, lecturer and staff support, have been left without any guidance or teaching. We deserve relaxed grading criteria to reflect the turmoil and instability faced.",
