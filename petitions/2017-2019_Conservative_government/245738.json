        "additional_details": "This year, when the clocks \"Spring Forward\" us mothers will be celebrating mothers day, with an hour less in bed. The irony kills me.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, our children wont be tired come their normal bedtime which will result in stress inducing hormones in parents.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure of the scientific reasons behind this but these hormones seem to cause some kind of behaviour alteration in children. They become irrational & unpredictable, much like wild animals. \r\n\r\nThis can continue for weeks. Please help us.",
        "background": "An American called Benjamin Franklin came up with the idea in 1784.\r\n\r\nHe suggested that if people got up earlier, when it was lighter, then it would save on candles.\r\n\r\nWe dont use candles anymore. \r\n\r\nOur kids go crazy, we go crazy.\r\n\r\nNobody needs this level of crazy.",
