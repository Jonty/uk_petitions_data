You could start a new petition calling on the UK Government to publish guidance to schools on disciplining students for racist behaviour in schools.\r\n\r\nIt's the responsibility of social media companies to manage content on their platforms and take action - such as suspending or closing accounts - against users who break their rules. \r\n\r\nThere's already a petition about hate speech on social media. We cannot accept a new petition when we already have one about a very similar issue. You might like to sign this petition if its calls for something you'd like to happen. You're more likely to get action on this issue if you sign and share a single petition.\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/234725\r\n"
