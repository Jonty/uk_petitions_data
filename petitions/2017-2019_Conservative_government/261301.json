        "action": "UK State: Tell Donald Trump the UK Opposes War with Iran",
        "additional_details": "President Trump\u2019s has told top national security aides he envisions sending as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East. This is a \"very dangerous move\" according to the Iranians. The USA has an infamous record of failed military interventions across the Middle East. Military intervention always leads to mountains of needless deaths, economic destruction and opens up regions to terrorism. We do not want to create more refugees, war shattered children and soldiers. We must oppose war with Iran.",
        "background": "The US is playing a \"very dangerous game\" according to Iran's Ambassador to the UK, in provoking and escalating tensions with Iran. The UK must emphatically rule out its endorsement of any war of aggression with Iran and stress its desire to protect the lives of civilians and soldiers on both sides.",
