In particular, we're not sure what you mean by \"all large and known dangerous dogs\".\r\n\r\nThere is already a list of dangerous dogs which are banned in the UK. There are certain circumstances when a banned dog can be kept. You can find out more here: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/control-dog-public/banned-dogs\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking for all dogs to be kept on a lead and muzzled at all times when in public, or in residential areas, if that's what you'd like to happen. "
