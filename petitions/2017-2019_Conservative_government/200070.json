        "additional_details": "LGBTIQ etc. and non-gender politics are now very visible and constantly being pushed to the fore of MP's thoughts and actions. However, many people of an older generation and millennials agree that being a lesbian/gay/non-binary is a personal choice which is acceptable. The key issue is when all schoolchildren are requested to wear a non gender uniform to make a few transgender children feel happier, included. Are schools taking into account other children's feelings, the parents etc?",
        "background": "Our society is more than ever being driven by minorities. \r\n\r\nIt is hoped traditional, conservative values will be promoted & supported removing same sex education, paraphernalia and non-gender discussions, films, programmes from public view until at least after 9pm on T.V. and other commumications.",
