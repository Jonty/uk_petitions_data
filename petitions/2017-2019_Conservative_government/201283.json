        "action": "Revoke Article 50 and seek to remain in the EU",
        "additional_details": "From the Government's own analyses, leaving the customs union (\"hard\" Brexit) is likely to bring considerable economic pain.  Remaining in the customs union whilst leaving the EU itself (\"soft\" Brexit) is unlikely to be possible without ceding more sovereignty to the EU and forgoing many of the benefits we have as full members and will not satisfy leave campaigners. We should act now to remain because waiting to conclude negotiations may lose us this option.",
        "background": "It is clear that the type of Brexit promoted by leave campaigners before the referendum is not possible and it is doubtful that the available options have the support of the people. We should seek to remain in the EU now rather than risk losing the concessions we have already secured.",
