        "additional_details": "Regardless of whether you are left wing, or right wing, or indeed whether you voted for Brexit or Remain. The UK people must be allowed a General election to bring the Brexit debate to a close. Given the intransigence in Parliament and the additional division that this is creating in the country, the Public should be allowed a General Election forthwith to allow sufficient time to either revoke article 50 or implement Brexit. Further delay is causing division, costing jobs and damaging brand UK.",
        "background": "Whether the UK leaves the EU as per the referendum result or stays in the EU, the uncertainty created by the continual delaying of Brexit is causing considerable harm to the economy through delayed investment decisions & a damaged external view of the UK.",
