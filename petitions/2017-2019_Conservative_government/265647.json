        "additional_details": "Someone reminded me that cats cannot be left at the cattery without proof of vaccinations. How as a nation do we take better care of our pets than our children? \r\n\r\nI have heard the argument that making vaccinations compulsory is a \u201cnanny state\u201d move. Perhaps so but it is the same nanny state that made education compulsory and banned violence against our children. There are reasons why laws are made. Quoting Bentham, it is about the greatest happiness for the greatest number and vaccinations create herd immunity which protects us all. \r\n\r\n11 European countries as well as New York and California have already moved towards mandatory vaccinations. It is time that we did too.",
        "background": "The measles outbreak across the western world is a tragedy given that it is a preventable disease. Unvaccinated members of our society put our babies, our pregnant mums and the immunocompromised at risk.",
