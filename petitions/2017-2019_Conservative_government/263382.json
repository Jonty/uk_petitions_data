        "additional_details": "The NHS has been the safety net that the poorest and most vulnerable people in our country have needed in order to survive. We have been lucky to not have allowed greedy companies and politicians to strip this out to the levels of the US. Unfortunately current and past governments have started to undo and sabotage this amazing service.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to make profits from people in this way should be stopped from doing so. Many Americans suffer and if used in a deal, many in the UK will suffer.",
        "background": "Several figures have spoken about how the NHS may be used in a future trade deal with the US. No UK Government should let that happen in this instance or any other.",
