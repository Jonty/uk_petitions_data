They are really nice people and very greatful for anything they can get. It not right to expect people to be homeless for 5 years that's way to long and people do die in the cold weather. We need your help.",
        "background": "A lovely lady started a group on Facebook to help the homeless. I have helped out as I could and have found out that they are expected to be homeless for 5 years before they will be given any help. This is way to long. A lot can happen in 5 years and with our winters getting colder it's dangerous.",
