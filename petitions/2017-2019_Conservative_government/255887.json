I analysed how they voted in the recent indicative votes. 92% of the Wikipedia known 77 ERG members (excluding ministers) collectively voted against all of the recent indicative vote options.  These were Brexit and compromise options.\r\n\r\nSo far they have been voting destructively against:\r\n1\tLeave\r\n2\tRemain\r\n3\tA rethink\r\n\r\nIn other words, AGAINST EVERYTHING. Is their agenda is to bring down the government and seize power at all costs?",

But their voting patterns indicate organised destructive behaviour against remain and leave and compromise.",
