Repealing the Trade Disputes Act 1906 would not necessarily allow an individual to bring a case against a trade union for compensation due to financial losses. For example, trade union law was consolidated in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. This could, for example, ask for the law to be changed so that individuals could sue unions for damages causes by strike action.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
