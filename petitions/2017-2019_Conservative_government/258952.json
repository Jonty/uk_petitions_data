        "additional_details": "Trump promotes a fossil fuel economy. Despite the significant impact on his own citizens health and the global impact. Because he rejects climate change. Rejecting his own government advise and advise of elected city mayors. Rejecting advise of transformative diagnostic medical companies and industry. To endorse a state visit of an individual representing such beliefs is fundamentally socially irresponsible; environmentally irresponsible.",
        "background": "Donald Trump does not represent shared interests with the UK. He rejects and denies climate change. As evidenced by Federal state aid in the US which cannot reference climate change relevant to any extreme event. His migration policy - \"Mexican wall' a symbol of exclusion not societal inclusion.",
