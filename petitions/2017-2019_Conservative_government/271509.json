        "additional_details": "In recent times, many interviews with political figures on terrestrial TV channels,  have been found to contain untruths and be misleading facts, which go unchallenged. These interviews have then been used within social media to deliberately mislead and influence the general public. A live \u201cFact Checker\u201d with script,would ensure that honesty is promoted and truth reaches the public in at large.\r\n\r\nThe technology is available to do this easily, and could be easily applied by major TV networks,",
        "background": "To ensure that every claim and \u201cstated\u201d fact is scrutinized and validated so that the British public can be better informed. \r\nThis will insure that mistruths, or misleading statements are immediately challenged and ensures that truth is validated live.",
