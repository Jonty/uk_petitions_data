The bill states that it would \u2018require the driver of a mechanically propelled vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury or death to a cat to stop and give information or report the accident to the police\u2019 Passing or amending this bill, or others like this, can not stop the pain of losing a beloved pet, but can bring about justice for the families of Nico and many other cats like him.",

The driver didn\u2019t stop. The Police told us that the driver does not have any obligation to report it, but would if it were a dog.",
