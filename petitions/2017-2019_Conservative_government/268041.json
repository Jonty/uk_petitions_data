        "additional_details": "Under current rules, if a prime minster steps down, the leading party is able to elect a new party leader who in most cases will become the next prime minister without a vote of the electorate.\r\n\r\nThis petition requests that if a prime minister steps down or otherwise leaves their office, in order to prevent a new prime minister stepping into the office that hasn't been voted on by the electorate, that an interim leader be appointed and a general election be immediately triggered.",
        "background": "In the event that a prime minister resigns or otherwise leaves their office prior to a general election occurring, a general election should be triggered in order to ensure that at any time, the entire country is able to exercise their democratic right to elect their leader.",
