We're therefore not sure what action you would like the UK Government or Parliament to take.\r\n\r\nUnder the rules of the Australian Parliament, Australian Members and Senators may request portraits of the Queen and other members of the Royal Family to give to constituents. There is no automatic right for an individual to receive such a portrait. Introducing a similar scheme in the UK would be the responsibility of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority and not the UK Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://maps.finance.gov.au/entitlements_handbooks/senators-and-members/Part_Six_Other_Matters_-_6.8_Constituents_Request\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Government provides a website where you can download pictures of the Queen. The Royal Family already provide such images from time to time, for example on the occasion of the Queen's 90th birthday, we're not sure what further action you would like taken:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.royal.uk/downloadable-image-queens-90th-birthday"
