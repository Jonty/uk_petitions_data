        "additional_details": "I believe MP's should lead by example. By closing the Houses of Parliament and creating a place of historical interest and a museum, I believe we could generate more money to reduce our national debt. MP's places of work could be relocated at a more economical premise or premises, like an industrial building that would be large enough to seat members in order to discuss the country's political issues.",
        "background": "I believe we could save money and help pay off our national debt, so we can properly fund our Police, Fire service, NHS, Teachers etc.  I believe we need to start looking at ways we can save more money to help our society where it needs it. By closing Parliament, we can generate more revenue.",
