        "additional_details": "Increasing paid paternity leave, even to 4 or 6 weeks, means fathers have time to bond with their baby, and reduces stress on mothers who are likely in need of support from their partners. Paid paternity leave increase allows:\r\n\u2022More bonding time with their baby (minus the worry of financial strain)\r\n\u2022Emotional/physical help for the mother from the father\r\nIncrease in paternity leave is already available in other countries (Japan= year, Mongolia =14 weeks to name a few) so let\u2019s increase it too!",
        "background": "Women in the UK are entitled to paid maternity leave for 52 weeks (optional but legally 2 weeks MUST be taken off after the birth), whereas men are entitled to 1-2 weeks of paid paternity leave. In 2018, men and women are meant to be equal, so why can\u2019t a father have longer to bond with his baby?",
