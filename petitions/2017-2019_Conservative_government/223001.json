        "additional_details": "Our road over the last 9 months has seen 1 burglary, 1 burnt out stolen bike, 2 attempts on our bikes, 2 attempted car thefts and its a small road with ~15 houses. The thieves do not fear repercussions and last time they came were armed, we told the police this and the officers that showed up informed us they were told not to attend as they were armed, so we are out confronting the thieves and the police are being told not to come to our aid. This needs to be stopped before people get hurt.",
        "background": "Owning a motorcycle feels like having a target painted on me/my house. Thieves are not sentenced properly because its hard to prove they stole anything so change the law so you can be sentenced for being in charge of a stolen vehicle and possibly a seperate charge for being a passenger in/on one.",
