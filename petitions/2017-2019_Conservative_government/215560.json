Politicians make worse remarks on TV and the BBC doesn't ban them so why ban somebody with mental health issues for saying something that wasn't explicit, wasn't racist and wasn't intended to cause offense in any other way? This has gotten out of hand and I think it's time to do something about it. \r\nThanks!",

Using a \"meme\" should NOT carry a 30 day ban. Since when is it OK to limit somebody's, sometimes only means of communication with f&f?",
