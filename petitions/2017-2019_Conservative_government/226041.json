People especially go to the beach in the summer but they can choose how long they want to be in the sun for, however the donkeys can\u2019t choose and can be there day after day. I wouldn\u2019t like that would you?",

Also not being able to sit in the shade for aslong as you want and someone choosing when you have a refreshing drink? It wouldn\u2019t be comforting would it.",
