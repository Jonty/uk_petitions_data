Saying there were 'fine people on both sides' following the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. His response to NFL protests against police violence. These are just a handful of the President's political choices that many people in the UK find troubling. \r\n\r\nWe call on our representatives to make clear that we do not support these views.",
