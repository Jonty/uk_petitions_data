        "action": "Give free access to British Standards for installers working in the gas industry",
        "additional_details": "A list of British Standards is produced in gas appliance installation manuals, yet those Standards are only available at great expense. A recent add-up, saw the price to purchase the required standards and other quoted regulations, amount to \u00a34,952.00. It is considered that this is a detrimental factor when assessing the cause or reason for incorrectly installed gas appliances. Free access to British Standards would ensure that appliances can be installed correctly and installers work safely.",
        "background": "In order for gas installers to be able to install gas appliances correctly, we are required to work to the British Standards and Building Regulations. Gas engineers requalify every 5 years and are assessed on British Standards. This is usually the only time when installers access those publications.",
