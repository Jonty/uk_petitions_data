        "action": "Hold a second referendum on leaving the EU.",
        "additional_details": "In 2016, we voted to leave the EU, this is not being questioned. What is being questioned is the fact that people voted on this blindly trusting in the power of our government to negotiate a deal that would benefit us in the ways we were told. The government did not manage to get us this deal, the deal to put forward would, in fact, hamper our economy for years to come. \r\nThe people of the UK deserve to get a second chance to agree on what their future entails. Now with open eyes, we can choose.",
        "background": "People of the UK voted to leave the EU, However, we voted on the grounds that we would get a favorable deal with the EU. This, though, has been shown to not be possible. We cannot achieve a favorable deal for the whole of the UK. I believe that the UK population deserve to vote with a clear picture.",
