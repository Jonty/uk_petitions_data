        "additional_details": "Pursuant to articles 21, 22 and 39 of EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, the UK government failed to protect the basic rights of EU expatriates. On grounds of nationality, also resulting in disrespect of cultural pro-EU background, it is discriminatory and unconstitutional to prevent a minority from voting on public matters impacting their lives significantly. We ask the UK government to assume responsibility for the rise of populism and racism and issue an official apology to all EU expatriates.",
        "background": "Brexit vote was not democratic and must be invalidated. Millions of EU expatriates who have permanent residence in the UK were not invited to vote in the Brexit referendum. All EU expatriates were not heard, while their lives are being adversely affected.",
