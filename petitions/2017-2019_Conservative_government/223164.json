        "additional_details": "The government abolished the 10 days holiday entitlement and introduced fines for any term time absence.   \r\n\r\nThe majority of people take children out of of school, do so purely because of a cost issue.\r\nA family holiday during  any school holiday period can dramatically rise in price for the same holiday out of the school holidays.",
        "background": "Enforcing a no price increase with a average price throughout the year means any holiday provider would not loose any revenue.\r\nSchool time absences will reduce as the necessity to remove children from school to find a cheaper holiday would be removed",
