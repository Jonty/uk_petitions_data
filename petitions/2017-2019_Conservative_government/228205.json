For example, we're not sure whether you'd like a change in animal welfare law to bring in minimum standards before horses can be bred; whether you'd like breeders to be inspected and licensed; or you'd like something else.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.
