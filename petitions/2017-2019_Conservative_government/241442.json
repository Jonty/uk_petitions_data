        "background": "Properties in Wynyard Park are cut off from accessing vital services in Wynyard Village, separated by the A689 70mph dual carriageway.  No crossing facilities mean kids can't walk to school, residents can't access shops / pharmacy safely.  It's dangerous and isolating, impacting the most vulnerable.",
