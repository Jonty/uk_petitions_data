        "additional_details": "Leaving using that result is not democracy, as it disregards the views of today's majority and denies 1.7 million~ voters now age 18 their say. Democracy must be dynamic or it ceases to be democracy as facts emerge and change. Leaving would be temporary due to Leave and Remain voter's age profiles, so not worth suffering x years of adversity. Signatories: Sign supporting the justifications. If government refuse to act, find more signatories. The more who sign it, the more likely MP's will act.",
        "background": "Search and click rejected petition 276414 as that will lead you to find the documents explaining why. It also did not mention leaving the Single Market and Customs Union so is NOT A MANDATE to do so. THIS RESULT WAS CONTRIVED by withheld facts, misleading statements, and encouraged misconceptions.",
