        "additional_details": "RAF Scampton is one of the few RAF stations to trace its history to the creation of the RAF in 1918.\r\nDuring WW2 it was a Bomber Command base, and in May 1943 617 Sqdn flew the famous \u201cDambusters\u201d mission from here.\r\nIn this, the centennial year of the Royal Air Force, it beggars belief that the MOD can be so oblivious to British military history and tradition as to contemplate disposing of an important piece of that history in such a cavalier fashion.",
        "background": "The Ministry of Defence is planning to close RAF Scampton in 2022, and sell off the land for a housing development.\r\nRAF Scampton is currently home to the Red Arrows Aerobatic Team, which act as ambassadors of the UK Armed Services all over the world.",
