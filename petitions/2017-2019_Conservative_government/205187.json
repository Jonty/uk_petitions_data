        "additional_details": "My mum passed away on the 08/11/17 and I was only allowed 3 days paid time off. I think it is unreasonable for anyone losing an immediate family member to go back to concentrating at work. There needs to be a reasonable grieving period. In fact because I was in hospital 2 days before she died I should have gone back to work the day after. Like a parent losing a child and having to go back to work after that period. There needs to be a law against this inhumane process!",

It is more or less \u201cup to the employer\u201d this needs to be a standard equal to ALL and not for anyone in any company or organisation to decide.",
