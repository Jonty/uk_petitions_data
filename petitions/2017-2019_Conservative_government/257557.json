        "additional_details": "The EU election is going to cost in excess of \u00a3100 million. A separate referendum would also cost in excess of \u00a3100 million. There is no justification to spend over \u00a3200 million when it can all be done on the same day saving the taxpayer some \u00a3100 million which could be put to far better use. Lets go forward with pride  looking  positively to a prosperous future for all our citizens and not just the self interested few.",
        "background": "The decision to leave the EU has been decided. Unfortunately our politicians are incapable of deciding how we leave.  There are only two options open so put them to the people and let them decide. Direct  democracy in the hands of the citizens  and not 650 inept MPs.  It can and should be done.",
