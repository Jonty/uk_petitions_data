I can honestly say, it is one of the worst things I have ever had to do.\r\nI have asked Macmillan to reconsider and they have stated that over 50%  surveyed agree with the campaign.\r\nPutting that another way nearly half of all people surveyed were against the campaign.\r\nMacmillan need to consider the emotional harm they are doing to the very people they are trying to help.",
        "background": "One of the most emotional things a cancer patient goes through is loosing their hair due to Chemo and radio therapy. Many try to cover it up with scarves or wigs. The last thing they want to be reminded of is losing their hair. The Macmillan campaign is insensitive and should be stopped.",
