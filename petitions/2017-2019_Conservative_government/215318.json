        "additional_details": "So I call on the UK government not to change the current devolution settlement. They say it will be more expensive to have different sets of rules, but I don\u2019t agree with them. If they want a UK-wide framework, then maybe they could look towards having a federalised framework rather than a \u2018power grab\u2019.",
        "background": "In 1997, the people of Scotland voted very decisively to have a devolved Scottish Parliament and devolved powers as well, and they are within an EU framework. But now, the UK government is planning a \u2018power grab\u2019 on these areas such as agriculture, farming and fishing.",
