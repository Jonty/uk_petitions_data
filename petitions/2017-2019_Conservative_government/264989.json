There is already an independent Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards whose job is to oversee the Register of Members' Financial Interests and the Code of Conduct for MPs. You can find out more about the Code of Conduct here:\r\n\r\nhttps://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmcode/1474/1474.pdf\r\n\r\nThere's already a petition calling for it to be a criminal offence for an MP deliberately to mislead the public. You are more likely to get action on this issue if you sign and share a single petition:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/239850\r\n"
