        "action": "Abolish the TV and Radio broadcasting license and make the BBC self funding.",
        "additional_details": "Most, if not all of the services provided by the BBC, are available either free or through subscription from other providers. It is self evident that imposing compulsory license fees to allow the BBC to compete with these organisations, against the will of most people, is anti competetive, anti democratic and a waste of license payers money.  There is not a single reason why the BBC should not have to earn its keep the same as every other commercial entity.",
        "background": "No other commercial organisation in the Country enjoys the right to force people to pay for a service they don't need, don't want, never use and for which alternatives are  available.\r\nThe right thing to do is give people a choice paying or not by removing the compulsory license fee.",
