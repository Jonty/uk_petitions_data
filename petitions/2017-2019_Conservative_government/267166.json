        "additional_details": "All African countries require up to 18 million new job places a year to stop poverty. Not more than 3 million are created. Each year more than 15 million people start to live life without future in Africa. It systematically increases the risk of illegal immigration for the UK. But on the other hand the UK is proud leader of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence solutions. Taking into account local trade customs we can stop poverty and unemployment in Africa by means of such advanced technologies.",
        "background": "The biggest humanitarian crisis in the world takes place in Africa now. It doesn't relate to any disease or conflict. It relates to lack of real-life awareness and leadership. It's just poverty. Around 90 million people live in huge poverty in Nigeria only. Unemployment rate in South Africa is 37.5%",
