        "additional_details": "My idea might not be perfect and there may be better technology to monitor the drivers of the vehicles.However I think it would identify a massive black economy. Identifying who is actually driving the vehicle , and the hours they are working. The introduction of a CPC (certificate of professional competence) would be a minimum requirement to send a message to this business sector to improve the standard of driving.",
        "background": "I would like to see a more professional approach to granting taxi and private hire vehicle licences. The introduction of a digital tachograph into all private hire vehicles and taxi's would create a safer environment for passengers,pedestrians and other road users.",
