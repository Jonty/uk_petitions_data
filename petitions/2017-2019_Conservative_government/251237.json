Surely at times like this, they could join forces to make this happen. Rather then paying extra for expensive guests, this could be used to just allow students to enjoy their evening and celebrate the year.",

No other university has had this issue and I feel strongly that students should have this opportunity to celebrate their achievements, in particular final year students who are leaving.",
