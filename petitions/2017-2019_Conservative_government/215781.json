        "additional_details": "-Black Arrow was cancelled in order to save cost, however it was a comparatively cheap rocket design.\r\n-All other countries that have successfully developed rocket technologies have continued to develop them further.\r\n-The lack of our own launch system has led us to rely on foreign countries, such as the Russian Soyuz rocket, which we could be prevented from using their equipment if we fall out of favour with their governments.",
        "background": "During the 1960s a British rocket named Black Arrow was created that was capable of launching payloads into orbit. However, the program was cancelled in order to save money which left the UK the only country to successfully develop and then cancel an indigenous space rocket.",
