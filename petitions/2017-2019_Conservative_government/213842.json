        "additional_details": "From our research we have got lots of stats and evidence that  racial inequality exist in football. For example we done a questionnaire and asked the question 'Do you think racism is the biggest thing in football that we need to tackle?'. 82 % said yes it is and 18% said that it isn't. These stats just prove our point that we need to put an end to inequality in football.",
        "background": "We are a group of year nines that are studying inequality in football for our coursework. We all play football and believe there is racial  inequality in sport that we need to put an end to. We believe the best way to do this is to increase the bans and fine of any racist incident in football.",
