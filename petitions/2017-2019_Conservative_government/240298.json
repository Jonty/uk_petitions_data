The law clearly states upon hitting a protected animal the driver must stop and give Insurance details, and await for the police to tell them they can go.\r\nIt's evident this doesn't happen. \r\nPets are part of our families and our families deserve to have these callous incidents fully investigated and the law used again hit and run drivers.",
