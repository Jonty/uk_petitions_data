There could be no arguing the details as they would be in the deals. \r\nWe could get useful concessions on freedom of movement etc. This could be the start of EU reform with the UK at the forefront.",
        "background": "The government can\u2019t come up with a leave deal that is not objected to from various angles. We need a binary choice that will produce a definitive way to go forwards. \r\nTo this end lets get the government of the day to start negotiations to get a remain deal. Then offer a referendum on both deals.",
