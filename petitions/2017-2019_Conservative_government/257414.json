The BBC has made promising steps in this direction. Its independence is widely acknowledged and respected. We should now give it the mandate, the funds and the force of law to build, publish and promote the transparency that an official Register of Untruths would provide.",

When incontrovertible factual evidence to the contrary becomes available it must be recorded in a public register alongside the name/s of the untruth's sponsor/s.",
