        "additional_details": "After people leave school they find they didnt need to learn these topics at all as they dont help whatsoever in their job. It seems like time wasted at school trying to get pupils to memorise something useless. While some things that are learned at school definitely help pupils, others not so much. Topics like this should only be taught later on at the end of school life when students are sure they want to pursue this or if their job requires them to know something of that topic.",
        "background": "Students from schools across the country know that in subjects like maths they have to learn topics like Pythagoras theorem. Topics like this do not need to be taught so early on as they can be very confusing and stressful to some students and others very quickly forget how to do them later on.",
