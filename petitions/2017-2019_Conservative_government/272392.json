This needs to leave no wiggle room for mis-interpretation or delay.\r\n\r\nThis is what I believe those questions should be.\r\n\r\n1.\tShould the UK revoke Article 50 and stay in the EU?\r\n\r\nSTAY or LEAVE\r\n\r\n2.\tIf more that 50% vote NOT to revoke article 50. Should we leave with the current EU proposed deal OR leave with no deal in place. \r\n\r\nLEAVE WITH CURRENT DEAL or LEAVE WITH NO DEAL\r\n\r\nThis will be followed 1 week later by a General Election with the winning party having 1 month from the election date to enact the will of the people. If we work quickly this can still happen by October 31st the current deadline.",
        "background": "The original referendum had flaws that have led us to years of people claiming that only their interpretation of the result is correct or dismissing the result on technicalities. Some claiming that the will of the country has changed, some saying that more than ever we want to leave.",
