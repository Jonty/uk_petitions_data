        "additional_details": "Since 2010 MP's (and including the current planned 2.7% increase) will have received over \u00a313,000 in pay increases whereas the likes of our teachers and nurses, police and firemen and women are worse off in real terms.\r\n\r\nThis should not be allowed to continue.\r\n\r\nThat's why I believe we should scrap the IPSA. In business, you are not rewarded for doing a bad job, for not delivering the goods. MP's should be no exception.",
        "background": "MP's are servants of the people so I believe the people, essentially their 'employer', should decide level at which MP's pay should increase.",
