        "additional_details": "Badgers are considered the most dangerous animal in the UK. I beg to differ. Man is. These beautiful creatures should be admired and protected. It should be against the law to disturb them and harm them. Leave them alone to go about their lives without the fear of being murdered.",
        "background": "It recently has been scientifically proven that badgers can be successfully inoculated so they cannot transfer Bovine TB to cattle. Its a cheaper way to prevent cattle becoming infected. Lets all sign this to try and stop the cull. Badgers should be left alone to live their lives.",
