        "additional_details": "The legislation in relation to issues of abuse is very stagnated and it needs a joined up approach and legislation.  There is not one law that covers all aspects of abuse,  There are very clear similarities with domestic abuse and workplace abuse and bullying.  Therefore, it remains unclear why, the Physiological Abuse law, part of the Serious Crime Bill, is just applicable to cases of domestic violence.  For more information, please email info@workplacebullying.me",
