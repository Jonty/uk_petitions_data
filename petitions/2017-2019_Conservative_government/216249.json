        "additional_details": "Endometriosis is a chronic illness in which 1 in 10 women will suffer with and there is still no cure. It can leave you in crippling pain so much that you can\u2019t walk, leave you curled over in pain and bedbound. Endometriosis is the 2nd most common gynaecological problem in the uk & yet people still are unsure what it is. It causes infertility 30-50% of the time. I know people who\u2019ve never been able to work with it, I myself hospitalised several times. It\u2019s an illness you can\u2019t see yet the pain is unbearable. This should be a classed disability as most women struggle to hold down a job with the amount of time you\u2019re stuck in bed due to this crippling illness. This isn\u2019t a life threatening illness, however, we have to try and live with the pain everyday.",
        "background": "After years of pain, doctors / specialists / hospital tests - I was diagnosed with endometriosis at the age of 18. Within a year I had my first 2 surgery\u2019s, neither relieved me of any pain. I\u2019ve tried every medication suggested to me, again neither relieved any pain. 6 years on, still suffering.",
