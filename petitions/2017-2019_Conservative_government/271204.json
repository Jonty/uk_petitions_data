        "additional_details": "During indicative votes, it has become increasingly clear that the majority of Parliament do not support the dangerous proposition of a no-deal Brexit. The PM has prorogued Parliament simply because he knows that while democracy exists, a no-deal Brexit will never be accepted. Experts have consistently displayed how no-deal will do significant damage to the economy. Therefore, in the national interest, the default option shouldn\u2019t be no-deal. It should be to revoke Article 50.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson has prorogued Parliament. Put simply, this undermines democracy - the Government want people to believe that they are pro-democracy by supposedly respecting the result of a referendum that was won through scaremongering and untruths. How can suspending Parliament be pro-democracy?",
