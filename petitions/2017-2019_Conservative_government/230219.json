We're not sure exactly what you mean by asking for Sensory Processing Disorder to be made a recognised disability.\r\n\r\nLaws and policies don't usually list specific conditions and define them as disabilities. In most cases, it\u2019s the impact on the person\u2019s life that qualifies them for protection under the law or makes them eligible for support. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more about how to show someone's disabled under the Equality Act here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/protected-characteristics/showing-you-re-disabled-under-the-equality-act/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
