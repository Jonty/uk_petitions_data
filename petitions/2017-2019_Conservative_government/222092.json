        "additional_details": "There are slower trains in the same route or in Route From Cambridge to Liverpool street. My understanding is we pay at least \u00a31000 for a faster peak train. Consistently being slow means we can apply for delay repay, but the fact is we have been fleeced of quite a large sum in the season ticket goes unnoticed. This is not just in Cambridge route but every route Thames-link operates. Can the parliament take some responsibility to get some justice for the beaten up middle class commuter.",
        "background": "More stops mean Season ticket holders loose out on excess money paid for faster trains over slower trains. All trains from Cambridge to kings cross route has slowed down. We commuters pay one of the highest prices in Europe for a what used to be a 55 minute travel and now a 75 minute travel.",
