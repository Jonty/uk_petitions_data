If caught, wether it's accidental or not, then punishment may be justified. However only a fine should be in place for minor offences.

The points should only be given for major offences such as (example) fault at big incidents with serious injuries or death, running a red light, running red X on motorways, exceeding speed limits by over 30mph, etc.",
