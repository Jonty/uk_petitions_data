        "action": "Make it compulsory for all schools to teach basic signs as part of curriculum",
        "additional_details": "I feel this could be achieved by each school simply having a resource pack of the compulsory words. If needed a lead person from each school could attend training and roll out to rest of the staff. This is vitally important as a large amount of children and adults with disabilities or communication issues rely on sign to support their social interaction and they should be able to communicate with everyone they meet not just a select few who can understand what they are signing. Please support us",
        "background": "My little brother has disabilities and communicates through sign. My dream is for it to be compulsary for every school to teach at least the basic keyword signs. This could be done quite easily and cost effectively. I want a world where my brother and others are not socially restricted or isolated.",
