        "additional_details": "It is horrifying knowing that more people are dying on our streets each year, with little being done to help. Some homeless people have their sleeping bags thrown away, stolen and/or vandalised. This is deeply saddening as it can be fatal for those sleeping rough in sometimes freezing conditions. Yet, this problem is easily solved. Lockers would provide the homeless with somewhere to put their belongings but would also give them safety, security and more opportunities.",
        "background": "Homeless people are often forced to risk leaving their belongings when going to places like job interviews which can be life-threatening. 597 homeless people died last year in England and Wales; an increase of 24% over the last five years.",
