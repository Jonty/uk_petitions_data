        "action": "Any MP who wishes to \"cross the floor\" must first resign and face a by-election.",
        "additional_details": "When there have been previous calls for MPs to face a by-election if they defect to a different party from the one on whose manifesto they were elected, the Government has responded that such a change would be \u201ca major constitutional reform of the role of Members of Parliament and their independence\u201d.  The failure of Parliament to carry out the democratic instruction of the British people in the 2016 referendum demonstrates that such constitutional reform is now overdue.",
        "background": "Although in a general election the electorate vote for a person, not a party, this isn't what happens in reality.  Most people vote for a particular party.  Any MP who wishes to change their allegiance to another party (or become an Independent) should first seek a mandate from their constituents.",
