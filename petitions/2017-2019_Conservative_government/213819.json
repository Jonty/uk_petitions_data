        "additional_details": "Across the UK we have become aware that we are not the only business attacked by competitors by purchasing fake, negative, reviews. We believe that a bad review should not be published until the user has proven that they are a) a genuine account, or b) have some evidence of being a genuine customer (I.e. a receipt or invoice) Currently, good reviews can be purchased from eBay, and bad reviews can be purchased from sites like Fiverr.com..",
        "background": "As a small business, we rely on our glowing and honest customer feedback. It is currently impossible to remove fake reviews, and Facebook are famous for not removing them, when reported. These can be incredibly damaging, and destroy honest, quality, businesses in the UK.",
