I feel that if sites such as pornhub took these extra precautions then maybe these children would not be exploited. Hopefully this would deter peadophiles from forcing vulnerable children into such vulgar circumstances.",

There is some seriously disturbing content that is disguised by a title on these FREE websites.",
