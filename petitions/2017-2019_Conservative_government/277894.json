In order to avoid the same problems as in the EU withdrawal referendum the Scottish independence referendum will be required to have a 60/40 majority for Scottish independence.",
        "background": "Parliament is asked to pass legislation to stop Scotland from repeatedly frustrating parliament and the UK relationship with the EU.

Parliament is not able to bind future Parliaments to a decision, so any ban on a referendum or a requirement for a 2/3 majority for an action could be removed by a simple majority.  \r\n\t\r\nYou could start a new petition calling for Parliament not to agree to a new referendum before a 20 year period has elapsed, if that's what you'd like to see happen.
