        "additional_details": "Two parents living together can both earn \u00a350000 and keep all of their benefits. Another family can have one parent earning \u00a360000 and the other earning nothing and they have to return all the benefits. This is a massive difference in household income and is hitting honest working families. With this law people earning \u00a360000 are not only paying 40% tax on that money but are also being charged with child benefit fines meaning they are working for very little on the income between \u00a350k and \u00a360k.",
        "background": "In 2013 the government introduced a fine on UK tax payers (with children) who earn over \u00a350000 per year. For every \u00a31000 over \u00a350000 the person must pay back 10% of their child benefits meaning somebody earning \u00a360000 must return all benefits paid. This amount is equal to \u00a32501 for a 3 child family.",
