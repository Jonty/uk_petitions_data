Simply for their own gain. The will of the people was decided on the night of 23 June 2016, therefore as alleged elected officials these ambassadors of democracy that sit in parliament should do what they were elected to do. Obey the people!",

It was implied by the former PM David Cameron that the result would be honoured and that the result would require a winning vote of 50%+1. Of which the final result was to indeed leave the EU.",
