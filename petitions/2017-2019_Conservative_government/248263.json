Lets eradicate the lies, hidden agendas, and uncover the politicians who seem to jump ship when the time suits, blocking national interests. By questioning, we the public will vote on an outcome that is split in government. Such as the brexit vote, or the more recent dispute between May and MP's. Audience demographic scholars & workers",
