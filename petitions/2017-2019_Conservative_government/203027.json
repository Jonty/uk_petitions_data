        "additional_details": "Jeremy Corbyn refuses to sing the National Anthem, refuses to pay respects to the Monarchy nor has he shown any respect recognition or gratitude to our Armed forces past or present. Therefore he has no reason to attend Remembrance day ceremonies other than to  show his disrespect. As an ex serviceman I would see his attendance as a spit in the face of those who gave more to this country than he ever could.",
        "background": "The current Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn has in the past shown he has no interest in showing gratitude or respect to our fallen. Therefore should be banned from attending and using this as a political platform to discourage national pride.",
