        "additional_details": "What has been happening to our country is ridiculous; it's only causing more division and the people are fed up with it. The Tories have proven time and time again that they're only interested in themselves rather than creating a better economy and country for all to benefit from.\r\nRemember, over 100 Conservative MPs voted no confidence in Theresa May's leadership and over 100 would have voted against her deal.\r\nSo a 325 vote in favour of parliament proves that they're only interested in themselves.",
        "background": "Due to the horrendous negotiations of the Conservatives with the EU, we the people, call for the dissolving of parliament and an immediate general election as we have absolutely no confidence in the government.",
