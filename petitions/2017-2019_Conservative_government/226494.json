        "additional_details": "An example of a hospital that charges the staff is West Middlesex Hospital in Isleworth. \r\n\r\nAn NHS nurse from the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, Wales, was charged \u00a3150,000 even though she had paid for a permit to park at the hospital. However, as there was not enough space in the staff car park, she had to park in the visitor car park and so was fined 3 to 4 times a week.\r\n\r\nTo be an essential part in saving lives, you should not have to worry about receiving fines while at work.",
        "background": "At hospitals in the UK, NHS staff have to pay for their parking. To be charged to spend your day dedicated to helping others is unjust. \r\n\r\nStaff can get permits to reduce the parking prices but they are only valid in the staff car park where there are not enough spaces for all of the staff to park.",
