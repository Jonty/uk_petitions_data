        "additional_details": "Many students already find school a struggle and now with the new grading system and exams how are we going to cope? All the pressure from these new GCSE\u2019s are making me and many of my friends paranoid we are going to fail. I personally do not understand why the government has changed this, is it because they want us all to fail?",
        "background": "I\u2019m a year 10 student and will be taking my GCSE\u2019s next year. Being someone who isn\u2019t the brightest student, I\u2019m struggling to learn all the information from different 10 subjects. How are children supposed to learn over 18 poems off by heart in English? 6 exam papers in science?",
