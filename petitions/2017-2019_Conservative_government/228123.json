        "additional_details": "2018 Public Health England published a report that vaping is less harmfu than tobacco, but health experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Liverpool claim evidence used in the report was flawed, based on inconclusive evidence which was tainted by vested interests.\r\nWriting in the BMJ, Professor Martin McKee and Professor Simon Capewell said there was no reliable evidence to show that e-cigarettes were safe or that they did not provide a \u2018gateway\u2019 to smoking for youngsters.",
        "background": "I find the excessive smoke from vaping in enclosed spaces quite upsetting and which makes me cough. It would be a step backwards in allowing smoking in confined spaces due to the effects upon others nearby. On a train a person may be vaping in the next seat which is unacceptable.",
