        "additional_details": "I have spoken to a few diabetics who have the same problem as me, not many places have the information needed for carbohydrate counting, you ask for a nutrition sheet and it tells you the sugar, fat, calories, energy etc but not the carbohydrate amount. This makes diabetes control harder when out. (I have myself as evidence for that). For example I was at zizzis and they couldn't provide the information i needed and guessing my insulin amount lead to me having a blood glucose reading of 17.5",
        "background": "Whenever I go out for a meal at a pub, restaurant, fast food place etc I have to try and guess how much insulin I need to take with that meal as most dont provide the carbohydrate information besides McDonalds that I've seen. It makes it very difficult to control my glucose levels (type 1 diabetic)",
