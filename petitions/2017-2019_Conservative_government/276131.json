Research has found that the number of young people struggling with gambling addiction has quadrupled in just 2 years. The gambling commision estimate that 55,000 children in the UK are now classed with having a gambling addiction. Advertisments for gambling needs to be banned to prevent more young children being victims to online gambling sites.",
