        "additional_details": "If this petition is looked at by the government, it could end up helping obesity problems in the country, as children can learn to make healthy meals that they can make at home. As a high-schooler, I can say that you don\u2019t start learning to make real, healthy meals until year 10 if you take food tech as an A level. If not, you make bread and soup: not the greatest of meals. I feel like this has been ovelooked, and schools definitely need to teach kids things like politics and money saving tips.",
        "background": "So many students nowadays aren\u2019t learning skills that they will actually use until later on in life: some won\u2019t even learn to cook until year 9 or 10. This could make their lives even harder in the long run, when they can\u2019t make meals at all.",
