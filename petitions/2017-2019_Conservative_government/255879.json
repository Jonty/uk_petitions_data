It's bad enough they dont turn up for meetings on tax reductions and military funding, but have a meeting on their pay and BOOM.... they crawl out the wood work. Fall asleep at work and you dont get paid for the day. I think that's pretty fair.",

If anyone falls asleep at work that's a disciplinary, why should MPs be different when they are paid so much and are suppose to be working for the country? Fall asleep and you dont get paid. Do your job!",
