        "action": "Remove the congestion charge for the private hire vehicles.",
        "additional_details": "The Travelling Public, hospitals, sports facilities, businesses, places of entertainment and Local Authorities are dependent on London\u2019s PHVs (Private Hire Vehicles) as a primary form of affordable transport. Introducing this congestion charge will make it only difficult for the drivers and riders. They are far more environmentally friendly than the average London Taxi. TfL are not proposing that London Taxis should be Congestion Charged, which may have serious equality and competition issues.",
        "background": "TfL has proposed a fee for Private Hire Vehicles to reduce congestion. This however does not achieve this instead it's making it more expensive to get to work or home safely. Most fares would need to increase between 10 & 20% and minicabs could become as expensive as black cab.",
