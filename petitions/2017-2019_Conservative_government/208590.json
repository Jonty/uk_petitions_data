        "additional_details": "Each year elitist celebrities are given honours with a significant amount of them being awarded to people that have no relevance to the general population. Honours are awarded to dancers or clothes designers that do not impact on the life of 99.9% of the population. This leads to an \u201cus and them\u201d mentality in our society. Give honours to those that have sacrificed themselves to and for the public.",
        "background": "It should be written into law that each year at least 10 people from each of the emergency services, teachers and the NHS with over 20 years service should be honoured for their service to the people of the country.",
