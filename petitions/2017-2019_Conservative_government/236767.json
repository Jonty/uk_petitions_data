This can happen by redirecting users to a fake verification processing website, thus prompting users to enter their personal details. This method has been used in different scenarios and will be used again via this process. The majority of British public will agree that this system is flawed and anyone with a common sense will tell you this is a responsibility of a parent, not the government.",
