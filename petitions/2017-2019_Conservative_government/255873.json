We need time to restore trust in our political system. Revoking article 50 gives us the time to reassess.\r\n\r\nOnly 37 out of 195 democracies in the world use winner takes all systems, and most of these are former British colonies. New Zealand, Italy and Japan have all reformed to Proportional Representation in recent decades. \r\n\r\nIt's time for us to revoke, reform and repair.",
        "background": "This petition seeks to revoke article 50, use what would have been the transition period to reform to a system of proportional representation and repair our communities.",
