        "action": "Make a legal requirement for businesses and households to have recycling bins",
        "additional_details": "While recycling rates have been increasing (40.4% up to 45.7% for UK total between 2010 and 2017), there's still lots of BMW sent to landfill (biodegradable municipal waste ie stuff that could be recycled). In 2017 this ammounted to 7.4 million tonnes, while this ammount does meet EU targets it is still too much. Resources are wasted recovering these recyclable materials from landfill and not all are recovered. Therefore ever waste producing establishment should by law have recycling facilities.",
        "background": "As a student I have lived and worked in lots of different establishments, majority of which have not had facilities in which to recycle waste, this has resulted in lots of commonly recyclable things being sent to landfill. Making recycling facilities a legal requirement will better the environment.",
