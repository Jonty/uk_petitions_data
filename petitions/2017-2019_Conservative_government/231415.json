        "additional_details": "I am 18 years of age, during high school while I was 16, I was made to pay for a tampon at my school reception. While i understand they pay for the tampons and have to make the money back, some children cannot afford to pay for sanitary products at home, let alone at school too. Contraceptive products such as condoms are freely distributed throughout almost all schools in the country, however more and more schools are charging students for sanitary products, which they genuinely need.",
        "background": "I believe sanitary products in schools should be free and fully available for students who need them, especially if they cannot afford them.",
