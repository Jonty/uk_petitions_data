        "additional_details": "UK schools are currently facing an enormous challenge. Although the government tells us that school funding is at record levels the reality is that pupil costs and numbers are both rising. Despite their best efforts schools are considering:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIncreasing class sizes\r\n\u2022\tReducing courses \r\n\u2022\tCutting extra-curricular activities\r\n\u2022\tReducing pastoral care and removing counselling support\r\n\u2022\tReducing training for teachers\r\n\u2022\tReducing support staff to work with children with additional needs",
        "background": "Although the government has increased funding to schools we believe the increase is inadequate and we ask that it be reviewed. Any increase should reflect rising costs so that UK schools can continue providing the exceptional quality of education that our children deserve.",
