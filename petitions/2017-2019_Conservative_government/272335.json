If 2500 sign any given petition 4 times it reaches the 10000 required for the government to take action by responding.

They use a number of techniques, automated and manual, to identify and block signatures from bots, disposable email addresses or other sources that show signs of fraudulent activity. They also monitor signing patterns. For security reasons, we don\u2019t tell people when their fraudulent activity has been unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t comment in detail about the security measures, but all petitions are subject to checks as part of due diligence and any concerns investigated.\r\n\r\nWe're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. At the moment, under the rules agreed by the House of Commons, anyone who is a UK resident or British Citizen can start or sign a petition. This includes people who do not have national insurance numbers, for example people who are under 16 and some British citizens who live abroad.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like the rules on petitions to change, so that only people with National Insurance numbers are eligible to sign petitions and need to provide their NI number to sign, you might like to sign this petition:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/260039\r\n"
