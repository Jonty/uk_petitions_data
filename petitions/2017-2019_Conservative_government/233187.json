        "additional_details": "I believe that all hospitals should have wards for young people to help with the transition between child and adult services, I feel that a young person being placed on an adult ward is daunting, stressful, worrying and uncomfortable. Mixing 16-21 year olds girls with men in their 70\u2019s, 80\u2019s & 90\u2019s or vice versa is not ideal! This needs to change",
        "background": "My daughter has a congenital heart defect and has been admitted to hospital many times in since turning 16 as she is no longer classed as a child patient this means she is put on adult wards which are often mixed this is uncomfortable for any young person.",
