        "additional_details": "By 2 degrees of warming, it is predicted that 100% of coral reefs would be wiped out, and the impact on the arctic would be unimaginable.\r\n\r\nIf we wait any longer than we have, more damage to the environment will be done, and it will be irreversible.\r\n\r\nAn average car journey from London to Oxford produces over 10 Kg of CO2. This journey by train per passenger would be around 1/4 of the emissions.\r\n\r\nClimate change is happening now.",
        "background": "After three years of research, and a week of discussion, a team of scientists proved that - unless drastic action is take - the 1.5C rise in temperature could be exceeded by 2030.\r\nA dramatic drop in train fares would encourage the use of public transport - helping massively to reduce CO2 emissions.",

Most rail fares are set by train operating companies. Some are regulated by the Government, which means the company can only raise them by up to a certain amount.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition to ask the Government to fund a dramatic drop in rail fares or to change the way they are set if that is something you would like to see happen."
