        "additional_details": "I understand milk is cheaper to buy at supermarkets now. But It's something I feel parliament should discuss as that was a small part of British history gone. I feel it's always important to stay connected to our roots.",
        "background": "It's something that's sad, losing the Milkman services feels like a loss to the history of the UK. But generally I see it as a logical step as a lot of people are lazy now a days. It could also give people more jobs to deliver milk to peoples houses. It could even be a subscription service.",
