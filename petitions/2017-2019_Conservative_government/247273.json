No arguing why or what for, We the British people gave you the British government and our M.P.s a mandate to leave the E.U. on the 29th March 2019. We didn't vote for a deal or no deal. Just to leave. There was nothing on the voting paper to say we had a choice of how we leave, It was simply put leave or stay. We voted out. The government then brought in they needed a deal. The M.P.s are not representing their constituents and are moving forward on there own personal views. If they cant represent they're people then they should step down or be voted out. We the British people commend you leave the European union on the 29th March 2019 on W.T.O. No deal Brexit. We commend this to the house.",
