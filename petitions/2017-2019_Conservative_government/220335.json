        "additional_details": "I believe there is a 'conflict of interest' letting betting companies deal with 'Self exclusion' and 'Affordability checks'.   Betting companies do not identify problem gamblers and there is no instructions how they could identify problem gamblers.  Amounts placed and frequency is not monitored.  Could the government, working with betting firms, consider a 'gambling card' be introduced based on someone's income.  Gambling is not FUN if someone can lose more than they can afford to.",
        "background": "Gambling was legalised in 1961 for better government control and to allow SMALL bets to be placed. There are 450k-2million problem gamblers that effect 2-10million people in the UK.  Can i suggest that the UK government considers the introduction of a 'gambling card' that will control gambling.",
