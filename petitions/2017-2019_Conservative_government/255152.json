MPs are already required to register and declare financial interests. If there is a conflict between their personal interest and the public interest, they must resolve it straightaway and in favour of the public interest. Complaints that a Member has breached the Code of Conduct are examined by the independent Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.\r\n\r\nYou can find the Code of Conduct for the House of Commons here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/code-of-conduct-and-rules-of-the-house/ \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling for those rules to be changed if that is something you would like to see happen."
