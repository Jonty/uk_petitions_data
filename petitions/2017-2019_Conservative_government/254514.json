It is not fair that we as a people need to scrape up every penny to have a day out wvery now and then when we work full time. THIS HAS TO CHANGE",
        "background": "It is ridiculous that every time we get a 30p pay rise and the mp and pm get thousands of pound that our council tax and working tax get higher, why do we pay tax for police and hospitals if we pay national insurance aswell it should only be one of them",

Local councils are responsible for deciding the level of council tax in their area.\r\n\r\nYou could raise your issue with a local councillor, who represents you. You can use this page to find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them:\r\n \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors.\r\n"
