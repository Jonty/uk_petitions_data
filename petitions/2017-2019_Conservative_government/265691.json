        "additional_details": "This Borough has a fine tradition of progressive thought and openness towards civilised debate. The recent action by Mark Field MP at a Mansion House dinner was in complete contrast. As well as his unacceptable and apparently instinctive use of force against a woman, he demonstrated a contempt for the principle of peaceful protest. \r\n \r\nMr Field's behaviour was not becoming of the office he holds and is entirely indefensible.",
