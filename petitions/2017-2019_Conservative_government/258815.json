        "additional_details": "If the free travel age limit is raised to 21 this would benefit college and university students a lot. This means they have to spend less money which then means less financial difficulties and this lowers the chance for any more additional problems.\r\n\r\nUnder 16s don't travel as often as college or university students. Furthermore university students are hard at work getting a degree, where will they have time to work in order to pay for their travel. This will imply more stress upon them.\r\n\r\nM.A",
        "background": "In the UK, bus rides are free to anyone under 18. The age should be raised to 21 because , personally, I felt I never used my free travel untill I was 16. Children whom I've talked to also said they don't rest travel much yet university students travel a lot, hence the age should me raised to 21",
