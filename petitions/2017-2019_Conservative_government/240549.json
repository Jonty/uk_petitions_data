        "additional_details": "1 billion prescriptions were dispensed in the UK last year.  We import 73% of our meds.  Surely there is not enough capacity to stockpile for this and not enough capacity to guarantee supplies entering the country. Lives are at risk.  We also import 40% of our food, which means shortages.  Tariffs would mean that vulnerable people might not be able to afford to eat a proper meal.  Jobs are already being lost as \r\nfinancial institutions and manufacturers depart.",
        "background": "The govt is leading us to no-deal. If we 'crash out' people will die from shortages of food and meds, more jobs and livelihoods will be lost and the Troubles will return to N.Ireland. This humanitarian crisis cannot be allowed to happen and must be stopped as a matter of urgency.",
