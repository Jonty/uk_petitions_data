        "additional_details": "Alongside the skateparks & users being shunned to the side every time we make a point like we are lesser than everyone else, we have the added insult of 9 football pitches that span 36,450 square metres (average) that go unused all year round\r\n\r\nWe want more for the extreme sports enthusiasts of our local area, as I can guarantee there are more people that use both skateparks in 3 months than use football pitches all year round.\r\n\r\nIf you agree please sign up & share this petition!",
        "background": "I have been a local to Tonbridge since birth, our first skatepark (longmead was built in 2004 & town park in 2011)\r\nThese are the most overused places in Tonbridge that are in dire need of an upgrade, however the 9 football pitches in longmead generally go unused all year round, let\u2019s make it known",
