Why offer a blanket deal instead of country by country bilaterals? All EU Nationals coming to live in Britain should have to wait at least 5 years before being allowed \"full voting rights\" This decision is a betrayal what 17.4m people voted for. No EU nationals should be allowed to vote In General Elections for at least 5 years.",
