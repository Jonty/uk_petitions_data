The courts can allow an owner to keep a Pit Bull if it decides the dog is not a danger to the public, but the dog must be kept on a lead and muzzled at all times when in public.\r\n\r\nWe're sorry to hear what happened to your dogs. If you think someone has broken the law you could contact the police:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.police.uk/contact/\r\n\r\nWe're not sure what else you would like the Government or Parliament to do. You could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Government and Parliament for more resources to enforce the current law, or to change the law to require all bull breeds of dog to be muzzled and on a lead in public, if those are things that you want to happen.
