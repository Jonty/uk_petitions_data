        "additional_details": "Only the European court of justice or European parliament may revoke this. \r\n\r\nNormally, a country may revoke a citizenship it has granted if the owner of said citizenship has committed a serious crime, and even then only in rare cases.\r\n\r\nIt is not up to the British Government to decide in the Brexit deal what shall happen to those with European citizenship, since it was awarded by the European body, and not the government of the United Kingdom.",
        "background": "The U.K. does not have jurisdiction to revoke the European Citizenship of those who wish to keep it.\r\n\r\nTo clarify; by \"European Citizenship\", we mean a \"Citizen of the European Union\", and not someone who has citizenship from a country in Europe, although they may have both.",
