        "additional_details": "In the absence of any other options, the two choices open to the UK are a \"No Deal Brexit\" or remaining within the EU. A \"No Deal Brexit\" was not one of the choices offered in the original referendum, so it would be undemocratic for the UK government to proceed with a No Deal Brexit without putting this hugely important matter to the British people.",
        "background": "The EU Withdrawal Agreement does not seem to have parliamentary support. If parliament rejects the deal, and all further possibility of negotiation has been exhausted, the government should hold a referendum giving us the choice between a no-deal Brexit and remaining in the EU.",
