        "additional_details": "If you are a doctor, and your patient is sick, you work to treat them. You find the source of the illness and provide appropriate treatment. Much like a patient, our planet is sick and dying. Only, unlike doctors, we know the cause of the illness, we have ran tests for over half a decade, yet we are allowing our planet to go untreated. Signing its death warrant. \r\n\r\nThat is not right. \r\n\r\nDeclaring a climate emergency is the first step in treating our planet and preventing total climate breakdown.",
        "background": "The evidence for Climate Change is immense, and we are seeing the effects right now. From rising sea levels, to 15 degree weather in February; the time to act is now. Strikes and protests across the country prove there is support for declaring a climate emergency and acting to prevent catastrophe.",
