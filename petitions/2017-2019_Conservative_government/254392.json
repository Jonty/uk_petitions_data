        "additional_details": "The inquest should look at: setting up of the options, process of informing the public, splitting lies from truth, the use of social media to taylor specific messages to individual groups, the use of legally advisory referenda when promising to carry out the results (politically binding) and the role/responsibilities of media in our democracy.",
        "background": "The brexit referendum was a farce...\r\n\r\nWhether it was the big red bus and the \"all things to all people\" policy of leave or the \"using tax payers money for pro remain leaflets\" policy of the pro-remain government.\r\n\r\nThat referendum split families and country. It can't be allowed to happen again",
