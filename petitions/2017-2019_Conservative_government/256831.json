        "action": "Change the Motorcycle Licence Progressive Scheme.",
        "additional_details": "The current Motorcycle Licence Progressive Scheme is outdated and unfair on motorcyclists due to making motorcyclists retake the same practical riding tests in order to get a full motorcycle licence. Example if a motorcyclist holds an A2 Licence they must wait two years in order to retake the same practical tests again that they have already done. The DVLA should change this scheme after two years, motorcyclists can take a course instead of a resit on their same motorcycle test of module 1/2.",
        "background": "Currently motorcyclists have to take a CBT, Theory Test along with Module 1 and Module 2 practical tests in order to pass their riding test. If a motorcyclist decides to upgrade their motorcycle licence they have to retake their Module 1/2 again after two years of holding their current licence.",
