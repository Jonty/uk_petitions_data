        "action": "Internet companies to pay in advance a minimum corporation tax / business rate",
        "additional_details": "The traditional bricks and mortar retailers pay local business rates, more corporation tax and other taxes that benefit the local economy and country as a whole.  Small and medium enterprises should be encouraged not penalised.  Internet based companies avoid virtually all corporation tax and even the FTSE 100 companies pay as a percentage of turnover as little as 1% in corporation tax on average so even the most competitive companies will not be disadvantaged by this petition!",
        "background": "Internet based companies have an unfair competitive advantage over the traditional bricks and mortar retailers.  To help redress the balance, UK online internet sales should be subject to a minimum 1% corporation tax and/or business rate charge, payable in advance, on each transaction.",
