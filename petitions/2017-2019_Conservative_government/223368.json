        "additional_details": "Cannabis could actually be the safest drug available, after a study found it is actually 114 times less deadly than alcohol, according to the journal, Scientific Reports. Despite the predictions of you right-wing nutters, in Colorado, which legalised recreational use of marijuana, there has been no epidemic of crime. Marijuana can kill cancer cells and can also shrink some of the most serious types of brain tumours. If we legalised cannabis, up to \u00a3900m could be raised annually in taxes.",
        "background": "Marijuana is not a misused drug, it\u2019s fairly safe, if its done properly. Legalisation will then allow a better version of the drug to be distrubuted to smokers. Legalisation will recharge the British Economy.",
