        "additional_details": "A journey from Leeds to London on the M1 can take from 3 hours to 5 hours.  There are road upgrades which go on for miles to simply create a more controlled environment.\r\nA train from London to Leeds can cost up to \u00a3400 return and weekends the journey can take 3.5 hours.\r\nThe cost to our economy of the delays caused by this will be substantial.  The current transport infrastructure is not fit for purpose and the person responsible need to suffer at its hands as the rest of us do",
        "background": "Commuters are facing a transport system in heavy decline.  Motorways are hugely congested, littered with roadworks and journey times are unpredictable. Railways are slow, subject to delays, cancellations and huge expense.  Clearly a transport secretary who had to experience this would deal with it",
