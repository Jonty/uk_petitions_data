Everyone is entitled to 2 days off per week, one of those shouldn't be ruined by inconsiderate construction right next door. \r\n\r\nLimiting working hours on a Sarurday to start at 9am instead of 8am would be an improvement, plus keeping the afternoon limit at a 1pm finish.",
        "background": "A council owned building has been under construction next door to us on an otherwise very quiet residential street. For the past 4 months they have been working noisily from 8am, 6 days a week with no warning or apologies from the construction firm",
