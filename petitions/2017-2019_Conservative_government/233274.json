        "action": "Abolish married couple's allowance and marriage allowance",
        "additional_details": "I believe this law to be in breach of the Equality Act 2010 as it discriminates on the basis of sexuality and (in the case of the married couple's allowance) gender. I believe this to be archaic and not at all fitting with the present times - married people are not any poorer than cohabiting or single people. So why should they be taxed less? Why do we still have a law that is based on the husband's income? It's 2018 isn't it?",
        "background": "This legislation is outdated and discriminatory. It discriminates against asexuals and aromatics. It is also sexist as for those on married couple's allowance (who married before December 2005), the break is based in the husband's income regardless of who actually earns the most.",
