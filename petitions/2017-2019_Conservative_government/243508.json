        "additional_details": "My current idea would have ratings on things such as: \r\nImpact of transporting goods \r\nImpact on ecosystem (Such as deforestation)\r\nImpact of production (Has the actual production or growth been unnecessarily damaging or resource heavy)\r\n\r\nThe categories would be given a number and averaged into one. The full rating could be accessed online or on an app by QR codes for full information.\r\nSurely having informed choices on the impact food has on planetary health is just as important as personal health.",
        "background": "Food in the UK must show dietary information, such as calories, fat content and sugar. If you can know what is in your food, surely you have a right to know the impact on our planet. The health of our planet is just as important. I propose a similar system rating environmental impact of food goods.",
