        "action": "Disregard student loan as 'unearned income' in Universal Credit claims.",
        "additional_details": "This is because for every \u00a31 of 'unearned income', \u00a31 of Universal Credit will be deducted from the claim. For example; the maximum student loan is \u00a3675 per month therefore, \u00a3675 will be deducted from any money due to be paid by UC. This includes the child element which is not protected from unearned income. This means that many lone parent students are eligible for \u00a30 UC despite previously receiving a legacy benefit such as Child Tax Credits. Student loan should not effect this.",
        "background": "Under the new Universal Credit system, some of the most vulnerable students are being forced to live below the poverty line. Despite having to be paid back (with interest), a student loan is currently regarded by DWP as 'unearned income' meaning many lone parent students are not receiving UC.",
