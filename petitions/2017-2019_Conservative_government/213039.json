        "additional_details": "As you may already know, this offensive is in its 27th day today. Hundreds and thousands of Kurdish people are still resisting and are at high risk of displacement and death. The Turkish state aims not only to displace and slaughter kurds but to create a safe haven for ISIS and AL QEUDA militia. The UK government NEEDS to look for some form of solutions as this is an INTERNATIONAL CRISIS. Please note, a similar petition has been introduced and signed by 41 senators in the French parliament.",
        "background": "In January 2018, the Turkish military began an operation in the Kurdish-majority Afrin Canton and the Tel Rifaat Area of Shahba Canton in Northern Syria. Turkey code-named the operation as Operation Olive Branch. The offensive is against the Kurdish-led Democratic Union Party in Syria (PYD).",
