        "additional_details": "It is clear that the solution is not just additional funding. It is universally accepted that there are many interconnected issues that significantly and negatively impact upon an acceptable level of provision of both the health and social services.\r\nThis is a nationally critical and urgent problem that has been inadequately addressed by successive governments and which affects every man, woman and child in the UK. It requires a coalition of heart and the finest minds to provide the solution.",
        "background": "Whatever the inefficiencies in the NHS & Social services currently, it is clear that we have a capacity issue at peak times, specifically in the Winter. As a civilised society we must ensure that these services are adequately funded in both the short-, and long-term.\r\nMore details provided",
