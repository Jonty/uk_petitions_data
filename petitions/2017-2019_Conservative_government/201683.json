        "additional_details": "We have a major issue in Cornwall in peak holiday time, childcare and work. Locals need to work in the busy period which unfortunately detracts from the quality family time.  If the Cornish summer holiday is moved to June then it allows families quality time and also serve their employer in peak time. Childcare needs to be accessible for all workers meaning in holidays it will have tourists more as locals will be at school keeping the flow of the economy in the area for smooth running long-term.",
        "background": "Many families have to work in August under the work agreement(peak time). Tourists flood to Cornwall, preventing family time or  going on holiday. All families should have quality family time as a human rights law  but this is absent in tourist resorts, I suggest change the summer holiday.",
