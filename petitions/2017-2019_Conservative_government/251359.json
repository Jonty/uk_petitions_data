Why do we need to be constantly bombarded with outrageously loud music, PA announcements and otherwise wherever we go? This discomfort during shopping trips for some is such a disruption that we often leave feeling anxious, deflated and downright upset that this preventable absurdness has yet to be stopped. Let's introduce a lower noise limit, now!",
