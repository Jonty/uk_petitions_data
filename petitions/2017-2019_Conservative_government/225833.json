        "additional_details": "24/07/2018 a teenage boy went out on his bike, without a helmet. For fun he raced his friend on a main road, ignored give way junctions and hit a vehicle. The vehicle had nowhere to go, it was her right of way. Police praised the drivers reactions and driving skills, but the driver is now left with a \u00a31000+ bill for damage that was not her fault! Loss of no claims and a huge rise in her insurance! This is unfair and unjust! It would be different if the driver did not give way or hit the child!!",
        "background": "Many cyclists ignore traffic lights, ignore give way signs and can often be the cause of damage to vehicles and yet it is the driver of the car who has to pay for the damage",
