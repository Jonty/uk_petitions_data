For example, you could start a new petition asking the Government to fund more mental health services for children in care, if that's what you'd like to happen. You could also start a new petition asking for an urgent review into the care system and its impact on children's mental health, if that's what you'd like to happen. \r\n\r\nIf you do start a new petition, you'll need to use your full name.
