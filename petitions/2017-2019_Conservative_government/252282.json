        "additional_details": "This could be a source of revenue for the Government, with heavy fines for companies who miss this target. It would also help the Goverment generate jobs and aid their commitment towards a circular economy.\r\n\r\nLegislation would help enforce this and the emphasis would be on companies to finance the transition, not the UK tax payer.",
        "background": "The UK fails to recycle over 1.5 million tonnes of plastic packaging waste each year, which ends up in landfill & waterways instead.\r\n\r\nCreating packaging that our society cannot deal with is blatantly unsustainable. We urgently need 100% recyclable/compostable packaging on every product in the UK.",
