        "additional_details": "Return the judicial hierarchy to exactly how it was before the Supreme Court was founded in 2009 with the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary at the top, as if the Supreme Court had never been established. Also pass an Act declaring the Supreme Courts ruling in the \"R (Miller) v The Prime Minister and Cherry v Advocate General for Scotland\" null and void so it can never be used as a precedent and forbid the judiciary in any way being allowed to rule on the exercise of prorogation.",
        "background": "Abolish the Supreme Court. To clarify what I mean by abolish I mean: Abolish it, get rid of it, remove it, expunge it, eliminate it, exterminate it! Then pass a Bill declaring that no court may ever treat a case regarding the exercise of prorogation as justiciable.",
