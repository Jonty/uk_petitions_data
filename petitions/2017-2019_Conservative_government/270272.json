Unsold food can be giver to charities,homeless people or taken home by the members of staff at their own accord and responsibility.\r\nWith so much food produced there shouldn't be hunger at all.\r\nTherefore I cannot support a government that prefers to throw away food rather than give it away.\r\nWe have lived well,happy and much healthier long before food safety nonsense was invented and as a matter of fact we are much more unhealthy now with all current safety.",
        "background": "I will not accept laws that contravene nature and it's importance while at the same time making sure that everything natural is expensive.\r\nThese laws and people cannot be considered as normal and accepted as they are destructive and wasteful in every way.",
