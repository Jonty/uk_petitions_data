Plastic is a fantastic material that will be needed for some time, but the pollution caused by making it is part of the reason for the climate catastrophe and ecological disaster that is happening right now. We are calling on the government to enact laws to prevent shops using plastic just for their pricing policy.",
        "background": "We are all eating, drinking and breathing plastic. Whales and birds are dying. We must REDUCE the amount we use. Tins don't need plastic wrappers, oranges and lemons don't need plastic nets, this is a totally unnecessary use of plastic. The shops can advertise their multi-buys on the shelf.",
