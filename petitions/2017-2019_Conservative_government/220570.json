        "additional_details": "Football banning orders for use of pyrotechnics are at minimum 3 years through a court and can go up to 10 years. Even if you are caught with the smoke bomb in a bag search, the punishments can be just as harsh as if you had let it off.",
        "background": "The majority of countries within Europe and South America allow fans to use pyrotechnics such as smoke bombs and flares at football matches however current law states that in UK they are not allowed and the use of them can lead to stadium bans as well as custodial sentences.",
