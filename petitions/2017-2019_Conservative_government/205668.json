        "additional_details": "Non human animals show obvious traits of emotion, look at elephants mourning, dogs cowering from an abusive owner, koko the gorilla who showed real signs of depression, and obvious signs of love. On a more ridiculous level with this, they very much do feel pain, if you accidentally step on a cats tail, they react to the pain. If this notion of animals can't feel pain makes it into law, then there's no such thing as animal abuse, microwaving a rabbit alive causes no pain to it, idiotic.",
        "background": "Today (20th Nov 2017) it got voted in that animals don't feel pain or emotions, Facts can't be chosen, voting science in and out of law is not how it works. Animals feel pain, can be distressed and have emotion, there is no logical argument against that, E.g. mammals share the same nervous system.",
