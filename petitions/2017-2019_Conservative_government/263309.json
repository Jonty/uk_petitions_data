        "additional_details": "In the latest European election, the Conservatives and Labour received 22% of the vote. They currently have 89% of MPs. This disparity needs to stop.\r\nTo do this, we should group current constituencies into regions of 10 constituencies and have the voting mirror the European system. This would mean that if a party got 10% of the vote in a region, they would expect 1 MP. The 10 MPs elected in a region would then be assigned a constituency to ensure that local views are represented in parliament.",
        "background": "The current electoral system (first past the post) favours a two party system that has been clearly shown to not reflect the views of the country.\r\nWe should change how we select MPs to increase smaller party representation (Brexit party, Lib Dem, Green) by using the European election model.",
