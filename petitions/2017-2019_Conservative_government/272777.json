        "action": "Implement a No Deal Brexit by 31st October 2019 at the latest",
        "additional_details": "In June 2016 the people voted, by a majority which exceeded the combined populations of Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle to leave the EU. Since then a combination of middle class pseudo liberals, self interested politicians and ignorant media figures have conspired to negate this decision. These people have spent three years trying to dishonour the greatest democratic decision taken in these islands, and now they try to present themselves as the guardians of democracy.",
        "background": "The only way to regain our freedom is to make a clean break with the EU, and this requires a No Deal Brexit. We have waited since June 2016 for the result of the referendum to be implemented. Any further delay would be an outrage and a negation of democracy. We have nothing to fear but fear itself",
