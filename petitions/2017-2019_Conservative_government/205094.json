An account on fb has been reported over and over and apparently it doesn't violate there terms... even though they have put death threats on there wall and the account is still allowed even though it is a fake. accounts should be verified and teenagers should have limited use and if you break the rules or law you should be banned from the site.. lets try to tackle cyberbullying and fake accounts",
        "background": "There are alot of fake accounts on facebook etc and nothing gets done about it. i believe social media should check these accounts properly and put a verified sticker next to people who have proved there age and name. i also believe they need to look into these accounts properly when we report them",
