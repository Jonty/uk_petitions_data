        "additional_details": "I'm starting this petition because I am a type 1 diabetic and I have to use a sharps disposal bin for my insulin cartridges, needles, blood test strips and my blood testing pen drums. Because this is a lot of sharps wastage i end up filling a sharps bin within a couple weeks.The collection of sharps bins used to be free of charge but now there not, you can only have 2 free collections per 12 months and any other collections after would be \u00a35 each time, so I would end up spending \u00a330 or even more per year because I have a lot of sharps wastage from my diabetic stuff. I find this very unfair for anyone who uses a sharps disposal bin as no one chooses to be ill and have to use sharps bin for their wastage and some people might not be able to afford it.",
