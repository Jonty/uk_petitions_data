        "additional_details": "Plastic is polluting our oceans, rivers and planet. Please read any of the information online from marine health organisations, to know this is not speculation, but fact. We are slowly destroying the planet, and as one of the more affluent countries in the world, we need to be seen to be doing something about the problem. We should be leading the world on green issues; not playing catch up. Wealth is important, but the health of the planet is worth more than financial stability of our country.",
        "background": "We are now forced to pay 5p per bag, which is good, and a step in the right direction, but it isn't enough. There is no advantage of plastic over paper, and the modern lifestyle means many people are 'impromptu shoppers', and usually have no issue spending 5p for a bag. It hasn't fixed the problem.",
