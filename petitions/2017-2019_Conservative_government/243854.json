        "additional_details": "By simply changing minor details vulnerable people are able to open multiple gambling accounts and finance this money from irresponsible lenders. We need to get this discussed in Parliament before even more lives are ruined. We need to raise public awareness and have high profile supporters to ensure the many young gamblers do not go down this route. Using the unique NI will ensure vulnerable people are identified earlier before the issue spirals out of control",

The use of NI numbers will ensure vulnerable people will not be able to gamble or lend irresponsibly. Please sign and pass. All support appreciated",
