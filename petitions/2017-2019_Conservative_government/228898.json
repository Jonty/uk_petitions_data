        "additional_details": "My son used to speak but unfortunately one year ago he regressed and stopped talking. Due to his young age professionals couldn't help. Now I'm told after finally seeing speech and language that they cannot help with speech that doesn't exist.\r\nI'm too work more on his sign language for him to communicate. \r\nHe is starting to communicate with children and other people but unfortunately they don't understand sign language making it harder for him to communicate with others and socialising.",
        "background": "My son learnt sign language due to speech regression but unfortunately now he wants to communicate with other children and people and no one understands him which is heartbreaking as he cannot talk. This will only be magnified as time goes by making it difficult to make friends and school harder.",
