There is one rate (\u00a37.50 per hour, set to rise to \u00a37.83 in April 2018) for the whole country.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more here: \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a petition asking the Government to increase the National Living Wage for people who work in London."
