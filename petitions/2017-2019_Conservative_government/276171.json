        "action": "If there is an interim government the leader must trigger a brexit/EU referendum",
        "additional_details": "The original referendum campaign was based on a vote where little was known or understood about Brexit and it was positioned that a good Brexit deal could be easily obtained. The reallity has been quite different and there is much better understanding now of the personal cost of BREXIT. The British people should be able to vote on the actual deal they are signing up for or the chance to back out of BREXIT altogether if it is not what they want.",
        "background": "Parliament has failed to find an acceptable Brexit deal and an interim government demonstrates that parliamentary process has failed. The only fair and reasonable way to resolve Brexit is to go back to the people and seek clarity as to whether they want the Brexit terms on offer vs remain in the EU.",
