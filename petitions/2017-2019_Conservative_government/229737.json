        "action": "At least 50% of new plastic food/drink containers be made of recycled plastic  .",
        "additional_details": "This plastic in the sea can cause enormous damage to marine life and the problem will only get worse if we continue to produce new plastics and fail to recycle our current plastics.\r\nWhile households are encouraged by Government to recycle their own waste nonetheless there should be a concerted effort to encourage the food packaging industry to play their part to the full.\r\nIf food packaging is made from recycled materials then that in itself will encourage a market for re-cycled plastics and hopefully make the business of re-cycling plastics more profitable .",
        "background": "Recent television documentaries including \"The Blue Planet\" have highlighted the enormous amount of plastic that goes into the world`s oceans with a significant amount of that being from food and/or drink packaging.",
