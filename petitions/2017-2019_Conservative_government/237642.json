        "action": "End the ability of elderly drivers to certify themselves as 'fit to drive'",
        "additional_details": "Many elderly drivers who lose their licence often find they could have stopped driving much earlier & that their fears of a loss of independence were unfounded as cheaper & more convenient alternatives reveal themselves. There is ample evidence of accidents among elderly drivers to suggest that their own perceptions of safety are often severely compromised & that they lack the will & mental capacity to declare themselves unfit. This decision must be placed in the hands of trained professionals.",
        "background": "In the UK there is no compulsory test or assessment for drivers over the age of 75. This is the age at which many physical & mental impairments start to become apparent to professional clinicians but which are not apparent to the sufferer. The current system of self assessment is therefore not safe.",
