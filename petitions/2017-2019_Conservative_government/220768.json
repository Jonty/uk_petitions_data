        "additional_details": "I as someone whom is 6ft 6 I find flying an extremely emotional time due to the servere lack of room and comfort. I believe that if I was different in any other physicial position That would alter how I flew it would be felt with accordingly but due to society seeing being tall as a positive thing we don\u2019t deserve help when needed. I personally shouldn\u2019t have to pay extra for a chair I cannot fit in comfortably a specially when the person in front reclines their chair.",
        "background": "I believe that airlines should offer extra leg room free of charge for anyone above 6ft 2inch because it\u2019s unavoidable and they shouldn\u2019t be forced to be made to feel uncomfortable physically and mentally. Wouldn\u2019t happen if I had a obesity problem or disability.",
