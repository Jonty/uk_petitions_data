        "additional_details": "I myself have to get up very early to do my sport as I am an athlete and very tired after a training session for school. I think and others will agree that 6 stressful hours doesn\u2019t do the body good on top of all the homework we get because you brain can\u2019t cope with that much information it\u2019s just thrown away. If school hours where cut down we would have more time to live our lives and get the education need to succeed in life without all of them stressful hours.",
        "background": "I believe that school hours should be shortened because our brains need to get get into gear and to give us the time to wake our body\u2019s up because you are not going to remember 6 hours of education and this would give us more freedom in life. I think school hours should be from 10am till around 3pm.",
