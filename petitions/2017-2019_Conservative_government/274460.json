Establish a cross-party group of MPs supported by a Civil Service department and a representative People\u2019s Assembly.\r\n3. Execute a three year project to determine the UK\u2019s position on Brexit\r\n4. Declare Article 50 and begin a two year negotiation.\r\n\r\nOnce the terms are clear, the cross-party group under guidance from the People\u2019s Assembly will make the final decision on whether to proceed with Brexit or to remain in the EU.",
        "background": "In light of the inability of Government to negotiate Brexit we petition for an alternative approach to determine if and how an exit from the EU can be made to benefit the UK.  Remainers and Leavers will be assured that Brexit is seriously considered and will not harm the UK if we do leave the EU.",
