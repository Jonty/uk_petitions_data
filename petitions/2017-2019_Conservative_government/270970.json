        "additional_details": "Skateparks are full of people who make the skatepark feel unsafe and not friendly for the youth. Smokers make the environment unsafe for the younger people to be breathing in and it is very unhealthy. A supervised indoor skatepark would make us feel safer and would make the extreme sports community better. There also is broken glass and drunk people in the skatepark which is making it very dangerous. I hope this gets the attention so we can make a change to exeter",
        "background": "Skateboarders. Scooter riders and BMXERS want a indoor skate in exeter, devon. This skatepark could attract tourists and can help the skateparks feel safe again. Exeter Flowerpot Skatepark is full of drug dealers and smokers and it\u2019s an unhealthy environment for young people to be having fun",
