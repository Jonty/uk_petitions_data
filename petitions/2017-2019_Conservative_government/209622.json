        "additional_details": "There will be a further corrosion of trust and disconnect between MPs and voters if this path is taken by our elected officials. \r\nThe British people are sovereign as said by Lord Adonis on LBC, our vote to leave the EU shall be acted upon and our decision implemented fully as promised by the government,who spent 9 million pound of taxpayers money on leaflets, which were then distributed to every household in the UK. \r\nThe UK referendum was touted as a once in a generation vote not a yearly vote.",
