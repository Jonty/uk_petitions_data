        "additional_details": "The 2016 Brexit referendum result was final, as made clear by all political parties at the time. As a remainer our Prime Minister has allowed her personal view to influence her negotiating position, and used this to force a withdrawal agreement through the house which achieves withdrawal only from the political decision making process but not the rules and regulations that emanate.",
