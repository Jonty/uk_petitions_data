        "additional_details": "The deal should be voted for as is. Parliament should stop delaying and adhere to the vote of the people to leave the EU. No customs union with the EU as this would negate brexit, no referendum (we already voted) just agree this bill with no further delay and exit on 31 october or very soon after to start negotiations on the future trade deals.\r\nParliament should support this or support elections before Christmas",
        "background": "The people of the UK have voted to leave the EU. The withdrawal is just the first step to the UK negotiating its future not just with the EU but also with other countries of the commonwealth and the world. It is time for parliament to support the deal without any further delay or referendum.",
