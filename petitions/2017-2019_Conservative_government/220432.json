        "additional_details": "Barnaby's Law, is a campaign named after an illegal dog now in quarantine. We're not against re-homing from abroad but diseases we eradicated or never had are on the increase and dogs with no RBU are putting strain on our own shelters. With exceptions, for movement of dogs numbering +5, we propose they travel on a commercial license with a max of 8 dogs per vehicle. Smaller vans would reduce the carbon footprint and smaller animal number would also be more beneficial to the animals welfare.",
        "background": "An estimated 30,000 dogs from the EU enter the UK each year as commercial imports. In 2013 the number was 1,869.\r\nThe majority of dogs are \"rescue dogs\", up to 50 in a van, from Romania, Bosnia, Serbia & Bulgaria. Many with falsified passports and have not been vaccinated against rabies nor wormed.",

We're not sure whether you want to increase the number of pets that can travel with their owner; create a new system for people who want to sell puppies in the UK; or do something else to ensure that dogs travelling to the UK are healthy and cared for appropriately. \r\n\r\nLast year, the House of Commons Library produced a research pack on puppy smuggling. You can read it here: \r\n\r\nhttps://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CDP-2017-0205\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
