Attack a foreign power, of course \u2013 because she\u2019s more interested in saving her job than any risk of starting World War 3.",
        "background": "Theresa May has ordered UK armed forces to attack Syria - just before UN weapons inspectors are about to confirm or deny there was a chemical weapons attack - risking World War 3.  She is a danger to humanity and should be replaced immediately.",

However, the Petitions Committee can\u2019t schedule votes of no confidence. This was often frustrating and disappointing for petitioners. Petitions calling for action on policy are more likely to be an effective way of achieving the change you want."
