        "action": "Make parking in a Parent and Child space without children a penalty offence.",
        "additional_details": "As a mother of two I would like to make a change and a better experience when it comes to parking. Not only is this for the safety of my children but for my peers and future generations. The spaces are there for a reason but no authority is in place to make sure they are not abused and that the eligible people do not suffer as a result. I recently had to risk my safety and Childs to simply park my car. Every parent should be supported in the same way with a buggy as a wheelchair.",
        "background": "There is a huge impact on child safety when these spaces are not utilised correctly. They are there for people that require extra space and extra safety like the disabled bays and should follow the same guidelines in terms of who is eligible to use them.",
