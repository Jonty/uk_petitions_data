        "action": "Repeal the Benn Act Now!",
        "additional_details": "The main provisions of the Act were triggered as the House of Commons failed to give its consent to either a withdrawal agreement or leaving without a deal by 19 October 2019. The Act proposes a new withdrawal date of 31 January 2020, which the Prime Minister is obliged to accept if the proposal is accepted by the European Council.\r\nWe believe this Act needs repealing as it is Our Democratic Rights\r\nThe will of the people must be sovereign at all times.",
        "background": "We call upon the Government to repeal the The European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019. This Act is more commonly known as the Benn Act\r\n\r\nThis Act goes against the fundamental democratic traditions of our country and ignores the will of the people who voted in good faith to Leave the EU.",
