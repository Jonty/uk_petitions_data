        "additional_details": "My 22 yrs old daughter has just found out she has cells that are turning cancerous in her cervix.She had a cervical smear in July this year (and only 22 yrs old) and this came back abnormal, after a colposcopy this has come back as 2/3rds of the cells in her cervix is affected..it does not bear thinking about if this had been left till she was 25 yrs old.",
        "background": "There has already been needless deaths because the government will not allow girls under 25 to have a cervical smear test done. Things need to change so girls with symptoms that are alarming and show they are at risk can access a test through their GP on the NHS in all area's of the uk.",
