        "action": "Abolish road tax as we know it, and add an extra tax to fuels instead",
        "additional_details": "Moving road tax from being its own specific tax to one added onto the cost of fuel will mean that drivers will be charged an appropriate amount of tax based on the fuel economy of their car as well as the amount of driving they do. \r\n\r\nCars which are manufactured to be more economical are typically also kinder to the environment in terms of emissions.\r\n\r\nThis approach would also remove pressure / cost to the DVLA of collecting road tax payments. \r\n\r\nIt would also ensure that foreign vehicles pay tax.",
        "background": "Currently, road tax is set based on the how clean the emissions of the specific vehicle in question are; this is an admirable approach but has a significant flaw in that it does not take into account how much the vehicle is used.",
