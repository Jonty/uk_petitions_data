        "additional_details": "The public votes for Brexit, the PM negotiated the Withdrawal Agreement and on over 100 times stated that \"No Deal\" is better than a \"Bad Deal\".  MPs clearly view the deal as bad but cannot agree on what would be 'Good'.  Therefore allow the public to decide what we want.",
        "background": "I believe that Parliament and the Government are not voting in line of what the public want.  I also believe that individual MPs have their own agenda which is frustrating this process and making this a national embarrassment.  A public vote on on the 2 options would help move us forward",
