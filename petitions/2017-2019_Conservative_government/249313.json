We have hundreds of thousands of immigrants living here who have come from Eastern European states which suffered numerous horrors under the soviet regime. They will either themselves or have family members who have suffered under the barbaric Soviet Union and there should be no place for people who arrogantly wave this symbol of suffering in their faces.",

All of this was done under the banner of the hammer and sickle communism symbol.",
