        "action": "David Davis to Resume Negotiating the Canada Plus Trade Agreement",
        "additional_details": "Canada Plus brings the UK and Canada into close natural alignment. It allows the UK and Canada to work closely together allowing for a Canada-UK partnership. It is also the only trade deal, to date that maintains enough UK sovereignty, whilst ensuring a sufficient level of trade with the EU. Moreover, this natural alignment can give the framework for a Canada, Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom (CANZUK) treaty already adopted as the flagship policy by the Canadian Conservative Party.",
        "background": "Theresa May's Deal was a colossal failure unpalatable to the British Public. She has wasted 2 years overriding what could have been a successful negotiation by David Davies for a Canada Plus Trade Deal. Bring David Davies back as the lead negotiator with the EU and keep Theresa May out of his way.",
