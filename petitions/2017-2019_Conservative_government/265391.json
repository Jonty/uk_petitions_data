        "action": "Make it illegal to force waiters to pay for unpaid customers' bills.",
        "additional_details": "Sarah Hayward from Camden tweeted the Wahaca Restaurant after seeing a waiter being made to pay part of a bill resulting from customers absconding.  The tweet went viral as so many people were appalled at this practice. But this practice is not only widespread across the country, it has been so for decades. It unfairly exploits some of the most poorly paid staff in the country. Waiters are usually too scared of losing their jobs to complain and the money is often taken from the waiter on the day to avoid falling foul of the minimum wage rules.",
        "background": "The petition has arisen because of the recently publicised policy of the Wahaca Restaurant chain who made a waiter pay part of a bill left by customers. The reason this came to light was because it was witnessed by a former Councillor, but this practice is widespread in pubs and restaurants.",
