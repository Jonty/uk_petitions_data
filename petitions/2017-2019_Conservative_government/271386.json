        "action": "Replace the Monarchy with an elected Head of State chosen by the people",
        "additional_details": "There would also be a term limit of 4 years in post.  They would be paid a salary, have a small official residence.  In carrying out their duties they would represent the county in times of national celebrations, uncertainty and tragedy.  In carrying out these duties, the Head of State will be held to account for their all actions, providing a strong incentive to be unifying and inclusive.  If they overreach their powers, there should be a clear process for removing them from office.",
        "background": "An Head of State should be politically strictly neutral and could infer contentious decisions to the UK Supreme Court or to the people (via a referendum) or parliament.",
