        "additional_details": "We have been parked in a layby since 13th Nov 2017. We would like a piece of land big enough to accommodate 2 buses and a portacabin which we can convert into a office and training worktop. This will be used to teach basic DIY/life skills to help those on the bus to have the best start to their new journey. The land itself although it would be a bonus, doesnt have to have mains services as both buses are self sufficient and have their own supplies. We would like to be about 3 miles away from a town centre",
        "background": "The Bus Shelter Ipswich is a converted double decker bus which accommodates up to 6 ex rough sleepers of Suffolk. We are currently parked in a layby as we get NO assistance from central or local government. We temporarily offer 24/7 support to those who want to change their life.",
