        "additional_details": "Peanut allergies affect 1 in 55 children in the UK, why put our children at risk in a place that is suppose to be enjoyable? \r\n Every cinema I have visited in the UK so far sells Peanut M&M\u2019s as a film-time snack. Are there not enough other snacks available without the need to sell peanut based products?? \r\n Nuts are in the top 3 most common food allergies in the UK to date, and with this allergy being also airborne this causes more of a danger in close public spaces such as cinemas.",
        "background": "Going to the cinema can be a traumatic time for many people with a peanut/nut allergy. Spending most of the time looking around to make sure that someone next to you is not about to open a packet of Peanut M&M\u2019s or another product containing peanuts. Families should feel safe in a place of enjoyment",
