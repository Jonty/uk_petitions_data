        "action": "Revoke Article 50 until an agreed Brexit solution is found",
        "additional_details": "Parliament is unable to agree on what sort of Brexit Britain wants, or even a viable plan on how to resolve the deep differences between all involved. As such, it is unreasonable to expect the EU to validate an extension to the looming deadlines, so Britain can expect a No Deal Brexit on April 12th - an outcome that has been firmly rejected.\r\n\r\nRevoking Article 50 now is the only solution that keeps all options on the table - Brexit or No Brexit, Deal or No-Deal.",
        "background": "To regain control of the Brexit process, Britain must revoke Article 50 until Government can determine what it and the British people actually want to do, in a measured and thoughtful way and with all options on the table. We can then re-invoke Article 50 and start working towards that agreed goal.",
