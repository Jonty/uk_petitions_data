        "additional_details": "The current secondary ticket market is nothing more than a way for non fans to make money. \r\n\r\nThe secondary market has a place in todays market but it should never be correct that tickets are being sold at inflated prices within minutes of a show going on sale. What's even more concerning is that these secondary ticket sites are owned and run by the same companies that have just annoucned the show as sold out.\r\n\r\nThis industy drastically needs regulation to protect the true music fans.",
        "background": "As a big music fan I love nothing more than attending live shows. \r\nI along with thousands of others are more often than not left frsutrated by sold out shows. Time again shows are sold out within minutes of the onsale date at which point tickets are already for sale on the secondary market.",
