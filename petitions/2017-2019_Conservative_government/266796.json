        "additional_details": "If you\u2019re unlucky enough to get a condition such as cancer, you at least know that the NHS will look after you. You won\u2019t pay a penny for chemotherapy, radio- therapy or surgery because your taxes cover it all. But if you\u2019re unlucky in a different way, and need residential care, because you\u2019ve had a stroke, or are diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s -then tough. The state will turn its back on you. If you have assets over about \u00a323,000, and that includes the value of your home, you\u2019ll have to pay.",
        "background": "Change the law to prevent the elderly from being stripped of their assets, including their homes to pay for residential care after paying taxes all their life. The Government can afford it easily. There are other ways that can be used. Make the system fair for everybody.",
