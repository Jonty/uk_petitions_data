If it goes ahead it will mean the AONB designation provides no protection at all, nationwide, and our best landscapes will be at grave risk.",
        "background": "West Dorset District Council's Local Plan includes a proposed major development (930 houses, 4 hectare 'employment zone', etc) at Vearse Farm, Bridport.  The scale is unprecedented in an AONB, which is supposed to have the highest status of protection and be conserved for future generations.",

Local planning issues are the responsibility of your local council.\r\n\r\nYou could raise your issue with a local councillor, who represents you. You can use this page to find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\r\nOnce an application is made for the development to take place, all local residents have the right to request that a planning application be \u2018called in\u2019 by the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government. This means that it will assess the planning application against certain criteria and decide if a full inquiry is needed. For more information, including the criteria and how to request the call in of a planning application, see:\r\n \r\nhttp://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN00930/SN00930.pdf \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition asking the UK Government and Parliament to remove the exceptional circumstances clause for major developments in Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty from the National Planning Policy Framework, if that's what you'd like to happen.
