        "additional_details": "If the combined Conservative Party and Labour Party vote in the European Elections is less than 25% of the popular vote and if the voter turnout is 50% or more, then the \u2018first past the post\u2019 voting system will be thoroughly discredited. Labour and the Tories will have less than half the electorate, but more than 85% of the power! The two main parties must agree to act against their interest, but in the best interests of the United Kingdom, and introduce proportional representation.",
        "background": "The European election results should be treated as a referendum on the \u2018first past the post\u2019 voting system. Support of Labour and the Conservatives is at a record low, but the current voting system means that they will never be out of power. This is not democratic.",
