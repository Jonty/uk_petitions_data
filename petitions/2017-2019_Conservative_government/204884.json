        "additional_details": "During recent trips travelling with a 5 year old with severe autism we were informed that the decision over whether a car seat was allowed on the plane was at the discretion of the cabin crew.\r\n\r\nCar seats for children who can't follow verbal instruction are necessary for safety. I want to make it law that car seats be allowed on all flights for children with disabilities that limit understanding or with sensory impairment, for any child who wouldnt be able to access the world without one.",
        "background": "Cabin Crew currently have the right to refuse a disabled childs car seat onto a plane right up to the stage of boarding. If you believe its unfair that a disabled childs holiday is at the discretion of cabin crew then support this petition.",
