        "additional_details": "Under the FTPA, the opposition parties can now hold the Government hostage by denying a general election in order to see this law exercised: for the PM to request an extension to Article 50 by 19th October.\r\n\r\nBy amending the FTPA as specified, the PM can call an election before the meeting of the European Council on 17th October 2019. It is then for the newly-elected Government to decide whether or not to repeal the opposition's Bill or to request an extension of the UK's Withdrawal of the EU.",
        "background": "The Speaker, having broken precedent to allow the opposition parties control over the Commons' timetable, during the course of the UK's negotiation period with the EU, has facilitated a Bill into law without the permission of the Government (European Union Withdrawal No.6 Bill).",
