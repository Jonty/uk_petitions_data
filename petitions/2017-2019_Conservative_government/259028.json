        "additional_details": "Give Mr Trump the book \"Global Warming for Dummies\", his aids the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. Teach him that  climate change is not fake news.\r\n\r\nWhen he visited England in 2018 his party travelled in two V-22 Osprey helicopters, these burn 5 litres per mile. He also flew in Air Force one that burns 26 litres per mile.\r\n\r\nWe expect our political leaders to set good examples. They must show us that they care for the environment that our children will inherit.",
        "background": "Trump and his retinue flying the Atlantic twice will emit a lot of carbon. We can avoid even more by insisting that he travels within the UK by bus and train.\r\n\r\nClimate change activist Greta Thunberg has recently travelled round Europe by train to meet politicians.",
