        "additional_details": "Research published in the December 2013 issue of the \u2018Economic Journal\u2019 indicated that paying Members of Parliament too much risked damaging their work ethic. Paying MPs a salary of \u00a344,000 would put  them on a par with judges, barristers, solicitors, management consultants and those with similarly demanding careers. MPs would still be able to claim the expenses needed to meet their constituency commitments.",
        "background": "Paying backbench MPs, as we do,  \u00a377,379 and expenses alienates them from their constituents making it difficult for them to understand the lives of working people. This level of pay places them in the top 5% of earners in the UK and cannot be justified.",
