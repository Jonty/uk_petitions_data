        "additional_details": "The UK has been planning for \"Brexit\" based on an advisory referendum in which only 37% of the electorate voted Brexit. (Many were excluded). \r\n\r\nBrexit seems to mean disrupting links with neighbouring countries which have worked for up to 40 years. Jobs and supply chains depend on these links as do science & medicine research.\r\n\r\nMuch of the time in parliament & a great deal of money has been put into this \"Brexit\" yet we still wait to find out a good reason for it.\r\nWe demand a reason for \"Brexit\".",
        "background": "The country is being put through disruption in order to attempt to go ahead with something called Brexit. \r\nWe have not been told any good reason why.\r\nArguments such as Brexit means Brexit are no longer sufficient.\r\nSome people have been affected by losing jobs or having to apply for citizenship.",
