        "additional_details": "If a UK wide register of all rough sleepers was set up, identification could be made of an individual's needs and medical requirement. Once this work had be completed, then appropriate workplace training could be offered to reintroduce the person back into society. This investment from Government would yield a return, from some, of up to 35 years of tax returns many, of whom would live  their shorter lifespan in desperate need of our emergency services paid for by the tax payer.",
        "background": "The Rough sleeping crisis, is a waste of a human resource. Adults who should be in work or in education living  a chaotic lifestyle, funded by the NHS, Police, and Local Authority draining them of resources. To rehabilitate, and to support helps rough sleepers back  paying taxes repaying this debt",
