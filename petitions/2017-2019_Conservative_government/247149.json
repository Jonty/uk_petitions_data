        "additional_details": "The majority of politicians have had nothing but contempt for the peoples vote and done their utmost to stop the process, they need to be reminded that it\u2019s not their wishes they\u2019re voting on but the peoples and that democracy must be upheld.  They can and more than likely will be replaced at the next GE if they continue to ignore the democratic process.",
        "background": "It\u2019s no longer about Brexit but following the democratic process & fulfilling the wishes of the people who voted out & to leave the EU on the date & time the politicians themselves had set in law. Anything else would be destroying centuries of trust in the democratic process this country has had.",
