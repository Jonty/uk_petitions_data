        "additional_details": "Following the decision of the Supreme Court on the illegality of fees levied at Employment Tribunals, it is confirmed that employees have low-cost access to justice for disability discrimination via an Employment Tribunal but disabled students still have to pay thousands of pounds to pursue an identical claim against a university in the High Court. Disabled students are in a less equitable position than employees. That in itself is discriminatory per Equality Act 2010.",
        "background": "Request to UK Gov to widen remit of Employment Tribunals to address cost disparity of students' disability discrimination claims against universities. Students can be forced to go to the High Court, whereas employees can take their identical claim to Employment Tribunal at significantly less cost.",
