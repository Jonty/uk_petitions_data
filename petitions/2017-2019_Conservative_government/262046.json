        "additional_details": "The government has signed up to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, but it hands out financial incentives of \u00a31billion a year to oil companies specifically for the purpose of exploring for more oil. We have 20billion barrels of oil in the North Sea which we are legally bound to extract.\r\nWe cannot burn even a fraction of all we could extract without facing extinction.\r\nThe government must change its mindset on oil investment and put that money into renewables.",
        "background": "Eni Ltd UK's Environmental Impact Assessment justification report states their intention to prospect for oil on June 1st. Surveys carried out only a decade ago concluded that there are no viable oil reserves. The habitat of dolphins and porpoises will be seriously harmed at this time of the year.",
