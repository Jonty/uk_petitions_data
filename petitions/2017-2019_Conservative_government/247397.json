Right now an estimated 12.7 million tonnes of plastic \u2013 everything from plastic bottles and bags to micro beads \u2013 end up in our oceans each year. That\u2019s a truck load of rubbish a minute. This is the time for us to make a change! Our oceans are slowly turning into a plastic soup and the effects on ocean lives are chilling please help us to reduce plastic as soon as possible",

Each year, 400 million tonnes of plastic is produced and 40% of that is single used, more than 8 million tonnes of plastic enters the world's oceans each year, and most of that escapes from land.
