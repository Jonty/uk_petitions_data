        "additional_details": "We do not need to consume meat, dairy, fish or eggs in order to lead healthy lives at any part of our development, including infancy, throughout pregnancy and into old age. Give livestock farmers financial backing and practical support to switch to arable farming. Animal agriculture is destroying the planet and is cruel. Reverse de-foresation; reclaim the land and the oceans. Recover lost/discarded fishing nets. Redeploy fishermen and women to revitalise our oceans instead of plundering them.",
        "background": "These industries are dependent on cruelty and killing and at the same time are killing our planet as well as significantly contributing to individual ill health. By continuing to indulge in these ill-gotten luxuries we are threatening our own existence as well as that of all other species on earth.",

We're also not sure what you want the Government or Parliament to do to redeploy fishermen and women to revitalise our oceans. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
