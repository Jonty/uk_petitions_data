        "additional_details": "The present deadlock which has arisen due to the refusal of opposition parties to support a motion to call a general election undermines democracy.\r\n\r\nThe public should have the power to cut short fixed-term parliaments.  The FTPA should be amended to introduce such a power and introduce procedures to allow a suitable proportion of the electorate to trigger a general election.",
        "background": "Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, an early general election can only take place if a motion is supported by two-thirds of the House of Commons.  The electorate has no power to compel a general election.",
