If the parent with custody neglected to feed or clothe a child it wouldnt go unnoticed.

Its simply unfair. Take away their p.rights",

Estranged fathers and mothers should be forced by law regardless of employment status to pay a minimum financial contribution towards their offsprings upbringing and prison should be a consequence of non compliance",
