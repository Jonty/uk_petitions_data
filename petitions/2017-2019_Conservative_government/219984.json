        "additional_details": "Stop the persecution  of veterans to appease Sinn Fein , The Government has offered immunity from prosecution to hundreds of IRA terrorists . They openly support the Good Friday agreement that offers no protection to members of the security forces  ,  over 150 OTR letters, otherwise referred to as letters of comfort have been issued to many terrorists . This  prevents  prosecution for past crimes of mass murder and genocide  . We have seen elderly veterans dragged before the courts , stop the witch hunt !",
        "background": "Northern Irelands secretary of state Karen Bradley is excluding a statute of limitations that will protect veterans from prosecution , however the IRA have had an exclusive arrangement since 1998",
