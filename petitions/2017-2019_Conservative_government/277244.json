        "additional_details": "We envisage that supporters will be a mixture of:\r\nLeave voters who have changed their minds,\r\nLeave voters for whom current 'deal' prospects are unacceptable,\r\nRemain voters who love the EU,\r\nRemain voters critical of the EU but wanting to remain and press for changes,\r\nPeople who abstained in 2016,\r\nUK citizens living abroad,\r\nResidents not qualified to vote in 2016: too young or wrong citizenship or missing from the electoral register.",
        "background": "This would not prevent a fresh and considered national debate or referendum being started later.\r\n\r\nIf this petition gets massive support but the Government & Parliament fail to give it effect, we call on the EU to act on it in the absence of a clear UK constitution.",
