        "action": "We, the Electorate, demand an immediate General Election.",
        "additional_details": "MPs' refusal to accept the outcome or the 2016 referendum, their continuing games and stratagems in the House of Commons are destroying the electorate's belief in democracy. Only a General Election will restore it.\r\nEarlier in this Parliamentary session and throughout their party conferences, the opposition parties demanded an immediate General Election. But, now the Prime Minister has asked several times for one, the opposition parties are refusing to step up to what they were demanding earlier.",
        "background": "The Prime Minister is attempting to negotiate a deal to settle our relationship with the EU. As he does not have a majority, he is thwarted, making it impossible to carry out the result of the 2016 Referendum and hampering his ability to negotiate a deal acceptable to the UK.",
