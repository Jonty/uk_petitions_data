        "action": "A new Prime Minister to be chosen by secret ballot of MPs",
        "additional_details": "The process that led to this appointment has seriously undermined public respect for Parliament and for our whole system of government. However, a no-confidence vote without a more suitable candidate already lined up risks a damaging period of uncertainty.\r\n\r\nWe therefore ask that, in advance of a no-confidence vote, a potential new Prime Minister be selected by MPs through a secret ballot, using a voting system that maximises their ability to demonstrate which candidates would have their support.",
        "background": "The Queen appointed our current Prime Minister on the strength of advice, from the former PM, that he commanded the confidence of Parliament \u2013 despite the fact that most MPs never voted for his appointment and many, even in his own party, openly regard him as utterly unfit for the office.",
