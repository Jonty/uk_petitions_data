        "action": "Support the proroguing of Parliament to deliver what 17.4m voted for in 2016.",
        "additional_details": "Leaving the EU will allow us to\r\n1. Take control of our Laws (No ECJ) or (ECHR)\r\n2. Negotiate new trade deals without EU red tape\r\n3. Control the flow of immigration to suit the countries needs\r\n4. Control of our industries without the EU red tape hindering our efforts, we've all been effected by industries that have suffered with the government unable to help due to EU anti competitive laws yet the French government can have shares in companies like Renault, 1 rule for them and another for the UK",
        "background": "Brexit has always been about taking back control, given the majority of MP's are ''Remainers'' and do not want to leave the EU they are trying all tactics possible to delay this process, it is their intransigent behavior that is truly the real undemocratic action not prorogation.",
