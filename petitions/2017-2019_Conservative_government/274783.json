        "additional_details": "I worked for 3 years in a secondary school as a cover teacher and also a student mentor. I dealt with our children self harming, feeling insecure, and sadly a few taking their own lives. I have a 23 year old son who suffered insecurities with his skin  a few years ago and an 17 year old daughter who is just beautiful, but she doesn't see it as a lot of her friends.",
        "background": "I am always fighting to help both male & females see their own worth and to understand that we are all not the same. We are all perfect in our own ways and that's what makes us individually beautiful. I have suffered with body confidence myself and have learnt to work with who I am.",
