        "additional_details": "Recently, the Government attempted to table the WAB (Withdrawal Agreement) through the House of Common, but instead due to Letwin Agreement the \"meaningful vote\" couldn't take place, instead our Government, in particular Prime Minister Boris Johnson, was \"forced\" to write an extension letter as set out by the Benn Act, in further humiliating attempt to delay Brexit. I ask both houses to end this uncertainty and deliver on the Brexit referendum which was voted by The People on October 31, 2019.",
        "background": "The people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union by October 31, however despite repeated attempts, this has failed to pass Commons majority. In summary, the People are fed-up, businesses are suffering and families being torn apart due to uncertainty, this has to stop now.",
