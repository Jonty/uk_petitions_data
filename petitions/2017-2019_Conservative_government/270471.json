        "additional_details": "China Post pays RM a fraction of the actual cost of delivering small packets within the UK. This is because China is classed as a \u201cdeveloping country.\u201d  This is a huge subsidy to the Chinese.  It is cheaper to send airmail from China than for us to send something within the UK.\r\nTwo million items a week are thought to arrive each week from China. They are transported by air freight to the UK. Think of the carbon air-miles involved!\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s no wonder why high street retailers are suffering and why UK manufacturing continues to decline.  Let\u2019s stop subsiding Chinese imports NOW!",
        "background": "Chinese  exporters get subsidised postal costs from Royal Mail. RM charges China less than the real cost of delivery  within the UK . This is  due to outdated rules imposed by the United Nations.",
