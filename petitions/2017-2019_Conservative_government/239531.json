        "additional_details": "The UK Government must provide funding to ensure that baby milk is available free to all babies who need it. We are constantly told Breast is Best, but that isn\u2019t the case for all babies for various medical reasons. Some mums simply don\u2019t want to breast feed and that is their choice. Many other products can be obtained on the NHS for free such as nicotine patches and methadone. Babies don\u2019t ask to have an intolerance.",
        "background": "In some areas of the country, parents are being told that they will have to pay for their baby's prescribed milk for conditions such as CMPA. Parents may have to find around \u00a3500, depending on the brand, for the milk powder their child is prescribed, when other normal milks are far cheaper.",
