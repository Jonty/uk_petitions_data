        "additional_details": "When my daughters cat Elmo was young, he went missing for a few days and came back injured. During the time Elmo was missing, he was registered as missing via his microchip and his details also got sent out everywhere. When we look him to an emergency vets he was not scanned. \r\nSadly, about 6 months later, Elmo vanished again - with no trace this time. We suspect - and I have more than just suspicion - that he was found by the council and disposed of without being chip scanned.",
        "background": "All cats should be scanned for a microchip when first registering at a new vets, they should also be scanned for a microchip when found deceased. \r\nIt should be law and not just an unenforced procedure.\r\nIf this was in place then Elmo would be home, we would have been able to lay him to rest.",
