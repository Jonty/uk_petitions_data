        "additional_details": "An issue I know frustrates thousands of us, bots and moneygrabbers sitting at home with tickets you could have had. If you did succumb to one of them not only have you paid more than over the odds but are also at home because in some places if your name is not on the ticket you are not allowed in!\r\nBuying tickets to sell them seconds later to make profit doesn't seem fair!\r\nWe work hard and we are getting screwed! SHUT THEM DOWN!!!",
        "background": "When tickets sell out accross all venues in 30 seconds, everywhere is sold out, yet resale sites already have \"un-needed\" tickets available at, at least double but usually quadruple the price, plus a huge fee from the resale site. Non fans and these sites are profiting whilst real fans miss out.",
