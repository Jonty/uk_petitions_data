        "action": "Reduce MP's monthly paid salary by 50% until Brexit is resolved",
        "additional_details": "Failure to deliver consensus in this debate is largely due to a ruling class serving its own interests.  A general election will not resolve this issue.  Forcing MP's to defend their salaries in the face of this debacle will prove unequivocally that the vast majority of MPs are divorced from society and unable to negotiate a good exit deal on behalf of the UK without being swayed by corporations,  entrenched views, a biased media and warped statistics.",
        "background": "As public servants, MP's failure to deliver a practical and practicable resolution to the Brexit situation after two years is tantamount to gross negligence.  Irrespective of the result of the EU referendum, all members of British society deserve better from their elected members.",
