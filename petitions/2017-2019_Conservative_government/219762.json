        "additional_details": "Independent local shops need to be looked after otherwise they will all disappear. Being close to one or more chain supermarkets takes away a large chunk of business especially when they do special offers and even give products away buying customer loyalty.\r\n\r\nAn independent local newsagent sits in a small town with a Waitrose, a Lidl and a One-Stop (owned by Tesco) all selling newspapers, magazines and greetings cards. For the independent, competing is tough and margins are tight. Profits for the three chain supermarkets are huge and are driving out independents as a result.\r\n",
        "background": "A new law should be created to ban large chain supermarkets from selling competing products within 500 yards of an independent shop.\r\n\r\n",
