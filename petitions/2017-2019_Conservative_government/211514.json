        "additional_details": "Operators 'legally' win with prepayment; the motorist pays for parking plus unused time, and frequently a high PCN, (this is entrapment) The Operator takes unfair excess revenue when ANPR could support pay-on exit. Fair examples are a Birmingham  Hospital paperless and barrier-less, and Solihull town centre where entry ticket has car registration printed and ANPR exit barriers. Both accept cash/card payment before exit",
        "background": "For compulsory prepayment I chose 4 hrs for a theatre visit and incurred \u00a385 PCN by leaving 23 mins late, (this is entrapment). The operator's website allows pre-registration of a debit card to auto pay every visit by time used, not easy for casual users, but pay-on-exit  would be feasible.",
