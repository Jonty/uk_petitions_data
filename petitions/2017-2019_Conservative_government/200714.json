You spend long periods of uncertainty being passed from departments and you are just waiting for someone to give you the help & support you desperately need. This is a petition for the NHS to give more support and structure within the NHS for Young Adults, (one way to do this would be to introduce specific young adult clinics and wards)",
        "background": "It is extremely worrying & stressful for anyone going into hospital, it's even worse for any young adult (aged 16-20) as whenever you go to clinic, operation or getting a referral done it's extremely difficult, as no one knows where to put you as technically you are too old for the children's ward..",
