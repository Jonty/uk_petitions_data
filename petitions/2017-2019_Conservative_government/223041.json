Common quotes that cause utter dismay within the household are as such:\r\n1. He went down like Custard there\r\n2. Do France need to play Kante AND Tolisso?\r\n3. At this level you have got to score goals to win matches\r\n4. He can be as good as he wants to be; that's how good he can be etc....\r\nNo evidence is needed, football fans just need to watch the games he commentates and they understand",
        "background": "Too many times men, women and children across GB have tuned into to watch some exciting football to find they have to listen to absolute waffle. This dull auditory experience does not match the exhilarating visual experience from the professional footballers, creating a very boring atmosphere.",
