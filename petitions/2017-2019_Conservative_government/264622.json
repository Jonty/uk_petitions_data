        "additional_details": "Removing their free licence will only penalise the poorest of old age pensioners, who have little or no money to spare.  Manyrely on their television for both company and companionship due to age related factors, plus with many this being their main or only source of entertainment and knowledge of what is happening in and around their area and further away",
        "background": "This is going to force many into poverty in what is supposed to be an human right advocate country. Shameful that in 2015, the Government announced the BBC would take over the cost of providing free licenses for over-75s by 2020, but the broadcaster have now said it can\u2019t afford to take on the bill.",
