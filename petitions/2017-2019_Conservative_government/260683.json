        "action": "Give parliamentary constituencies the power to recall MP's without condition.",
        "additional_details": "Many MP's have consistently shown contempt for the electorate by abusing expenses, failing to honour manifesto commitments and failing to safeguard British democracy.\r\n\r\nMany MP's have shown they are unworthy of the trust placed in them to serve up to five years in office without accountability.\r\n\r\nImproving accountablility through the threat of recall will improve standards.",
        "background": "The Recall Act 2015 requires an MP to be convicted of a criminal offense and also violate parliamentary standards, to qualify for recall. \r\n\r\nA constituency should be able to recall it's MP if enough signatures are collected requesting such action without other condition or consent of parliament.",
