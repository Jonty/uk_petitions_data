        "additional_details": "Safety is paramount & ensuring that taxi drivers have the necessary training will ensure that we are adequately safeguarding passengers of all ages & abilities. It is down to individual local authorities to set the criteria for licensing, so there is no minimum set of standards. It is not right that a driver can be refused a licence in one area yet is able to obtain a licence in another area where standards are lower. Drivers should have to start or finish in the area in which they are licensed.",
        "background": "We call upon the government to change the legislation for private hire vehicles that allows operators to subcontract jobs to any local authority in England & Wales, meaning drivers do not need to live/operate in the area they are licensed by or adhere to local council rules and regulations.",
