        "additional_details": "The current programme on the BBC about the effect plastic is having on our oceans and environment gives hope and encouragement for the general public to make their own personal choices to stop using plastic. However it\u2019s not enough and too many people still have access to plastic bags, a 5p charge is not enough (despite proceeds going to charity), and does not justify the tearing down of our environment and pollution of our seas. There is no reason for us to cling on to plastic bags.",
        "background": "Currently in the UK we have a 5p charge for a plastic bag. Only the big shopping chains are  forced to have this in place, small businesses are still freely handing out plastic bags and people are still finding it far too easy to have the mindset of it \u2018just being 5p\u2019. We don\u2019t need plastic bags.",
