        "additional_details": "In May 2019, I walked into a supermarket in central Croydon. An area in which knife crime has risen. This store sold knives in a \u201cbargain bucket\u201d for \u00a32.99, which no security tags or measures in place. Any person could walk out with one. A lot of stores have started to create their own policy of knives sales, including security tags, or only selling the weapons online. I think it is important as a society, to sell knives behind a case (like tobacco) where they are out of sight, and out of reach.",
        "background": "Knife crime in London, and the rest of the UK has sky rocketed. On average, 400 people are injured by knife crime in London in a month. Over 30,000 recorded offences involving a knife or sharp object happen in a year. Tobacco is out of view in stores due to health concerns. Weapons should be too.",
