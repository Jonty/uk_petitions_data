        "additional_details": "A genetic descendant of the Princes has now been found, thanks to the efforts of Dr John Ashdown-Hill, meaning DNA matching can be achieved. \r\nModern archaeological methods are much more advanced since the remains' last examination nearly 90 years ago. \r\nAcademics have also shown interest, with Turi King of Leicester University stating she could extract DNA from the remains.\r\nFor the sake of historic discovery, and the legacy of Richard III, it is only right that this research be conducted.",
        "background": "By excavating the alleged remains of Edward V and Richard of Shrewsbury from Westminster Abbey, and subjecting them to scientific examination, we will be able to confirm whether they are the Princes' remains, and if this suggests that Richard III did, or did not, have them murdered.",
