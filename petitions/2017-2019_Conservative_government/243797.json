        "additional_details": "I am sick to death of receiving letters/emails every year to tell me everything is going up to \u201cfall in line with inflation\u201d 02, rent, bank account fee, utility bills...even luxurys like sky and golf/football memberships increase...yet wages for the working class never seem to change....and to top it off we are slowly stripped of the tax credits that help us. If MPs cant live off their inflated salaries and scamming the expense system that they need a pay rise, then i think we all deserve an explenation for this.",
        "background": "MP\u2019s are set to recieve yet another pay rise, money which could do a lot for familys,\r\nMoney that could go towards sheltering the homeless....no....its going on top of the already high salary's these clowns are stealing!We are paying too many MP\u2019s, and we are paying them to fail to look after us.",
