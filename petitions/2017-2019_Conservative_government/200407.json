        "action": "Increase efficiency of motorways by permitting overtaking on the left.",
        "additional_details": "Penalties to motorists ignoring rule 264 (keeping in the left lane unless overtaking) were introduced, but the decrease in motorway police patrols means this rarely enforced. Many motorists still habitually drive in Lane 2 while Lane 1 is empty;this forces all faster moving traffic into Lane 3 so becomes full 'nose to tail' and motorways operate below optimum capacity. By allowing overtaking on the left (as the USA) ALL lanes of motorways would be fully utilised to increase capacity at no cost.",
        "background": "The UK motorway network is one of the most congested in Europe. The UK government are spending \u00a3 millions implementing \"smart motorways\" to help increase efficiency. The problem is NOT just volume of traffic, but because motorists don't abide by Highway code rule 264 leading to 'empty lanes'.",
