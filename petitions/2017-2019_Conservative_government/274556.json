        "action": "End Govt badger culls after expert said it failed and caused immense suffering.",
        "additional_details": "Prof Munro's independent expert group found that about 23% of almost 40,000 of badgers shot in the cull took more than five minutes to die.These figures prompted the group to conclude that the culls were inhumane. The group has been disbanded by DEFRA, but Prof Munro wrote to Natural England to protest the continuation of the culls. See  the Guardian feature by Pallab Ghosh of 9 September 2019.",
        "background": "Up to 9,000 of badgers are likely to have suffered \"immense pain\" in culls, according to Prof Ranald Munro, the ex-Chair of an independent expert group appointed by the government to assess its trials. The culls are not reducing TB in cattle and in one area the incidence of the disease has gone up.",
