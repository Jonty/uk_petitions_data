        "action": "Ban Lootboxes and limit shady micro-transactions within video games",
        "additional_details": "Various companies such as EA, Ubisoft and Activision have cleverly implemented micro-transactions to bypass certain features or give unfair advantages within games e.g. \"time-savers\". Lootboxes have resulted in many gamers wasting vast amounts of money on them in a manner which is essentially gambling with most of the time no prize. The recent genre of Battle Royale video games has brought with it more shady micro-transaction business models which manipulate younger audiences to purchase tiers",
        "background": "Loot boxes are shameful in games for which you have already payed for. The argument that lootboxes are optional or cosmetic only is tired and increasingly untrue as various game publishers begin to lock more and more content behind a paywall, forcing gamers to buy in-game items to remain on par.",
