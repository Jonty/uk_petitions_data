        "additional_details": "Specially interest pleading and influence is rotting our country from the inside. Wealth begets power and power, wealth, a vicious circle that is set to continue unless checked. The interests of the international super rich are not remotely aligned to the interests of the British population, and yet our politicians are too corrupt to resist the deals on offer from them. State funding is common in many other countries but it is rarely watertight. UK should lead the way in doing it properly.",
        "background": "Reducing the burgeoning corruption in our politics entails introducing exclusive state funding of our political process. This means a comprehensive prohibition of any funding or support (inc. deferred revolving door deals) from any other source. The cost would be tiny and the benefits incalculable.",
