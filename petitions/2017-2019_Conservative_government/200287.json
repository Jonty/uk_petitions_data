In fact the opposite. Here is a link to UK CHILD that had to flee the country because rules on a plant in the soil.\r\nhttps://goo.gl/h48peQ\r\n\r\nBusiness insider UK even made a list for the top 23 health\r\nbenefits for cannabis.\r\nhttps://goo.gl/HesB19\r\n\r\nHow can anyone say it damages human health?",

Patients are having to flee the UK to other countries that have moved with the times and have legalised/decriminalised. \r\nWhy are we so far behind the rest of the world?",
