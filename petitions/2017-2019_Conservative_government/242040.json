        "action": "Legalize or decriminalise cannabis to free up space in jails and police time",
        "additional_details": "The war on drugs is failing and we need a new approach. I have been in and out of many mental hospitals due to severe depression and anxiety, I have been given all sorts of medicine which has not helped at all. I smoke cannabis and it helps me a lot, much better than what I was prescribed.\r\nI think we should start a trial to see how this could work. Listen to the people of the UK and hold a vote on whether it should be legalised. If its such a danger to health then why is alcohol and tobacco still available to buy, which has contributed to deaths way more than cannabis related deaths (if there are any)",
        "background": "I and other members of society believe cannabis should be legalised or decriminalised.\r\nI believe this would help the economy if it was controlled and taxed. The USA, Netherlands and Canada have taken this approach and has worked well for them. I believe this will free up jail space and police time.",
