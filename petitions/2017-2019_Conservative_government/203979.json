The devastation cause on Japan has been outrageous and I believe that our use of nuclear weapons could cause devastation on ourselves if used incorrectly. Therefore, we should not use nuclear weapons as, not only will innocent civilians of other countries be devastated, but that could have backlash on our own country as the allies of whom we bombed could turn on us.",
