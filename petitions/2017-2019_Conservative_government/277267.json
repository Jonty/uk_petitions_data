        "additional_details": "Changing the age to 16 would give access to those who do graduate early to come to the UK for their working gap year. This allows them to explore our culture and see our amazing country without having to go into debt like others do on their gap year because they are able to work. This also allows them to earn and save money during their gap year to use for their future back in their home country eg.) for university the following year.",
        "background": "The Youth Mobility Scheme Visa is a visa that allows young adults from foreign countries to come live and work in the UK for up to 2 years. However for people who graduate high school early (at ages 16/17) this is an unable option for their gap year as the age restriction is 18.",
