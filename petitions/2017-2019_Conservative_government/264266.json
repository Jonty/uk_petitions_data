        "additional_details": "It should be an easy transition from adolescence to adulthood. The ages for children and young people\u2019s services such as CAMHS or inpatient facilities require young people to be of the ages of 13-18, I believe that a children\u2019s hospital should allow young people to receive the medical care and attention they need while still attending a children\u2019s hospital or A&E. It would not only be more convenient for NHS staff but it would also young people develop their confidence.",
        "background": "Young children and adolescents need more support when receiving treatment in hospital or using the facilities. It can be a scary transition from a children\u2019s hospital/ward to an adults. I believe that the age a young person should transition to adult medical care should be the age of 18.",
