        "additional_details": "Due to the unsatisfactory procedures in place, more needs to be done and the road needs to be rectified. There is video evidence shared on social media on almost a daily basis regarding illegal u-turns on this particular road, in addition to local newspapers raising concern almost weekly. The amount of accidents and injuries that have occurred, not including near misses, must be addressed. It is unacceptable to put innocent road users at risk due to the impatience of some road users.",
        "background": "Over the last few years, illegal U-turns on the A30 between Hayle and St Erth have become a common occurrence. This has resulted in many severe injuries to other road users. Procedures have been put in place, for example signs and road markings, however this has been unsuccessful.",
