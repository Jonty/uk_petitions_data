        "action": "Revoke the law of pupils having to wear school uniforms",
        "additional_details": "Schools are way too hung up on rules like \u201cno gum\u201d or \u201cno nail polish\u201d to care about actual students feeling uncomfortable with other people in the school. If someone is getting bullied, most teachers do nothing. But if someone has something wrong with their hair it\u2019s an immediate isolation. Maybe if pupils were able to have their own clothes (appropriate for weather circumstances and not too distracting) teachers could focus on more important things to help students feel safer and happier.",
        "background": "Wearing school uniforms can make pupils feel uncomfortable, uptight and like they\u2019re part of the vast majority. Many schools talk to children about \u201cbeing themselves\u201d and things like that but how can one \u201cbe themself\u201d if they have to wear expensive, low quality, boxy uniforms all day?",
