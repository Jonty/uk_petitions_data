        "additional_details": "BREXIT was a non-party issue that has shown the divisions within the two main political parties (Conservative and Labour).  The Conservatives have 3 postions - the EU-Cabinet deal,  Remain and a  WTO exit.  Labour have every option stilon the table but cannot tell us which one they want other than to unseat the current minority govt. \r\n In 3 years of debate, sitting MPs have failed time and time again to bring BREXIT to a logical and equitable solution, and define long-term trade relationships.",
        "background": "MPs have failed to deliver what was mandated by the BREXIT referendum. They failed to recognise that the EU 27 have a voice in the process. Petty political manoeuvres inter- and intra main parties have thwarted achieving a transitional deal. Current MP's have lost all confidence of the electortate.",
