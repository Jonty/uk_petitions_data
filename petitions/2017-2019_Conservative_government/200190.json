        "additional_details": "I have started this petition as we are now into the new school year and are yet to hear the outcomes from the consultation on primary assessment.  I am very concerned that we could see a third year of children being assessed unfairly.  At present, it is almost impossible for a Year 6 child with spelling difficulties to be assessed as being 'at the expected standard' in writing. Let's start celebrating and acknowledging what children can do, rather than punishing them for what they can't!",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, call upon the DfE/STA to remove spelling from the secure fit criteria used for teacher assessment of writing. Also, to report the outcomes of the KS2 spelling test, separate from the grammar & punctuation test.",
