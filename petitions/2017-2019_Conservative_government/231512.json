If you mean the expenditure of the non-resident parent, some costs, such as contact costs, can already be deducted in some cases. You can find out more here: http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7773/CBP-7773.pdf \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking for CMS variations to be calculated based on the resident parent's income, if it is equal or more than the non-resident parent's income, if that's what you'd like to happen.
