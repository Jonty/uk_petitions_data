It is unscientific and unacceptable to state that these balance each other out, and continue regardless as this government wants to do.\r\n\r\nThere is compelling evidence also that interference and misinformation from outside agencies influenced the vote. That evidence indicates that it is likely that the vote was influenced by more than the 4% difference that decided the vote. \r\n\r\nTHE FIRST EU REFERENDUM WAS UNDEMOCRATIC.",
