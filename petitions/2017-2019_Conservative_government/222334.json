        "additional_details": "On 15 June 2018 Sir Christopher Chope blocked a bill aiming to make the practice of \"upskirting\" a crime. This MP has a history of blocking bills, regardless of their content,  because they \"have not been debated\". He could, of course, research prior to the first reading, but chooses not to. Not only does this delay implementation of many sensible laws, but it can also cause hurt, and leaves parliament open to ridicule. This is an obscure privilege which has little place in the 21st century.",
        "background": "A single MP can block a bill's progress through parliament by shouting \"object\". This privilege is being abused by MPs who use it to block bills, regardless of content, on point of principle. This is an undemocratic waste of time,  money and energy, and should be curtailed as soon as possible.",
