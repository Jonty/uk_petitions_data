        "additional_details": "Theresa May claims she knows what people voted for in the EU Referendum, but she doesn't. With both the main parties fundamentally split, there is currently no effective government and no real opposition either, and that is the real travesty of democracy, not the idea of a People's Vote. We must check that the will of the people is still what it was over 2 years ago, to break the deadlock. Another referendum cannot be more divisive: in many respects we are now better informed about the options.",
        "background": "Time is running out on the Brexit clock. Parliament has had no real say in shaping Brexit, and will only be given a vote on it sometime in January. The only way out of the current impasse is a referendum on the Brexit deal, and ideally, the result could inform the MPs' 'meaningful vote'.",
