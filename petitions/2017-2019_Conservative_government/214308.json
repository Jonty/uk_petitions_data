        "additional_details": "On March 3rd 2018, several news outlets have reported that West Midlands Ambulance Service is receiving fines of up to \u00a3900 a day for the use of a bus lane close to the largest hospital in Birmingham. The council didn't even discuss the introduction of cameras with the Emergency Services.\r\n\r\nThis level of punishment on the Emergency Services sees an annual fining of over \u00a3328,000 - money the NHS cannot afford. A Taxi is given free reign of these lanes making them more applicable for emergencies.",
        "background": "Emergency Services are being fined for the use of Bus Lanes and other restricted lanes, which is applying needless pressure and financial strain on the services, whilst lining the pockets of local authorities.\r\n\r\nThis is placing lives at risk on a daily basis, and must come to an immediate end.",
