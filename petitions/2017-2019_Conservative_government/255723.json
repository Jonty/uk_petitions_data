It really is the only deal that pleases 100% of the population. Then we can get on with fighting child poverty and saving the NHS and everything else that's been put on hold for three years.",
        "background": "The government has been unable to make progress on Brexit for nearly three years. 48% of the country want us to remain, 52% want us to leave, but half of the leavers want us to leave with no deal and the other half refuse to leave with no deal. If we absorb the EU we get the best of both worlds.",
