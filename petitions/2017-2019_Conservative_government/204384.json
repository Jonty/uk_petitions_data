This would reduce deaths and the cost of health care levied on the NHS.  Cyclist should have insurance cover to ride on the road so if they inadvertently cause damage to another vehicle or person, then that person or vehicle damaged will have a simple method of recovering damages without having to go through a costly legal process.",
        "background": "All cyclists should have to wear an approved standard helmet to reduce head injury if they come off their bikes.  They should also have to have insurance cover in case they damage, injure a third party or other vehicle. As at present there is no easy method to get a cyclist to pay for damage caused.",
