The only solution is to stop, go back to solutions we already have such as walking, bus, train and cycle.  The public will not consider these as options until cars are rightly put in a category such as smoking so it is obvious there are better choices.  The public can walk away from a smoker, but they can't walk away from the air!",

The pollution is also killing our planet, which is at the brink of a catastrophe. Yet advertisements for smoking are banned, but adverts for cars are not.",
