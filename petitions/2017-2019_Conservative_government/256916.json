        "additional_details": "According to Crisis people sleeping on the streets are almost 17 times more likely to have been victims of violence and 15 times more likely to have verbal abuse in the past year compared to the general public. In January we started this year with news, a homeless man in  Coventry was \u201cdeliberately\u201d set on fire as he was sleeping in a park, leaving him with \u201csevere burns\u201d. We are not blind to what is happening on the streets. There are many examples in our media. Now we must do something.\r\n.",
        "background": "Today homelessness in the UK is a national 'state of emergency.' I am devastated when I read or see footage of violent attacks on our homeless and rough sleeping community. We have to believe humanity is not lost on this group and help them have some small sense that the wider community do care.",
