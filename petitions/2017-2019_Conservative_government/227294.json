It is already possible for private rail firms to do this, if they wish to and if they receive the relevant planning permissions. We're therefore not sure what further action you want the Government or Parliament to take. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the Government to provide funding as an incentive for private rail companies to reopen lines, if that's what you'd like to happen. \r\n"
