        "additional_details": "Teachers are paid so inadequately but many, like myself, will tell you we do it for the 30+ children each year. Whilst that is 100% true, it would be wonderful to not be penalised when wanting to live life and make memories with our own children. \r\nI am proposing that teachers who have obtained QTS and are in employment be able to access cheaper holiday booking rates. \r\nLet\u2019s give a little something back to the amazing people who educate our generations - heaven knows we don\u2019t get much else.",
        "background": "As I come to the end of my NQT year in teaching, thoroughly shattered and heavily in debt from my university degree it would be wonderful to have a holiday to look forward to. However, the reality is that I cannot afford to take my family away out of term time due to the prices.",
