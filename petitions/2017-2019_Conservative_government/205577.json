        "additional_details": "Under Article 13 of the Lisbon Treaty, animals are recognised as being sentient beings that are capable of having feelings, including pain and contentment. The current law means that policies regarding animals must consider animal welfare when being created.\r\nBut now, once Britain leaves the EU, animals will no longer benefit from the protection this law granted them. It has been said that the Animal Welfare Act 2006 covers this but it does not, failing to mention sentience at all.",
        "background": "The Govt. rejected the integration of an EU law post-Brexit that recognises animals as being sentient beings. The vote on implementing the bill into British law was lost by 313 against, to 295 in favour. This decision is completely against the opinion of British citizens; a nation of animal lovers",
