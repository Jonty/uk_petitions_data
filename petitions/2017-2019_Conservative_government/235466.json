We did not vote for MP's in Parliament to do what they think is best for us, or the most financially prudent course, but to leave the EU by the terms details above. Terms that were repeatedly outlined and made clear by David Cameron as well as many MP's during the pre referendum debates. Represent your constituents & you will achieve consensus.",
