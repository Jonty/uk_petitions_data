So the airline still gets that money.\r\nIt's like selling 55000 concert tickets for a venue that only seats 50000! Booking an un Uber for 10, but you can only take 4! Selling a house to 2 people, but only 1 can live in it! None of this would be allowed...\r\nEssentially, airlines are conning passengers.",
        "background": "After our recent honeymoon to Africa, our flight was overbooked. Luckily, after a very stressful while, we were able to board last minute.\r\nThis needs to stop - it causes unecessary stress, it's is immoral and simply unfair.",
