You can find the details of the debate on this petition here:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/241584\r\n\r\nThe Petitions Committee can't schedule debates in the main House of Commons Chamber or arrange a vote on whether to agree or disagree with a petition. \r\n\r\nOther Members of Parliament could approach the Backbench Business Committee and ask it to schedule a debate on revoking Article 50 in the main chamber. That would be a decision for them and not the UK Government or Parliament as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons has recently voted on motions to revoke article 50 in certain circumstances. You can find the Hansard of one of those debates here:\r\n\r\nhttps://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2019-03-27/debates/45525049-637A-47BF-90CA-AF6A2D9F16ED/EUWithdrawalAndFutureRelationship(Motions)\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling for the Petitions Committee to have the power to schedule debates and votes on petitions in the main chamber if that is something you would like to see happen.
