        "additional_details": "As a union of nations it is our duty to support each other in these divisive times. The Irish 'Backstop' arrangement will not be resolved before 29th March. We need more time. The UK can not leave the European Union with 'no deal'. Business communities including the retail sector, universities and colleges, and the NHS express alarm at the prospect of leaving the EU with 'no deal' . \r\n\r\nWe must have more time - but only if we agree to extend Article 50.",
        "background": "On 1st January 1973 the UK signed up to an organisation that would change all aspects of our daily lives, the (EEC) European Union. Within the EU we determined our individual goals. Our ambitions, our futures, and those of our children. Our rights, security and destiny. We risk losing all of that.",
