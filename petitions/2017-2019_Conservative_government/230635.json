        "action": "Ban ALL retail shops from offering plastic bags in coastal towns",
        "additional_details": "Retail consumer led pollution of the oceans is mostly caused by plastic bags and packaging material left at the coasts and beaches. If the retailers - big and small - in coastal towns offer only bio-degradable / paper bags to customers and plastic bags are banned, this will surely prove to bring about a huge positive impact on plastic pollution on coasts and sea, and also inform people and catalyse them to think more about the environment consciously on a daily basis.",
        "background": "Substantial ocean pollution is committed by plastic bags by visitors to beaches and coastline. ONLY paper bags should be offered to customers by retailers / super markets / shops in all the coastal towns. It will make a huge positive impact, and also be an exemplary step for further initiatives",
