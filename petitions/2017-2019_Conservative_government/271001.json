        "additional_details": "It is continually emphasised the democratic outcome of the referendum. However, to deny a huge proportion of the country the right, or least the option to retain some form of association with the EU is by far, more undemocratic. Especially, when concerning the younger generations who have had their futures dictated for them. Guy Verhofstadt has clearly indicated the desire for such a scheme and the government must enact on this. Doing so will not only adhere to the UK to its democratic values but enable wider and deeper business opportunities.",
        "background": "While the 2016 Referendum did result in a majority to leave, there remain 16.1 million people who desire to retain access for personal or business reasons to the EU. Not to mention generations too young to vote and have had their future opportunities chosen for them. This in itself is undemocratic.",
