        "action": "The minimum wage for under 18 year old should be raised",
        "additional_details": "At the age of 16 one can legally live alone, therefore we should be entitled to a higher minimum wage to give us the opportunity to support ourselves financially. Moreover, 16 year old would benefit from a higher wage to financially support their education. This includes college and sixth form resources. Some may argue that bursaries and benefits are available, however surely it is better to allow one to support themselves and help the government save money.",
        "background": "The national living wage and the minimum wage for those over 25 years old is \u00a38.21 per hour. For those under 18 the minimum wage is a mere \u00a34.35 per hour as of April 2019 according to the government website. This is a measly 53% of the national living wage.",
