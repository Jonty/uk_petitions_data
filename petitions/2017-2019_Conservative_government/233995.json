        "additional_details": "We've all seen how the Conservative government have 'handled' negotiations with the EU and the deal they are now proposing. It is suggested that since 2016, sentiment for \"leave\" has shifted with many people now either wishing to remain or are in a position now in 2018 to make a much more informed decision.\r\n\r\nIt is fair and just for each Nation to be represented in Live TV debates and indeed more than 2 political parties and not left to the biased opinion of 2 politicians wishing to leave the EU.",
        "background": "A Brexit TV debate is proposed between Theresa May (Conservatives) & Jeremy Corbyn (Labour) with no invite to the leaders of the devolved Nations of the UK. We, the British People ask for consideration for representatives of each Nation to be included as a simple, democratic, unbiased right.",
