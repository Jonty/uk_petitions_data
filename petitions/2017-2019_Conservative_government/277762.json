        "action": "Hold a referendum on Proportional Representation for parliamentary elections",
        "additional_details": "This is unrepresentative of the votes cast: since 2005 two general elections have produced no overall majority, and two have produced majorities which each resulted from just over one third of the votes cast. \r\n20 years ago the Jenkins Commission recommended a proportional system to replace First Past the Post. We therefore call upon Parliament to hold a referendum on the Jenkins Commission recommendation providing a truly representative parliament rather than party career politician's in safe seats. If you disagree your vote will not be represented.",
        "background": "Under our present electoral system the distribution of seats among the political parties bears no close relation to the total votes cast for those parties. In 2017, the average number of votes cast nationally for each party varied between just under 28,000 and over 525,000 votes per seat won.",
