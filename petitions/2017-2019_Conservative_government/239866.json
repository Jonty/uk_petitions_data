        "additional_details": "By holding the 2016 referendum as a binary issue and combining the votes cast for a no deal with the votes cast for a deal, the 2016 referendum was either deliberately or mistakenly skewed towards a leave result. I call on Parliament to recognise that the 2016 referendum was delivered in such a manner as was disloyal to the crown and the general public and should be annulled.\r\n",
        "background": "Action is required on this petition, as it can be demonstrated the outcome of the 2016 election was undemocratic and was not fit for purpose. It is certain, that a group that had the minority support from the voting electorate will be the, \u201cwinners.\u201d \r\nDemocracy must be restored.",
