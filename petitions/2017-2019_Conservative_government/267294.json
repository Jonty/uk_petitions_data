        "additional_details": "Chinese import motorcycles are usually bought by newly qualified riders. Time and time again as a vehicle technician I have seen critical parts coming loose or oil leaks nearly causing accidents, an example of this is that one of our motorcycle NVQ students 2019 bike had a major fuel leak whilst he was riding nearly causing a fire. The bike was only a few months old.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese market is poorly regulated and these bikes are not fit for UK roads.",
