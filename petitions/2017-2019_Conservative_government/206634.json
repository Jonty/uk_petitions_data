        "action": "Create a devolved parliament for the county of Devon",
        "additional_details": "The Government at Westminster has for too long now shown a complete lack of regard for The South West and Devon in particular. And despite promises, our hospitals, schools and infrastructure has been underfunded and it is making the people of Devon frustrated. Our pupils are underfunded, local hospitals are being forced to close and our railway system is dreadful, with projects planned before WWII that still haven't been completed. We want a more prosperous Devon inside a fairer united Kingdom.",
        "background": "Devon has for too long been put at the bottom of the agenda by the out-of-touch Government in Westminster. We have received far too little in the way of funding for education and the NHS. A devolved assembly would allow us to decide on issues like tax, agriculture housing and education.",
