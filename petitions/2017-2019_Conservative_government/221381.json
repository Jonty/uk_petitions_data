        "additional_details": "Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan is currently the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates, a country which finds same-sex sexual activity to be illegal. He also owns City Football Group, which Manchester City Football Club is a part of. Football is the national sport of the UK, yet the owner of the Premier League champions believes homosexuality should be illegal. If LGBT equality is to be truly achieved, people like Sheikh Mansour cannot be permitted to own UK based companies",
        "background": "In many countries homosexuality is still considered a crime. This is in direct contrast to the UK, where same-sex sexual activity has been legal since 1967. Members of ruling government parties in countries where homosexuality is still illegal should be banned from owning UK based companies",
