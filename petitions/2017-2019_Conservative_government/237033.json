        "action": "A second EU referendum based on what we now know are the consequences of Brexit",
        "additional_details": "The prolonged negotiation period has cost this economy.  Direct costs of the Brexit departments, indirect costs of uncertainty and UK reputation, and opportunity costs of funds spent on this project which could have been spent on housing and the NHS.  I did vote remain;  but accepted the result.  However, more than 2 years on there is no clear idea of the final outcome.  Political paralysis is hurting our country, and more importantly the hard working families who feel betrayed by Westminster.",
        "background": "Given what we now know to be the consequences of leaving the EU and given the Government's (and Westminter's) inability to agree a way forward, voters should have an opportunity to consider facts arising over the past 2 years and review their decision.  If leave wins, Brexit should be immediate.",
