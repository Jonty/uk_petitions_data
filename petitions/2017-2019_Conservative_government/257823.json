        "action": "Please make being spiked with drugs a specific defence to criminal allegations.",
        "additional_details": "The way the law stands currently, if the Crown Prosecution Service do not need to prove that a person had any intent to commit a crime because of the way a piece of legislation is written, being spiked (involuntary intoxication) is not considered as a defence but a mitigating circumstance leaving people at risk of jail sentences, losing their home and a life-long criminal record. My Assailant got away scott free to do the same again. Please make this amendment retrospective to cover all laws.",
        "background": "I was spiked in a pub and Greater Manchester Police decided that it was not proportionate to collect CCTV evidence of me being spiked. I had an allegation made against me whilst I was under the influence of it. The allegation carries a mandatory 6 month jail sentence. Being spiked is not a defence.",
