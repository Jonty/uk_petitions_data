        "additional_details": "If an employee is already suffering with severe anxiety, depression and panic attacks, surely it would be in a companies best interest to help the employee to recover and aid them in returning back to work. Providing financial help would have a massive impact on an already suffering employee by providing support but also not adding another anxiety /panic to an already serious condition. If companies would provide this support then the employee would be very well aided in the recovery process.",
        "background": "Having worked in the private sector for numerous years and now working in the public sector for over a year, I have come to find that companies are not supportive when an employees mental health illness occurs. Not being supportive in the workplace financially is detrimental to their recovery.",

For example, you could start a new petition asking for the UK Government and Parliament to set a mandatory amount of paid leave for employees who experience mental health problems, if that's what you want to happen. You could also start a new petition asking for the UK Government to launch an awareness campaign aimed at employers about mental health, if that's what you want to happen. \r\n\r\n"
