        "action": "Reintroduce teaching of British Imperial measurements into the UK curriculum",
        "additional_details": "- Road signs are Imperial (yards, miles)\r\n- Body weight is given in Stone, lbs.\r\n- Milk and beer is sold in pints.\r\n- Height is measures in feet and inches.\r\n\r\nMetric is the sole focus of the curriculum.\r\nBring imperial measurements in line with metric and restore people's ability to use real-life measurements and weights.",
        "background": "Currently, the metric system is primarily taught in schools, with imperial being very loosely taught. This is problematic due to the fact that many real life scenarios (road signs, pints, weight etc) are measured in imperial. It's unfair for people not to be taught an important system used in the UK",
