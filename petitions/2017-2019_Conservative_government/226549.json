        "additional_details": "In my opinion, I feel as though the DBS check is not thorough enough as people are still working with children and vulnerable people that are later convicted of offences in relation to the safeguarding and welfare of the children, e.g. rape. Just because these people have no current criminal convictions doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t have the traits and the motives to carry out the convictions that are happening and continue to happen to children on a day-to-day basis.",
        "background": "The Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) helps employers make safer recruitment decisions and prevent unsuitable people from working with vulnerable groups, including children. There are still people today that are working with young and vulnerable children that are later convicted.",
