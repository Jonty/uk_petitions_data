        "additional_details": "Paying nearly \u00a39 a month per prescription is hard. I am currently on 3 different types of tablets for my metal health, which is just under \u00a330 per month. Having a job does put pressure on my mental health, and the price of prescription increases does not help either. Having an exemption certificate would help people with mental health a lot more than people think. With this, we can live our lives knowing that we will be able to obtain our medication, and not have to worry if we can afford it.",
        "background": "I was diagnosed with borderline persobality disorder, anxiety & depression a few years ago. Since then, the price of prescriptions have risen. For a lifelong illness such as mental health, people should be able to gain a medical exemption certificate.",
