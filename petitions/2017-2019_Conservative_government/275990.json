        "additional_details": "These adverts are false propaganda designed to give the impression that the Government is getting on with Brexit by 31st October despite time and the law making this impossible. These adverts are actually electioneering tools being used outside of an election period. They should be identified as such and withdrawn immediately.",
        "background": "The Government is spending many millions on adverts telling people to \u201cget ready for Brexit on 31st October\u201d.  In reality there isn\u2019t enough time to ratify a deal and \u201c no deal\u201d is illegal, forcing the Government to ask for an extension. This means the adverts are not honest or truthful.",
