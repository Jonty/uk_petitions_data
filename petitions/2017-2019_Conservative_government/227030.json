        "background": "Ban all headgear that covers the face, including Scarves, Balaclavas, Niqabs and Burkas from being worn in public places.\r\nSafety equipment such as Motorcycle helmets and face masks can only be worn in public in relation to their use and not as a casual accessory in a public place.",
