        "additional_details": "I want the Government, with a cross party group and a neutral lead, i.e. Caroline Lucas MP (Green), to fully investigate and take action to stop the blatant abuse of the power the BBC has at it's disposal.\r\nWe live in a democracy. In a time of fake news, we need our primary media choices to keep us adequately informed - not exposed to inherently negative Tory propaganda.\r\nI want Leveson 2 to be put forward for a Parliamentary vote and for it to be extended to further study the BBC News platform.",
        "background": "My bias notwithstanding as a Corbyn Labour supporter, there is a systemic bias concern at the BBC News team. \r\nIt is a public funded organisation that is pushing an anti-Labour/Corbyn agenda whilst ignoring clear concerns with the Conservatives over racism, funding and Parliament protected smears.",
