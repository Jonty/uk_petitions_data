        "action": "Amend the Recall of MPs Act 2015. MPs not standing as elected to be included.",
        "additional_details": "This is manifestly unrepresentative when the MP in question;  Resigns the Party Whip and therefore that parties principles; Goes against the Parties Manifesto (Unless the Party Leaders have made the decision to change), or blatantly reneges on their personal promises to the electorate.  We believe that in any instance of a sitting MP not truly representing the majority of their electorate, they should be subject to recall under the same terms as the above mentioned Act.",
        "background": "Under the present Recall of MPs Act 2015, MPs can only be recalled for Criminal Acts resulting in imprisonment. The fact that all MPs are elected on their Party , their Parties Manifesto and the individual Candidates promises to the Electorate is not considered to be of any Importance.",
