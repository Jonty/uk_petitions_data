        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom has a representative democracy.  It is therefore incumbent upon the MPs representing their constituents to represent the views of the electorate.  It is clear that a majority of the electorate did not want the UK to remain within the European Union.  MPs absolutely must reflect this view and enable the executive to execute the decision of the electorate otherwise a mockery is made of our democracy - the Mother of Democracy.",
        "background": "On 23/06/2016 under the biggest democratic operation ever held in the UK (with a turnout of 72.3%)  51.9% of the population voted to leave the European Union.  If democracy is to be upheld then neither a 2nd referendum nor remaining in the European Union upholds this democratic decision.",
