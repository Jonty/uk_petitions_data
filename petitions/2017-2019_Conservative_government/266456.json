        "additional_details": "Standards should be tightened to account for lower pressures found throughout waste water systems, not just at the immediate flush point. In addition, products should be proven to be quickly bio-degradable before they can be labelled as flushable. \r\nStandards should be enforced, and mislabelling should be an offence and carry significant fines.",
        "background": "So-called flushable products block sewers and damage aquatic environments. Industry tests for categorising a product as flushable are inadequate and do not represent real-world conditions. Standards also do not adequately test for rapid biodegrading of the product once flushed.",
