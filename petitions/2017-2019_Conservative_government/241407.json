        "additional_details": "With potentially huge impact on the economy, security and standing of this nation, a clear explanation is vital if we are to move forward together as the  Government requests.\r\nGovernment response often justifies Brexit related requests by citing a marginal majority of a consultative referendum. This request does not seek for that specious platitude to be repeated but to understand the true and indisputable benefits of Brexit and how they outweigh the considerable benefits we enjoy within the EU.",
        "background": "With the nation within weeks of leaving the EU, the people have still not been informed of the clear and indisputable benefits of Brexit. Holders of Public Office are required to act in the best interests of the people and therefore, the people should understand what those benefits are.",
