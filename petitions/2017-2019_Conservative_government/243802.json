        "additional_details": "We want out with no delays on 29th March 2019.  Contrary to popular belief by many both in Parliament and by other high profile people money is NOT the most important thing in life.  If we are poorer as a result of No Deal then so be it.  You cannot put a price on freedom.  Better to be poor and free than rich and enslaved.",
        "background": "The current deal is dead and will not deliver what we voted for and keep us shackled to the EU for years.  Only NO DEAL WTO rules will give us what we voted for.  We don't care about any effects on the economy that it might bring which is the main argument by Project Fear trying to keep us in.",
