        "additional_details": "Since the declaration of the results of the 2016 EU Referendum, there has been persistent attempts to overturn the results and frustrate government\u2019s pledge to fulfill the said Referendum. To preserve integrity and voter\u2019s trust in our democratic institutions, it is imperative that the UK government honours it\u2019s pledge by delivering on the Referendum result and take the UK out of the EU. Any subsequent referendum on UK\u2019s withdrawal should solely be on the terms upon which the UK leaves the EU.",
        "background": "In 2016 and on a 72% turnout, 17,410,742 people voted to Leave the EU which is the biggest vote in British history for any event. Constituting 52% of the votes thereby making the majority, UK voters took the decision to leave the EU. There are now calls for a 2nd Referendum or People\u2019s vote.",
