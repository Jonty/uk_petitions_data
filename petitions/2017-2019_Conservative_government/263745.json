This not only deeply affects a families finances, but also adds to stress within the family home, creating knock on effects.",
        "background": "With there being over 4.5 million children living in poverty and some parents struggling to make ends meet, it seem absurd that the price of school uniforms is so high. \r\nIt is not fair to put unnecessary pressure on already struggling parents.",
