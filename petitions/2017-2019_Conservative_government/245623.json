        "action": "Let people 65 and over stay on DLA and not force them to go over to PIP.",
        "additional_details": "If someone who has been on DLA for many years, in many cases, since it first came out in the 1970's and they are 65 and over with a life time award then they should remain on DLA. DWP has nothing to gain by forcing people in that age group to go over to PIP. Mistakes being made on peoples application for PIP by DWP is a total disgrace, causing many people to the point of suicide. People with major disabilities are never going to improve and people in this age group do not need the stress.",
        "background": "Amber Rudd, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions announced recently that people 65 and over will not be reassess on PIP. She should go one step further and allow people who are on DLA with life time award and who are 65 and over to remain on DLA.",
