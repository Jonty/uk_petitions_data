        "additional_details": "John Bercow (speaker of the commons) called this an \u201coffence against the democratic process\u201d - and he\u2019s absolutely right. How can we allow MP\u2019s to return for just six days until they are adjourned once again? Our current political situation should not make the public so desensitised to the extent that we forget about democracy altogether. \r\n\r\nSign if you agree that the U.K. shouldn\u2019t forfeit its political democracy for a temporary gesture.",
        "background": "Regardless of everyone\u2019s position on Brexit, it is completely unacceptable to allow the Prime Minister to push the suspension of Parliament and set a dangerous precedent. We elect MP\u2019s to represent us; not only about Brexit, but to represent our local issues too.",
