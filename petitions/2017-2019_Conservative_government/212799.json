A public transport system needs to be accessible to the public. Someone trying to get to London for a night out has to navigate a ridiculous web of terms and conditions to buy a ticket - each way! We should be able to saunter into our local station, tap on & touch off again in Kings Cross with no fuss. Embrace the 21st C!",
        "background": "Replace the absurdly convoluted system of different companies running different tickets for different peak and off-peak times at extortionist prices! Introduce a single CHEAP touch-on touch-off system (like Oyster) for the whole of UK (barely bigger than the state of Victoria AU and we managed it).",
