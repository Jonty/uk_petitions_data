        "additional_details": "In the UK only second offences can be considered for mandatory life, we demand that the leniency given to sexual criminals be investigated by an impartial committee. We demand the laws regarding sentencing are thrown out and rewritten. The U.K. is far to lenient on sexual criminals. Most of the time you will see they recieve a 5 month sentence. This is not good enough. The safety of our children is at stake.",
        "background": "We,the people ask the government invests time into reviewing the path of justice in reference to sexual crimes. Time and time again we hear about rapists perverts and peadophiles absconding or breaking court orders. There should be manadatory life senticing for rapists.",
