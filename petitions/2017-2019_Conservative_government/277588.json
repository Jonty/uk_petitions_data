Guy Fawkes night used to be celebrated on November 5th. Now days events seem to go on for at least a week making it very difficult for pet owners to take appropriate action to protect their pets from the distress that fireworks often cause. \r\nLet\u2019s go back to Nov 5th being held on Nov 5th.",
