        "additional_details": "Within the last couple of days I have seen 2 reports of cats being killed by lurchers (that\u2019s just in my home town but happens country wide) These cruel acts are on the rise again and those poor, innocent cats are someone\u2019s family. These Lurchers and Staffordshire Bull Terriors are usually taken out by teenage boys who think it\u2019s funny to set them on cats and watch as they get ripped to pieces. This is a depraved, senseless act and the law needs to change and Individuals should be punished.",
        "background": "Owners of certain breeds of dogs like Lurchers and Staffordshire Bull Terriors are increasingly and deliberately setting their dogs upon helpless, defenceless cats and the majority are dying a cruel and painful death as a result of being ripped apart, internal bleeding or wounds too great to treat.",
