        "additional_details": "There are some cases where some parents are considered unsafe around children and this of course should be the exception. But research proves that parental alienation and using children as weapons is damaging their development. Parental alienation should be considered as child abuse. Children can only be used as a weapon whilst our civil law allows it to happen. If both parents have equal rights and shared custody then the court process would rarely be required, only in cases of enforcement.",
        "background": "In some cases fathers are being denied access to their children. If not married, the mother does not have to name a father on the child's birth certificate. We have a current civil law process which allows and gives incentives to mother's who delay and outright deny access to children.",
