        "additional_details": "I want to raise awareness for this condition and believe that, with help from the right people eg. NHS and NMC, Fowler\u2019s Syndrome could be made a vital part of the national curriculum for doctors and nurses which would help prevent multiple undiagnosed patients, less trauma and a better understanding to treat those patients with the condition.",
        "background": "Fowler\u2019s Syndrome is a rare condition, first diagnosed in 1985 by professor Fowler @ UCLH London. It causes chronic retention in young woman. A lot of ladies go undiagnosed for years, enduring endless, unnecessary trauma because not enough doctors know about the condition.",
