        "additional_details": "Elected MPs stood on a manifesto that said \"No Deal is better than a bad deal\". No deal is now off the table because some MPs decided to go against their manifesto pledges.\r\n\r\nThe right thing to do, at this point, is to put it back to the people in the form of a General Election.\r\n\r\nWe have seen MPs cross the floor, some cross the floor and others be deselected.\r\n\r\nParliament in its current form is not one that the electorate voted for.\r\n\r\nGive us the chance to democratically elect our parliament!",
        "background": "After Johnson lost the votes on 4th October, it has become clear that there is no real majority for anything in parliament. Most MPs voted for Article 50 but 3 times a whitdrawal bill has been rejected and now no deal has been rejected too. The only way to solve this is for a general election.",
