This is a firm commitment by the candidate and a strong message to the electorate.\r\n\r\nThey should not continue as MPs if their views have changed so significantly from that advertised.",
        "background": "Under our voting system those standing for parliament can apply to have the logo and name of the party they are standing for on the ballot paper. Many people take that as meaning they agree with the policies and positions of that party, if they leave the party it's no longer what the people voted on",
