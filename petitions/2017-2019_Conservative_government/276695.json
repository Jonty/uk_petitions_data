Earlier this year, they prevented a person visiting a loved one who was dying. Sadly, they missed their loved one's death.\r\nThey have no respect for people who need urgent access to hospitals.\r\nWe believe it is time the law was strengthened to ban Activist Groups from being able to shut down and disable city transport networks.",
