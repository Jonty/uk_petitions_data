We're therefore not exactly sure what further action you want the UK Government or Parliament to take. You can find out which types of applications are included in the fee waiver here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/672083/fee-waiver-guidancev2_0.pdf \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking for other types of applications to be included in the fee waiver, if that's what you'd like to happen. You could also start a new petition asking for a specific change to the criteria for a fee waiver, if that's what you'd like to happen. "
