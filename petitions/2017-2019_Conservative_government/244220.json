        "additional_details": "You work towards buying your house, but do they understand how much money is required at the start of this process? Do they understand how much insurance they need to pay for there first car? Do they understand how debt can crumble a persons life. When they go to university and they spend there student loan on the less important things and not think about eventually paying it back, Why put them in a position where they have to learn the hard way, instead of teaching it to them in schools?",
        "background": "The reason i make this petition is because no one is taught basic financial management at schools, the reason we go school is to learn, with that learning in place , we use that knowledge to then get us a job, to then allow us to make money. So why dont they get taught how to manage it appropriately",
