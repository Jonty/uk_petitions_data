        "additional_details": "In other countries the state pension age is anything between 60 & 65 you can check this on Wikipedia. Considering England is one of the richest countries in the world it\u2019s an absolute disgrace that women have to work a further 7 years and men a further 2 or 3 years.  At this rate you won\u2019t receive your state pension because you\u2019ll be 6 foot under and that is exactly what the government want.",
        "background": "If you were born in the 50s or 60s you\u2019re expecting to receive your state pension at the age of 60. However the government have decided you should work until the age of 65 to 67 which is another seven years working before you get your state pension. Absolutely disgrace.",
