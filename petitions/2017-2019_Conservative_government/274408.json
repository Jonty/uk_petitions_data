        "additional_details": "Currently the cost of school transport for 16 to 18 year olds and whether to grant free transport, is decided by local authorities. Some offer free transport and others charge. In my own case the charge is currently \u00a3700 p.a. In two years time we will have triplets entering sixth form or college. At the current cost, that's an additional \u00a32,100 to find.\r\nThis makes no sense. If a local authority deems that free school transport is justifiable from age 4 to 16, it should remain free until age 18.",
        "background": "The school leaving age has effectively been extended until the age of 18. However, entitlement to free school transport ceases at 16 as it did before the leaving age was extended. This makes no sense. If it's free up to the age of 16 it should remain free until a child leaves full-time education.",
