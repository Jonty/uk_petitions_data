        "additional_details": "There is already a claim process in place, however this requires claiming every single journey individually and the compensation is minimal. Furthermore, shortly after the new timetable was introduced, a large number of trains were removed from the schedule which means you cannot claim compensation for those trains being cancelled every single day.",
        "background": "On the 20th May a new timetable was introduced on the Thameslink railway line through London, since then there have been delays and cancellations everyday. All season tickets should be fully refunded for the affected period, which is from the 20th of May and as yet there is no end date.",
