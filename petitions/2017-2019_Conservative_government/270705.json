        "action": "Tell the Queen that it will be a political act by Her to prorogue before Brexit",
        "additional_details": "Prorogation is a matter of Royal prerogative, done by the Queen on Her PM's recommendation. It is usual for a few days between parliamentary sessions. In the pre-Brexit period, it would amount to a circumvention of democratic institutions that the Government knows are opposed to No Deal. Asking for prorogation will force Her into a political choice: either suspend Parliament or refuse the PM's request. The House of Commons should submit that prorogation now would be a political act by the Queen.",
        "background": "The Prime Minister may ask the Queen to prorogue Parliament. This would politicise her role, and should not be done. It would prevent Parliament scrutinising Government action to which it has shown itself opposed. A request will force Her either to suspend democracy or to reject her PM's advice.",
