        "additional_details": "In the UK, over 2.2 million tonnes of plastic packaging are placed on the market each year.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, only 46.2% of UK plastic packaging from all sectors was collected for recycling; of this 46.2%, 34% was recycled in the UK, with the rest exported for recycling.\r\n\r\nWith China banning imports of plastic waste, some UK plastic waste is now exported to countries such as Indonesia & Malaysia; the poorer infratructure in these countries means that only around 10% of all plastic waste is recycled.",
        "background": "Currently in the UK food is sold in packaging that's non-recyclable, which ends up being sent to landfill & causing environmental pollution.  Each year, this amounts to thousand of tonnes, from polystyrene takeaway cartons, to fruit and veg sold in non-recyclable plastic film, it is not sustainable.",
