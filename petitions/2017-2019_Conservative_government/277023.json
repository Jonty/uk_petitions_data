        "action": "Change the current law on dog chipping to include compulsory scanning",
        "additional_details": "National Dog Finders Alliance along with many other facebook groups has for some years helped to get dogs reunited, this was helped a great deal when it was made law to chip all dogs, however, this was undermined by allowing vets and others to decide if they wanted to scan or not, vets and others have scanners and to scan a dog or cat takes seconds, so there is no valid reason for this not to be made compulsory the end result would mean many more lost and stolen dogs being reunited",
        "background": "The law making it compulsory to chip all dogs (hopefully cats as well soon) was a major step forward in getting dogs back home but was undermined by the failure to include compulsory scanning by vets and other organizations, this now needs to be put right and make all organizations compulsory scan",
