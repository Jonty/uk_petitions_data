        "additional_details": "A door supervisors wages 10+ years ago was \u00a310 per hour and today you'll be lucky enough to get \u00a310 per hour but it ranges from \u00a37.50-\u00a310 per hour! This needs to change to a minimum of \u00a315 per hour. To be working for a extra \u00a32.50 above the national minimum wage to have to deal with what they do is disgusting!",
        "background": "The role of a door supervisor is to protect the people that want to go out for a good time and to deal with challenging situations. A door supervisor of today are putting their lives at risk by having to deal with concealed weapons, broken bottles used as weapons and a lot more!",
