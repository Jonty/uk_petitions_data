        "action": "Restrict sale of fireworks to 1st-5th November in the interest of animal welfare",
        "additional_details": "I have spoken to numerous pet owners, dogs/cats/rabbits etc and they are all in agreement that fireworks are getting louder every year and being let off over a least a 2 week period. The law at the moment allows fireworks to be sold from 15th October until 10th November, that is too long. I would like this changed to 1st November to 5th November in the interest of all animal including wild animals welfare",
        "background": "Having just spent the last week with a dog absolutely terrified of the fireworks and its still going on and its now 7th November I feel something needs to be done about the length of time before and after bonfire night that fireworks are sold. This stands at 15th October - 10th November at present",
