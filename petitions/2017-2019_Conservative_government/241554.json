The jobs selected will be based upon the proportion of people they employ \u2013 85% of places would be in jobs paying less than \u00a325k/yr.\r\n\r\nThe MPs and Lords will be paired with someone from an opposing party. The pair will be assigned a job for one week. This selection will be random.\r\n\r\nThe media won't report on the politicians during the week to avoid interfering in how the MPs conduct themselves.",
        "background": "Every year all politicians should undertake one week of randomly assigned work experience \u2013 possibly to be extended to some civil servants.\r\n\r\nThis will allow them to experience what work is like for all classes of people. Thus, they will be able to make better decisions in parliament.",
