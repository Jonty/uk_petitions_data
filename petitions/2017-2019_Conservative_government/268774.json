And will leave 74 Midwives without a job they're passionate about.",
        "background": "One to one Midwives is a community-based organisation that has recently gone into administration citing its NHS contract no longer being financially viable.\r\nOnetoOne empowers women to make their own choices around prenatal, postnatal and birthing care and offers a dedicated midwife to every woman.",
