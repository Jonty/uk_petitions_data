        "additional_details": "Let\u2019s Legalise all drugs. We must regulate them and take the profits out of the drug dealers hands. It is time to care for each other - not punish. \r\nYoung boys are being groomed by dealers - across the whole United Kingdom. School children are going hungry while food money goes on their parents drugs. Our criminalised youth are in prison and are dying drug related deaths.\r\nPlease provide a framework of help for users where they get clean drugs and help with mental health (which is a primary driver of hard drug use.) We need to have investment in rehabilitation and education in schools. Legalising all drugs and taxing them, in the same way that tobacco is taxed, will bring billions of pounds in revenue.",
