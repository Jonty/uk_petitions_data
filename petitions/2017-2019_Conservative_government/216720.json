        "additional_details": "I think this would significantly improve road safety by reducing the number of car accidents with motorbikes when they are not seen by drivers joining / changing lanes in heavy traffic.  The headlight colour would obviously need to be one that would afford the bike rider equal visibility.",
        "background": "Driving at night, in heavy traffic or in wet weather it is often difficult to differentiate a motorbike weaving down between lanes from other cars.  If motorbikes had a different coloured headlamp (yellow maybe), drivers, incl. other riders, looking in rear/side view mirrors would better spot them.",
