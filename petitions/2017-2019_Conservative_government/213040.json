        "additional_details": "We want all 16/17-year-olds in the UK to have the opportunity to vote in general elections, local elections and referendums.\r\nIn Scotland, the voting age was lowered for the Scottish Independence referendum and currently, 16/17-year-old citizens can vote in local elections. Wales is currently seeking to decrease voting age to 16 for council elections. But still, in England and Northern Ireland, 16/17-year-olds are not allowed to partake in any general or local elections or referendums. Let's join Austria (with a higher turnout of people aged 16/17 than 18 or 21 in 2008 and political interest for young people increased), Brazil, Switzerland, Malta, Germany, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Nicaragua who all have some level of voting rights for 16 or 17-year-olds.",
        "background": "In the UK, 16/17-year-olds can legally consent to sex, marry, join the army, work full time and pay tax, however, voting rights for 16/17-year-olds across the entirety of the UK are not yet equal.\r\nDoing this in the UK would make young people eager to vote + increase voter turnout.",
