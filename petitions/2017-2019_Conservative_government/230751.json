In particular, we are not sure what you mean by \"without any extensions\".\r\n\r\nIt has been reported that the Prime Minister is considering asking for an extension to the transition period. The transition period would take place after the UK has formally left the EU. The current draft agreement proposes this runs until December 2020.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling on the UK to negotiate an agreement to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 without a transition period if that is something you would like to see happen. Or you could sign this petition for the UK to leave the EU on that date without an agreement:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/229963 \r\n"
