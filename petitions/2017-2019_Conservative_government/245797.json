        "additional_details": "The government welcome people becoming self employed as they have no need to claim JSA. However if you take home more than \u00a3192 per month you have reductions in your entitlement equal to 63p out of every \u00a3 above this figure. You also get deductions if you don't meet a minimum income floor equal to 35 hours per week (this is after deducting associated expenses, income tax & NI). Universal Credit is a double edged sword for the self employed. It effectively punishes the self employed for working.",
        "background": "One size does not fit all. Universal Credit does not cater for self employed people and new businesses. The government & UC / DWP only give new businesses 12 months to start up, build and achieve unrealistic levels of income which would normally take 2 or 3 years of trading to reach.",

For example, you could ask for the 12 month period to be increased to 3 years, if that's what you'd like to happen. \r\n\r\nA group of MPs called the Work and Pensions Committee has recommended that the Government make changes to how Universal Credit works for self-employed people.
