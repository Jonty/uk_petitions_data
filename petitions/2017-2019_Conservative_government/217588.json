        "additional_details": "Antifa has become very active in demonstrations using threatening and violent behaviour to intimidate people who do not share their opinion. \r\nThe fact that they disguise their appearance with masks and balaclavas suggests their intentions are unlawful.\r\nThey tend to dress in black along with their faces covered. This could be seen as a uniform which it's self is threatening. These people instil terror on innocent members of the public and must be made illegal",
        "background": "Antifa members dressed in black with their faces covered should be made illegal. They are intimidating and threatening and get away with this behaviour due to covering their faces.",
