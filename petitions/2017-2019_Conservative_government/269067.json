        "additional_details": "I believe we saw a rise in terrorism since the media gained more reach and we failed to learn that removing the publicity would reduce such acts of violence, and promote more dialogue to resolve differences.  We need to inact this law in the hope that other countries follow our Leadership.  The sooner we do this, the more lives will be saved.",
        "background": "It is not right to give publicity to terrorists names or airtime to their causes.  We should ban this in the name of peace, to remove some of the motivations from these terrorists and their movements from undertaking such acts.  Any successful attack should instead focus on the victims and families.",
