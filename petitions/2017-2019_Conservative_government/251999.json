        "additional_details": "As of todays date we have 65 women actively receiving counselling with a further 55 on the waiting list. We are also working with 28 children age 4 and up with 41 on the waiting list. These maybe just figures to the Ministry of Justice, but to us they are survivors of some form of sexual abuse, who all need our service. Where do all 189 people go from June when our funding runs out?",
        "background": "The Ministry Of Justice decided not to renew funding for counselling services to women and children who have been victims of either childhood sexual abuse or sexual violence in Redcar and Cleveland. The MOJ suggests that victims go to their nearest centre for support, WE are their nearest support.",
