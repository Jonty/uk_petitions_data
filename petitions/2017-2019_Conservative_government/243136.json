        "additional_details": "A recent case where a father and husband was killed on his motorcycle, the driver of the vehicle was fined \u00a3200 and got a conditional discharge, for causing Death by Careless driving. How is this a deterrent? The same driver would not consider driving under the influence of alcohol,because of the immediate 1 year ban and large fine. So, if the offence was Death by driving and carried a custodial se fence of between 1 and 15 years, the choice to not pay full attention would be better enhanced.",
        "background": "Recent cases have seen vulnerable road users killed by cars on tbe road. The drivers of these cars have been taken to court for, Death by careless driving, which is a lesser charge, than Death by dangerous driving. I believe tbe charge should be simply Death by driving.",
