        "background": "The dreadful behaviour of all MP's in the House of Commons during Brexit has demonstrated that they are incapable of acting on behalf of the British People and are only serving their own interests.\r\n\r\nParliament should be dissolved by the Queen and a new democratic system should be developed.",
