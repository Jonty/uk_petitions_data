In my mind all public services work extremely hard (Police, Fire, Ambulance or our nurses and doctors).  Our pay was frozen, then capped at 1% whilst inflation has risen at about 3%, our pension contributions have risen and the NI contributions we pay so, in effect, our wages have dropped.\u201d \r\n\r\nALL emergency services deserve a decent living wage and appropriate funding for volunteer agencies.",
        "background": "The fire fighters are real life heroes risking their own life and limb, running into danger, for the sake of others and their property. Their wages, along with ALL other emergency service workers, have been frozen and capped instead of being given the recognition they deserve.",
