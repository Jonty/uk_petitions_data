        "additional_details": "NO published scientific study has yet explored the biological effects of complex/multi-frequency radiation exposure on humanity. Over 180 scientists/doctors from 35 countries call for ban on 5G until safety is proven: http://bit.ly/2jylC6c. Concerns from higher radiation exposure include neurological impacts, infertility and cancer.\r\n\r\nWe are being knowingly and progressively harmed by technology service-providers, industry and government for profit so research MUST be independent of these bodies.",
        "background": "We are energetic \u2018vibrational\u2019 beings. Powerful 5G will substantially increase our exposure to radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) on top of the 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi etc for telecommunications that are already in place. RF-EMF has already been proven to be very harmful for humans/environment.",
