In other cases, people who are accused of making false accusations may be prosecuted for wasting police time.\r\n\t\r\nYou may find this guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service helpful:\r\nhttp://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/perverting_the_course_of_justice_-_rape_and_dv_allegations/\r\n\r\nWe're therefore not sure how you would like the law to be changed. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
