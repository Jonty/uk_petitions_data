        "additional_details": "A majority of MPs have shown contempt for the Electorate by seeking to undermine the result of the 2016 EU Referendum. Significant numbers are currently seeking to overturn the Referendum result and must be held accountable. The decision to remain in or leave the EU was delegated to voters. It is completely unacceptable for MPs to ignore the will of the majority of voters in this manner.",
        "background": "MPs and the Government can currently be held in contempt of Parliament. They are not accountable to electorate in the same way. Many adhere to the principle of 'one word from voters and we do as we like'. We seek accountability to Parliament and the electorate, beyond that afforded by election.",
