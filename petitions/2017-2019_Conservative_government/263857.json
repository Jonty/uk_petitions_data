        "additional_details": "Of those who previously received DLA, 54% were denied PIP, this is the highest rejection rate out of all health conditions and double the national average. Additionally, 66% of new claims for PIP were denied the benefit. However, of the third that appealed the decision 77% were granted PIP. This is evidence that a review must be undertaken into how people with epilepsy are assessed for PIP to make the system fairer.",
