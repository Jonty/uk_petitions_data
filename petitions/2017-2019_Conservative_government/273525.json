        "additional_details": "The 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum saw a turnout of 84%, of which 45% voted Yes. With my proposal, this equates to less than 38% and a far more decisive Result. Import this format to the 2016 EU Referendum and I believe a more clear cut result would have been announced, sparing us the unsavoury scenes we've witnessed from our parliamentarians in the last 3years. The current farce we see now, would not be happening and faith in our Democracy would be restored.",
        "background": "Parliamentary and Public issues caused by results of 2016 EU and 2014 Scottish Independence Referendums would be avoided and our democracy revived, if Constitutional Change could only be Implemented when over 50% of the Electorate votes for it in any Referendum.",
