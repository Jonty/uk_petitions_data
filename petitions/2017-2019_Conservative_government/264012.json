        "additional_details": "Whilst I am all for marking this anniversary given that it is such a momentous occasion, why not offer the hard-working citizens of the UK an extra bank holiday to celebrate it seeing that as a nation we have some of the fewest number of bank holidays compared to other countries around the globe.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this petition proposes for the Bank Holiday on Monday 4 May 2020 to remain, with an additional Bank Holiday to mark the VE anniversary on Friday 8 May 2020.",
        "background": "The Government have just announced that the 2020 Early May Bank Holiday will be moved from Monday 4 May 2020 to Friday 8 May 2020 to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day.",
