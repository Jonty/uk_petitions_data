        "additional_details": "I do not feel that we choose which washing products to buy based on the aesthetics of the actual product inside, therefor see no reason for them to be colourful, bright and attractive as people are buying based on the product quality and possibly how the outer packaging looks. Children are very curious and more needs to be done to raise awareness of the dangers of these liquitabs. Myself & several others, feel a good start would be a change to the colours of the product.",
        "background": "Child locked boxes doesn\u2019t always mean children aren\u2019t able to get access to the contents of the box. Inside, they find brightly coloured liquitabs and can easily mistake them them for a sweet or snack and ingest them, which can be fatal if not treated quickly and appropriately.",
