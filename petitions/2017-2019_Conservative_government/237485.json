We voted to leave we and we the people made that decision in the full knowledge that this might happen. Parliament has failed in its duty to represent the electorates wishes and has obviously lost the trust of the people due to the continued political and personal agenda's.",
        "background": "It's obvious that parliament is incapable of making any decisions concerning brexit without political and personal agenda's. It's time now for the people to have it say in yet another simple question. Do we the people accept a no deal. Yes or No. If yes then parliament steps down from obstructing.",
