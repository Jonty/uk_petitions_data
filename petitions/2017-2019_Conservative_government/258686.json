        "additional_details": "Over 5 trillion tonnes of plastic live in our ocean today which has immensely impacted it\u2019s longevity - marine species such as whales, tiny corals and many unknown organisms are now endganged due this plastic pollution pandemic.\r\n\r\nWith the growing population now, and it\u2019s increased consumeration of plastic products; stricter regulations and management to waste and water is essential in reducing further damage to our waters and it\u2019s species. \r\n\r\nAs a developing country, we can challenge this issue.",
        "background": "National action is required to reduce the consequences of plastic pollution which not only suffocates our oceans, but can lead to a rippled effect to our health, animals and food. The UK Government can make bold moves in restoring our oceans through legislative measures; lead to a global protocol.",
