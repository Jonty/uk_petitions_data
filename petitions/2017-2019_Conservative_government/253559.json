        "additional_details": "Hold a legally-binding confirmatory referendum between Parliament's chosen deal (voted on with the proviso that it is subject to this referendum being held) vs. remain. Specify dates on which either a. we leave the EU or b. Article 50 is revoked. Regardless of the outcome of this referendum, it can be respected as all of the facts are now known, unlike in 2016. The outcome will be legally-binding so that there can be no more discussion and endless voting in the Commons.",
        "background": "The UK populus, Parliament, and the Government are bitterly divided. The 2016 EU referendum was flawed on both sides with inaccurate, exaggerated, and knowingly false data being used to support their respective arguments. Hold a legally-binding confirmatory referendum.",
