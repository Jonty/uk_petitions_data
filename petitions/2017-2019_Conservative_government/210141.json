        "action": "Leave the GCSE grade boundaries as they are.",
        "additional_details": "The students feel overwhelmed by the fact that what was an A* last year may become an A or even a B this year. This is unfair and suggests more people are wanted to fail; those that already feel under pressure will feel even worse upon hearing this issue. Changing the grade boundary is fundamentally unnecessary. Exams have become several times more difficult already and many students are already struggling with maintaining grades but the change in grade boundaries is very discouraging.",
        "background": "GCSEs have become increasingly difficult as the years have gone by, rendering students under both extreme mental and physical pressure. The students this year will be undergoing the new GCSEs; yet the Government are increasing the grade boundary, making it more difficult to pass than it already is.",
