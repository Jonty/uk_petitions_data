But, the proposals they are putting forward are going to have the unintentional consequence of destroying the aeromodelling hobby in the UK.  This will impact modellers and the industry that supports it.  Modellers already belong to an organisation (BMFA) that covers insurance and safe flying and have been leasing successfully with the CAA for many years. Our safety record is impeccable.",
