She ended her long career with a pay packet of \u00a3468,000, whilst living for free in a \u00a31.6M house.\r\nThe average student will be in \u00a340,000 debt with staff earning only,on average, \u00a335,000. I'm calling on the government to regulate the difference in pay between staff and vice chancellors, and ultimately review the necessity of a \u00a39,000 tuition fee.",
