        "additional_details": "Because universal credit calculate student finance as income, during term time UC take over \u00a3500 from my benefit because of this. Nothing is taken from my benefit during the summer holidays.\r\nStudent fiance is a loan that the student will be paying back when they earn enough to pay it back, it won't be the DWP paying it back.\r\nThis being taken every month also makes is harder for students with children to work at the same time as studying, even more so at christmas when every penny counts.",
        "background": "I am a full time student studying forensic science with psychology, I'm a lone parent with 4 children and I have a part time job.\r\nMy circumstances changed so I had to move onto universal credit, so I did this not knowing that they calculate the student finance package and use it as unearned income.",
