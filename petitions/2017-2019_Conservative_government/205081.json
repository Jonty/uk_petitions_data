        "additional_details": "In the 30mph zones people often do 50mph - 80 mph. In this people have had 'near misses' with cars/vans etc and some have even had car accidents, there are many schools/children play areas/elderly/adults/parents pushing buggies or walking with their children in Sawbridgeworth where crossing the road is a major concern as these people speed so fast with no care in the world. We just want some safety measures to be taken so that Sawbrideworth can be 'normal' again. Please sign this to help us.",
        "background": "Through the years speeding in Sawbridgeworth has been and still being an issue, we have contacted the council, local MP and the community police regarding this however they seem to be very reluctant to do anything, this petition is to make them realise the dangers and that something needs to be done",
