        "action": "Ban deep-sea trawl fishing at depths >600m in the North-East Atlantic Ocean.",
        "additional_details": "Deep-sea trawling causes: 1. The unrecoverable destruction of reefs, grown over thousands of years and inhabiting fish there. 2. An average of ~50% of fish caught being undesired and discarded, dead, back in to the sea. 3. The loss of huge amounts of carbon storing coral life that is desperately needed as we face climate change.\r\n\r\nDeep-sea trawling of the NE Atlantic is just 1.1% of EU catch for this region. The negative ecological and economic impacts are completely out proportion. Please Sign.",
        "background": "In 2017 the EU banned trawling below 800m in the EU and international waters of the Central-Eastern Atlantic. Whilst this was welcome, its in the North-East Atlantic waters that most trawling effort is made by EU fleets and are most in need of protection.",
