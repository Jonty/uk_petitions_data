Whilst the child protection sector encourages social work professionals to register themselves, a startling number are failing to do so, leading to cases of families being subjected to negligent care by social workers who are sometimes not qualified to practice, and who use unprotected titles to avoid detection. \r\n8,000 social workers barred from practice after failing to register in 2013.",
        "background": "At the moment there is no law requiring every social worker to register with an independent monitoring body like Social Work England. This loophole allows for dangerous levels of malpractice to take place inside the system, which could lead to, or may have already caused, child deaths.",
