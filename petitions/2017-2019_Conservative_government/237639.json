        "action": "Make it compulsory for food products to have environmental impact traffic lights",
        "additional_details": "We all need to make changes to limit the effects of climate change in our future and in our children's future. There is a growing movement across the country to use consumer power to limit climate change but this can be a daunting task for an individual - are bananas shipped from Africa less environmentally damaging than tomatoes grown in Spain? \r\n\r\nAlso, if we can increase everyone's awareness of their environmental impact then we increase the likelihood of making lower impact choices.",
        "background": "This proposal is to enforce environmental health traffic lights of carbon footprint, water use & packaging recyclability on food products similar to the sugar/salt health traffic lights. \r\n\r\nThis will enable people to make informed choices on the environmental impact of the goods they are buying.",
