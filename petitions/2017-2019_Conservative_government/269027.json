        "additional_details": "Should a widow or widower be in receipt of this benefit and then live with another person, you remove the benefit, because you consider them to be 'living together as though married'. I do agree with this. \r\nThis is misinterpretation of the term and used to disadvantage cohabiting couples. \r\nCohabiting couples are either 'living together as though married' OR NOT 'living together as though married'.\r\nThis is unfair and discriminatory against cohabiting couples and needs clarifying and changing.",
        "background": "Many of your benefit claims exclude cohabiting couples from claiming if they 'are living together as though married'.Namely pension and bereavement benefit.\r\nYou use the term to exclude benefits and to remove benefits.You can't use the same term for totally opposite reasons, and its a clear misnomer",
