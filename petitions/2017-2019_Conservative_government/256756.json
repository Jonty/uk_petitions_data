        "additional_details": "For almost three years Theresa May has failed to take the UK out of the EU and has repeatedly delayed our departure.  It is time to accept that she cannot deliver on her promise to take the country out of the EU and the task should be given to a new person who will succeed.",

She must be replaced with someone who will restore trust in our democratic institutions and heal divisions.",
