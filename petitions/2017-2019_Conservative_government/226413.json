        "action": "Extend support available for care leavers doing apprenticeships beyond 24 years",
        "additional_details": "Through maintaining contact with some care leavers I see a huge gap in supporting them appropriately into employment so that they will become financially independent and improve their personal well being in all areas. They need additional support and mentoring due the gaps and disadvantages their backgrounds have created and usually beyond the age of their peers without disadvantages. The new support available should have no upper age limit for care leavers.",
        "background": "Having worked within social care with children and families for 19 years it has saddened me that the prospects for care leavers aren't very positive. They need additional support and mentoring to access meaningful employment and often aren't ready to do this before 24 years old like their peers.",
