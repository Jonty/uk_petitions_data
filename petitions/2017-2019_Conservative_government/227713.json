What's the point in entitling employees 5.6 weeks a year but they don't get the full holidays they are entitled to. These unused holidays should be paid to employees at the end of every working year as its unfair if the employer does not usage them and in turn we lose out on what we are entitled to every year.  Scrap the \"don't use you lose\"",
        "background": "Many employees lose out of their full holiday pay mostly due to unable to take them depending on their job role. Employers are entitled to 5.6 weeks holiday a year. Sometimes requests get rejected by employers or can't use them all. All unused holiday play should be paid at end of the holiday year.",
