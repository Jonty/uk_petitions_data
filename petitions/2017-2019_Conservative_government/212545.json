        "action": "Outlaw and Abolish School Uniforms in ALL British Schools",
        "additional_details": "Schools on the Continent have much more relaxed attitudes to students' dress because they focus more on teaching the basic essential life skills. Pupils have been suspended or sent home for the most infantile of reasons, even when their motives were justifiable (health issues, too expensive, wrong size, etc.). Head teachers are acting in unprofessional capacities by abusing their power and are also technically breaking the law by denying children their right to education based on their looks.",
        "background": "Uniforms neither promote equality, nor deter bullying. They enforce blind obedience and objectify pupils as drones instead of people. They must go on the grounds of cost, health, practicality, human rights and having failed to accomplish their task. They are a form of blackmail and extortion.",
