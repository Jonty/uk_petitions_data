        "additional_details": "Hayley Green is home to Huntingtree Primary & Lutley Primary, both are in very close proximity. There is currently no 20mphr speed limit or double yellows on Huntingtree Rd nor the surrounding streets, & people attending the schools are often seen speeding, & parking dangerously. Often cars are parked opposite T-junctions, on grass verges & on corners. Children are coming to & from school surrounded by chaos, how long must we wait for these critical life saving restrictions to be put in place?",
        "background": "In March 2017 I was involved in a collision on Huntingtree Road due to a speeding vehicle and other cars parked dangerously. The impact caused my car to be written off, but thankfully nobody was seriously hurt.",
