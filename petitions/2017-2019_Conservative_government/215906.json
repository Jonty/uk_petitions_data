        "action": "We demand the new blue UK passport is made in Britain to support UK jobs",
        "additional_details": "This would not happen in France, where they produce their own passports in the interests of national security and it should not happen in the UK. De La Rue is the UK\u2019s leading security printer making bank notes as well as passports sustaining thousands of decent jobs in the UK. It is more than capable of producing the UK\u2019s post-Brexit blue passports. Ministers must not hide behind EU procurement law. It was the UK government that took this decision and the UK government that can reverse it.",
        "background": "After years of our passports being made in Britain, the government decided that the UK\u2019s new blue passport will be made in France putting hundreds of British jobs at risk. Ministers need to reverse this decision to support British business and UK workers.",
