We're not sure which aspects of the Swedish system you want to replicate.  \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nThere are already petitions about the school exam system and young people's mental health, which you might like to sign if they call for something you want to happen. You're more likely to get action on this issue if you sign and share a single petition.\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/258294\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/233631"
