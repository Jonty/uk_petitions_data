That's because there's already a student travel card, which gives a third off rail fares. You can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.16-25railcard.co.uk/student-travel-card/\r\n\r\nAnd local councils also provide subsidised concessionary fares for young people, to help with the costs of travel to and from sixth form or college. You can find out more here: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/subsidised-college-transport-16-19\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
