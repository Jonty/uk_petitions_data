        "additional_details": "Retail, construction, security and other private businesses exploit people by making them work 50-70 hours a week at basic pay rates. If you add travel time then it goes to 60-80 hours. These workers have no time left to live. They have no time for recovery or recreational activities which causes a lot of disease, unhealthy, unhappy life and environment in our society. Limits on working hours will create more jobs and will reduce unemployment.",
        "background": "We should limit working hours to 40/week to keep a work life balance. It will encourage a healthy living, most of EU countries have less working hours and better quality of life. Hours worked over 40 and weekends should be paid at double rate. Same should be applied to workers on annual pay contract",
