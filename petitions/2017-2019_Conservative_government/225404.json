        "additional_details": "Our community has been fighting this for a year and continues to object strongly. The application was rushed to full approval in 6 weeks based on incorrect details and factual errors. We were unable to organise as a community and appeal within judicial review deadlines but have continued to appeal to the local authority with no cooperation yet. Our primary concerns are traffic and health and the number of errors and inconsistencies throughout this entire approval. We want a just and fair review.",
        "background": "Planning approval for a petrol station and a fast food drive-thru was given in June 2017 in the village of Blaengwrach. Our village is in danger from traffic and fumes, and our primary school is less than 300 metres away from the site. The planning authority refuse to address any of our concerns.",
