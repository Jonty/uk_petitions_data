They do not have the right to reverse these, without the backing of those who empowered them. \r\nA General election is therefore required to either grant them support for their plans by re-election, or to remove them, based on them no longer having the support of the electorate. \r\nTheir position in parliament is to represent the people\u2019s will, not their own.",
        "background": "Members currently in parliament were elected by us the people based on their commitment to the departure of the United Kingdom from the EU. \r\nThese MP\u2019s have taken it upon themselves to discard that which they stood for, and were elected upon. \r\nThey no longer have the support of their electorate.",
