        "background": "With the sale of RAF Scampton a huge part of the RAF\u2019s history could be lost. Perhaps consider making the airfield the third site for the RAF Museum, who have been short of space for their displays for some time. Perhaps a joint venture with moving the BBMF to the site could kick start a museum?",
