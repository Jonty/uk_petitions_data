Many of these groups travel far and wide to confront and try to bring these people to justice. They are being let down by the lack of punishment handed out. The physical and mental harm brought about by these predators on these children should be deemed as a offence more punishable than that of other that carry mandatory sentences.",

With the majority able to walk free and reofend and risk to destroy more childrens lives. The harm these actions causes and the length of suffering is significent enough to warrant a mandatory prison sentence.",
