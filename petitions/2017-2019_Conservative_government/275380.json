        "additional_details": "17.4 million voted for Brexit and their voice is being ignored by a social elite that think they know better. A general election is the only way for this maligned majority to make it's views clear again and to deliver a Government with a majority sufficient for getting the job done.  Delaying an election is nothing more than an attempt to sustain the politics of protest and uncertainty in hopes that the public pendulum of opinion will swing in favour of its perpetrators.",
        "background": "MPs' are working against the outcome of the 2016 referendum on leaving the EU & claim this is in the name of the people and democracy. Ignoring the result of the 2016 referendum is patently undemocratic. The best test of the will of the people would be a general election held before the end of 2019.",
