        "additional_details": "There are many documented cases. As the Author of the Falklands 35 blog  just this week someone claimed to have served in the Falklands with a unit when they had not. Some people have even had newspapers cover their 'false; service.\r\n This is a huge insult to those who have. Many of these people do it for personal gain as in just attention but some actually dupe the general public into parting with hard earned cash. Let us stand together and make it a criminal offence as it is in other countries.",
