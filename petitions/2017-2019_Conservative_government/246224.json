        "additional_details": "To be incapacitated by the enormity of the problem is not an option.\r\nAn urgent start needs to be made at the highest possible level.\r\nRecycling does not fully engage with the problem.\r\nPhased legislation will seek to decrease the impact on product-associated livelihoods.\r\nPlastic supermarket bags, 6 pack carrier rings, toothbrushes, lighters, earbuds, flip flops, dental floss, milk bottles and chemical absorbent nappies causing so much damage can be rapidly legislated out of existence. I call on parliament to effect this as a matter of urgency.",
        "background": "Seeing the devastation wreaked by plastic in the sea and on beaches and the sea life that use those environments, a start needs to be made somewhere at high level to curtail and prevent the destruction of these delicate habitats and the life they support for future generations to enjoy.",
