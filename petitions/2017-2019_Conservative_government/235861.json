As any idea that can be seen as contradictory to others beliefs can cause disharmony and could cause a backlash against the petitioner it is the duty of the Government to protect an individuals right to privacy. Not allowing for anonymous petitions will inevitably put certain people off of creating a petition and as such is an infringement on their rights to both privacy and free speech.",
        "background": "There is a problem with forcing people who create petitions to use their name to identify themselves as the creator of the petition. There is no need to identify the person who created a petition and there should be an option for such individuals to remain anonymous.",
