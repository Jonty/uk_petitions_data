It should NOT be on the underside of packaging, only visible when you open the lid/film.\r\n- Vague. Some products have the recycling logo, but with no recycling codes (1/PET, 2/HDPE, 3/PVC, 4/LDPE, 5/PP, 6/PS, 7/other). Some don't specify the recycling info of each material used.\r\n\r\n*www.recycle-more.co.uk",
