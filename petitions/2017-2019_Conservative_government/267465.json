So that essential supplies reach all there must be provision for rationing and regulated supply from 1 November onwards. So little time remaining, this must be put in place without delay.",
        "background": "In the event of a no-deal Brexit food supplies cannot be guaranteed and food shortages are certain to occur. This will cause civic unrest, food riots etc. Ration books must be prepared for issue, and allowances for important goods must be determined. Less than four months remain.",
