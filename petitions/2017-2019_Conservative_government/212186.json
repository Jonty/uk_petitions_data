        "additional_details": "The strike is happening at a critical time in the academic year and has significant implications on the successful progress of all university students across the UK. Hence, we, the university students from across the country, propose the following to the UK government: \r\n\r\nIntervene to reverse the decision by Universities UK to cut lecturers\u2019 pensions \r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\nIntervene to ensure that students affected by the strike will be compensated by the 61 universities for every contact hour missed",
        "background": "Lecturers' pension cuts are being protested in a 14 day strike by the University and College Union (UCU). The planned strike will adversely affect students between February 22nd and March 16th 2018 as all lectures will be cancelled and not re-scheduled. We hope for a mutually beneficial solution.",
