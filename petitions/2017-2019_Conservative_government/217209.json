        "additional_details": "It is a well known fact that children don\u2019t show symptoms/traits in school due to the overwhelming environment. It\u2019s quite common that the child will become nonverbal and follow his/her peers which results in them bottling up all there stress/frustration and anxiety until home time when he/she are in a place they feel comfortable and safe and this is when they are most likely to have a meltdown/sensory overload. They say it\u2019s always down to parenting but it is not the case. This needs to change.",
        "background": "We believe children in the uk are being ignored as professionals are only interested in children\u2019s behaviour in school. It is not right that a child\u2019s final diagnosis is made on the observation of a teacher/school who only sees that child in school time.",
