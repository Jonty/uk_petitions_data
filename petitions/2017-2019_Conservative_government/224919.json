They aren't a reality for us care workers. \r\nWe don't have a good night's sleep we are always using a listening ear, to make sure the vulnerable people we care for are safe and well throughout the night. \r\nWe get woken up during the night, may it be the service user making noise or calling us. \r\nWe cannot leave the premises at all. This is working. We are among the lowest paid professions in the UK yet we keep our clients alive daily. We deserve better, we deserve to be valued.",
        "background": "After 2 employment tribunals a compliance scheme was set up to ensure carers got the back pay they so deserve. \r\nThe court of appeal today judged in favour of The Royal Mencap society. This now means hard working, low paid carers are not entitled to millions of pounds of backpay for sleep in shifts.",
