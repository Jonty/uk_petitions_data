        "additional_details": "In additional to the mechanics of loot boxes, video games are using additional methods to incentivise their purchases by tying them into core game mechanics - Star Wars Battlefront II progression, Call of Duty WWII showing other player's rewards, free crates to trigger the addictive nature of opening the boxes.\r\n\r\nWithout regulations in place, loot boxes will continue to appear in games aimed at children - to develop their addiction from a young age, causing harm to their developments.",
        "background": "Loot boxes are containers of in-game items purchased through in-game currencies or real money. The items in the containers are entirely random, meaning players can only purchase chances of receiving desired items. This is a form of gambling if the items are physical, they should be in games too.",
