        "additional_details": "A study for the British Heart Foundation found smokers to disappear up to 4x/day for 10min each time. That's 40min of extra break time/day for smokers to relax and socialize. Just because non-smokers don't have a specific need to take a break doesn't mean they should be deprived of this option. They could, for example, go outside to do the most smoking-resembling action: blowing bubbles. These optional breaks for non-smokers should be enforced globally to fight the discrimination facing them.",
        "background": "Smokers get to take more breaks at work than non-smokers, especially in stressful jobs. Many employers set informal smoking policies, allowing for smokers to have many short breaks in a day on top of their scheduled breaks. This is unjust towards non-smoker employees, who should get equal treatment.",
