For example, equal pay for work of equal value, parental leave, anti-harassment laws, properly paid holiday rights, working time and important features of our anti-discrimination provisions, including on pregnancy and maternity, have been introduced/substantially developed by the EU. To protect our hard-won rights, we must be given the chance to vote on the final deal.",

This poses a real risk to people from all walks of life.",
