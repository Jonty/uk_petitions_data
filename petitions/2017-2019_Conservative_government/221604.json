        "additional_details": "Several headlines over the last two weeks highlighting increased fuel prices, which drivers will feel. Petrol and diesel prices increased more in May 2018 than at any other point in the last 18 years, according to a new analysis.\r\nA record 6p per litre was added to the price of fuel last month. A poll of over 17,000 motorists discovered rising fuel prices forced 15% of people to spend less time driving and 8% cut back on spending in other areas, while 14% had done both. The cost needs to reduce.",
        "background": "Fuel increases are once again being blamed on the rising cost of oil, exchange rates negatively affecting wholesale oil trade for UK consumers. However this is not a reflection of profit being made by fuel companies, on the balance of their overheads vs profits, why are we paying their fuel duty?",
