        "additional_details": "Even those who arriving this month for three year undergraduate courses will be exempt from this new law and given just 4 months to find a job should they wish to remain in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis can often add a great deal of pressure to students who have made the UK their home and sets us far behind other countries like Australia, Canada and USA.\r\n\r\nChanging this law would offer employers more graduates to choose from and also vastly increase the chances of these students who have spent tens of thousands.",
        "background": "Today it has been announced that (from next year onwards) international students coming to the UK to study at undergraduate level or higher, will be eligible to work here for at least two years after their course ends. Current students however, get only four months.",
