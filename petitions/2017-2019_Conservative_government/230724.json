        "additional_details": "Margaret Thatcher has always been seen by the masses as a person that single handedly shut down British industry and caused more poverty and hardship in the general population. Her actions in office put her more in line with the likes of a mediaeval monarch then a person representing the general populations will and well-being.",
        "background": "The new \u00a350 note should feature a popular and significant person and not such a divisive figure as Margaret Thatcher who is fundamentally disliked by so many people. To place her image on the new \u00a350 note would be a flagrant disregard for the strong feelings of the Citizens of Great Britain.",
