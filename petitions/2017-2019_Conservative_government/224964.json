        "action": "Stop the Brexit White Paper. This is not what we voted for in the referendum.",
        "additional_details": "Theresa May presents this White Paper as if she has kept within her \"red lines\" on taking back control of the UK\u2019s laws, borders and money but in fact she has crossed them all. This Association Agreement is not a bespoke trading arrangement with the EU but one that the EU already uses as a precursor to greater integration and full membership. The Common Rulebook is just another way of saying that Britain will continue to follow EU rules and therefore the ECJ will still reign supreme. Stop it now",
        "background": "This White Paper is a bad deal for Great Britain and will see the UK effectively still in the EU but with no say. There are now no true Brexiteers left in the cabinet to stop the PM from offering the EU this White Flag. The only way to stop this proposal is to register your opposition by voting.",
