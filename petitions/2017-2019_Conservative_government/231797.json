        "additional_details": "People negatively impacted by fire works include: people with hearing disabilities such as hearing loss, tinnitus, hyperacusis.  People suffering with anxiety disorders including PTSD/PTS.  Pets and wild animals. Its time the antiquated celebration of bombfire night started to consider the more vulnerable among society. Banning public use will limit the noise to shows that commonly last a couple of hours. This will solve problems for all the above as they can take precautions for this short time",
        "background": "Every year 100,000s of people around the country are negatively impacted by fireworks. Only allowing fireworks at public events will allow these people to greatly limit that impact as they can prepare for the 1-2 hours of the shows. This is currently impossible with public sale and use of fireworks.",
