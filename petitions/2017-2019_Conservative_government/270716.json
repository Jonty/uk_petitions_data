        "action": "Block travel/trade with Brazil until Bolsonaro has secure environmental policies",
        "additional_details": "UK/brazilian trade was worth \u00a36 billion last year, and the majority of Bolsonaro's votes in the 2018 election came from rich income cities. These rich voters are much more likely to visit England and Europe and will be outraged if they are not allowed to do so. By targeting Bolsonaro's voters, they will force him to shift his environmental policies. The UK government should use their world influence and the EU to sanction Brazil's actions. The Amazon is for everyone, not the few elites.",
        "background": "The UK has declared a climate emergency, meaning we must take action protecting the environment. Without the Amazon Rainforest the war against climate change is lost. I call on the British Government to openly condemn Bolsonaro's environmental policies and begin economic and travel sanctions.",
