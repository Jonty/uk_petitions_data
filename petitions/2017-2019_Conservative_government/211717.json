        "additional_details": "Insurance should be based on the amount of claims and crashes had not simply your age and location, this is ageism? Charging at least \u00a3400 a month purely as I am young when anyone else is maximum \u00a3400 a year. Very discriminatory, why allow young people to pass their test if you will make it impossible for everything else?",
        "background": "Young drivers in London are looking at spending at least \u00a3400 a month to insure any type of car just due to the fact they are young. I understand it should be a little more as they have recently got their licence but not as extortionate as it is.",
