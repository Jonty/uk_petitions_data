        "additional_details": "The UK has invoked the \u201creligious exemption\u201d from the EU\u2019s \u201cslaughter directive\u201d and now carries out more halal slaughter than the rest of Europe. Normally, Halal meat is to be killed by hand and must be blessed by the slaughterman. The exception from EU law allows animals to be slaughtered without being pre-stunned. We believe everyone should know which meat has been religiously slaughtered before making an informed decision wether to buy or not.",
        "background": "Everyday, millions of people are unknowingly buying & eating religiously slaughtered meat in British supermarkets & shops. We demand ALL Halal & Kosher meat must be clearly labelled on the front of its packaging.",
