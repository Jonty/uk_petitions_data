        "action": "Change the issue of prison systems not working by expanding rehabilitation.",
        "additional_details": "Many prisons are also corrupt as it can show up that up to 5 officers in every prison result in becoming corrupted. They tend to smuggle in phones and drugs. In some circumstances, weapons have also been smuggled in. Also, short sentences can be a problem. prisoners with long sentences have a longer rehabilitation time than the criminals with shorter sentences. This means that shorter sentences either need to be made longer, or, after release, an extended rehabilitation time should be given.",
        "background": "Action is needed because it is an underlining issue in society and it is made clear that many criminals reoffend. Around 47% of all criminals leaving prison reoffend within a year. This clearly shows how the prison system does not work. 70% of under 18s also reoffend within 12 months.",
