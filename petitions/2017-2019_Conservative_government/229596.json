Those opposing the motion can feel disenfranchised, as there is no immediate way for them to register their opposition.\r\n\\\\\r\nElectronic/online mechanisms are particularly susceptible to this problem: for example, YouTube is one of the few such where both types of \"vote\" are collected - too often, only a \"like\" option is offered.",
        "background": "Frequently, petitions and similar are reported as having collected so many thousand votes. This only represents one side: without knowing how strong the opposing feeling is, the true public opinion can be misreported - and, decision-makers can be pushed into actions the majority don't actually want.",
