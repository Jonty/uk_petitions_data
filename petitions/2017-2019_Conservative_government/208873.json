        "additional_details": "One of his less explicit tweets reads \"@alexcstallings Thanks. Personally, I'm a fan of Gail's boobs\", this is one of a vast number of tweets. Young has since apologised for his comments, but an apology forced out of duty that comes with his new position. He did not apologies because he felt a moral duty to do so. University students, and people in general, must be taught that misogyny and homophobia are not to be tolerated. This is not a message that Young's appointment shows.",
        "background": "Vulgar comments made by Toby Young have recently come to light. As a student intent on going to university this year, I do not feel that his position on the board is appropriate. His position sends the message to students sexism and homophobia are tolerable and do not evoke repercussions.",
