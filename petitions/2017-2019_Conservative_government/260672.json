        "action": "The NHS should not charge it's staff to use the carpark.",
        "additional_details": "Enforcement of parking has increasingly led to fines. These fines, along with the parking charges, are a huge drain in the low salaries of NHS staff. These people deserve to be able to park for free when they are going about their duties in work time.\r\n\r\nI propose that hospital staff be exempt from parking charges and parking fines and that hospital governors are prevented from subsidising budgets and facilities by collecting money from staff.",
        "background": "Nurses and other hospital staff are typically charged a monthly fee to use the carpark. Since driving to work is necessary for almost everyone, this has become an extra form of taxation on the lowest paid staff.",
