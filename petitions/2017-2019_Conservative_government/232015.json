        "additional_details": "There are many companies who train dogs to become emotional support dogs, however without the right to public access, they are not of much use to people suffering outside of the home. Many people with these conditions also suffer from agoraphobia - severe anxiety when leaving the house. Without public access rights, service dogs cannot support those struggling outside of the home. Because of this, people won\u2019t leave their homes, worsening their condition.\r\nPsychiatric dogs deserve access rights.",
        "background": "I firmly believe that animals, particularly dogs have an extremely therapeutic effect on those affected by severe and enduring mental health issues, and unlike other forms of assistance dogs, psychiatric assistant/service dogs do not currently have public access rights.",
