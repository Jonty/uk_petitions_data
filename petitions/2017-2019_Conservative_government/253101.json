The vets in my experience were reactive rather than proactive. Had they employed foresight when I first presented Zammo's symptoms and looked at worse case scenarios instead of jumping to conclusions, his prognosis would have been better and he could have got the medication he needed much earlier.",
        "background": "As things stand you cannot sue / claim compensation for the negligent actions / misdiagnosis / short-sightedness of a vet in the UK. You can only hope to get an apology or recoup your financial loss if their missteps create pain and suffering in the animal. This needs to change.",
