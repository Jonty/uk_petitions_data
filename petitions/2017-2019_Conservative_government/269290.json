        "action": "Amend the Fixed-term Parliament Act 2011",
        "additional_details": "Jonathan Sumption, a former supreme court judge, said [a PM] Johnson would be entitled to stay on as prime minister even if he lost a confidence vote.  As a result it is possible, for example, for the prime minister to set the date of a subsequent election for after 31 October, following the UK\u2019s departure from the EU with or without a deal. This effectively removes the ability of Parliament to legislate as it wishes to and repeal a law that it made.",
        "background": "The act diminishes the sovereignty of Parliament.  It is unreasonable that the Fixed-term Parliaments Act does not require a prime minister to resign immediately following a vote of no confidence and serves as an obstacle to Parliament's ability to legislate as it wishes.",
