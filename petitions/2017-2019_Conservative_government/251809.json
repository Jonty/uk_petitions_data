        "additional_details": "It is clear that the 1st Referendum was seen by many as a protest vote against the government. Polling and anecdotal evidence shows that many people either regret not voting in the first Referendum, or regret not voting at all. Referendum results reflect the information available at the time and the way it is presented - to not update beliefs based on new information is completely irrational. Now we know the deal on offer, the only democratic option is a second vote.",
        "background": "The recent petition to revoke Article 50 reached 6m signatures and shows the strong support for remaining. However, to cancel Brexit without a 2nd vote would also hurt democracy. Two years ago nobody knew what Brexit really meant since the campaigns were full of misinformation and bias.",
