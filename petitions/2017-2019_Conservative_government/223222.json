        "additional_details": "I don\u2019t see why the exam can\u2019t be an open book exam. As students we have to revise for other exams and we will have exam stress and the fact that our English Literature exam is a closed book exam will just build onto that exam stress. It is not fair that the old GCSE system was open book but now it is not. How will a closed book exam be beneficial? Why do you think a closed book exam is better than an open book one? What is the point of a closed book English Literature exam? It is more like testing our memory rather than our knowledge.",
        "background": "Now in the English Literature exam, GCSE students are expected to memorise quotes from 15 poems and memorise the themes of a play, the roles of the characters and quotes from the characters and the plot of the play. This is all for one exam.",
