        "additional_details": "The simplest solution is a single confirmatory referendum asking the people to rank the following choices from 1 (best) to 3 (worst):\r\nA. No deal brexit\r\nB. Brexit with the current deal inc. the backstop\r\nC. Remain (Revoke article 50)\r\nThen we:\r\ni. Compare all the 1s for point C with the total 1s for points A&B combined. The highest score would answer question 1.\r\nii. Add up the total score for points A&B only. The lowest score would answer question 2.\r\nThis would then be the people's choice on brexit.",
        "background": "The first thing we need to do before we decide who's best to lead this country is to answer these two brexit questions:\r\n\r\n1. Do we still want to leave the EU?\r\nand\r\n2. If we still want to leave, then do we want the deal on the table or no deal?",
