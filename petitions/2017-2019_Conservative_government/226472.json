In serious cases, the Court of Protection already has the power to cancel a lasting power of attorney or an enduring power of attorney.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nIf you are concerned that an attorney or deputy is making decisions that aren\u2019t in the best interests of the person they\u2019re responsible for, you can report it to the Office of the Public Guardian.
