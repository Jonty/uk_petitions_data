        "additional_details": "There are three formats of the game recognised by the International Cricket Council - Test, 50-over and 20-over. In order to launch the new competition, the ECB has announced that the domestic 50-over competition will be downgraded to a \"development competition\". However, this format is a World Cup format that England is about to host, and is a popular tournament with the existing fanbase. There are no sensible projections or customer-led desire for a replacement competition.",
        "background": "The county cricket structure in England and Wales is fundamental to the success of the game. The ECB's proposed new competition sets up an entirely new club structure in direct competition with its existing product set. We the fans have no confidence in the direction of the current administration.",
