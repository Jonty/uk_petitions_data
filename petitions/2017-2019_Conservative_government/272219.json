        "additional_details": "An example would be Anna Soubry. She stood as a Conservative candidate, stated clearly that she will uphold the Brexit referendum and thus got elected in Broxtowe. After being elected, she changed her decision and left the Conservative Party to form her own party with several other MPs. Their new manifesto contradicted the manifesto she was stood for election with. This clearly means that her promises will have changed but she hasn't received a mandate from her electorate. That's undemocratic!",
        "background": "In the last couple of years, MPs have changed party to reflect their own personal political beliefs without the consent of the electorate they represent. The manifesto they stood on, that people will have voted for, will therefore change and thus the mandate given by the people should be revoked.",
