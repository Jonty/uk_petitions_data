        "additional_details": "The mayor of London defended his decision to allow protesters to fly a giant \u201cTrump baby\u201d blimp over the city during President Donald Trump\u2019s visit, saying disagreement was part of a fundamental freedom.\r\n\r\nSadiq Khan should represent London and not just those of his faith.   Media coverage is extensive but indicates the actions of the mayor of London are not befitting of someone holding that position.\r\n\r\nLondon is the capital of the UK.   Therefore, this stunt is representing the UK.",
        "background": "Sadiq Khan disagrees with some of President Donald Trumps policies. \r\nThere are proper political avenues by which such matters should be dealt with.   Trump is no angel, however,  by supporting the childish Trump inflatable stunt,  the mayor of London is not representing everyone as he should be.",
