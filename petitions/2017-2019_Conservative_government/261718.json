        "action": "Confront the US on banning abortions in cases of abnormality, rape and incest.",
        "additional_details": "The 6 week limit applied in other areas means that a woman could have only had a late period by 2 weeks, and the majority are unlikely to assume they are pregnant! Abortion shouldn't be the primary means of contraception, but it needs to be readily and safely available, and it is our responsibility to confront the USA on this. Also, women who have been raped, whose foetus is a product of incest are required to bring their baby to term. How are we improving women's rights when we are regressing?",
        "background": "The widspread banning of abortions in the USA is extremely concerning, this is unconstitutional and contravenes the rights of women; where predominatly male senators are making huge decisions about women's bodies.",
