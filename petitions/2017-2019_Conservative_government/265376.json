If a 16 year old is the age where you can legally leave education for full-time work, get married and have children then surely they should be offered the exact minimum wage as someone who is older.\r\n\r\nAllowing employees to offer wage near half of the 25yr old age gap, allows those to exploit children to complete the same level work, for less payout.\r\n\r\nThe system needs to change under The Equality Act 2010 how does this protect young adults?",
        "background": "Why should individuals aged under 18 earn \u00a34.20 meanwhile those 25 and over are earning \u00a37.83\r\n\r\nI think it is time the government focused on a minimum wage for everyone no matter the age and/or gender and that minimum should fall under once value.",
