        "additional_details": "As a British citizen we are already hampered and restricted on who we can marry and bring back to the UK with recent law changes. Living overseas in a calm but unstable country and married to a Chinese lady for 16yrs European citizenship allows us the right to travel into Europe (not the Uk) in the event of termoil. By relinquishing my EU status I would have to choose between leaving my wife to protect herself and protecting my children who are British citizens. British law does not recognise a family unit",
