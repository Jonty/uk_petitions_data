        "additional_details": "We as a Nation had a long struggle, lasting hundreds of years, since the Magna Carta, to get the right to vote, and supported the rights of other people in other countries to also have that right. We do not meekly accept the government's attempt to take that right from us. Most adults, those over voting age do not have a driving licence  and many do not have a current passport. If this requirement becomes law then people would have to pay to vote, meaning that the poorest, those who cannot afford a car, or chose not to drive and those who's finances were controled by someone else would lose their voting right. Please sign this petition to preserve every elegible person's righ to vote.",
