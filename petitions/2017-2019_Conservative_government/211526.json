        "additional_details": "The discrimination also occurs in recruitment, where it has a big impact. There is significant research that backs up the fact people over 55 (and especially women) are less likely to get job interviews than younger people.\r\n\r\nMany older workers are forced to become self-employed and find contract work to make ends meet when they would prefer to find a permanent job.\r\n\r\nReporting on mean, median and hiring ratios vs applicants would ensure less bias.",
        "background": "The UK government predicts that by 2020 a third of workers will be over the age of 50 and by 2039 the state pension age will be 68. Yet despite our ageing workforce, discrimination against older workers is a problem that is likely to worsen.",
