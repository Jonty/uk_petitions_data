        "additional_details": "Although illegal, just to use a hypothetical situation, a person should be able to walk down the street naked if they want to,without fear of rape or sexual assault. Whether a victim is wearing minimal clothing, or fully clothed, this is not a reason to be raped and is in no way the victims fault. There is never any excuse for rape, whether someone gets into your bed by accident while sleep walking for example, that is still not an excuse for rape. The attacked is the only person at fault",
        "background": "What a women or man was wearing before being raped should have zero bearing on them being the victim of sexual assault/rape. This is not a question of \u2018asking for it\u2019, this is about the attackers  own self control, never the victims",
