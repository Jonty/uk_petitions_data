        "additional_details": "Many Young People feel ignored and abandoned.  Most Young People have no electoral voice.  Every civilisation must protect and educate it\u2019s Young People for the future.  Increased efforts and funding are being spent on very young children and pre-school education, which is wonderful, but we must not abandon our children when they become teenagers.  If we do, they form their own groups and gangs.\r\n\r\nThe Youth Service and Youth Clubs need to be restored and future funding protected by legislation.",
        "background": "The recent increase in knife crime and stabbings is evidence that young people are not being engaged and guided.  Funding for Youth Services needs to be a legislative, not discretionary responsibility for all councils.   Youth Services have been cut and Youth Clubs closed all over the country.",
