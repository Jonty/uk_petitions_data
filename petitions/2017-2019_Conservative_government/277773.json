It's blatant profitering by the airlines and out of sinc with other supplies of services and products who allow cancellations and refunds with no questions asked.",
        "background": "For example, it's impossible to cancel flights or flight add-ons with Ryanair. Any changes cost \u00a345.00 plus the cost of the new flight if it's more expensive. It may be sensible to attach conditions to this option like a \u00a31.00 cancellation fee or having to give at least 24 hours notice to be fair",
