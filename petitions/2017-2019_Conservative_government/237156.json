To be offered this, the person often has to go through a long process that involves in depth access to their medical history. \r\n\r\nThe questions asked in applications can extend back to adolescence and can be triggering or insensitive - guidelines are needed.",

Additionally,  the questions asked are often triggering.\r\n\r\nThis should be given more legal protection under the Equality Act.",
