        "action": "Limit the use of coercive practices in mental health that harm the patient",
        "additional_details": "The current practice of psychiatry is almost exclusively based on a biochemical model. The outcome of this is that medication is seen as the only credible resort when treating patients suffering from psychotic illness and any other therapy is seen as supportive. When patients suffer side effects they are seen as non-compliant and when they stop medication they are placed on CTOs. This makes it impossible for patients to escape the mental health system or be educated to alternative options.",
        "background": "The purpose of this petition is to start a debate about the coercive practises used openly, freely and extensively in current psychiatry. This includes importantly physical or chemical restraint, forced medication and more subtle forms of coercion which blatantly disregard human rights of patients.",
