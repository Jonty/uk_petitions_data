        "additional_details": "Many ring sports have a governing body to protect industry members and trainees alike, by adopting measures to make sure trainers have had thorough DBS checks particularly before being allowed to work with children. All young men and women should be able to find a safe place to follow their dreams and I urge the UK government to introduce measures to regulate who is allowed to teach the new generation of British wrestlers. Too many children have suffered already. This should not be tolerated.",
        "background": "Recently, names of a small minority of trainers, event promoters and wrestlers in the UK wrestling industry have allegedly abused their power to commit sexual assault, harassment, grooming and rape of underage wrestling trainees and others involved in the wrestling industry.",
