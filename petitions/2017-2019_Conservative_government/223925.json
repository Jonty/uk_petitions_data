        "additional_details": "In our modern day of technology wasting precious educational time and taxpayers money to teach religion is outdated. Any teenager has access to the internet where they can learn about any religion to their hearts content. Instead with this time we can introduce teens to basic level psychology. To get children asking questions, growing their knowledge on issues and learning how to deal them. Many time it takes humans a while to learn about themselves so the more headstart we can give the better.",

Mental health effects everybody either directly or indirectly and it is our duty to make sure children are given the tools needed to deal with these issues.",
