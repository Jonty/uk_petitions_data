        "action": "Lower the insurance cost for young drivers on cars and Vans",
        "additional_details": "Too many young drivers have to pay over the odds with cars or Vans compared to older people, which can be more of a risk on the road. Owning a van at such a young age I been wrongly overcharged, and received no help when I needed my car insurance. It's time to change this, its time to help young people and encourage them, instead of seeing it as an opportunity to make more money.",
        "background": "After going from paying \u00a3870 for car insurance in my second year I purchased a van to aid me in my work. The insurance cost shot up to \u00a32300, plus another \u00a3420 after a woman in her 60's reversed into me. although the accident was not my fault it has massively affected my price.",
