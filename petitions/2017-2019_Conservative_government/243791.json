        "additional_details": "Fishermen will hack the fins off living sharks and simply throw the rest of their bodies overboard, allowing them to bleed to death. \r\n\r\nSinking fin-less, slowly to the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nShark finning is a wasteful, barbaric practice, but it also has a devastating impact on our oceans.\r\n\r\nThe use of these atrocious practices in the name of archaic traditions and cultures, must stop. How are we to grow as a species if we continue to act like our poorly educated predecessors.\r\n\r\nWe have no excuse.",
        "background": "According to many conservative estimates from multiple sources, 100,000,000 sharks are slaughtered for their fins every year. That\u2019s roughly 274,000 sharks a day.\r\n\r\nThat's nearly double the population of the UK - Dying every year.\r\n\r\nWe need regulations now, to protect these species imperil.",
