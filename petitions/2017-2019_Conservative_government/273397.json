        "action": "Lower the voting age to 16 for the next referendum about membership of the EU",
        "additional_details": "Staying in the EU, or leaving it, is NOT a political party issue.  All of the political parties have a variety of views about what is needed. When the United Kingdom (NOT Britain, as implied by 'Brexit') joined the 'Common Market' it was to promote trade. Since then, the European Union has developed politically as well as commercially. There are good arguments for both staying and for remaining, and the people who are going to be most affected should be entitled to a say in their future.",
        "background": "The 'Brexit' vote will affect people for the rest of their lives.  The young will be affected over their lifespan more than their elders. This was recognised in the referendum for Scottish Independence, when the voting age was reduced to 16. The young of the whole of the UK should now have a say.",
