        "additional_details": "Whilst reducing plastic packaging in our supermarkets is a mayor breakthrough for plastic pollution and our marine environment, a area that is not receiving as much publicity is the excessive plastic that is supplied and placed on the shelves to stack the product. After careful observations were conducted this appeared to be a huge problem and blame game as to who is at fault began. Alternative materials need to be used during transit, refusal and free stacking needs to be the primary option",
        "background": "A area that is not receiving as much publicity amongst many issues right now is the excessive plastic that is been received from suppliers upon delivery to our supermarkets and then placed on the shelves to stack the product. Free stacking could avoid this.",
