        "additional_details": "The media report on decisions that are being made and many decisions that are not being made because of confusion and lack of time. Important issues about the good governance of the country are being neglected and there appears to be only one issue at the moment that is being attended to. There is now concern whether decisions being made within parliament are constitutional or even legal and other decisions may well be made by judges, rather than parliamentarians.  We deserve better than this.",
        "background": "We suspect that like many voting citizens of this country we are frustrated, bemused, confused and angry at the lack of cohesion and shared vision that parliament is currently showing about issues it is dealing with. Attitudes and opinions appear to change from day to day resulting in utter chaos!",
