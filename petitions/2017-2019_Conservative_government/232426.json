I will not claim that this advert is not political, but it stretches across party lines, so why should it not go on the air.Is it because it brings light to a political issue, and might change the way people behave. since when was this a bad thing? please, sign this petition\r\nGreen Peace is involved with the advert, if you don't like them, fair enough, i don't like them either, but still sign.",
