        "additional_details": "There is a potential conflict of interest regarding her role as legislator and income from legal cannabis cultivation that her family currently profits from, this is the reason behind her recusing herself.  Both this potential conflict of interest and the inability of \"The Drugs Minister\" to discuss these drugs at all clearly demonstrate she is incapable of delivering the job she is paid for and the country cannot remain confident in this ministers decision making.",
        "background": "The current Drugs Minister has again had to recuse herself from discussions regarding cannabis, this being the most widely used illicit drug in the UK. There is significant concern regarding this drug across the country.  If the minister cannot discuss this issue then she cannot deliver her role.",
