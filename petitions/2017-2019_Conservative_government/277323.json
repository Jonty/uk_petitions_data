Democracy must be dynamic or it ceases to be democracy as facts emerge and change. Leaving would be temporary due to Leave and Remain voter's age profiles, so not worth suffering x years of adversity. Signatories: Sign if you agree with the analysis. If government refuse to act, find more signatories. The more who sign it, the more likely MP's will act.",

It did not mention leaving the Single Market and Customs Union so is not a mandate to do so. This result was CONTRIVED by withholding facts, misleading statements and encouraged misconceptions and more",
