        "action": "Make British sign language a compulsory subject in education nationwide",
        "additional_details": "In the UK there are 11 million people who are deaf or hard of hearing. 151,000 us BSL, and 87,000 are deaf. People are often unaware of when a person is deaf and do not know how to communicate with hard of hearing/deaf people. BSL is an option in few schools but should be part of the curriculum. Please support this petition as this may one day affect someone you are close to, and it is fair that 11 million people should not be sectioned off from society because of hearing difficulties.",
        "background": "After taking British Sign Language as a GCSE/BTEC option, I discovered it wasn\u2019t widely popular and encouraged in schools. When hearing the difficulties that deaf/hard of hearing people can face daily due to not many people knowing how to sign, it tells us we should take action.",
