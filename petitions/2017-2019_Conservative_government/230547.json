        "background": "Too many private car parks (eg supermarkets) are employing private companies to control the use of their car park and charging extortionate parking charges for minor breaches whereby in many instances the recipient of the PCN was unaware they were even in breach of the 'so called' parking contract.",

However, we are not sure how exactly you want this to work. For example, whether it would be a first warning for each specific offence or for each private operator.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling on the UK Government to regulate parking charges across England if that is something you would like to see happen."
