The government should not have allowed parliment votes & to frustrate the EU leaving process. They have no legal right to try & remove no deal. We the electorate voted to leave, article 50 was triggered & that means we leave the EU on the 29th March, with or without a deal.",
        "background": "The referendum decision was to Leave the EU. No deal is the default legally. The House of Commons speakers biased acts & remain MPs have scuppered the process unduly & the government changed the rules without a mandate from the electorate. Review if this is legal & stop this abuse of power now.",
