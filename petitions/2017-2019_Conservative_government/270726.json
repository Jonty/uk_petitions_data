        "additional_details": "Today the leaders of the opposition parties agreed a way to block no-deal. By blocking no deal, this means the EU has NO incentive to negotiate a better deal than Theresa May's awful deal, which has been thrown out of parliament twice! Therefore meaning we will be in deadlock again! This deadlock will bring about a 2nd referendum which is exactly what remain MPs want.\r\n\r\nWe have to leave on 31st October 2019 with or without a deal to honour the historic peoples vote and to honour our democracy!",
        "background": "On the 23rd June 2016 (3 years and 2 months ago) the UK voted to leave the EU in one of the biggest voting turnouts in history. David Cameron promised an IN/OUT, \"No Ifs, No Buts\" referendum and parliment agreed. Now the remain majority 486/650 of MPs are trying to block no deal and brexit itself!",
