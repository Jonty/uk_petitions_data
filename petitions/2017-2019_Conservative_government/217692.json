They're unwilling to listen to public opinion, and seem intent on following the coattails of the Trump administration. Not only do we not fund our services adequately, and we find funds for war, but if we blindly follow the USA, then it is likely future trade deals will be conducted without public interest as priority. We need UK leaders who have integrity and patience, and who desire to build a country of peace and prosperity.",
        "background": "Following the current administration's response in Syria, and following the USA in their desire for an escalation of war, it is clear that they are not capable of running our country. They act with impunity, denying the need for debate, or to await for proper investigations.",
