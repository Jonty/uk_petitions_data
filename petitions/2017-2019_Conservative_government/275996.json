All shareholders of newspapers should be expected to pay tax with no avoidance whatsoever.\r\nThe British press is already least trusted in the EU: https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/survey-finds-that-uk-written-press-is-by-some-way-the-least-trusted-in-europe/\r\nIf this petition becomes law, this will go a long way into remedying that.",
        "background": "Currently, the owners of our newspapers use aggressive tax avoidance schemes. Newspapers already have 0% VAT rate. This is an extremely serious conflict of interest as newspapers will avoid reporting tax avoidance by large multinationals and extremely wealthy individuals, including themselves.",
