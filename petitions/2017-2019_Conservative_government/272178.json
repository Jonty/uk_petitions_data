The only thing they want to do is keep kicking the can down the road with extension upon extension. It is clear at this point that they have sat too long for any good they have been doing lately. Dissolve Parliament and let us have done with them. In the name of God, go!",
        "background": "Parliament has rejected all options put to it in regards to Brexit - deal, no deal, no Brexit, and another referendum. It is quite clear at this point that this body is not capable of action, and new leadership is needed. Dissolve Parliament and let us choose another one.",
