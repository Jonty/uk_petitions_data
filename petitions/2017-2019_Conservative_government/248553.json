        "action": "Revoke Fixed Parliament Act 2011 enacted by Conservative Gov. (David Cameron)",
        "additional_details": "We believe this to be constitutionally illegal and has allowed corruption of our democratic process.  We believe that if this Act is not revoked, it is possible for any Parliament to change the fixed period to 20 years, 50 years, forever, creating the danger of dictatorship in our Country.  We believe any Act regarding the dissolution of Parliament should also include the ability for the Electorate to dissolve Parliament under certain circumstances, such ignoring the wishes of the People in Refs",
        "background": "This Act creates a 5 year period of Government & removes the prerogative power of the Queen to dissolve Parliament.  The Fixed-term Parliaments Act was introduced to level the political playing field & strengthen the chances that the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition would survive for a full term.",
