        "action": "BAN THE MANUFACTURE & DISTRIBUTION OF NON-RECYCLABLE PLASTIC BAGS IN THE UK",
        "additional_details": "I do not feel that I need to give supporting evidence because the world has never been more engaged on the subject of plastic pollution.  BBC Blue Planet 2 has done a great deal to raise awareness about the issue but I do not feel that our UK Government is doing enough.  I have had a number of deliveries lately in recyclable packing, which begs the question why are we still manufacturing plastic non-recyclable, when we clearly don't need to?",
        "background": "This petition is to tackle the issue of plastic pollution.  After watching BBC Blue Planet 2, I have carried out a number of UK beach cleans and plastic bags are a major issue.  The threat to marine & bird life because of plastic bags is widely documented and the UK Gov needs to do more to help.",
