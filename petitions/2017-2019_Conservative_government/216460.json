        "action": "Make carrying a knife a mandatory 10 year prison sentence without exception.",
        "additional_details": "Unfortunately the majority of stabbings in the UK are carried out by gangs of teenagers. If the police had the power to stop and search anyone in groups of three or over without reason then the gangs would think twice about carrying knifes. People may believe that stop and searches without reason is a breach of human rights, however if you are doing no wrong then you would have no problem being searched, and if it saves lives then make it possible.",
        "background": "The UK has a serious knife crime problem. People are being killed everyday in this country and it needs to stop. If there is a mandatory prison sentence of 10 years for carrying a knife, no if's, no but's, no excuses, then maybe this would deter the carrying and use of these deadly weapons.",
