        "additional_details": "Jeremy Hunt has suggested that if he becomes PM he will cancel all August leave for civil servants, people that have been dealing with the ineptitude of politicians over Brexit for years. \r\n\r\nSo it is only right that MPs sacrifice their ludicrously indulgent recess in order to make headway with preparing our country for a No-Deal Brexit, instead of passing the buck to the hardworking and highly skilled civil service that has dealt with their bungling incompetence with hitherto endless patience.",
        "background": "\"All August leave will be cancelled unless I have a signed letter from the relevant permanent secretary saying that all preparations in his or her department are on time and on track.\" Jeremy Hunt, Tory leadership contender and Foreign Secretary of HM Government",
