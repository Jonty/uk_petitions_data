        "additional_details": "The DVLA, Government, Police, Finance Companies etc., all have their own reasons and all of them can explain the current form of V5C but it does not help and it does not matter.\r\n What matters and is very important is your opinion. You, the reader, can change something for the better. Here, now! Think about you and others. Make it simple, easy and clear. Protect yourself against problems! Protect yourself from crooks and criminals, scammers and thieves! \r\n If you want an ownership title for your vehicle/motor then please, please sign this petition! Make your opinion count! Make the V5C proof of ownership!\r\nThank you",
