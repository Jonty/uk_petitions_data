It is time to show a vote of no confidence, to sweep the halls clean of MP\u2019s that clearly lack the credentials, skill and understanding to govern effectively and negotiate positive outcomes for the people of the UK while maintaining key relationships with our allies in the EU.",

From the initial stewardship of David Cameron who tabled the motion of a referendum and subsequent leadership of Theresa May to the current chaos in the House of Commons and failure to reach consensus on both sides",
