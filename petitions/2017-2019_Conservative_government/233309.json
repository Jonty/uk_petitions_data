        "action": "Bring back Asperger's Syndrome as an official diagnosis.",
        "additional_details": "I started a Facebook page in 2012 called 'Asperger's Syndrome Awareness: Bryan's Advocacy' and we have almost reached a total of 300,000 likes. Many people still support the name Asperger's Syndrome and I aim to prove this with this petition. People assume that we are more capable/less capable because of a name and it should not be that way. Having the name Asperger's Syndrome removed also makes it harder for us to describe our condition to other's.",
        "background": "Asperger's Syndrome was removed from the DSM-V diagnostic manual in 2013 and has since been referred to as 'Autism Level One'. Asperger's is a born with condition and by removing the name it removes a part of our identity. It makes awareness and understanding harder.",
