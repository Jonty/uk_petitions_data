We demand our birth centres are re-opened without delay. We understand this requires additional resources be made available for commissioning education and training for more key clinical staff within the NHS Maternity service in Devon. We ask these resources are made available as a matter of urgency.\r\nRefs: \r\nhttps://goo.gl/5uRkbB\r\nhttps://goo.gl/TcmLfn\r\nhttps://goo.gl/GR6eKH",
        "background": "Honiton & Okehampton birth centres in Devon continue to have birth services suspended due to ongoing staff issues. This means that women in labour need to travel further to reach maternity care, or wait longer while midwives travel out to them for home birth support. These are unnecessary risks.",
