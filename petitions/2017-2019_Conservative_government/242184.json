No two people are the same in the way they suffer with their mental health. \r\nSymptoms include: \r\nLow moods \r\nFeeling tearful \r\nFeeling helpless and hopeless \r\nVery low self esteem \r\nThe list goes on. \r\n\r\nToo many lives are being lost to suicide including those of children. Many are also self harming. The wait is far to long for mental health services. Some do not even have services available, this has to change.\r\n",

Even though these symptoms are not as visible as many other illnesses, they can be just as devastating. \r\nI myself suffer with severe depression,anxiety and PTSD.",
