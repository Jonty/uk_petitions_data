        "action": "Extend the Public Sector pay rise cap to MP's incl. reducing expense payments",
        "additional_details": "Despite there being a cap on public sector workers from 2010 to 2019/20, it's reported that MP's received a 1.4% increase in April 2017 having received a 10% increase less than 2 years prior. They also claim travel expenses despite many NHS workers having to pay for parking at work and the general public pay to travel to work - why should well paid MP's have all travel paid for? The Government should also invest in housing around London to house serving MP's instead of paying for London homes.",
        "background": "As Public Sector workers have a pay cap enforced on them by the Government, this should also be extended to all MP's as they in theory, work for the public.",
