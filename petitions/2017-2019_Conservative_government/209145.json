        "background": "McVey lost her previous seat in 2015 at least in part due to her previous roles at the DWP in which she heavily involved in unpopular cuts to disability benefits & the so-called bedroom tax. Rejected once by the electorate, she's an exceptionally poor choice for greater responsibility at the DWP.",
