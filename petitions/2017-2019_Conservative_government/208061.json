        "additional_details": "No one chooses to be homeless. Many people are only 1 wage away from losing their home. Mental health issues and substance abuse are often triggers that push people into homelessness. As a country Britain should show the world that it is prepared to help the vulnerable in society by providing a safe, warm bed, food and treatment for the causes of homelessness. Convicted criminals receive this so why not the homeless? Especially when many have served this country on the battlefield.",
        "background": "There are more than 9000 people living on the streets of Britain many of whom are ex military personnel. As a country with one of the largest economies in the world Britain should be ashamed that even 1 person is sleeping rough on our streets.",
