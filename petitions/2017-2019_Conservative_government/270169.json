        "additional_details": "The United Nations Populations Fund is able to distribute menstrual products to women and children in humanitarian crises and currently Scottish educational facilities such as schools and universities are giving women the access to free sanitary products for people that need them. This should be something that is spread across the UK. \r\n\r\nFor more information you can visit: \r\n\r\nMenstruation and human rights - Frequently asked questions: https://www.unfpa.org/menstruationfaq#managing%20menstruation",
        "background": "Feminine hygiene and the supply of products is a basic human right for a woman to have access to sanitary products e.g. tampons, and sanitary towels. However, in the UK, this is not the case. Currently tax is at 5%. For something that is of basic need, this does not seem acceptable or ethical.",
