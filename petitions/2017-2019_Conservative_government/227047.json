In particular, we are not clear whether you are concerned about illegal lending (\"loan sharks\") or would like the law on credit cards and pay day loans changed.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a petition to change the law around credit cards and pay day loans if that's what you would like to happen."
