Referring the culprits of hideous crime as Asian and not as their country of origin broadens the forum for accusation and stereo typical views. Chinese, Russian, Japanese and others are identified as per their country of origin and not as Asians. It is clearly unjust to categorised only Indians as Asians with one or two other minorities",
        "background": "Branding all Asian under one umbrella is rather a stereotypical view and it is clearly unjust. It could be classed as violation of human rights to classify all Asians as grooming gangs, rapist or terrorist, as the British media and the society simply addresses the culprits as Asians.",
