The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) is responsible for deciding on MPs' pay.

You could start a new petition calling for ministerial salaries to be reduced, but Ministers would still be entitled to the MPs' salary set by IPSA. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more about MPs' and Ministers' salaries here:\r\n\r\nhttp://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7762"
