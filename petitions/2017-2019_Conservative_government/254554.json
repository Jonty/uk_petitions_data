        "additional_details": "The NUB negotiates future UK-EU relations and tries to mend a fractured population. The House of Commons cannot agree on what deal it wants despite seizing control of the Executive's business. The democratic majority of the People is Sovereign over Parliament with 17.4 million votes in the 2016 Referendum to leave the EU.  PM Theresa May's deal does not deliver UK control of movement, money, law, and trade. The legal default position of No Deal makes Britain a free, independent, Sovereign State.",
        "background": "Independent persons set up a NUB group of cross-party, devolved Government, great and good representatives. Power to co-opt. NUB appoints a Chief Negotiator. Two-thirds majority voting. NUB runs a Brexit Compensation Scheme to cover \"unavoidable\" loss (define) with severe penalties to deter abusers.",
