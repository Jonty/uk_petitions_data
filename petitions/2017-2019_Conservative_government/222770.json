        "action": "Improve transparency for customers booking oversold flights.",
        "additional_details": "Due to the lack of transparency customers can book additional travel arrangements connecting flights/transfers/hotels based on their assumed flight meaning that their monetary loss may be greater than the compensation offered by airline. If customers are made aware of the flight being oversold at the time of booking they can make an informed decision as to whether they want to proceed or choose another flight that may better meet their needs.",
        "background": "There is a lack of transparency from airlines with regards to the overselling of seats on aircraft which is often done at inflated rates. Airlines should be transparent that customers are being sold a \u201cstandby\u201d ticket so they can make informed decisions about their travel arrangements.",
