        "additional_details": "Unregulated cannabis grown by criminal gangs is flooded with chemicals hazardous to humans. By decriminalising the cultivation of cannabis for personal use peoples health is at less risk. This will also help restrict the flow of cash obtained by criminal organisations selling cannabis. \r\nThis method doesn't call for legalisation of the distribution of the plant and has been proven to be effective in countries such as Portugal. Furthermore, alcohol and the behaviour of people whilst under the influence of alcohol is far more damaging to communities then cannabis... Equality and fairness in this country no longer exists (as proven by Brexit) and we want it back!",
        "background": "Cannabis is becoming the drug of choice for many people in \r\nEngland. While it remains unregulated a large and growing percentage of the population is at increased and unnecessary risk.",
