        "additional_details": "The president of the American Academy of Paediatrics, Dr Colleen Kraft witnessed the practice first hand & described in detail the emotional & physical harm done to children exposed to these kinds of stresses. She was measured & not alarmist but when pushed said that this was indeed child abuse.\r\n\r\nReference: The Hill\r\nHttp://thehill.com/Latino/392790-American-academy-of-paediatrics-president-trumps-family-separation-policy-is-child\r\n\r\nFour former First Ladies, UNHCR Grandi have also condemned this.",
        "background": "The dehumanising policy of separating children from their families and keeping them apart in special \u2018camps\u2019 is antagonistic to British Values. To continue with this visit is to support and tacitly approve this disgusting policy.\r\nThe British people do not want to be associated with this policy.",
