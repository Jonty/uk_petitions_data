        "additional_details": "Institute for Fiscal Studies report (Briefing Note 201) that recent growth in UK public health spending is substantially below that between the 1950s and early 2010s. NHS spending per person is forecast to fall by 03% in 2018/19. Office for Budget Responsibility project that future health spending will need to rise again to meet patient demand - considerably over the next 50 years. The Government's short-term spending on health is simply deferring decisions.",

Despite this, the Government refuses to increase funding even to match that of other wealthy countries.",
