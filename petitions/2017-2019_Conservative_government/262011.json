        "additional_details": "They are so many alternative options to plastic. For example; bamboo toothbrushes, reusable version of cotton swabs, metal straws, recycled aluminium foil and bamboo paper towels etc. however none of these are stocked in stores like ASDA, Tescos or Sainsbury's. We need these items to be more accessible. We have survived without plastic before, we can do it again. So many companies can change their packaging to be eco friendly. Climate change is happening and it is happening NOW.",
        "background": "Between 4.8 and 12.7 million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean each year. They are so many single use plastic products being produced. We need to stop plastic polluting our oceans and landfills. \"We don't need a handful of people doing zero waste perfectly. We need millions doing It imperfectly\"",
