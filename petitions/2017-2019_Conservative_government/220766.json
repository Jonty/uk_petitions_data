On that same day he was allegedly sentenced to 13 months in prison, but due to reporting restrictions imposed by the judge the media is not allowed to discuss the case. Given the speed with which his trial took place, it is especially important that, as Lord Hewart famously said, it \"justice should not only be done, but should... ...undoubtedly be seen to be done.\"",
