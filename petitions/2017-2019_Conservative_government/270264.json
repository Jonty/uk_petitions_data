        "additional_details": "Hardworking individuals run their businesses out of Smithfield Meat Market.  We are penalised heavily already in the form of diesel prices, vehicle taxes, congestion charging, ULEZ, other compliance such as O' Licence plus the cost of a new fleet of vehicles since the introduction of ULEZ.  There is no doubt that the blockade will prevent those businesses to carry out their job, affecting thousands of businesses across the country.",
