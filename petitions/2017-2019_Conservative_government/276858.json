This will present major challenges to older and disabled people.\r\n\r\nBarclays\u2019 actions will be damaging to customers and to a national institution - the local post office.\r\n\r\nGovernment has a duty to protect people\u2019s access to cash. It is unacceptable that people should suffer due to Barclays\u2019 greed.\r\n\r\nFor more info, contact the National Federation of SubPostoligarchs at ",
