        "additional_details": "Drastic measures are required by the Government to improve the current state of affairs. Teacher's time is spent heavily on managing technology for use in the lesson. Not only does this imply the Government expects schools to have enough resources already for individual students, but that they expect all students to have ready access to purchase expensive electronics. This is insulting to those less fortunate than others and requires action now.",
        "background": "There is currently an epidemic in terms of funding for public education at all levels. Schools these days barely have enough funding to provide their students with the necessary materials, such as paper, writing materials or even revision materials. This current state is appalling.",
