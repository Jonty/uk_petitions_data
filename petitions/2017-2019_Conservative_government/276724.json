        "additional_details": "Behaviour of MPs in public and in the House must be challenged and sanctioned, by a panel of public leaders (eg. heads, doctors etc). This panel needs the power to sanction or remove MPs from office for financial irregularity, lying, or racist, sexist, homophobic, abusive, violent, discriminatory, anti-social or anti-semitic behaviour. All incidents and sanctions should be made public with MP's voting records, so voters can see if their MP shows the morality and integrity worthy of their vote.",
        "background": "The behaviour of some MPs is a national and international disgrace, and the current arrangements with the House of Commons monitoring itself are utterly ineffective. Behaviour that would result in members of the general public losing their jobs is ignored in MPs. These double standards must cease.",
