        "additional_details": "Countless times I have seen higher and lower tier candidates buckle under the pressure and break down due to the new exams and how hard they are. Having to remember fourmulas does not test how smart a student is. Applying these formulas will show how intelligent a student is so therefore a higher ability student will be able to apply the formula but might not remember it correctly or at all. Almost all GCSE students and teachers agree this is too hard for a level 2 qualification.",
        "background": "In GCSE trilogy science students have to remember 25+ formulas which are not given in an exam. As well as this GCSE maths students have to remember 8+ formulas. This doesn\u2019t test rigor or how intelligent a student is and causes unnecessary stress.",
