        "additional_details": "Our local Truro Crown Post Office has already been transferred into the back of the local W. H Smith from the previous premises, with poor  access without any meaningful prior consultation & despite many local objections including from our local M.P. The present team are highly knowledgeable, skilled and experienced providing excellent service, working in cramped conditions. These are not minimum wage jobs. These franchise plans will lead to a poorer service at all Post Offices concerned.",
        "background": "This cost-cutting exercise is reported to have resulted in reduced staff levels and loss of service where this has already been trialled. The same loss of skills and service can be expected at those Post Offices now earmarked for further such franchises.",
