        "additional_details": "The title Ms. began to be used as early as the 17th century, as a title which like Mister that did not originally indicate marital status. It fell into disuse until the 20th century. What is needed today is a more comprehensive term which does homage to the sex without expressing any views as to their domestic situation. Ask the government to remove Mrs. & Miss. from official documentation, recognise and publicise Ms. functions officially as the only title both for married and unmarried women.",
        "background": "Women must reveal their marital status on their title. This makes an issue for widows, and some women who being discriminated by their title. Ask the government to remove titles of Mrs. & Miss, and publicising Ms. functions as the only title, on all central, local government and civil documentation.",
