        "additional_details": "This epidemic has been happening for years, now it's Telford but how many more will be discovered? Children are our most important and vulnerable members of society and this country has done nothing to protect them from the evils of adults.Tough laws  are needed as offenders are not deterred by prison sentences. Castration and the death penalty are needed. Police need gov/public backing to do their job without fear of being labelled racist that prevents them like in the Rochdale case.",
        "background": "Children are our top priority, more so than brexit or the NHS. Police in Rochdale didn't stop grooming out of fear of being labelled racist, social workers are ignoring signs of abuse or allowing it by sex gangs. There shouldn't be a 2nd chance for an offender when they took a child's first.",
