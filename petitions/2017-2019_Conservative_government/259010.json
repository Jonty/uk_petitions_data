        "additional_details": "Scooters with electric motors are already commonly used in several European countries and the US, but under the UK's Highways Act 1835, footpaths can only be used by pedestrians.\r\nElectric scooters fall within the legal definition of a \"motor vehicle\", which means they cannot be used on public roads without meeting a number of requirements, which include conforming to technical standards and being subject to driver testing.",
        "background": "It is currently illegal to ride electric scooters on public roads or pavements, and even the government has said the traffic laws are \"a barrier to innovation\".\r\nOther countries around the world are already allowing electric scooters to help CUT TRAFFIC and POLLUTION.",
