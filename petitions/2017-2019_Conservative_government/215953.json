        "action": "Lower the math entry requirement to a Grade D, to access teacher training.",
        "additional_details": "Why would you need math to teach English, Sociology or other non math based/ limited math courses. It seems that achieving a Grade D in math at GCSE portrays the idea that we cannot do math. This is absolutely absurd, just because people did not achieve a grade C or above does not mean we cannot do the basic math. I simply believe, to become a teacher within the UK, math should only be a requirement depending on the type of Course the individual would like to teach.",
        "background": "Many Passionate individuals like myself are not able to access teacher training courses due to receiving a grade D at GCSE level. This is creating a problem of shortages of teachers, since many are simply not able to active peruse their dreams in helping the younger generation achieve their best.",
