At the moment, the next London mayoral election will be held in May 2020.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor of London is accountable to the London Assembly. If you are concerned about a specific policy which is the responsibility of the Mayor of London, the London Assembly has its own petitions process. You can find out more about how to petition the London Assembly here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/london-assembly/petitions\r\n\r\nYou could also start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n"
