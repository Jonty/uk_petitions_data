        "additional_details": "As a student going to and from college and work everyday I cannot afford to pay up to \u00a38 a day to travel to achieve the necessary qualifications for my education and experience from work. I, and most of my friends and many other students have great difficulty getting to and from work and home or to their education because they cannot afford travel fares. Some students may not have jobs to pay for travel or the funds to do so anyway and it\u2019s deeply affecting their reputation at work and school.",
        "background": "Travel fares should be lowered for students with a valid student ID card or document that states that they are a student. Bus fares are too expensive and is affecting our financial and social lives due to being unable to get to work or school to earn the money to travel and to have an education.",
