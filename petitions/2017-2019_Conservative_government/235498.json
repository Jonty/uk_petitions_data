Following a recommendation of the Petitions and Women and Equalities Committees last year, the Government issued new guidance setting how the law applies to dress codes at work. You can find this guidance here:\r\n\r\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/709535/dress-code-guidance-may2018-2.pdf\r\n\r\nIt would be for a court or tribunal to decide whether a case like yours would break the law. They would look at the facts of the case and take a decision independently of the UK Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling for the law or guidance to be changed if that is something you would like to see happen."
