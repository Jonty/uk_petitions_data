If the commonly referred to \"fast lane\" was indeed made the \"fast lane\" then traffic would flow better as people wouldn't be weaving in and out causing others to brake harshly, let alone when people crash because of this, if the limit was raised in all lanes or Removed completely in places I believe less weaving, less traffic, less accidents.",
        "background": "I do a lot of driving and spend many hours sat on motorways. Sometimes 300miles a day. 80-90mph would suffice, or even have certain stretches de-restricted completely. The M20, M25, M4, M6 are a few for example.",
