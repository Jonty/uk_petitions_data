        "additional_details": "It takes more than 500 words to give any example or evidence of a time where a decision has been incorrect or unacceptable by a referee or other match officials and the FA have done absolutely nothing about punishing them where a club, player, fans or club staff have to innocently face the harsh consequence of an incorrect decision. Investigations and actions should be taken of officials when called upon just like if it were to be the other way round. No fairness and no respect equally otherwise",
        "background": "In English football, players, coaches and club staff are punished either financially, a ban for 1 or more matches or point deduction. However the FA fail to address the fact that referee also make foul decisions, unfair decisions and terribly incorrect decisions but face no punishment or very little",
