        "background": "By pretending to have the authority to cancel an Order signed by Her Majesty's own hand, the Supreme Court have attempted to seize power, and disrupt our constitutional settlement. \r\n\r\nThey must be abolished forthwith, and the court of highest resort returned to the House of Lords.",
