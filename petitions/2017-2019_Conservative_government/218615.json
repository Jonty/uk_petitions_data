        "action": "Study leave for students during examinations.",
        "additional_details": "Research shows that pupils and students who eat breakfast perform better in exams. However most Muslim students will be fasting. So to make up for that loss I think that the schools around the UK should give exam leave to all students. By providing exam leave it will ensure that Muslim students aren\u2019t fatigued during exams which will lead to better GCSE grades.\r\nReasearch also shows that students who study at home in a relaxed environment before an examination tend to have better exam grades.",
        "background": "Students should have the option to either come or not to come to school during GCSE examinations, so that students only have to come in to give their examinations and leave . It is also the month of Ramadan so Muslim students will be fasting.",
