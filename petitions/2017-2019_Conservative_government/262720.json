        "additional_details": "Pepole from across parties ought to put pressure on the PM to put forward a piece of legislation as prime minister to put into law that there can't be an exit from the EU of any nature without a vote in parliament.\r\nWe have to have a procedure to prevent a no-deal Brexit being imposed on our country by a small number of MPs from a party with a leader who has effectively been elected prime minister by a very, very small and unrepresentative portion of our country",
        "background": "The PM needs to recognise the danger to our country of a future Tory prime minister who is a no-deal Leaver.\r\n\"And she needs to use the remaining powers she has in the remaining days she has left to help the majority in parliament insulate our country from that danger.\"",
