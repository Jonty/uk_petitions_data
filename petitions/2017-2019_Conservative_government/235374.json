        "additional_details": "Recent trials using psilocybin to treat depression and anxiety have returned staggering results, with 80% of patients reporting improved wellbeing or life satisfaction for up to six months from just a single dose. Psilocybin is currently a Schedule 1 substance which is not authorised for medical use and can only be supplied, possessed or administered in exceptional circumstances under a special Home Office licence.",
        "background": "We are calling on the UK government to reschedule psilocybin, a 'breakthrough' treatment for mental health. By rescheduling psilocybin from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2, research would become faster and cheaper, and doctors would be able to start prescribing the substance when they see fit.",
