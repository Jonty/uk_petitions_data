        "background": "Cars that have a list price of \u00a340,000 or more have a surcharge of \u00a3310 on the vehicle excise duty until the car is 6 years old. This results in the annual excise duty being \u00a3450. This is suppressing new car sales and the second hand car market at a time where car manufacturers are struggling.",
