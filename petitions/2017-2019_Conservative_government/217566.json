        "additional_details": "1) 52% of 72.2% turnout represents 37.54% of electorate\r\n2) Many may have been influenced by a multiplicity of lies e.g. https://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/long-list-leave-lies/.\r\n3) 2002: David Davis said \"referendums should be held when people know exactly what they are getting\".  Dec 2017: Brexit secretary Davis still did not know exactly what the people would be getting. How could voters know what their 'will' was without even the Brexit secretary knowing exactly what they would be getting?",
        "background": "The government repeatedly rejects calls for a 2nd referendum on EU membership, saying that \"the will of the people\" is to leave. However a minority of the total electorate (the people) voted leave.  Also many didn't know what they were voting for (thus what their will was) due to lies & uncertainty.",
