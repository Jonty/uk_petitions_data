        "additional_details": "There is a growing issue with cyber/bullying which is affecting our young people. Church is seen as a place of sanctuary and any YP could knock on the door or speak to ANY member of staff at the church they feel comfortable with. Some churches do not recognize bullying/cyber as an issue and play it down with \"just switch off the computer\" Therefore I propose that all Volunteer staff/Paid staff at church be trained in Safeguarding and how to speak to a YP who has disclosed bullying to them.",
        "background": "Cyber/bullying goes unnoticed by churches, as volunteer and paid church staff do not have training in recognizing the signs and safe guard training. The hierarchy in churches make it impossible for yp to go straight to anyone and seek help. Anyone could recognize the signs, even the cleaner could.",
