        "additional_details": "I have noticed in the past few years councils (notably Labour) are building so called affordable housing on public lands especially in London with little to no social housing or council housing that would actually be affordable for many people. All I see is housing that costs \u00a3300k+ which is not fair to people with average and lower wages. Look at the \u201cregeneration\u201d in Seven Sisters & Waltham Forest for example, both Labour run areas with a social housing crisis they don\u2019t seem to want to solve.",
        "background": "The government should stop local councils from building non-council housing (so-called affordable) on public land, such as parks & at least build more, council housing. The local councils don\u2019t care, they want to remove \u201cThe Poor\u201d from cities like London. This gentrification is Tony Blair\u2019s legacy.",
