Why are they not being immediately returned to the country of entry under the Dublin agreement or deported home?  We should be forcing them to take action, instead of wasting our resources trying to catch these criminals, and worse yet, allowing them to clog and abuse our asylum and immigration system.  This only hurts legitimate migrants who obey our laws, and legitimate refugees.",

Migrants who chose to travel though several SAFE countries to sneak into the UK and not claim asylum in the first country they enter are ILLEGAL economic migrants. We should stop accepting their bogus asylum claims under any circumstances. DEPORT THEM",
