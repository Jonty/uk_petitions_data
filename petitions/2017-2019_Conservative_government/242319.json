        "action": "Give nurses and paramedics free bus and rail travel inside London.",
        "additional_details": "I say it's time that the emergency services are given free transport inside London. It's a small thing that can make such a difference to their lives. It could help pay for that break away that they so desperately need or allowing them to use the money they save to buy a loved one a gift.\r\n\r\nSo if you appreciate the nurses and paramedics, please sign and ask the government to take away that one other costly thing that London prices demand.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
        "background": "We all know that nurses and paramedics do a really tough job and are under-appreciated. Not only do they work in harsh environments that are extremely stressful, they work long and unsociable hours also. If that's not bad enough, their pay isn't that great neither and living in London isn't cheap.",
