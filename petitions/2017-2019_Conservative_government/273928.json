        "action": "Post study work visa for international students currently studying in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "As international students we leave everything behind with a hope of both professional and personal development. We have invested a lot of effort and money for higher education however the strict rules hinder both the development and put more financial strains. The true essence of international studies is incomplete without the practical use in the industry. Since the post study visa has been introduced this year, we would be grateful if the current students are also made a part of the same.",
        "background": "Post study work visa of 2 years have been provided to international students coming to UK from year 2020.Since the current students do not have PSWV and It is difficult to get a sponsorship and job from the employer,we request the UK Government to provide 2yrs PSWV to the students currently in UK.",
