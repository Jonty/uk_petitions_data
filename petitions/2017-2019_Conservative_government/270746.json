        "additional_details": "A study undertaken by the Department of Animal Science at\u00a0Colorado State University (2012) found that most non-stunned calves ''did not become isoelectric (brain dead) until between 132-336 seconds (over 5 minutes). (Blackmore, DK., Newhook, J.C, Meat Science, Volume 6, 1982).\r\n\u200b\r\nOther studies suggest that smaller animals such as chickens do not lose consciousness after the severance of their arteries for up to 3 minutes.\u00a0(J. Cranley, Journal of Veterinary Behaviour  & Research, 2016).",
        "background": "Non-stun slaughter is cruel and subjects animals to needless and prolonged suffering, fear and pain. We believe that in a progressive and caring society, the welfare of animals should come before religious or cultural beliefs and customs.",
