        "action": "Limit the sale of fireworks to organised public displays",
        "additional_details": "The current legislation aims to prevent ASB by limiting hours of use but in practice this is hard to police causing vulnerable people and animals prolonged distress. We have seen fireworks used in crime and given the current threat level from terrorism having explosives readily available surely requires a more stringent control on the conditions of sale.",
        "background": "Recent examples show where fireworks have been used to commit ASB, Arson (in Birmingham where a man is in critical condition) and to deliberately harm animals (cat killed in Derby). The legislation around the use of fireworks is hard to police therefore sales should be limited to organised displays",
