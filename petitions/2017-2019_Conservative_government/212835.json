        "additional_details": "The militias have refused this government decision and blocked the roads to Tawergha by force. Now the people of Tawergha have built make-shift camps in Gararat Al-Gadaf which is near Bin Walid and Harawa which is near Sirte. On 5/02/2018 militias from Mistrata attacked the camp and burned some tents. On 12/02/2018 two people passed away and some children were admitted to Bin Walid hospital due to exposure to the cold. I am asking the British Government to provide assistance to these civilians.",
        "background": "There are around 35,000 people (who are an ethnic minority) who have been forced to leave their homes in the 2011 revolution by militias from Misrata. The UN-backed Tripoli Government promised their return to Tawargha on the 1st of February 2018, after 7 years of living in bad conditions.",
