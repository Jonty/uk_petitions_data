        "additional_details": "Renewing registration can cost practitioners in the NMC \u00a3120 per year and practitoners in the hcpc costs \u00a3180 for two years registration. They pay the fee despite wage rises being frozen for two years from 2011, and increases capped at 1% until this year. However, despite the proposed pay increases this won\u2019t cover the registration fee and is minimal in comparison to inflation.",
        "background": "I want action because NHS workers shouldn\u2019t have to pay to go to work. They work long hours with stretched resources, often their is not enough staff with little opportunity for breaks. Both my parents work for the NHS, with my mother having been part of the service for more than 25 years.",
