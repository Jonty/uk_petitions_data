        "additional_details": "Parliamentarians have let their electorate down. This has directly resulted in the breakdown of the Brexit process.\r\n\r\nI propose that any MP voting against their electorate in such circumstances be subject to to a constituency petition.\r\n\r\nIf 10% of eligible voters support the petition then a by-election must occur.\r\n\r\nThis approach ensures MP's consult widely with voters before referendums.\r\n\r\nMP's who ignore their constituents do so in the knowledge that that they may be relieved of their role.",
        "background": "The role of an MP is to represent their constituents. Numerous MP's voted against their constituency wishes in parliamentary 'meaningful'  or 'indicative' votes following the Brexit referendum. This is a national outrage,  undemocratic and creates division between a political elite and communities.",
