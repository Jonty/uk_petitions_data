        "action": "Make Electric boards, scooters and similar vehicles legal on UK roads",
        "additional_details": "If the idea is proven to work in other countries then why not have it in the UK? There is also a large variation of options to choose from for customers, often they are somewhat pricey as well, this largely stops them from being purchased by minors or anyone who may not be deemed \u201cresponsible enough\u201d to ride them. Why not introduce law to something that\u2019s already happening. We already have a climate crisis, this, and more, could help to be part of the solution.",
        "background": "In a city such as London, transport is busy and expensive, roads are full and polluted and walking doesn\u2019t always cut it. Electric vehicles such as boards, scooters and onewheels could solve this. They\u2019re often no faster than legal e-bikes and so many other countries have already made them legal.",
