The AA estimates around 100 lives each year would be saved by avoiding traffic accidents on dark evenings.\r\nBST brings us into line with Europe, helping us to do business. The view of the British Association of Leisure Parks tourism earnings by increase by \u00a32.5-3.5bn.\r\nExtra hour of evening light (winter) could save \u00a3485m a year in bills, as households would require less energy to heat and light their homes.",
