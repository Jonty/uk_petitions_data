        "additional_details": "Playing at Edgbaston is a boon for England, winning their last 10 matches there, leading to the new title Fortress Edgbaston.\r\n\r\nWhile Lords is known for its quiet reserve, Edgbaston is a modern celebration of a multicultural game in a multicultural city - with the raucous crowds to match.\r\n\r\nThis change would also reflect a welcome move away from London-centricity. Birmingham is in the centre of the country and far more accessible to people from all parts of the country - not merely the South East.",
        "background": "Edgbaston Stadium in Birmingham is the favourite for players and supporters alike.\r\n\r\nLord's, in London, has traditionally been known as the home of England cricket. It is more accurately the home of world cricket. Playing at Lord's is no more a home for England than anyone else.",
