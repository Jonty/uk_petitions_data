        "additional_details": "Despite the requirements placed on parents, it is seen as perfectly ok for an entire school to close for the day so that it can be used as a polling station - even when town, parish, borough and county councils have lots of other suitable buildings at their disposal.\r\nAs well as the disruption to their childrens education many parents are also removed from the workplace",
        "background": "Good school attendance is crucial to ongoing levels of attainment with penalties for parents who take their children out of school during term\r\nDespite this schools are routinely closed for use as election polling stations, we believe government should legislate to prevent use of schools for this",
