So was unable to ring the police to report youths on a roof of a derelict building. We get told to report incidents/issues to the police and to ring 101 for non emergency, so surely to get people to report these non emergency issues/incidents the call needs to be FREE &/or including in phone contract minutes!! Please sort this out",
