        "additional_details": "Leaving the EU on the 12th April with or without a deal should be the governments main priority as the day of us leaving was delayed. Respecting the referendum result should not only be respected by the government but the whole of parliament, new amendments to try and extend article 50 to a further date should be ignored by the government and they should relieved the brexit people voted for.",
        "background": "Britain should leave the EU on the 12th of April as Theresa May\u2019s brexit deal was voted down in parliament. Another extension to article 50 would mean that we are part of the European elections one thing leave voters do not want!",
