        "action": "Implement compulsory registration across England for all care workers.",
        "additional_details": "A recent study by the All-Party Parliamentary Group identified that there is no compulsory register or industry-recognised minimum standard qualification for those tasked with administering life-saving care to seriously ill patients or to those people who need to access a health and social care service which supports their daily living and allows them to live independently.",
        "background": "Disturbing new evidence suggests an increasing number of care workers are easily able to find work because the care industry is unregulated. It means the vulnerable with complex health needs, many living at home, are wide open to abuse.",
