        "additional_details": "I propose that the current Parliament passes a law:\r\n\r\n(i) to enable a second referrendum setting out the Brexit options for people to vote on; and \r\n\r\n(ii) that binds the Parliament to implement the result of that second referrendum. \r\n\r\nThe Brexit options can include inter alia a no deal exit, a customs union and a common market 2.    \r\n\r\nIf required, the law can set out a reasonable extention to the current Brexit date that allows the above measures to be implemented.",
        "background": "The current Brexit deadlock is unprecedented.   Another election or change in the prime ministership will not resolve the underlying issue that has beseiged the MPs: the deep rooted disagreement as to the best way to implement the result of the first referrendum and the Brexit terms.",
