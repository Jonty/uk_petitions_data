        "background": "We got our baby Husky a few months ago, and he is my first dog, I know, crazy right. It has been a wonderful steep learning curve, but the biggest learning curve has been the fact that, apart from one we know of a drive away, there are no FREE enclosed spaces for dogs near us in Margate and Thanet.",
