        "additional_details": "After the referendum, Mrs May could have chosen to seek a compromise solution, in view of the closeness of the result and in order to unite the country. Instead the route she chose made the division even worse, and displayed utter contempt for Remainers, NI and Scotland. The decision to mint a commemorative 50 p coin is another example of this. All it will achieve is to ensure that the wounds inflicted by the referendum never heal, as it will be a constant reminder of this disastrous decision.",
        "background": "The decision to mint a commemorative 50p Brexit coin is just another example of the contempt displayed by May and the government towards Remainers since the referendum, and of their complete and utter lack of emotional intelligence. We are the people too, we demand that this decision is reversed.",
