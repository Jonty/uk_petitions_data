        "additional_details": "To defraud a company and threaten with spreading false statements  is essentially fraud, theft and blackmail. It should be a criminal offence. It is a civil matter currently so the police cannot take action. Also slandering a company and making false statements and accusations should also be a criminal offence. The law should be able to protect companies against fraudulent behaviour. It's unfair that a company has to pursue this through civil courts at its own cost - not all businesses are rich.",
        "background": "If a customer lies to defraud a company out of money - making false statements and blackmailing for money back, etc - it is a civil matter and the company has to pay to take this to court to defend themselves. This should be a criminal matter and the police should be able to take action.",

Blackmail and fraud are already criminal offences, so we're not sure what more you'd like Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nIf you think that a crime has been committed or you feel threatened or harassed, you should contact the police. \r\n\r\nYou can find advice on the best number to call here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.police.uk/contact/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking for defamation to be made a criminal offence. "
