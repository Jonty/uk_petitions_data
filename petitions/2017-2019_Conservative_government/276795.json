        "additional_details": "Many customers still rely on cash and do not wish to use a machine when they can withdraw money over a counter;  bank branches are increasingly rare in villages and small towns, and many people have become reliant on the Post Office network for their day to day banking needs. This is also a major blow for the viability of smaller Post Offices, which are under significant pressure already.",
        "background": "Barclays has announced that from January 2020, their customers will no longer be able to withdraw cash from Post Offices. This will be a major inconvenience to many of their customers, particularly in rural areas. It is also a threat to the viability of smaller Post Offices.",
