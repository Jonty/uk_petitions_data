        "action": "End the provision of subsidised food and alcohol in parliament and the Lords.",
        "additional_details": "Given the recent MP salary increase to \u00a374000 (before expenses) it's not unreasonable to expect that they pay for subsistence in the same way the majority of other workers do. The average wage in the UK is \u00a326000. Meanwhile Britain's poorest children are being starved whilst Mp's are getting drunk on our money. \u00a374000 pa from the public purse is quite enough.",
        "background": "It now costs the British tax payer more than \u00a36 million pounds per annum to supply public servants with subsidised food and alcohol. However the Government are no longer willing to subsidise Britain's poorest families with free school meals. These double standards must stop.",
