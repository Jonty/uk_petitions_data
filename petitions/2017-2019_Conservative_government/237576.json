        "additional_details": "If the UK went to a general election today we would need to choose between Jeremy Corbin and Theresa May. This is a sad reality. I and many people I speak to dislike both. There needs to be a mechanism for the public to deny candidates we simply do not want. We are currently forced to choose which is surley not fair. This is never more present with the ongoing brexit talks.",
        "background": "When a general election takes place, the public is forced to choose from the candidates put forward by their respective parties. Surely we should be able to decline all candidates and ask for new leaders to be put forward and go again.",
