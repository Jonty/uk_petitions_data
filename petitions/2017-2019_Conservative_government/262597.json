        "additional_details": "American health care companies are circling - so it\u2019s time to take action.\r\n\r\nThis proposed law would protect the NHS from privatisation, thereby protecting us all at our most vulnerable. Instead of focusing on money, patients can continue to focus on rehab/ recovery/ getting home.\r\n\r\nIf we allow corporations to take control we will all suffer. None of us know what health conditions or accidents we could have in the future. \r\n\r\nPlease sign. Please share.",
        "background": "I\u2019m Hannah, I\u2019m 21 and I have a variety of serious degenerate health conditions. The NHS has saved my life (and others) numerous times, and now we need to return the favour. \r\n\r\nFree, world class care at the point of access is a huge gift we must protect. Once it\u2019s gone it isn\u2019t coming back.",
