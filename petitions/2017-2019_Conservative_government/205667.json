        "action": "Include of animals feeling sentience (and pain) in the EU withdrawal bill",
        "additional_details": "MPs have rejected to include the clause stating animals are sentient beings in the UK law. While we have the Animal Welfare Act of 2006 it does not cover animals being sentient or feeling pain, it covers all animals requiring their basic needs. Without the clause from the EU wild animals can once again be hunted (such as fox hunting or badger culling) and it opens doors for animals to be treated inhumanely for our own profit, such as testing and inhuman treatment before killing for meat.",
        "background": "MPs have voted that animals are not sentient beings and cannot feel pain or emotions. They have rejected to include animal sentience in the EU Withdrawal Bill. This is a step backwards in animal welfare",
