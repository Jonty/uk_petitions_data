Provided with details of a van of illegal dogs arriving-they failed to stop it. Proof of corrupt vets and TRACE units in Romania-still operating. Traffickers operating on FB-still sending dogs. Romanian rescue dogs are still entering with no rabies vaccine. Rabies & Echinococcus will enter the UK unless Michael Gove & APHA take action!",

I discovered he was from Serbia & know now he wasn't wormed or rabies vaccinated or titered as required. I spoke out believing APHA would take action against those involved, they haven't!",
