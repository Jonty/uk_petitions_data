No deal is an assault on our democracy our economy. To create an Americanised, deregulated, privatised economy, and bump Britain into a trade deal with Donald Trump. There is simply no mandate for no deal. \r\n\r\nBoris Johnson has attacked our democracy. \r\n\r\nHe has taken Britain to the brink. He lied about his government\u2019s motivations for the prorogation. And he has no majority in the House of Commons. \r\n\r\nThis is unacceptable. Boris Johnson must now resign.",
