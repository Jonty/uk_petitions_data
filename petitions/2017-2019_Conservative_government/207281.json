        "background": "This petition is for the reduction of public transport prices. This is because a bus fare for a 12.5 mile trip is \u00a35.20 for a child, which is (in my opinion) very expensive. This is important as the government want to increase the number of people using public transport and high prices won't help.",

However, local transport authorities (usually local councils) have the power to set maximum fares in some circumstances.\r\n\r\nIf you would like bus fares in your local area to be lower, you could raise this with your local council. You can find out who your local councillor is here:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\r\nIf you'd like the Government or Parliament to take a specific action that could lead to lower transport fares, you could start a petition. For example, you might like the law to change, to give the Government the power to regulate fares and to set maximum prices. Alternatively, you might like the Government to provide funding to subsidise local transport fares."
