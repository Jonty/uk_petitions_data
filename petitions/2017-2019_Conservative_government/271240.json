        "action": "Our government has our full support to prorogue parliament until mid October",
        "additional_details": "The people of this country voted to leave the European Union, the question was simple as was the answer. Parliament was elected on the promise that they would ensure we left. Parliament delayed the leaving date but in doing so agreed that the priority was that we left deal or no deal. There is now no requirement for parliament to be involved until after we have left, hence proroguing parliament is a perfectly legitimate action by a new British Prime Minister.",
        "background": "We the undersigned fully support Boris Johnson and his cabinet in their action to prorogue parliament during the run up to our leaving the European Union on October 31st.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to be free to deliver the democratic will of the quiet, calm majority not the loud, selfish minority.",
