The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) is responsible for deciding on MPs' expenses and pay. IPSA is independent of both Parliament and Government.\r\n\r\nYou can find out how to contact IPSA here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.theipsa.org.uk/about-us/contact-us/\r\n\r\nThe UK Parliament and Government also aren't responsible for how individual MPs choose to represent their constituents. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition about something the UK Parliament and Government are responsible for. For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Parliament and Government to take back responsibility for pay and expenses and introduce a new system based on attendance at national legislatures, if that's what you'd like to happen. \r\n\r\nYou might also like to sign and share this petition: \"Stop MLA\u2019s Salary until Stormont has a sitting Assembly\"  \r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/239208"
