        "action": "Ensure all schools offer reception children a full time education from September",
        "additional_details": "There is little awareness of a ruling by the Schools Adjudicator in 2013 who said, in reference to phased starts, \u201cIt is not permissible in my view for a school to deny a child a term of full-time education. The school has a duty to provide a full-time place from September and cannot refuse to do so.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe latest school admissions code supports this, stating that a local authority must make clear that children are entitled to a full-time place in the Sept following their fourth birthday.",
        "background": "Every September many schools accept reception children for only part of a day for up to 6 weeks, causing enormous difficulties for many parents. Working parents have to take leave, unpaid leave in the case of self-employed parents, or pay huge childcare costs while the phased start is in place",
