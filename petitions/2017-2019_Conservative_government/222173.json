They will have driving licences off all kinds, a bank account and picture identification and references which sounds small but holds many of these people back which will greatly improve employment upon release. Many will excel in these roles as they want their family to be proud for once and want to prove they can be a worthwhile member of society whilst paying a debt to society.",

Also giving a sense of pride for offenders and family members while paying debt to society at the same time.",
