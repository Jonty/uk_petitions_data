        "action": "Make GCSE English Literature an optional subject choice",
        "additional_details": "Recently,these exams are becoming  harder,in the past you would be able to go into the exam with your anthology of poems/text.Whereas now,you have to learn 14 poems,learn a 19th century novel,a Shakespeare play and also a modern text and now in these exams all you have is your memory. Having to learn poems,plays and novels that will be quickly forgotten just to pass an exam is pointless and should be optional as it merely adds to the forever growing pressure to succeed that our young people are facing. Your success should not be based on your ability to analyse literature.",
        "background": "The GCSE English literature exam is an exam that many people would have gone through,however for an increasingly modern world,what skills does this exam pass on to the future workforce of the country? For example,when are you ever going to need to analyse a poem for a job interview.",
