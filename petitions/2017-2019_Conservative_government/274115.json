        "additional_details": "The approval of further culling will lead to an estimated 63,000 badgers being killed this year for no reason. This will push an iconic animal, and the UK's largest land predator, to the brink of extinction.\r\nBovine TB needs further research and viable treatments, and should not be an excuse for senseless slaughter.\r\nThe amount of confirmed cases has remained almost constant despite the slaughter of badgers and cattle since 2013. When the badgers are gone, the disease will still be here.",
        "background": "Since 2013, the British government have approved the culling of badgers in an attempt to slow or halt the spread of bovine tuberculosis. \r\nEmpirical data has shown this been ineffective, the amount of cattle being slaughtered for this disease has increased from 33,000 in 2013 to 45,000 in 2017.",
