        "additional_details": "There should be an aesthetics degree that is the equivalent of a medical degree, designed for beauticians. It should cover all applications of botox and dermal fillers along with how to deal with complications and adverse reactions. This will not be designed to gain the title of a 'Dr' but more to gain the respect of medical professionals and put their ever growing concerns to rest regarding beauticians carrying out these treatments safely.",
        "background": "As a beautician myself, i understand the discrimination and difficulty non medics face when administering Botox and dermal fillers. Although as beautician's we do not have the medical background a doctor would have, we still have to do vigorous training in order to gain our qualifications.",
