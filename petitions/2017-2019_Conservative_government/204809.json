        "additional_details": "Phones can be seen as status symbols by peers at school and can introduce new levels of teasing or could lead to bullying.  Smartphones promote anti-social qualities do not contribute anything positive to a school day. Instead of interacting with one another, or being physically active, children can often be seen huddled up in a corner somewhere playing on their smartphone.  This is not a proposal to ban the mobile phone, it is a proposal to ban the SMARTphone in school for those up to Year 8.",
        "background": "The Smartphone does nothing positive towards school life or adolescence.  In fact, it teaches and promotes all the wrong things in people, especially younger children.  Children do not need a smartphone at school.",
