        "additional_details": "It is imperative that as a country, we respect international law, just as we often like to call upon others to respect it. Respecting international law requires that the law is interpreted and applied in good faith. Distortions, manipulations and contortions of the law are not worthy of an advanced democracy as ours. How is the Chemical Weapons Convention to be enforced against violating states? The answer is not the use of Aggression; it is to be found in the Treaty itself. Let's stick to it!",
        "background": "Attacking Syria in response to the use of chemical weapons is unlawful. Even if it is proven that the Syrian government used those abominable weapons, raining missiles over Syria is not a lawful way of responding to it. Doing so is an Armed Reprisal which is unlawful under International Law.",
