        "action": "Make it law for employers to pay employees for appointments after a miscarriage",
        "additional_details": "When you are pregnant it is law that you get paid for any appointment and even antenatal classes if they are recommended by your GP or midwife. As soon as you are told you have miscarried you are no longer entitled to this. Personal experience tells me that you do need to have time off after, not just for greiving but medical reasons too (surgery and very invasive situations). Trying to deal with a devastating situation and then financially struggling is ridiculous under these circumstances.",
        "background": "I\u2019ve started this petition to help people who suffer the devastating news that they have miscarried. I\u2019ve had 2 missed miscarriages this year which meant several appointments and full days in hospital. As I was no longer classed as pregnant I wasn\u2019t entitled to any pay.",
