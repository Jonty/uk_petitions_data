        "additional_details": "In July 2018 ICS placements are being postponed as ICS is gong 'on review' after running since 2012 without review. There are some issues that need to be addressed to improve the project impact of ICS. However, as an ICS volunteer, with a first hand understanding of the program I am worried that the program will not return; due to recent discussions about reducing the Foreign Aid budget. ICS is more than just aid, but a personal development and awareness raising opportunity that changes lives.",
        "background": "The International Citizen Service (ICS) Program is funded by DFID (Department for International Development) and is a once in a lifetime opportunity for 18-35 year olds from the UK and Developing countries. ICS contributes to development by engaging and encouraging youth volunteers to take action.",
