        "additional_details": "This sad history of violence shows how intimately the UK is tied to the waves of violence that occasionally pulse through Kashmir, and shows why attention needs to be paid to what is happening in there now. The newly crowned BJP government led by Narendra Modi, revoking a key part of the constitution which defined Indian controlled Kashmir as separate to the rest of the country. India is brutally oppressing the Muslim majority and revoking their rights of basic lifestyle!",
        "background": "India's actions in Kashmir could have bloody consequences in the UK as we have seen in the past.\r\n\r\nThis genocide could result in extremist debates and rally\u2019s in the UK and maybe lead to blood in our land, accelerated by tensions and legal rights of innocent Kashmiri\u2019s being revoked by Modi !!",
