Would also reduce the amount of landlords that do not fix the property and yet are happy to take full rentals off tenants.  This will increase the amount  of lending offered.",
        "background": "We want to propose to the Government that if a tenant has paid rent on a property for min 3 years(36 mths) that the government allow these to have a 95% LTV mortgage.  This would be on the proviso no late rents no rent arrears. Currently we have a nation of renters and not a nation of home owners.",
