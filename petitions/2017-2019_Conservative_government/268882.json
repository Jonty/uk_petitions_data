        "additional_details": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48908766\r\n\r\nThis story explains how FIFA, a PEGI 3 rated game, allowed children to spend \u00a3550 on in game purchases. While parents have a responsibility to ensure children play suitable games, they will often use the PEGI system to judge the suitability and level of supervision needed when kids play. \r\n\r\nHowever games like FIFA, constantly bombard players with requests to spend money to improve the experience. Young children should not be exposed to this.",
        "background": "There have been a growing number of stories regarding children inadvertently spending large amounts of their parents money on in game purchases. \r\n\r\nMany of these games are advertised as being suitable for children as young as 3 years old, yet they strongly push buying items with real world money.",
