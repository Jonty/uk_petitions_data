        "additional_details": "VE Day was an important day in the history of Europe, so the day should be kept as an additional bank holiday. This is the reason for changing the day in the first place. However, such a change should not be implemented with such short notice, considering the date has been known for the past 75 years.",
        "background": "It has been announced in the past few days that 4/5/20 will no longer be a bank holiday, with less than 12 months notice. This will result in events that require long-term planning having to be rearranged at high costs. The new bank holiday (8/5/20) should remain as an additional one.",
