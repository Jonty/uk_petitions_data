The result being that approx. Two thirds of car drivers have had their vehicles damaged in car parks.\r\nLegislation is therefore required to ensure that the minimum off road Parking Bay size should be 3.5 metres wide and 5.5 metres long.\r\n\r\nOn road Parking Bay minimums are 4.5 metres long by 1.8 metres wide and again these minimum standards do not accommodate many modern vehicles. Consequently Legislation is required to ensure that a legal minimum should be 6 metres long and 2.5 metres wide.",
