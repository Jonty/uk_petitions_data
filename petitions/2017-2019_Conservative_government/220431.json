        "action": "Abolish the tv licence, it shouldn't be a legal requirement.",
        "additional_details": "Independent economic research analysis and investigations by consumer protection organisations such as the National Consumers Council have concluded, that the UK TV licence is a levy which is regressive in its financial impact on the poor.This gross iniquity is perpetuated in essence by the UK Government upon its most vulnerable citizens. This situation is even more outrageous as \r\n we receive only 5 terrestrial TV channels, for which the TV licence contributes to the cost of only BBC.",
        "background": "It should be illegal to use public money to fund Media, as BBC can make use of all lawful, reasonable, modern means of capital and revenue generation. An extra \u00a3150 per annum bill can be a burden for those with a low income.",
