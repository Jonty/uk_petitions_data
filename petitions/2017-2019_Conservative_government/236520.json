        "additional_details": "Ben Sharp, Seaborne Freight\u2018s chief executive, previously ran a business that was liquidated owing money to the UK tax authorities. Mr Grayling had no reasonable grounds to assign - without tendering even - a contract to this company. He should step down and answer legally for this decision.",
        "background": "The contract was assigned without any due dilligence checks to a company with ni history, no assets and no expertize in the field. Governement has funded a start up saying that it helps small British companies. It is unfair to the tax payer and to other businesses that did not get a similar chance",
