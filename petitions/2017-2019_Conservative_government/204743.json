        "action": "Ban halal slaughter in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "It does not take long to either Google or YouTube images or videos of islamic slaughterhouses, to see the terrible, inhumane ways in which beautiful, sentient animals are being treated. Live animals are literally being thrown around, on top of other, half dead ones which are bleeding everywhere, whilst the vile 'butchers' are laughing, joking and even dancing around. In this civilised country, it is a massive step back. There is a huge growth in UK citizens in total opposition to this horror.",
        "background": "Halal slaughter forces sentient animals to suffer horrific physical pain as a result of this barbarism and forces them to watch others of their own kind being slaughtered in front of their very eyes, causing untold mental stress. It is totally incompatible with British culture and Christianity.",
