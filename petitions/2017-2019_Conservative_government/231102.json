        "additional_details": "Fanta in the USA have over 15+ flavours of soda, we have 3. Oreo have 45+ varietys of flavours, and we again only have 3. Skittles & Starburst (Wrigleys Co.) also have huge variety. In the UK everything has very little intrest to the customers in stores, the generation is evolving and its time that we change up our food products! Even british confectionary like (Wine Gums) could at least have more flavours! The flavours are always original, Im bored of it!!!!",
        "background": "We have very little varietys of certain food products to choose from and many could argue that it needs to change! We get limited options in this country and quite frankly it tends to be the sweets & beverages that need some more new flavours, we get bored of the same things!!!",
