        "additional_details": "It is understood that Brandon Lewis was knowingly paired with Jo Swinson on 17th July 2018 and honoured that arrangement for several votes during the day. \r\n\r\nWhen it became clear the government would need additional votes during the evening Brandon Lewis and Julian Smith colluded to the benefit of their party and Lewis used his vote twice, against the agreement.\r\n\r\nThe pair then apologised on Twitter stating the arrangement had been 'forgotten' which is clearly not true. Wholly unacceptable.",
        "background": "Julian Smith (Tory Chief Whip) and Brandon Lewis (Tory Chairman) are alleged to have deliberately conspired to suppress votes of a colleague whilst on maternity leave. This is a significant breach of trust, goes against accepted practice and constitutes discrimination under the Equality Act 2010.",
