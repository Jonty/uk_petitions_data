        "additional_details": "By prolonging he suffering of women, aiding with sexual offenders, and using genuine women\u2019s rights issues as a platform for his petty protest against private members bills, Christopher Chope has shown himself as someone not only unsuitable for Knighthood but unsuitable as an elected representative. \r\n\r\nHis role as MP can be changed at the next election but his status as \u2018Sir\u2019 can be removed right now. Show Christopher Chope and others there is no room for mysoginy in our society.",
        "background": "On the 15th June, Sir Christopher Chope, MP for Chrischirch in Dorset, was the sole MP to object to a change in law to make it illegal to photograph up a woman\u2019s skirt/dress. \r\n\r\nHis status as a \u2018Sir\u2019 is unbefitting of someone who sides with sexual offenders and holds back women\u2019s rights.",
