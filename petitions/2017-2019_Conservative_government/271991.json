        "additional_details": "Recent events show how easy it is for unscrupulous and corrupt people to subvert our democracy by ignoring custom and practice in the constitution. If the constitution were written and enshrined in law it would be much more difficult to do this as these loopholes would be examined during law-making. If a breach occurred, the courts would look into it and pass judgement, preventing corrupt governments policing themselves. This law must block advisers from outside the Civil Service or Parliament.",
        "background": "The constitutional arrangements for the United Kingdom are based on custom and practice. Recent events show that unscrupulous individuals can make loopholes with impunity. As a nation we would benefit if our constitution had the force of law behind it, as is the case in other leading democracies.",
