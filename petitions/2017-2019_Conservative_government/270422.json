        "additional_details": "It\u2019s just simply unfair there are so many cases of the landlord not performing any \r\nmaintenance on the property during our tenancy. We even allowed them to carry out works whilst we was there. And attempted to be charged for things such as boiler leaks and new mattresses. The growing number of cases of my friends who have been overcharged simply because \u201cwe are naive students\u201d amounting to many seeking help from parents at a crucial time of graduation. \r\nWe understand some students destroy Holmes",
        "background": "Speaking to lots of students we have received our deposit checkout from our landlord. Which includes extortionate costs off our security deposit, things such as professional cleaners when it wasn\u2019t to that standard upon moving in, new carpets, painting walls and not allowing for wear and tear!",
