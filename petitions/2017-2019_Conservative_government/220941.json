        "action": "Hold a Parliamentary vote to relax abortion restrictions in Northern Ireland",
        "additional_details": "There has been no devolved government in Northern Ireland since its collapse in January 2016, which means that MPs can vote to extend the 1967 Abortion Act to Northern Ireland, and make its laws around this simple medical procedure in line with the rest of the UK and Europe. We petition for the Government to move legislation to do so in this Parliamentary term.",
        "background": "After last weekend's vote on the 8th, Northern Ireland is the only place in Europe apart from Malta where there is a near total ban on abortion. It's only allowed in cases where the life or mental health of the mother is at risk and thousands of women are forced to travel to the UK every year.",
