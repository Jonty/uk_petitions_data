        "additional_details": "Ben Bradley MP is in a position of trust, his lies have proven he cannot be trusted. This is just the latest in a long line of defamatory stories made up to attack the Labour leader Mr. Corbyn. Enough is enough, maybe if an example was made of Mr. Bradley other Tory MP's would refrain from slander and fake news. An MP who has publicly admitted to telling lies, lies that he knew were lies at the time, should not be in the job.",
        "background": "Ben Bradley MP tweeted that Jeremy Corbyn was a spy for the communist party. Once threatened with legal action Ben then deleted his tweet and has since apologised for his lies. He cannot be trusted so, therefore, must resign from his job as an MP.",
