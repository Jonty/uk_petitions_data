We understand that you're concerned about sentences for animal cruelty offences, but we're not sure whether maximum sentence of three years would lead to tougher sentences. The Government has announced plans to increase the maximum sentence for very serious animal cruelty offences to five years. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Government and Parliament to change the law by the end of the year so that people who are convicted of very serious animal cruelty offences can be sentenced to up to five years in prison.
