The High Street already has a number of empty shops just sitting there making it look derelict, making the village unattractive to new potential shops. Trade has already dropped by 50% as a result of this. SAVE OUR HIGH STREET!",

However, due to unsubstantiated complaints received, all businesses on the High Street have been forced to remove all displays from outside.",
