        "additional_details": "Leaving via that result is not UK democracy, as it disregards the views of today's majority and denies 1.7 million~ voters now age 18 their say. Democracy must be dynamic or it ceases to be democracy as facts emerge and change. Leaving would be temporary due to Leave and Remain voter's age profiles, so not worth suffering x years of adversity. Signatories: Sign if you agree with the analysis. If government refuse to act, find more signatories. The more who sign it, the more likely MP's will act.",
        "background": "Search and click rejected petition 276414 to find the analysis. It INVALIDATES the result and the undertaking. It also did not mention leaving the Single Market and Customs Union so CANNOT BE A MANDATE to do so. This result was CONTRIVED by non disclosures, misleading statements and misconceptions.",
