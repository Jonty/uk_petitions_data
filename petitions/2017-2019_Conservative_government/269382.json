        "action": "Ban plastic bags in retail and high street shops",
        "additional_details": "Whilst banning plastic straws could be seen as an attempt at \u201csaving the planet\u201d, it could also be merely viewed as a publicity stunt since plastic straws only make up 0.25% of the damage done to the earth by single use plastic. Not to mention that plastic straws are (in some cases) necessary for disabled people to drink safely. We urge that a more effective, safer alternative be made. Companies such as Primark have without-issue, used paper bags in their stores for bagging items.",
        "background": "Plastic straws only make up 0.25% of the damage done to the environment by single use plastics and are also necessary to drink safely for some disabled people. We propose an alternative and more effective solution, banning single use plastic shopping bags from retail stores.",
