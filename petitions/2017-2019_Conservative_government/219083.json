        "additional_details": "The vast majority of car enthusiasts are not boy racers, we put our spare income into our cars, our pride and joy. We work hard for this money, paying income tax, we then spend on car parts, fitting said parts, tuning and dynos. Through this, we pay VAT, creating manufacturing jobs (more income tax and employment), garages providing labour, (again, yet more income tax and employment), engineering, dyno sessions etc etc All creating employment and much needed money into the UK coffers.",
        "background": "Recent MOT legislation is having a detrimental effect upon car enthusiasts. The Modified car scene creates thousands of jobs within the UK, brings vast amounts of money into the economy. This is not about passing unsafe cars, but a safe and realistic system so enthusiasts can enjoy their hobby.",
