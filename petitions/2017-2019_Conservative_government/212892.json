        "additional_details": "In the face-to-face scenario, it can happen that the goods are out of stock, the trader asks for payment prior to ordering the goods into stock, the trader receives the goods into stock, the consumer inspects the goods but is unhappy with them, then the trader refuses to refund the consumer\u2019s money, forcing the consumer to either accept the goods or alternatively a credit note that may be of no use to the consumer.  I believe that consumers should have the right to a refund in this situation.",
        "background": "Consumers currently have the right to a refund if unhappy with goods purchased online. They should have the same right when purchasing goods in a shop where the goods are out of stock at time of purchase; as with an Internet purchase, the consumer can't inspect the goods until they actually arrive.",
