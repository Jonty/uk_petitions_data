        "additional_details": "Our 15 year Westie was attacked on the 26th October 2018 by a dangerous dog. This dog was not on a lead and had been subject to constant anti-social behaviour from the property from where this incident occurred. Our dog was on a lead being walked up the street when the dog ran out of the house where the dog locked onto his neck, resulting in numerous horrendous life threatening wounds and punctures. The cause of this attack was the owner. We want to see owners prosecuted for this awful treatment",
        "background": "Our dog was savagely attacked by a dangerous dog uncontrolled in the street. He sustained a horrific attack and suffered a harrowing ordeal. The police cannot prosecute if it is a dog on dog attack. A change in the law is needed to prosecute irresponsible dog owners for allowing this behaviour",
