        "additional_details": "Evidence is three years of voting for leaving the EU but contradicting themselves. Their behaviour has put this country in a poor position to negotiate a descent withdrawal agreement and made this country a laughing stock of the world. \r\nThey have destroyed the trust of the people and if they continue in their position, the trust will not be returned.",
        "background": "This is a unique period of time, our politicians have wasted three years, caused great distress to the nation and the economy by ignoring the 2016 referendum. \r\nEach of these MP\u2019s should have their pension and other financial payouts to be taken away from them as compensation to the UK population.",
