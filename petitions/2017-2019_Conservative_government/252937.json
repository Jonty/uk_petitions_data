        "action": "If Theresa May steps down as PM then a General Election should be called.",
        "additional_details": "David Cameron called for the EU referendum splitting the country in two, an act of indescribably selfish recklessness. He then resigned leaving Britain in chaos. Theresa May has run negotiations into the ground causing chaos to the entire EU, repeatedly. She has now stated that she will step down as PM once she forces a Brexit deal, exactly the same as her predecessor. \r\nThis party cannot be trusted to lead no matter who is at the helm because evidently it\u2019s members are completely irresponsible.",
        "background": "A leader should stay their term. If they are not up to the job of leading their party, and indeed the country, then a general election should automatically ensue to open that position for someone who can, from any party and voted for by the British public.",
