        "additional_details": "The IR35 legislation has been in force for quite some time and I firmly believe in its principles for fair taxation, however the big banks and companies across the UK are fearful or the HMRC and therefore will look to use a blanket approach which is detrimental to the true professional contractors out there and we urge the parliament to intervene to protect this dynamic industry and to protect the rights of contractors who choose flexible work instead of full time employment.",
        "background": "Contractors across the UK are being unfairly pushed inside IR35 due to fears from big banks and corporations, contractors are not being assessed for IR35, instead are being pushed into it by the banks to avoid the risk of having to deal with the HMRC's unclear legistlation.",
