Forced marriages between religions by the state have been documented. Forced consumption of alcohol and pork. Countless more human right breaches can be listed. \r\n\r\nThis petition aims to direct the UK government to begin sanctions against the Chinese state for this breach of human rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-asia-china-48825090\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/china-puts-uighurs-uyghyrs-muslim-children-in-prison-re-education-internment-camps-vice-news/",
