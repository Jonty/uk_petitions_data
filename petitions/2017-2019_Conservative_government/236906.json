Let\u2019s face it, we import more than we export at the end of the day. \r\n\r\nStress to them EU citizens rights will be protected. \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s keep tourism flowing & offer a 90 day fee free visa for EU citizens\r\n\r\nIf we do the above we will control our boaders, laws, money and show the EU we want to work with them closely, just not be dictated to anymore.",

We don\u2019t need a deal to do this. \r\n\r\nStress to the EU keeping our trading agreement as is, would be best for all. Use smart boarder tech in NI and Gibraltar. \r\n\r\nNo backstop & no worry for businesses on both ends.",
