        "action": "Increase funding for Bedfordshire Police to match that of similar-sized forces",
        "additional_details": "This petition comes in the light of last week's events on serious violence across Bedfordshire.\r\nThe event, which was organised by the Home Office, revealed there have been four murders in Luton and Bedford over the last six months; that last year the county was in the top five for the number of firearms and knife crime offences committed per person; and the chief constable described the situation as being worse than anything he had experienced in more than 30 years of policing.",
        "background": "Beds Police is one of the most underfunded forces in the UK.\r\n1,126 officers serve a population of 670,000 people, soon to expand to nearly 750,000.\r\nThe chief constable and PCC have stated that the force is seriously underfunded.\r\nThis petition also welcomes increases to police funding nationally.",
