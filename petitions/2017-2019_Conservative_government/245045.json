        "additional_details": "Alison Whateley was a nursery School manager who watched live videos of children as young as 3 being raped and egged on the rapists as well as watching other obscene materials, was given a community order and allowed to walk free.\r\n\r\nChristopher Daniel, aged 18, was found guilty of abusing a 6 year old girl but was let off serving any time or being put on a sex offenders register as it might 'damage his career'. \r\n\r\nHaving the bravery to speak out as a child is hard and sentencing is usually unfit.",
        "background": "There are many outrageous cases of child abuse and peadophilia that result in poor sentencing that causes distress to victims and the public. Crimes against children affect all of society and are a literal life sentence for survivors. Having greater penalties for financial crime is so wrong.",
