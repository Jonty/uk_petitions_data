        "additional_details": "The Electoral Commission has announced that it won't be pursuing BSE about the 5 last minute campaigns which were set up a month before the EU Referendum\r\n More than \u00a31m was spent on these campaigns. The daily phone calls co-ordinating the campaigns did not \"meet the threshold for an investigation to be opened\".\r\nThe EC claimed these were \"advisory\".\r\nThis is clear double standards. There is clear evidence of collusion. \r\nWe want a full investigation into the activities of BSE during the Referendum",
        "background": "The Electoral Commission has issued fines to Vote Leave and to Darren Grimes of BeLeave.\r\nWe believe that in order for justice to be served, the official Remain side, Britain Stronger in Europe (BSE) should also be investigated.",
