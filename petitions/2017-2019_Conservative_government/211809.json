        "additional_details": "I feel that making the Monday immediately after Remembrance Sundaya bank holiday would encourage people to attend services across the country and world. Making Remembrance weekend a 3 day weekend would help those that woud like to attend loctions like Belgium and not have to worry about rushing back to the UK due to work commintments on the Monday. I feel that making this happen will also bring money to local hotels and B&B's in London, Alrewas in Lichfield.",
        "background": "Remembrance Sunday is an event held all across the country on the 2nd Sunday in November. And to encourage people to attend these events futher afield instead of just local events I would like the Monday immediately after Remembrance Sunday to become a bank holiday",
