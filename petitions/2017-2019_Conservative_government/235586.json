        "action": "Make it a legal requirement to report injured/killed cats caused by vehicles",
        "additional_details": "Our pets make up a gigantic portion of our families and lives. Cats have no protection by law to be reported to the authorities after being hit by a vehicle. If a dog is hit by a vehicle it is mandatory to report it, the only reason being is to see if the owners are accountable to damages to the vehicle. Cats barely leave a scuff when hit by a car. Frankly this is inhumane and completely disregards the animal as being a member of somebody\u2019s family.",
        "background": "230,000 pet cats are run over on british roads yearly. That makes it 630 a day. This petition would not prevent the deaths of cats but it would at least give the owners peace of mind to knowing what happened to their beloved animals.",
