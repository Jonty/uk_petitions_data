Where did the funds for these lavish changes come from? The queen\u2019s Sovereign Grant \u2014 a sum of money funded by British taxpayers. I say this is unacceptable. And is only the tip of the iceberg of lavish spending on behalf of the royals at the expense of the tax payer. These, and other expenses, should be self funded.",
