        "additional_details": "As a student who is doing a full time course which is very time consuming, finding a way to earn money is crucial to survive. I am aware there is student discount for using public transport, for shops, restaurants etc. but what about reducing the price of fuel? I am a strong believer that this could benefit a lot of students. Petrol is so expensive. Driving my own vehicle will give me the flexibility to work after lectures.",
        "background": "As a college student who drives to college, I fill up my car with petrol around every 7-10 days. I am roughly putting in around \u00a325-\u00a330 every time. I am going to University in September and if I choose to commute (which may be the cheapest option), I will be driving 38.6 miles a day.",
