        "additional_details": "There are 14 days in total which are a part of university striking, which looses valuable lecture time for students who pay there money to study to a high standard in further education. \r\nAs this is the case we agree the lectures missed by this strike should automatically allow a 2:1 grade in compensation of limited lecture time.",
        "background": "Students pay \u00a39250, per year to allow them self\u2019s to be educated in a chosen subject. Without university students paying this money there would be a lack of professional people such as emergency services etc. With this strike it looses valuable time to achieve our grades for our degree.",
