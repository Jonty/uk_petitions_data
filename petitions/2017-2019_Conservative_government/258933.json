        "action": "Ban supermarkets from selling 5p/10p bags.",
        "additional_details": "Most supermarkets offer woven or natural fibre alternatives which are; more sturdy and more environmentally efficient. Working in a supermarket, these bags are bigger, cost on average 30p and last years unlike the cheap 5p/10p alternative that lasts all but a day for most shoppers. This ban would encourage the purchase of bags of these bigger, sturdier bags, much like the first phase of the 5p bag charge.",
        "background": "Working in retail, I hear all too often from customers that they have a pile of bags in the car but forgot them, so decide to buy extra plastic ones. Having plastic bags readily available significantly increases opportunity for plastic waste which is killing our environment and landfill.",
