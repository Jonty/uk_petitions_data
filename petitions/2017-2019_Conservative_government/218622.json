It is very important that no group or individual should have too much control of our news media or too much power to affect the political agenda.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mirror and the Express, represent different sides of the political spectrum, left and right respectively, thus the merger would put pressure on editorial decision-making; and reduce plurality promoted by J. S. Mill.",

The merged entity would own nine out of 20 national UK newspaper titles, with a 28 per cent share of monthly circulation. Thus, clearly, intervention is required to protect the market from monopolisation.",
