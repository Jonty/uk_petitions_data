        "additional_details": "In my opinion exams are pointless. Teachers are teaching students pointless information that you\u2019re never going to need in your life again. There\u2019s no need for end of year tests. We need to be learning about things that we\u2019re going to be dealing with in the future. Such as how to deal with taxes and how to self defend ourselves. Not to be able to name the first 15 square root numbers and to solve the equation of a line. This needs to change as there\u2019s more important things to learn in life.",
        "background": "Many teenagers are suffering with mental health issues and the main reason is due to exam stress. For example, GCSEs are just certificates to prove you went to secondary school. 3/4 the stuff we learn is irrelevant and won\u2019t be needed later in life. Learn about things such as setting up a business.",
