        "additional_details": "In a great many interviews and press releases, Teresa May has stated the government is preparing for a no-deal scenario ahead of the United Kingdom ending its membership of the European Union. However, the only funds being spent are on stunts and headline grabbing projects such as hiring ferries from a company which to date has none.\r\nPhilip Hammond should be forced to release monies to the apparatus of  public services immediately, rather than spending on follies designed to grab column inches.",
        "background": "Philip Hammond is blocking the funding for the apparatus of public services to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. It is clear he is putting his own agendum, remaining in the EU at all costs, ahead of the interests of the United Kingdom.",
