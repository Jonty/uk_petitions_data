        "additional_details": "Let\u2019s keep what\u2019s best in our system but look elsewhere for improvements. For example, Canada puts online what the PM wants from Ministers & Australia has an independent body to look at election promises. We are all held accountable in our own jobs but Ministers seem able to brush off investigations, even when there is clear evidence they have failed to deliver expensive projects. We also shouldn\u2019t need to go to Court to interpret how Parliament should function. Let\u2019s demand change.",
        "background": "The Brexit crisis has shown Parliament needs fixing. It has good features to keep but we the People want to see full-time MP\u2019s paid properly by us and not external donors, an end to political knighthoods as a loyalty thank-you, ministers who can acknowledge errors and written parliamentary rules.",
