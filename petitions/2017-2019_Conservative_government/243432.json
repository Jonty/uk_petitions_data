        "additional_details": "I feel it\u2019s very easy to start making eco friendly decisions now that we have the knowledge and resources, such as natural plant fibres and biodegradable plastics. The bamboo fibre are biodegradable, compostable, renewable and sustainable. This could also help with saving the planet and future generations. A happy ocean equals to a healthy planet. Bamboo grows fast and this will not interfere with nature.",
        "background": "High brand beauty products are used and the plastic containers are never recycled, therefore ending up in the ocean. I have always picked up rubbish or plastic from a young age whenever visiting a beach. I watched the tv documentary \u2018Drowning in plastic\u2019 I could only watch 20 minutes of it.",
