        "additional_details": "Terrorist will often show their respect for such action praising the MP's for their solidarity to their cause of violence. It seems the terrorist can honor them for such support yet our law doesn't see it that way . That honor and support could result in further violence being carried out and more money supplied to its violent cause. A whole new approach to understanding how voicing any support to terrorism or creating hatred to those defending against terrorism could result in more extremism",
        "background": "By any MP showing support or respect to the terrorist commemoration you are giving your approval of its violence and hatred to the innocent victims of terrorism. This will give it legitimacy in the eye's of terrorist and its supporters that their violence has its support within a democracy?",
