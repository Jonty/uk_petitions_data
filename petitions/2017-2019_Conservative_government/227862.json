        "action": "Lower the compulsory age of cervical smear test screenings to 18",
        "additional_details": "Had I not gone to the doctors, I would not have known about having precancerous cells until I was called for my routine smear test when I turn 25. Every year in the UK, 3000 women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer under the age of 35. Lowering the age of smear tests will give women the opportunity to detect precancerous cells earlier and get treatment if needed before they want to start a family.",
        "background": "After going to the doctors about pelvic pain I was luckily referred to a gynaecologist. After having abnormal swabs, I was sent for a colposcopy clinic to have my cervix examined. My biopsy results came back clear, but unfortunately this year they found precancerous cells on my cervix.",
