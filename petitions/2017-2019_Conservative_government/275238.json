        "additional_details": "Jacob Rees-Mogg MP misled the Queen. The Supreme Court found that the purpose of the prorogation was not to prepare for the Queens Speech, but rather to prevent Parliament performing its proper purpose, namely holding the Government to account. \r\n\r\nJacob Rees-Mogg either knew that was untrue or recklessly advised the Queen on an unlawful course of action. \r\n\r\nThe Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament states that \u201cBy virtue of the oath, or affirmation, of allegiance taken by all Members when they are elected to the House, Members have a duty to be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen... according to law\u201d and that \u201ca duty to uphold the law\u201d. The actions of Jacob Rees-Mogg in misleading the Queen were a clear breach of these duties.",
        "background": "Jacob Rees-Mogg MP unlawfully advised Her Majesty the Queen to prorogue Parliament and in doing so misled her as to its purpose.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons is therefore petitioned to bar Jacob Rees-Mogg from the House of Commons for at least 10 sitting days or 14 calendar days.",
