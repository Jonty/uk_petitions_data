        "additional_details": "As a female BME/BAME born and brought up in the UK. i totally understood where Naga Munchetty was coming from.  Just as Ms. Munchetty has been publicly humiliated, I feel she should be publicly apologised to. As a UK TV licence payer I am shocked that this is what my licence fee is helping support. Maybe the BBC should be looking at its policies, procedures and even staffing, to ensure they are diverse - like the public they serve!",
        "background": "Naga Munchetty has been treated appallingly by the BBC over comments she had made, following a statement President Trump made.  They have upheld a complaint over comments she made.  However the complaint was not the view of all the public.",
