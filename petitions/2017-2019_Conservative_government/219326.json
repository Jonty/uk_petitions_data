For example, you could ask the Government to reintroduce a specific road fund for the maintenance of the UK road network, if that's what you'd like to happen. \r\n\r\nIf you want vehicle tax to include a levy for the repair of roads maintained by local authorities, you may wish to sign this petition instead: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/217189\r\n\r\n\r\n"
