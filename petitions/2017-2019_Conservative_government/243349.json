        "additional_details": "The leave campaign was fined for over spending and there were many false statements including the \u201c\u00a3350 million to be spent on the NHS\u201d that influenced many people. The only way to respect the views of the British people would be to hold a new referendum now that the British public are fully aware of all the facts and realities that Brexit would entail.",
        "background": "On the 26th of June, the British public voted to leave the European Union based on false claims which is undemocratic. The vote was far to close to have some people influenced by statements that have since been revoked. A second, INFORMED referendum is the only democratic option.",
