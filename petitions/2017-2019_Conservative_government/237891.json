        "additional_details": "David Cameron said the result of the 2016 'Brexit' referendum was binding. Theresa May became PM on a mandate that promised we would leave both the Single Market and Customs Union by the 29th March 2019. However, Parliamentarians continue to try and thwart democracy. They forget that they are public servants paid for by the hard working people they are elected to REPRESENT. Those who act autocratically against the will of their constituents, as decided by a vote, should be immediately removable.",
        "background": "A majorty of UK constituencies voted to leave the EU. Alarmingly, many of the estimated 75% of MPs that supported 'Remain', contiune to lobby against Brexit. It shouldn't take a General Election to remove MPs that ignore the will of their constituents after an official vote.",
