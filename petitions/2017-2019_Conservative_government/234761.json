        "additional_details": "This quote from a previous petition by Hollie Campbell sums it up: BMA medical students committee joint deputy chair Tom Rock said: \u2018It\u2019s time the student finance system was reformed, so that what matters is not whether graduates are on a four or five-year course but that all graduate medical students have access to the tuition-fee loans they need in order to put their medical studies first and financial worries second.",
        "background": "My daughter is a medical student in her 2nd year. This is her second degree and she is on a 5-year course. She does not receive any fee loans for her tuition fees of \u00a39250 per year until her 5th year. Those on 4 year courses do. This clearly is unfair and is financially difficult and stressful.",
