        "additional_details": "If speed limits are increased or abolished, those who love to speed will at some point either get bored of speeding or will realise that the the faster they go, the more it costs them in fuel so will inevitably slow down to the current speeds set by the government.\r\n\r\nAlso, since removing the previous buffer of 10% +2mph and increased 20mph roads locally, motorways have become more of an attraction for speeding.\r\n\r\nA suggested limit if one was to be set would be of one more than 80mph.",
        "background": "It is known worldwide that as humans, we love to break rules and regulations. Having low speed limits on motorways and dual carriageways is in the least safer than no speed limits as countries like Germany and Italy with autobahns have proved with the safest roads in Europe.",
