        "action": "Make ALL Student Loan Repayments Tax Deductable (not just the interest).",
        "additional_details": "The argument for student loans is that a graduate earns more over their life, so needs to pay more.   However they also pay more tax, so it seems unfair to charge them 6% interest and expect them to pay higher tax rates.\r\nFor this reason I suggest that we make all student loan repayments, i.e. the interest AND capital repayments, tax deductible.",
        "background": "Currently students can be required to pay up to \u00a39,000 per year to pay for university courses.   For a typical BA/BSc this would be \u00a327,000 excluding the cost of living.   They also pay a high 6% interest rate on these loans, i.e. over 5% higher than the bank of England base rate.",
