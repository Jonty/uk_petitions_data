        "additional_details": "Negotiating away a unilateral right to leave the EU is the polar opposite to what the country voted for. \r\n\r\nFurther to this, it inhibits future governments from taking a different approach by vesting their power in the hands of the EU. \r\n\r\nIt must be enshrined in law that the UK must always retain a unilateral right to exit the EU in its entirety, including any backstop arrangements.",
        "background": "Being bound by a backstop agreement that can not be unilaterally exited is tying the UK further to the EU but without any seat at the table. \r\n\r\nThe people voted to leave and this option must remain open for future governments even if the present one can not deliver on its people\u2019s wishes.",
