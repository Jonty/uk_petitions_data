        "additional_details": "As the decades have gone by, both males and females have started to grow inches and feet taller than our ancestors, primarily due to better healthcare, living conditions and nutrition. Some women now have much larger feet than their grandmothers and it is felt that this is NOT reflected my a multitude of retailers. Many women have to IMPORT larger sized shoes from other countries and stock from UK retailers is massively underproduced BOTH in store and in online platforms.",
        "background": "I am aware of many women , including myself, who continually feel discriminated against and under represented in most high street shops and retailers, due to the huge  lack of large sized women\u2019s shoes. There seems to always be an abundance of other sizes , but a definite lack in size 8,9 and 10.",
