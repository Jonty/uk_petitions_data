[One theory is] that there is a \u2018female autism phenotype\u2019, which doesn\u2019t fit with the profile usually associated with men and boys on which assessment tools are usually based \u2013 leading to under diagnosis in women and girls. Diagnostic tests for women and girls should be modified accordingly.\"",
        "background": "There is a lack of understanding of the signs of Autism in females which has led to the under diagnosis of the condition. The diagnostic criteria is male oriented diagnostic and therefore inappropriate and needs changing so girls with autism are recognised and therefore supported.",
