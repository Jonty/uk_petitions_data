        "additional_details": "The current practice of psychiatry is almost exclusively based on a biochemical model. The outcome of this is that medication is seen as the only credible resort when treating patients suffering from psychotic illness. When patients suffer side effects they are seen as non-compliant and when they stop medication they are placed on CTOs. This violates the patient's autonomy to make decisions for themselves about their treatment.",
        "background": "If patients with physical illnesses such as cancer can refuse treatment mental health patients should also be able to do the same. The current practice of using the Mental Health Act to force treatment is coercive and a violation of the autonomy of the patient.",
