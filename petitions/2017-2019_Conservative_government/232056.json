A driving license doesn't deal with the skills and knowledge required to drive for a living. The level of training should be drastically increased to include a combination of The Knowledge and a more complex physical driving examination with limitations on the number of hours that PCO drivers can work.",
        "background": "Having recently been knocked off my motorcycle by a PCO driver, it has become clear that standards of driving by the huge number of PCO drivers in London urgently needs reviewing. Simply requiring a driving license is not enough.",
