Now is the time for them to fulfill their obligations and pay their full part in ensuring we live in a Tower Hamlets that is safe for all and where company and personal profit does not take precedence over lives.",

NPW has ACM cladding that must be removed. 18 months on from Grenfell, Ballymore - builder, freeholder and manager, has failed to make NPW safe",
