        "action": "The contract with a French firm to print the new UK passports must be cancelled.",
        "additional_details": "The present Home Secretary, Amber Rudd MP, is a declared Remainer with a husband who is a major donor to the continuing Remain in the EU campaign. By this decision, as well as many others, she had proved herself to be totally unsuitable for such a position of trust & to have lost the confidence of the people of Britain. The decision to offer the contract abroad demonstrates an absurd notion from her of what Brexit is trying to achieve & the danger of supporting the minority who aim to derail it.",
        "background": "The Home Secretary has made a gross error of judgement in offering the new UK Passports Contract to a French firm. It must be kept inside the UK, as much for security concerns as for economic ones, and Amber Rudd MP should be made to resign, or be sacked, for her betrayal of the principles.",
