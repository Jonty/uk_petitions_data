A general election will confuse the E.U. question with unrelated party political issues. It will not give a clear, democratic decision on the E.U. \r\n\r\nA general election would afford the opportunity to allow the electorate to provide a clear instruction to Parliament, whatever the outcome of the general election.",
        "background": "The last E.U. referendum is discredited. \r\nDemocracy demands a new referendum with clear, explicit choices:-\r\n\r\n1. Leave the E.U with no deal if a deal cannot be agreed.\r\n2. Leave with the current deal.\r\n3. Withdraw article 50 and remain in the E.U.",
