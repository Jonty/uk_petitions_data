Unfortunately Margaret Blackwood Association didn't take in to consideration where the complex disable residents would live as they cannot live independently. This Association also plan to build an 8 bedded unit locally however this again is for people who can be supported independently. Still no consideration to complex disabled young people.",
        "background": "This Care home has provided care and support to residents for 25yrs. It is a specialist care home for younger people who have complex disabilities and require 24hr care. There are no other facilities like this in the area or close by. It will be an enormous blow to the residents.",
