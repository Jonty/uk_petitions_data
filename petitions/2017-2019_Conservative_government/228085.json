        "additional_details": "The board was secured with 4 wood-screws which were easily accessible from the outside of the property.  These were removed by me in 5-7 seconds (video evidence available).\r\nI then took an extra 3 minutes to convert this poor work to what should have been done i.e. fixings used were only accessible from inside the property (video evidence available)\r\nPublic bodies should not be procuring this work on behalf of members of the public.  It leaves properties unnecessarily vulnerable.",
        "background": "RapidSecure recently left my mother's property in an unsecured state following breakage of a window to facilitate paramedic assistance.\r\nOn contacting the company they have assured me that this work is typical and they will continue to perform these tasks to the same standard.",
