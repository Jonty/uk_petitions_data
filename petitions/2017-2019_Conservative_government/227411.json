        "background": "Attacks in different disguises against Muslims spreading hatred require laws to stop provocative insults to the Prophet deliberately aimed at causing offence leading to communal disharmony and religious intolerance.",

You can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cps.gov.uk/hate-crime\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n"
