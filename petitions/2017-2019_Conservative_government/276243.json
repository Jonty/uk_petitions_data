We can only accept petitions which call for actions that are the responsibility of the Government or Parliament. You could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nCustomers may already be entitled to refunds. You can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://thomascook.caa.co.uk/\r\n\r\nThere are already petitions about this issue. There's a petition calling for a public inquiry:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/274851\r\n\r\nThere's also a petition calling for the Government to fund a compensation scheme for Thomas Cook staff owed pay:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/275778\r\n\r\nYou might like to sign one of these petitions. You're more likely to get action on this issue if you sign and share a single petition."
