        "additional_details": "If we do not allow our youth a say in the future of their country - which ultimately will impact them for a longer time than those who are older - we are not practising true democracy. Unless we allow our young people to have an equal say, we cannot accurately state that \"the people have spoken.\" It's extremely unfair to disregard a whole segment of the population based on their age and inexperience. Please sign this petition - regardless of your age - in favour of a fair and true democracy.",
        "background": "It is over 2 years since the EU referendum took place, and in that time thousands of young people who were not eligible to vote, have now passed 18 years of age, and should be entitled to vote on this vitally important issue that will impact their futures.",
