        "additional_details": "When the pro EU house of commons finally get their way and either get \"no deal\" off the table, win enough support for a second referendum or even worse, stop Brexit totally, democracy in this country has finally died.\r\nThe only action left for Exit voters to take, when a date has been set for a second referendum is to have a complete boycott and DO NOT BOTHER GOING TO VOTE!! after all what is the point?\r\nWould another referendum with 17.4 million voters absent be worth anything?",
        "background": "MP`s are now openly calling for a second referendum completely ignoring the will of the democratic majority in the biggest democratic exercise this country has ever seen. Brexit voters have now more or less been silenced. We should have a blanket boycott when the 2nd referendum inevitably happens.",
