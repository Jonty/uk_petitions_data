        "additional_details": "Suicide is now at its all time highest, with it being the most common cause of death for men aged 20-49 across England and Wales. More and more pressures have emerged that we as humans were not originally designed to deal with such as financial worries, the rise of social media and having demanding jobs so there is no wonder 1 in 15 of us have made a suicide attempt at some point in our lives.",
        "background": "With how society is nowadays, it is very easy to find yourself struggling. An annual mental health check will give everyone a chance to talk about their feelings to a trained professional who will be able to react to this in a more proactive way than a friend who may not know how to deal with it.",
