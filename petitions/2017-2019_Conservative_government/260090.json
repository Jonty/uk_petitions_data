        "additional_details": "I was botched twice in the UK after two rhinoplasty surgeries gone wrong. My surgeon was advertised to me as a rhinoplasty specialist - I then learnt he had no specialist training for rhinoplasty procedures but is still legally entitled to call himself a specialist. As a result I am having to travel over seas for a reconstructive rhinoplasty specialist to fix the mess I have been left with.",
        "background": "Plastic surgeons in the UK can call themselves a specialist in a certain surgery without the extensive training. This results in dissatisfied patients and botched results. I want to change this to stop anyone going through the emotional and physical trauma of living with a botched result.",
