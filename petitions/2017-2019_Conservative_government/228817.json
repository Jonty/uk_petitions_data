If we do manage to get out we constantly worry about where the nearest WC is as you can be in desperate need at any given moment. Some of us have had bowel ruptures requiring emergency surgery and ICU admissions, fistulas where the Bowles connect to another organ that requires surgery. Myself I have caught a superbug that is antibiotics resistant as a result of many hospital admissions.",

Many of us suffer pain on a daily basis, have frequent hospital admissions and find it very difficult to hold down a job due to this, most resulting in disciplinary meetings, warnings and the sack.",

In most cases, it\u2019s the impact that a health condition has on the person\u2019s life that qualifies them for support or protection under the law. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more about how to show that you're disabled under the Equality Act here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/protected-characteristics/showing-you-re-disabled-under-the-equality-act/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the UK Government or Parliament to do to support people who are suffering from diverticular disease."
