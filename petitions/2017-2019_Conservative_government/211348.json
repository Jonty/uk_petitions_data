        "additional_details": "The UK sells tonnes of arms to Turkey's tyrannical government who recently cracked down on free speech and violently suppressed ethnic minorities. The government has dubious links to Islamism and a terrible human rights record. Meanwhile, the SDF have been fighting ISIS in Syria, many Kurds are part of the SDF hence Turkey's invasion of their land. We should be opposing Turkey not enabling them. (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/28/100m-arms-deal-turkey-blind-eye-rights-abuse)",
        "background": "The Kurds and SDF in Northern Syria (Rojava) helped defeat ISIS and their democratic model presents a beacon of hope for war-torn Syria. The illegal Turkish invasion violates international law and human rights standards. The UK government must oppose this and stop selling Turkey weapons.",
