        "additional_details": "I work with women who experience abuse and see an increase in abuse to women especially in late night venues. Government needs to address the rising levels of sexual harassment that women experience in late night bars and clubs, by changing licensing laws to require landlords and venue owners to train staff on how to respond to sexual harassment complaints effectively.  A change in the law will ensure a clear message to those who harass others, and to those who just want the harassment to stop.",
        "background": "By training staff once a year, venues can ensure that staff know what to do and who to report to, ensuring women feel safe.This can be provided by existing trainers, and has been piloted in Southwark council. Training costs, which are low, could be covered by the venues.",
