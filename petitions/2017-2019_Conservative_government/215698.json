        "additional_details": "There has been an increasing body of evidence to suggest that there were interfering influences in the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum.\r\nThink foreign interference, illegal acquisition of data without consent,  psychological profiling, fake news, misleading campaigns and undeclared financing.\r\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg. If the government does not invalidate the referendum result then it is laughing in the face of democracy and becomes an accomplice in illegal and unscrupulous methods.",
        "background": "Do you believe in democracy? Whatever you think about the EU referendum result, the government argues it must respect the democratic vote. However, evidence suggests the vote was illegally influenced by external sources and unethical methods, hence undemocratic. It should therefore be annulled.",
