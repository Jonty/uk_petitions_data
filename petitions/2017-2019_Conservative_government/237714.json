        "additional_details": "The police told me that he was looked after and being fed there\u2019s nothing I could do. Last week I saw a video of my boy at the local kennels immediately made contact. I told them I\u2019m going to do whatever it take to bring him home, They let me go see him. They told me yes he\u2019s my dog he\u2019s in my name still. But he\u2019s been there over 7 days so he\u2019s no longer mine. He\u2019s not allowed home and he\u2019s got a new family. The law should allow people like me to reclaim their pets.",
        "background": "I was made homeless 4 years ago and was placed in bed and breakfast so I couldn\u2019t take my dog with me. We had him two years from a puppy. So I found a friend who was willing to look after him till I got my home. I was paying for my boys expenses and food only for him to sell him.",
