        "action": "Make statutory Adoption Pay available for the self-employed.",
        "additional_details": "Therefore it should follow that a Self Employed person adopting should be entitled to Adoption Pay. There is currently no such allowance!\r\n\r\nThis is particluarly difficult when single adopters or one partner of adopters are required to take a minimum of 6 to12 months unpaid adoption leave!\r\n\r\nI petition the Government to introduce an Adoption Pay for Self Employed people.",
        "background": "This e-petition highlights the discrimination faced by Self Employed people wishing to adopt children. \r\n\r\nAs an `employee' it has been recognised that there is an entitlement to Statutory Adoption Pay, as there is for Statutory Maternity Pay. For Self Employed people there is Maternity Allowance.",
