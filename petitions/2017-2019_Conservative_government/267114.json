        "action": "Require owners of domestic cats to control and be responsible for their animals",
        "additional_details": "Domestic cats are vectors of pathogens such as Toxoplasma Gondii that kill non resistant species. Allowing them to foul other people's property poses human health risks. Our indigenous wildlife faces many threats and cats in the UK catch up to 275 million prey items a year, of which 55 million are birds. This is the number of prey items which were known to have been caught. We don't know how many more the cats caught, but didn't bring home, or how many escaped but subsequently died.",
        "background": "Domestic cats are a direct anthropogenic threat to wildlife, biodiversity and human health. They are introduced, invasive species that never existed in nature and don't belong there now.  Owners of ALL other creatures must keep them contained or under control and cats should not be an exception.",
