The wooden timers are rotten and covered with metal sheeting which has moved and bent over time. which has resulted in raise trip hazzards and sharp edges. \r\nMy concern is that if this had happened to a child it would have caused long term problems and the council would not pay compensation due to using its repaired on a reactive basis even tho they have carried out temp repairs.",
        "background": "After my dog was badly injuried after having two claws ripped out from the root. I reported it to the council only for them to deny liability even tho they went and repaired the area. They use the wording (reactive) only maintaining it when its reported to be faulty. They would not pay fees.",
