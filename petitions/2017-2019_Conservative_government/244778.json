        "additional_details": "In Australia, other countries and some states in the US, on-the-spot fines have been introduced to deter pedestrians from crossing the road while distracted. In the US, \"distracted walking\" is one of the largest causes of injury in collisions between a motor vehicle and pedestrian. \r\nFines could be issued by police, or civil enforcement officers who now have a wide range of duties such as environmental and parking enforcement and parking. Fines should be a deterrent, and not a punishment.",
        "background": "While driving, I and many other motorists see pedestrians crossing a road without paying due care or attention to their surroundings - some use a mobile phone while crossing the road too. It seems like my worst nightmare to hit a pedestrian even if it was their fault. Pedestrians must pay attention.",
