        "additional_details": "Parents who have parental responsibility must be asked permission for their child to go or move abroad, and to change the child(rens) surname. The also have the rights to view medical and school records, and rights remove a child from of school if they wanted, regardless of the duration of absence from the child. Many parents are beholden to the law that provides absent parents with legal rights. Voluntary exclusion for a continuous 2 year period should receive voluntary removal of these rights.",
        "background": "Assuming that 2 years is a reasonable timescale to measure a genuine marital separation and grounds for a divorce, this should also be applied to remove parental responsibility rights whereby an absent parent is never present, un-contactable and pays no maintenance for a continuous period of 2 years",
