        "additional_details": "Failure in the last three years to actively revoke or implement article 50 as MPs have failed to ensure that Great Britain either remains or leaves the EU with or without a deal. The public now have enough information to decide on their own requirements and it is clear that all major political parties now have an agenda on whether that is remain / leave  with a deal or leave with or without a deal. Therefore the public can now clearly decide which political party and therefore decide on Brexit.",
        "background": "As MP's have failed in either direction on Brexit and appear very much to have the mandate to decide on what the public actually want without any such mandate or direction from the public. A General Election should be held to decide the matter via public vote one way or the other.",
