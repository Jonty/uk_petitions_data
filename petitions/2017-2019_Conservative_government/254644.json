        "additional_details": "Since the last snap General election called by Teresa May, and the failure of this government to secure Britain's future following the departure from the EU, the public faith in the democracy of our country has waned. After the Brexit deadline of April 12th, no matter what the outcome, the Government should call a General Election to allow the public to choose who should lead the country into the next steps in post-Brexit Britain and allow faith in democracy to be restored through the most democratic of all processes.",
