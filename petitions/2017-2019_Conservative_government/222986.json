        "action": "Introduce an \"Interest Surcharge\" tax to finance additional NHS exenditure.",
        "additional_details": "Consumer debt is currently around \u00a31.6 trillion so a 1% surcharge would raise almost all the required additional NHS spending. It is hard to see who would be a significant loser from such a move, especially as the alternative of raising traditional taxes such as Income Tax, Corporation Tax or VAT would erode the meagre antiicipated economic growth to the point where the net increased tax raised could be very small.",
        "background": "An  \"Interest Surcharge\" will contain inflation, without strengthening the pound or hurting exports.  VAT registerees would reclaim the surcharge. Thus only consumers would be affected, but would gain from the deferring  of increased Base Rates. 1% surcharge raises \u00a316 bn  - almost the NHS needs.",
