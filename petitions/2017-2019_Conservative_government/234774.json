        "action": "Give the Bloodhound SSC landspeed record attempt the \u00a325m needed for completion",
        "additional_details": "Supporting this project will show the government is committed to the futures of the British STEM industries and the nation's children. The project will have shown an entire generation that highly skilled jobs are available to them and will show these children and the wider public the value of STEM. With the project having been axed, this petition represents the last chance for the public and government to intervene in a project that can have a lasting impact on the nation's STEM sectors.",
        "background": "The Bloodhound Supersonic Car (SSC) project is looking to beat the current landspeed record and reach 1,000mph. It has already inspired thousands of school children to pursue careers in STEM and the final \u00a325m needed for completion will ensure it can reach more, helping the UK's future economy.",
