The way the house of commons is comporting itself is not representative of the electorate irregardless of individual views on Brexit. As the seat of democracy, it is currently not representing the views of the people. I propose..\r\n1) Extend Brexit date a further 2 years\r\n2) call a general election to replace MPs and provide a clear mandate\r\n3) re-engage in Brexit with a clear mandate that MPs have been elected into office to deliver.",
