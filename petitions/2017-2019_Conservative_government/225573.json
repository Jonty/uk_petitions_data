The crime is unforgivable and I think we have a duty as a society to call for more action which will protect the general public. \r\n\r\n- Approximately 85,000 women and 12,000 men are raped in England and Wales alone every year.\r\n- Rape Crisis specialist services were accessed by 78,461 individuals an increase of 17% from 2016-17.",
        "background": "I would like the government to review current law and to implement a 3-point plan.\r\n\r\nEducate - To make sexual education compulsory in all Secondary schools.\r\nPrevent - Increased awareness around high-risk areas (nightclubs, pubs etc).\r\nProsecute - Increase current minimum term guideline for crimes.",
