        "additional_details": "One criticism of the American system is that teaching is more superficial than in UK higher education. I would argue, however, that students will gain a more rounded education this way. \r\n\r\nMy reference for the way the HE system works in America is: https://www.studyusa.com/en/a/58/understanding-the-american-education-system\r\n\r\nMy reference for the American system being more superficial is: https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/jun/30/uk-universities-better-education-dont-be-seduced-by-us",
        "background": "In the first two years of study, in the American higher education system, you will generally be required to take a wide variety of classes in different subjects. I feel this is better than picking what you want to study ahead of going to university because you get a more rounded education.",
