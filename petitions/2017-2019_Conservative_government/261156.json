        "additional_details": "RTA states that if you fail to stop after hitting a dog in an RTC you can be fined up to \u00a35,000. At present hitting a cat does not need to be reported but instead is seen as 'common decency' and 'kindness'. Yet in the Animal Welfare Act (2006) it states their are penalties for cruelty to animals including cats such as; 6 months in prison, a fine up to \u00a320,000 or a ban from owning animals. Surely leaving a cat to die at the side of the road or to lay there dead is CRUELTY?",
        "background": "At present, under the Road Traffic Act, only dogs (and larger animals) who are hit in an RTC must be reported. We want to make it a law that cats must also be reported or taken to the vets immediately. Cats are a part of the family, as much as dogs are, and must be given respect and care.",
