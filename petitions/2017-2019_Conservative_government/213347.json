If somebody dies due to a lack of education it\u2019s not their fault it\u2019s yours.",
        "background": "First aid should be taught so if someone needed any treatment on the street they would have a higher chance of survival/minimal injury.And it will reduce the pressure on the NHS as they won\u2019t have to treat as many people beacuse some injuries can be treated on scene.",
