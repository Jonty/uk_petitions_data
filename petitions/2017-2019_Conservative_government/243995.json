I have had to sit in A & E recently for 9 hours with my father due to chest pains and as you can see it cost me \u00a39.10 to park which is disgusting. I am on a very tight budget and just can not afford the charges. We shouldn\u2019t have to worry about parking at hospitals. Please help us stop the charges.",
        "background": "Parking charges are so high at many hospitals that people sometimes have to cancel appointments as they can not afford the parking charges, especially the disabled and elderly as often they are on a low income. The charges are a burden to all who need treatment or are visiting friends and loved ones",
