Sadly for the political class that means severing your hopes of jobs within the E.U and vast wages, expenses and pensions. Hoping to kick the can down the road with an extension whilst doing all in your powers to go against the majority of your own voters in the largest turnout for an election ever held is arguably tantamount to treason. Enough is enough get on with your duty or resign and make way for someone who will.",
        "background": "No extension to article 50, you lot have had 2.5 years to cobble something together and an extension will help nobody. Just get on with delivering on your instructions from the majority that voted leave.",
