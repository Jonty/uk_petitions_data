The two stations are put in as two applications, each just under 50MW, so as not to be \u2018national infrastructure\u2019 projects (at over 100MW).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a purely opportunistic development that undermines proposals for decarbonization of our power supply and flies in the face of the declaration of climate emergency by South Oxfordshire D.C. Any need for \u2018balancing power\u2019 stations to support renewable energy has never been properly discussed at a national level and there is no evidence that this development forms part of any coherent strategy.\r\n\r\nLets\u2019 get this mad idea thrown out now.",
