        "additional_details": "I am currently residing in one of the flats here in London. We have a neighbour who smokes and we smell it is not a cigaret nor tabaco in origin. We told the police and the housing association but their hands are tied due the fact that these properties are not only rented but owned. These are sharedownership properties. Our landlord, told us that there are no laws in the UK that prohibits smoking in their flats. Hence I am writing a petition. This is for the wellbeing of my family.",
