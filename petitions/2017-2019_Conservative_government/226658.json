        "additional_details": "The costs on the airports of the current monopoly carrier (IAG World Cargo) starts from 1000 GBP per sigle flight (example from Venice-Heathrow flight for a 5 kg dog that will have to be put in hold). \r\nIt was impossible to fly from/to any other airports than the DEFRA pre-authorized ones. E.g. no authorized flights from/to Cardiff. \r\nPet owners are transporting their dogs and cats in alternative manners which are not the best for the animal's well being as current system doesn't work for most.",
        "background": "Pet owners are asking the government to standardize UK flight prices for pet travel to no more than a reservation and flight ticket price of a passenger's seat. Travel crate with a pet up to 10kg can be safely placed on a seat with a standard seatbelt (done with KLM). Any airport should be eligible.",
