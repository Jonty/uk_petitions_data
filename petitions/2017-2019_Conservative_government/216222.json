        "action": "Introduce tax relief for the deduction of season ticket loans through PAYE",
        "additional_details": "This is a proposal to reduce the hit of the rising train prices. Employers should be able to deduct the loan repayment before tax and NI is calculated to reduce the taxable salary. Employees will receive tax relief at their marginal rate.\r\n\r\nCommuters traveling to London in particular are often young professionals with high exam fees, reflected with lower salaries to cover studying costs paid by the employer. Currently there are no financial aids / cheaper tickets for such individuals.",
        "background": "Travelling to work can be expensive and many employers offer loans to cover the cost of train season tickets. Train tickets are increasing every year and are a huge financial burden. This loan is usually repaid to the employer proportionately each month after national insurance and tax is deducted.",
