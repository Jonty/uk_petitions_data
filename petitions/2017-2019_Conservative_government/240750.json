        "additional_details": "MPs and Peers invoking \u201cProject Fear\u201d rarely give evidence thereof. In order to maintain transparency and avoid renewed allegations of lying against Vote Leave, members of both houses can show the faith in their own arguments. Disclosure of asset divestment should include divestments by legal entities listed in the Register of Members\u2019 Financial Interests.",
        "background": "MPs & Peers must disclose how much of their assets they have moved out of the UK and/or away from Pound Sterling since the 2016 Brexit referendum. Those claiming that warnings about economic outcomes are Project Fear should be able to demonstrate a strong faith in a post-Brexit UK economy.",
