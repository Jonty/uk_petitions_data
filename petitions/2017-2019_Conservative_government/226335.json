        "action": "Make car parking in hospitals free of charge for patients and visitors",
        "additional_details": "Many family members and friends also visit the people in hospital and they also have to pay the parking fee. In most cases you can buy a fortnight ticket, however if the patient is in the hospital for a substantial length of time, the cost for parking is ridiculous. Some families struggle financially and the added car parking fee for regular child check ups or if the child does have a severe condition means the cost is ever more increasing.",
        "background": "Being a patient in hospital is not a choice, it is not like going to the cinema or shopping, car parking fees are costly and despite it being free for the first 20 minutes, for many appointments you need to be there at least 15 minutes in advance and therefore pay around a \u00a32.00 fee for 1hour.",
