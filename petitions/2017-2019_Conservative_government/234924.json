        "action": "Approve the Draft Withdrawal Agreement, to avoid a no deal exit from the EU.",
        "additional_details": "The problem is the 'backstop'. There is no possible arrangement with the EU which does not have to grapple with the avoidance of a hard border between Eire and Northern Ireland. A 'Norway Plus' agreement cannot be negotiated until we have left the EU and would leave the UK agreeing to free movement of workers. Were the UK to enter the backstop on 1 January 2021, the UK we would still have left the EU, freedom of movement would cease, as would further financial contributions to the EU.",
        "background": "On 29 March 2019 the UK leaves the EU. Without a withdrawal agreement there will be significant disruption to trade and there is the prospect of shortages of food and medicines. The draft withdrawal agreement concluded by the Prime Minister is the only way to avoid this.",
