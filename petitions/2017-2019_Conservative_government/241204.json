        "background": "The climate is an ever changing place. Fuel emissions is one of the contributing factors, causing environmental change. This impact could however be minimised with the use of E10 fuel. This is a bioethanol blend of 10% ethanol and 90% oil, overall E10 could help reduce car emissions by 10%.",
