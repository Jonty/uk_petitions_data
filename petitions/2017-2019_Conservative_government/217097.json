        "additional_details": "Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder, with at least 20% of Anorexia sufferers dying prematurely. (Source: BEAT Eating Disorders). Full recovery from this illness involves moving away from all preoccupation with food. Therefore, calorie counting is incompatible with recovery and may lead to a rise in eating disorders. Please support me to ensure more people are protected from this life-ruining condition.",
        "background": "PHE have launched several initiatives to make people more 'calorie-aware'. This includes Change4Life's 'look for 100-calorie snacks, two a day max' and the One You Campaign, which advises adults to follow a 400-600-600 diet. Calorie Counting leads to a fixation on numbers and disordered eating.",
