        "additional_details": "The government has finally reached the conclusion that 4 months is not enough time with the strict measures to find a job in the UK post-graduation. Keeping talented foreign students is something that should be actively encouraged, but not in 3 years time as this new policy suggests but immediately. Change the policy for those who want to stay and find jobs; our country needs motivated intelligence now more than ever.",
        "background": "The government has finally agreed to end Theresa May's 4-month time limit for foreign students post-graduation to find a job in the UK. However, the effects of this change only come in for foreign students starting next year. This policy should be extended to all those on Tier 4 student visas now.",
