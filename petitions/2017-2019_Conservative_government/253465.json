        "additional_details": "We have been negotiating an exit deal since the Brexit vote and it has become clear that the UK is not going to get a deal that either the People or the Government will accept. \r\nNow is the time to accept that the only possible deals the EU are going to offer will leave us in an unacceptable situation for many years with no further say in future outcomes. \r\nIn view of this the only possible option is to leave on WTO terms and build our future as we see fit and on our own terms.",
        "background": "It has been clear for the last few months that the EU is not going to give the UK anything like an acceptable deal, which is why MP's have not been able to support any of the current options.\r\nWith this deadlock between the EU and UK we have no choice but to leave and start building our own future.",
