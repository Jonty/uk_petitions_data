        "additional_details": "We demand that the rail fares are measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which is a more accurate measurement of price change of goods and services in the country.\r\n\r\nIf rail fare increase go ahead, it will outpace current inflation rate (2.4%) and average wage earnings growth (2.7%) this year (Source; ONS).\r\n\r\nTrain Performance has fallen in the last 8 years across the UK to its lowest point this year (Source; ORR). This is a worrying trend as the cost of rail fares continue to increase.",
        "background": "We are tired of paying for poor train service. Quality of service (especially, punctuality) has  deteriorated because of the high train fares and low train performance (Source; RPI).\r\n\r\nWe demand that the government intervene and hold rail fares at or below the current inflation rate of 2.4%.",
