        "additional_details": "The actions of governments should reflect the moral compass of their societies. When governments & political organisations; cover up wrong-doing, prosecute whistleblowers for revealing embarrassing and inconvenient truths, deceive the public & soil the basic tenants of democracy, they must be held to account. Cue journalism and whistleblowers. Politicians talk about the importance of whistleblowers one minute and then advocate the incarceration of Julian Assange, the next. Enough is enough.",
        "background": "The UK government claims it supports the freedom of the press as a basic principle of democracy. Julian Assange is a journalist and his news organisation Wikileaks is a publisher of facts. His political witch-hunt is the ultimate hypocrisy. He shouldn't be extradited anywhere for publishing facts.",
