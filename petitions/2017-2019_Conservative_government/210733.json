        "action": "Decrease strictness of haircut rule within the Mossbourne Federation",
        "additional_details": "This has created many problems within and outside the academy itself. Firstly, it makes students feel extremely self-conscious and lowers their confidence when meeting with friends from other schools as they can decide what haircuts they desire unlike mossbourne students who must look plain and simple. Furthermore, it doesn't mirror the multicultural society in which London is openly accepting of people expressing themselves through their hair and denying because of their culture and denying this is cultural deprivation.",
        "background": "I am a student who goes to a secondary school called Mossbourne Victoria Park Academy. There are many policies withing the academy all students have to abide by, however one of the rules is that male students must have simple haircuts with no difference between the sides and the top.",
