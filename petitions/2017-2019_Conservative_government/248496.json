The beneficiaries of 'winner takes all' voting are highly organised, massively funded, parties to the exclusion of minorities.\r\n\r\nOur electoral system is unfit for the 21st century.",
        "background": "Recent events show how, with a first-past-the-post system, decisions of huge import can be decided by tiny margins, especially with low turnout.  It is wrong that MPs are elected, or referendums decided, by simple majority, especially when voting is optional.  Proportional and mandatory voting, now.",
