        "additional_details": "Either do not send a pregnant woman to prison for sentences less than 5 years or assure them a place at a Mother & Baby Unit for the length of their sentence. The child's health & development needs would have to be met. Currently, it is only when a mother enters prison that they can apply for a place at a Mother & Baby Unit but they have no guarantee of getting the place. Mothers who cannot read or write cannot even apply for a place. A Mother & Baby Unit must be available to all pregnant women.",
        "background": "There are 13 female UK prisons & only 6 of them have Units for Mothers&Babies. Those 6 Units only have 54 places but each year more than 100 babies are born. Damaging these babies lives can be stopped if pregnancy is made a mandatory factor in sentencing law under the Coroners & Justice Act 2009.",
