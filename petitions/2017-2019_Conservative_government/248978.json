        "additional_details": "Some families are not able to get to \u201cdestination parks\u201d such as greenhead park etc. Taking play and exercise equipment and funding away from doorstep parks will have a massive negative impact on children of Kirklees.\r\nChildren are already at risk of online gaming addiction, removing local play equipment will increase this risk and will not support the development of children in Kirklees.",
        "background": "More than 100 of our 342 will be modernised but most will be converted into play spaces with no swings or slides.\r\nWith excercise and play being a pivotal part of children\u2019s development, and online play becoming an increasing issue funding should be put into local areas to encourage children\u2019s play.",
