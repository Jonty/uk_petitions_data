        "additional_details": "More precisely, according to ICM\u2019s survey, 75% of 16 and 17 year olds voted (Scottish independence referendum) , compared with 54% of 18-24 year olds and 72% of 25-34 year olds. The 16 and 17 years olds voted more than  those,  who actually have the right to vote.\r\n\r\nCitizenship classes have been a compulsory part of the national curriculum for 11- to 16-year-olds in England since 2002.\r\n\r\nMore than 100,000 teenagers take a qualification in citizenship each year.",
        "background": "We believe 16/17 years old should have the chance to vote and have a say about their future. Younger people are now more educated than ever in politics and how voting affects society as technology and lessons like citizenship teach children and young people about politics and the basis of voting.",
