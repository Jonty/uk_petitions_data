She is not fit to represent the people of Sunderland and she should resign as MP.\r\nThe people deserve a member of parliament who listens to our own viewpoints and acts accordingly, not who dances to the beat of her own drum. We need someone who shares the majority\u2019s standpoint and fights for what we want and need as a community.",

Democracy must be respected and therefore she must represent the people vote.\r\nThe people have spoken and she has taken her own stance on the issue. The people want her to endorse the Democratic decision.",
