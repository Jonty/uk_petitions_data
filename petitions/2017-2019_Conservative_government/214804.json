        "additional_details": "Aberdeenshire Council plan to replace the current pitch like for like in the summer which is not suitable for football matches. We have to make better use of the facility by having it full all weekend rather than having it sitting empty most weekends.",
        "background": "The current Astro pitch sits empty 35 weekends of the year while kids football games get called off every other week. Hundreds of kids losing out on valuable game time. We want the current pitch replaced to a 3G or 4G pitch so Football can use it for games and have the facility used more often.",
