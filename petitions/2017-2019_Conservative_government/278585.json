        "additional_details": "People should have to apply to buy and use fireworks on committed dates only, or better still, only controlled licensed events be able to use them. Children are getting their hands on cheap fireworks and it's only a matter of time before someone gets seriously injured.\r\nMore to the point our animals are suffering and dying of fright. Do we really need to see another pathetic rocket or catherine wheel?",
        "background": "Anyone can get their hands on fireworks, including children who are misusing them by terrorising vulnerable people in the communities. They cause noise and air pollution and most importantly animals are having heart attacks and in some cases even dying because they are so scared.",
