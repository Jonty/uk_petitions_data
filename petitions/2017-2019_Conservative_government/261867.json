        "additional_details": "The Eurovision Song Contest is the largest pan-European exercise outside the EU elections on 23rd May. The margin of victory for Norway was appreciably higher than that achieved in the Leave campaign in 2016. It is therefore a much more pressing matter that Norway\u2019s victory is respected and not that of faceless bureaucrats rather wasting more time trying to leave the European Union. Norway means Norway.",
        "background": "The gap between the public vote for Norway and that of the Netherlands (291 votes to 261) was larger than that of the EU referendum in 2016 and therefore has greater legitimacy. If necessary, diplomatic relations with the Netherlands will need to be severed unless urgent corrective action is taken.",
