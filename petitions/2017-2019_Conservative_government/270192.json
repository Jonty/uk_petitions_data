        "additional_details": "On the Portland Place/Devonshire Street two junctions, it's difficult to have any time to cross without running and hoping a car will stop for you, as the light goes red but cars are coming from two other corners. There are green/red man lights on other junctions. This junction is where many school children cross throughout the day as there are many schools on Portland Place. I'm asking for red/green man lights to be put on both junctions to enable pedestrians to cross safely and without fear.",
        "background": "The traffic in Portland Place is hazardous. There are many schools on this busy street. Traffic lights may go red on the two Portland Place/Devonshire St junctions, but there are still buses/vehicles coming round the corner.",
