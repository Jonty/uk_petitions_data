        "additional_details": "At 16 you are mature enough to understand politics and are considered an adult in almost every other aspect but the government refuses what the people want; a more democratic country. and if you are going to say we are too lazy or immature to vote you're forgetting the 13 million adults who didn't vote in the EU referendum.",
        "background": "Give 16 and 17 year old's the right to vote the same as any other tax payer would be able to. At 16 and 17 you are old enough to join the army, drink alcohol and smoke, gamble, pay tax and marry yet you are not allowed to have a say in our country's politics. This needs to change.",
