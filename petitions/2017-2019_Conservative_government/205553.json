        "background": "Under EU law, animals are currently recognised as being capable of feeling pain and emotion. But MPs have voted to drop the inclusion of animal sentience into the Withdrawal Bill.\r\n\r\nThe term Sentience or Sentient Being doesn't appear once in that Act, and the Act doesn't cover all animals.",
