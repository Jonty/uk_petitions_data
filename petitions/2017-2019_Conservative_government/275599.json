        "action": "General Election to be held before October 17th without blocking no deal brexit",
        "additional_details": "The only evidence needed is to look at the current situation in parliament, we are stuck in a deadlock and the people are now being held to ransom over the request to remove a no deal brexit from the negotiation table. All options must be open to the PM (whoever that may be after an election) to ensure that he/she has the full suite of negotiating capabilities behind them.",
        "background": "The people of this country deserve a general election as soon as practicable possible without the requirement to remove no deal as this is a central part of any possible brexit negotiation that is to take place after the election is held. This should be held before the forthcoming EU council meeting",
