        "additional_details": "The 2016 referendum answered the question for a generation, lets book the date now 20 years after the first to decide whether to rejoin.\r\nThere are no good options left, no option that won't anger one side. We cannot continue. It is democratic to be able to change our minds, but it can't be done until after we actually leave, and Politicians need to restore trust that the 2016 vote is respected. Giving an option to get back in, in a generations time, is fair. It is also a compromise between both sides, the UK would be less likely to diverge too much, the EU would want to work in a way that encourage us to rejoin.",
        "background": "The referendum option is primarily pushed by those who want to over-turn the result, we could have one on the Leave options, being No Deal vs any new deal negotiated by Boris Johnson or Theresa May's deal.\r\n",
