        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom held a national referendum on our membership of the EU. The choices were clear, it was an in or out referendum, and the majority voted leave. The then prime minister resigned and another was put in place. She called for a general election in which she was the hot favourite to win. She then ran a negative campaign where she singled out the elderly for criticism. Thus she was left in charge of a minority government. She eventually resigned, leaving the new guy with no chance.",
        "background": "For three years Europhile MPs have managed to hold back our exit from the EU. They have done this in spite of the public having voted leave in a national referendum. It is time they either respect the will of the people or stand down as MPs. They won\u2019t do that, so a general election is needed.",
