        "additional_details": "Most hospital car parks are not big enough to cope with staff and patients. On average we charge the staff 30-50 pounds a month and even then they are not guaranteed a space meaning they might have to park outside of a space they have already paid for and get a fine just so they can go and complete a 12 hour shift looking after sick people",
        "background": "Why do we charge our nhs staff to park at work and fine them when there isn\u2019t enough space to park. Our nhs is the best medical service in the world why do we choose to penalise these hard workers.",
