        "additional_details": "The electorate is surely tired of continuous bickering and the constant recycling of old arguments. The media is spreading far too much doom and they too have a responsibility to discuss the positives of Brexit rather than using hyperbole to make headlines.\r\nAll politicians across the house must now work to find a solution rather than playing politics and ignoring the referendum result. We should expect politicians to work together and recognise the electorate's decision to leave the EU.",
        "background": "Allocate time in Parliament to require those rejecting the Brexit deal on offer to suggest alternative solutions other than a second referendum or a general election. Parliament now has a responsibility to the electorate to resolve the issue so that we can smoothly leave the EU on March 29th.",
