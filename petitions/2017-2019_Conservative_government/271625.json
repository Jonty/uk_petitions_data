        "additional_details": "From speaking with parents and staff over the last few months, it seems most are in favour and agree that this arrangement is extremely out of date. Many cannot afford to either pay for childcare or entertain their children for 6 weeks. Staff also struggle to budget bills for the 6 weeks. You either cut the amount of holidays or you review where they are taken. Factor in ridiculous holiday costs too. When schools are opening to feed children in the summer break, something is seriously wrong.",
        "background": "I am an employee within the education sector as well as a parent and for many years have thought the school holidays are not distributed evenly. 6 weeks is too long for the summer = add a week to Christmas so that families can spend quality time together. Break up the rest of the year appropriately.",
