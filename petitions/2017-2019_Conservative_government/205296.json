        "additional_details": "So it is nice that students get a discount on ferry travel, but, these are only students that are 19 or under. As a 20 year old student at Southampton University, I am fighting for all students whatever age to be able to travel for cheaper every day. I think everybody deserves to have a great opportunity in life, although unfortunately not every one can afford it.",
        "background": "For Myself, for example, living on the I.o.W and attending University in Southampton is a daily struggle, I study full time AND work full time, and I still can barely afford ferry travel. I think it's time for ferry company's to lower prices for students that are OVER 19. We would like a future too.",
