While a debate is happening, MPs might be doing another part of their job - such as meeting their constituents, taking part in a Committee doing detailed scrutiny of the Government, or speaking in a debate in Westminster Hall, the second debating Chamber of the House of Commons. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. You'll need to give your full name to start a petition.\r\n "
