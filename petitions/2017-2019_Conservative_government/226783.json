        "additional_details": "The decision to permit the search for shale gas goes against everything we know about climate change and the necessary transition from fossil fuels to meet the Paris Agreement. The evidence is in front of us through the IPCC and the scientists warning to humanity. Our UK Laws should provide a safety net to prevent catastrophic actions and governance. If this law guided Minister Claire Perry to this decision, it is outdated and must be reviewed. Our environment is unstable and this urgent.",

Section 47A describes 'Factors for the Secretary of State to take into account'- this section must include public position and a caveat to also include assessment against The Climate Change Act 2008.",
