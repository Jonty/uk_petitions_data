        "additional_details": "Generally speaking the nation is saddled with expenses and costs associated with getting to and from work that can impact on a decision whether or not to take employment in a different area. If the government were to offer work travel expenses as tax deductible it would encourage more people to either seek employment further afield where local opportunities are limited or rely less on singular car journeys.",
        "background": "The cost of commuting over the last 30 years has increased exponentially and seemingly without control. Commuters are the bedrock of Industry and have no choice but to pay exorbitant fees for largely poor & overcrowded services.",
