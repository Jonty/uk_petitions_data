        "action": "No transfer of powers to councils to fine motorists for minor traffic offences",
        "additional_details": "The Local Government Association have already started the process of lobbying government in the form of the Department of Transport.  They believe that they are better suited to this enforcement than the police.  This has already been rejected once, but they are continuing to put pressure on government for the change.  We already know that local government isn't about making things safer it's purely a revenue raising exercise and again the motorist is yet again being seen as a cash cow.",
        "background": "Town halls want to rake in more cash by securing sweeping new powers to impose fines on motorists for minor traffic offences.  The Local Government Association want government to transfer powers to them that are currently only available to the police.",
