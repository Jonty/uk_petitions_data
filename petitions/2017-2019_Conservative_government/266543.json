        "action": "Stop Britains unlawful arms sales to Saudi Arabia",
        "additional_details": "The legal action against the British government was brought by the Campaign Against Arms Trade, which argued that the Saudi-led coalition likely violated international humanitarian law in its ongoing bombardment in Yemen, breaking EU arms-export licence criteria. The court\u2019s decision does not mean Britain must immediately halt arms exports to Saudi Arabia.\r\nSince the Gulf bombing campaign began in 2015 against the Houthi rebels, CAAT said the UK has licensed \u00a34.7bn worth of arms to Saudi Arabia.",
        "background": "On Thursday, June 27th, the Court of Appeal ruled that the British secretary of state broke the law by allowing arms sales to Saudi that might have been deployed in the war in Yemen. The UK cannot grant new export licences to sell arms to the kingdom but the existing licenses can continue.",
