        "additional_details": "The thief's are becoming so brash they will cut through locks on crowded streets in broad daylight as they know nothing will happen to them if they are caught. The value of  many modern bikes can be in the thousands. If it was a car being stolen I am sure a harsher sentence would be delivered? This county needs to wake up, this is a real problem and criminal gangs are making a fortune from bike thefts.",
        "background": "I own a bike shop in Edinburgh. We have been opened 6 months and have been targeted by thief's three times. On two occasions they have stolen bikes. Bike theft is at an all time high! I talk to bike owners everyday and a very high percentage of the them have confirmed to be victims of bike crime.",
