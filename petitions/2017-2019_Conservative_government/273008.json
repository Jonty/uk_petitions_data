        "additional_details": "MP's standing in a General Election or By-election do so under the banner of a political party and campaign on that party manifesto. Most people vote for them on this basis. If the MP decides to change party then it is only fair, reasonable and democratic that the people should have the ability to vote again on whether or not they still want that MP to represent them. There are now around 35 MP's sitting in parliament for a different party to that which they were originally elected under.",
        "background": "A by-election is only triggered when an MP's seat becomes vacant. Where an MP changes political party they are in effect consciously walking away from the basis upon which the people originally elected them. The MP's who have changed party have not faced a by-election but still sit in parliament.",
