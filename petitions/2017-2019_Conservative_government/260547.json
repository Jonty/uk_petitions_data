        "action": "Abolish the \u2018Not Proven\u2019 verdict in Scottish law",
        "additional_details": "So many people are failed by the Scottish justice system in rape trials due to the not proven verdict. To go through years of trauma talking to police, procurator fiscal, lawyers and physical checks to their body for evidence. To question their character, whether they were under the influence of alcohol, what they were wearing- it is extremely humiliating to a person. The not proven verdict means that most rapists that go to trial get to walk free while the victim is dehumanised by speaking out.",
        "background": "Scotland is the only country to have 3 verdict options in law- guilty, not guilty and not proven. Not proven goes either two ways- either the jury think that the suspect is guilty but haven\u2019t got enough evidence or they just aren\u2019t very sure.",
