        "action": "Make child public transport fairs for people up to the age of eighteen",
        "additional_details": "Some families that don\u2019t produce a particularly good income, have to allow the own children to pay for things that they cannot produce themselves. An example is my case, I have a good source of income for a 16 year old with about \u00a340 a month. Although this is decent a adult train ticket to London (off peak) is \u00a318.50 that is just under half of my monthly income.",
        "background": "Legally children under the age of 16 cannot work. In some cases this has shown to be unfair when considering public transport. We think that child fares should go up to the age of eighteen as no one can get a full time job until the age of 18.",
