This gets worse when other delivery riders are near.  Intense rivalry between companies and even colleagues makes for dangerous situations.",
        "background": "Fast food delivery riders are under pressure to deliver as soon as possible, in some cases they have a set time, or lose money.  They can get on a moped with no training or experience.  All that is required is a provisional licence and a set of \u2018l plates\u2019.",
