If I were to let my pup off the lead in an open space, I\u2019d be too scared that he\u2019d run away or get hit by a car. Dogs should be allowed to run free and socialise with other dogs in parks, and not constantly be on a lead, as that\u2019s unfair on them.",

EVERYONE should be allowed to let their dogs run free and socialise in parks. \r\n\r\nBrighton is a multi cultural and modern city- so why can\u2019t it be fully pet friendly to?",
