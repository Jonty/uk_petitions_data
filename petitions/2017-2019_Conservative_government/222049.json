        "additional_details": "The Government is planning to introduce means testing for free school meals which, according to the Children\u2019s Society, means a family with one child that earns more than \u00a37,400 would need to earn \u00a31,124 a year more, the equivalent of working 2.4 hours more each week on the National Living Wage, to make up for the loss of free school meals.",
        "background": "The Croxteth Women's Walking Group are petitioning against the government vote that was passed through to cuts to free school meals. As this would mean up to 1,000,000 nationally could go hungry during school time. CWWG  pledge to travel across the country to collect signatures to stop this action.",
