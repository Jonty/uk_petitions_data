        "additional_details": "Royal Mail is making an estimated \u00a3184m a year by putting nearly 3 billion junk leaflets in the post.The Mail Preference Service, used by 6.5 million people a year, lets households opt out of receiving addressed junk letters, it does not stop junk mail. This is despite unaddressed mail accounting for around a third of all UK mail, according to Citizens Advice. \r\nThe climate disaster is being fuelled by greed at our expense, if there was a ban on junk mail, it would negate the need to recycle it.",
        "background": "How many trees have to be cut down to fill the demand for the millions of junk leaflets put through every door each week? Around 12-16 trees are required for a tonne of junk mail production, this means that with an average of 550,000 tonnes sent out each year in the UK, over 7.7m trees are wasted!",
