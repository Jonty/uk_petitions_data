Then see how it reads. A red haired person can't change there hair colour like a person can't change there skin colour. It's discrimination and should be treated that way. I want my Daughter to know that her life will be free from cruel  discrimanative comments and that she is protected like everyone else. Regarding her appearance.",
        "background": "My Daughter went to her teacher for help.She plucked up the courage and told her teacher she was getting bullied. The teacher replied by saying Your ginger and Wear glasses says it all. When my Daughter pointed out she could report him. He replied by saying he,d enjoy reading that.",
