A study showing high school students in having the same stress levels as child mental health patients in the 1950s. For me, school is now a continuous cycle of \"I need to make it through this week\". Our main priority is always school and getting the right grades but never ourselves.\r\n \r\n\"I understand that school is important and education is important but I feel like there is a huge difference between a healthy amount of challenge in order to do better and being so stressed about school that you break down and cry.\" - from Tumblr",
