Many important concerns have been raised by these petitions, and all have been systematically ignored by a shielded government.\r\n\r\nFree votes are a part of the UK constitution enabling all MPs to vote free from party whip or influence, which have been traditionally allowed for ethical issues seen as a matter of conscience.",
        "background": "Whenever petitions on this website reach 100,000 impassioned votes and go to parliament for \"debate\", they get sent back by the government saying, in effect, leave us alone.\r\n\r\nA new rule should therefore be introduced to allow the House of Commons a Free Vote whenever a petition reaches 500,000.",
