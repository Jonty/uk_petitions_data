You can find out more about that here:\r\n\r\nhttp://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8062\r\n\r\nWe aren't sure what changes you would like the Government to make to these current rules.  \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.
