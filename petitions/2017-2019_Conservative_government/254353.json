A General Election is not the route out, only the people can decide how we leave, as the government has failed to do so.\r\n\r\nIt is disappointing that it has come to this but between red lines and poor negotiations, we are in a constitutional crisis, regardless of how it is framed.",
        "background": "The government is at a standstill, and there's no route forward. We keep going round and round in circles, and no one wants to give or budge. You came to the public for a referendum and we have to leave. So at the very least, let democracy take over, and give us the chance to break the deadlock.",
