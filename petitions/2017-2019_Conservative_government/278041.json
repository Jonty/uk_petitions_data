        "action": "Force a GE required to obtain a public mandate on renewed manifesto pledges",
        "additional_details": "Proposals re Brexit range wildly from cancelling the referendum result, to offering a second referendum, albeit the first remains unactioned. Some evade this fact by calling it a confirmatory vote but ALL are without mandate, as they have not been campaigned for in a GE. It has become evident that the log jam is in parliament & parties all seem to be avoiding a GE, or the responsibility that comes with winning a GE, yet remain happy to thwart current cabinets attempts to respect the referendum",
        "background": "All Parties in the House of Commons stood on manifestos to respect the 2016 referendum, and most have since strayed from the pledges that got them voted into their positions. Many now propose opposite directions to the manifesto pledges yet purport to be representing their constituents",
