        "additional_details": "As people know, many horses sustain horrific injuries if not face death from racing, but it does not stop anyone from betting on them. how many more deaths does it need before a ban is put in place? Enough is enough! It needs too stop now!  it's not right! It's not fair! Horse racing shouldn't be a sport.  It is gambling on lives for the sake of a little win and these poor horses are constantly put under strain all for  selfish human ways. Please, please support this and help it stop.",
