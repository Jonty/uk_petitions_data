        "action": "Oppose the Prorogation of Parliament so a 'no-deal Brexit' happens by default.",
        "additional_details": "Proroguing Parliament is normally a formality to end one session of Parliament and begin the next. Several MPs have proposed this could be used as a technique to evade Parliamentary accountability for a 'no-deal Brexit.' The Bill of Rights Act (1689) provides: 'Dispensing Power: That the pretended Power of Suspending of Laws by Regal Authority without Consent of Parlyament is illegal.' The petition asks that prorogation should be made subject to the consent of Parliament.",
        "background": "Proroguing Parliament to evade accountability for leaving EU on October 31st would breach both constitutional tradition and the Bill of Rights Act (1689). It would violate the principles of both Parliamentary Sovereignty and the Rule of Law which are cornerstones of the UK constitution.",
