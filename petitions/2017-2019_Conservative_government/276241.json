        "additional_details": "In the next general election for the first time in history hundreds of candidates who are not members of their party will stand for a party with no members. Parties with NO MEMBERSHIP, NO DEMOCRATIC structures and with TOTAL CONTROL given to ELITE SHAREHOLDERS should urgently be BANNED from trying to take control of our country. \r\nParliament decides the laws to which the Electoral Commission (EC) works. Strengthen the laws and give new powers to EC to stop this & other attacks on democracy.",
        "background": "The Electoral Commission (EC) is powerless to stop undemocratic political parties from registering. This allows organisations with no membership & that do not resemble a traditional political party to register with the EC. This undermines confidence in democracy & political parties & must be stopped",
