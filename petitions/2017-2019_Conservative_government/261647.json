        "additional_details": "This change will raise almost no money for the exchequer.\r\nIt will cause loss of jobs in the solar industry.\r\nIt will make the economics for a solar install in the home very marginal.",
        "background": "The government backed Feed In Tariff for solar installations ended March 2019. This lost a major incentive for domestic solar panel installation.\r\nClimate change is firmly on the agenda. The VAT increase will raise domestic Solar install costs by 15%, and is scheduled for 1st October 2019.",
