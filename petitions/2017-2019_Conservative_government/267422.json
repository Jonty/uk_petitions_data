        "action": "Give funding for support to those suffering from depression and who are suicidal",
        "additional_details": "Crisis teams can only refer people to waiting lists, while waiting there is more chance that person will take their own life. No lives should be lost due to lack of funding. Families, partners, friends and children have to live with the guilt of living with not being able to help the depressed person, professional help is needed. Funds would provide counselling and save lives!  We should do all we can to protect these vulnerable people.",
        "background": "Too many lives are being lost to suicide, but there is not enough support for those needing help with severe depression. When someone is in crisis they should be expected to wait 18 weeks at least for help. Funding needs to be urgently as lack of funding means the urgent support needed is not there",
