        "additional_details": "While Brexit has dominated politics almost every constituency has suffered. Local councils have been stretched beyond belief and people are suffering. Our MPs have spent most of their time arguing over what type of Brexit they prefer while they should've been caring for their constituents. We've been let down by the ineptitude and indecision of Westminster while communities suffer. The little wo/man deserves better and an overhaul of how government governs is needed.",
        "background": "Too much time and money is spent in Westminster and not addressing issues that effect people in their local areas. Our MPs spend most of their time debating matters that do not help or progress local issues to resolution. More local tax appropriation should be allocated towards to local matters.",
