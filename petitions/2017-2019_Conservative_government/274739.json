        "additional_details": "Many people believe that this should be a criminal offence and offenders should be fined a minimum of \u00a320 because this offence should absolutely be classed as animal cruelty. However, this isn\u2019t yet widely known as an offence and has not been considered for debate in parliament yet. An article from the mirror said, \u2018The RSPCA have warned that dogs should only be walked early in the morning or at night \"when they will not burn their paws on the pavement or be at increased risk of heatstroke\".\u2019",
        "background": "Dogs who are walked outside at a highly temperature are often seen by vets to treat blisters and boils on their paws. It is known that if you can\u2019t hold the back of your hand on the tarmac for more that 10 seconds then your dog shouldn\u2019t be walked outside, which is roughly the temperature of 25\u00b0c.",
