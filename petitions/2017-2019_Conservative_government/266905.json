        "additional_details": "There are so many people though that take complete advantage of the fact that it\u2019s not illegal to use these spaces and will boldly park in them, swan out of their car with no children and when confronted don\u2019t care! It\u2019s illegal to use disabled spaces without a blue badge so I think it\u2019s about time it became a criminal offence to use a parent/child space without dependant children.",
        "background": "I find it astonishing the amount of people who use parent/child spaces with no children or older, independent children! The spaces are there for those that need them for things like manoeuvring car seats/toddlers etc and are usually kept close to the store doors for safety reasons.",
