        "additional_details": "The result of this referendum should then be carried out as the people of the UK voted for their decision. This will prevent parties using the current Brexit situation to gain political power. We are currently living in a broken democracy that will lead to a recession and several larger companies liquidating due to the chaos being caused currently.",
        "background": "The current situation around Brexit is ruining business and the UK economy. A decision needs to be made. As the majority of the UK voted to leave the EU 23rd June 2016 the power should be passed back to the people as to whether we leave WITH a deal or WITHOUT a deal.",
