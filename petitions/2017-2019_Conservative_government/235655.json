        "additional_details": "The open rallies and social media networks require moderators to stop hate speech. We have far-right preachers who are creating disunity, disharmony against law abiding citizens. Where such speech/expressions incite religious intolerance e.g. in the event of an improper or even abusive attack on an object of religious veneration, the government should consider them to be incompatible with respect for the freedom of thought, conscience and religion and take proportionate restrictive measures.",
        "background": "In the recent years numerous far right groups have insulted prophets of faiths including Prophet Muhammad PBUH, using public demonstrations, Facebook and other social media platforms. I believe there needs to be a limit when discussing critisim against religions and their respective Prophets.",
