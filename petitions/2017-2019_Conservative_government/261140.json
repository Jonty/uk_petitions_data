Sadly after waiting three years for our democratic request to be honoured by the U.K. Parliament, it is clear the task of setting a date and then implementing the referendum is beyond their capabilities, this said they should relinquish all their power over the people of the U.K. to the E.U. We do not wish to lend financial support to both.",
        "background": "I believe U.K. voters will concur with my conclusion that the vast majority of our elected representatives in the U.K. Parliament have become so accustomed to the E.U. defining and deciding on every aspect of the entire population of the U.K. that they are now incapable of effective government.",

For example:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/257347\r\n\r\nYou're more likely to get action on this issue if you sign and share a single petition.\r\n"
