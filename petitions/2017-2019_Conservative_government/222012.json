Most importantly, it must include representatives of victims of police misconduct to ensure it has the confidence of every individual in society. People should be protected regardless of colour or background.\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/207561\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/166709",
        "background": "For over 50 years, the system has failed to protect Black/Asian people from feeling targeted and racially profiled by the police. We need a new body to investigate police misuse of powers, recommend that individual officers be prosecuted or sacked and recommend ways to reform the police.",
