In Sunderland there is a lack of activities for young people and it's forcing them into being anti-social. As a voice for the youth, I want to see kids having fun instead of causing trouble or playing on technology.",
        "background": "Crowtree Leisure Centre was closed in 2009 and replaced with the Aquatic Centre. Most of the public want something like Crowtree back to influence kids in the right direction and get them doing something more productive.",
