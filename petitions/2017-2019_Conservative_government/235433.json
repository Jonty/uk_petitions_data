        "additional_details": "We believe that a second referendum would be a dereliction of the Government\u2019s duty to deliver the will of the people, an insult to the integrity of the people and will damage democracy in and the very fabric of our country. If Parliament forces a second referendum upon us then we demand that only the route to exit from the EU is put to question. To be clear, that means (1)  A Deal or (2) No Deal. We do not accept the option of remain. We trust that the Government will hear The Peoples' Voice.",
        "background": "The issue of Brexit has now become a common cause about the future of democracy in our country. We debated in pubs, the workplace and in our homes . We were as well informed as we wanted to be and took responsibility for deciphering fake news from real news, fact from fiction. We voted to leave.",
