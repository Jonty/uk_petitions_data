Clearly such an undertaking is grossly inappropriate for a taxpayer-funded national broadcaster, so it is crucial that a judicial enquiry is held in order to establish exactly what undertakings and agreements the BBC signed up to in order to receive EU funding.",
        "background": "A recent Freedom of Information Request (RFI20101570) revealed that the BBC received funding from the EU and loans from the European Investment Bank. Due to the possibility of this creating bias in BBC reporting regarding the EU and Brexit, an inquiry should be held to determine if this is the case.",
