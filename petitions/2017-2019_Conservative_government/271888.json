The DVLA also made \u00a317 million in 2018 from selling the details of vehicle owners to private companies. This practice, from a governmental body which should be safeguarding our personal data, needs to be reviewed.",
        "background": "Motorists are increasingly being targeted by companies for what are relatively minor driving transgressions and these fines are usually disproportionate, unjust and meted out too frequently. The money that these firms are raking in is testament to the unjust nature of the practices of such companies",
