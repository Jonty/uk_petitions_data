        "additional_details": "More and more families are struggling to live together with young children. My children are 14 month old and a 2 week old. Like a lot of families me and my partner can\u2019t afford to live together as I work full time and she doesn't as she raises the children. The systems we have in this country don't help people who work. Help to buy is only good if you can afford to save but with young children and paying rent that's more than a mortgage, it's hard to save.",
        "background": "I'm a working dad of 2 children under 2 year old. Me and my partner can't afford to live together as I don't earn enough to support us and pay private rent. The Government should introduce a scheme to make more council homes available for families to part rent part buy to get on the property ladder.",
