        "additional_details": "The exam is also extremely difficult for students that suffer with anxiety & paranoia, in the exam you are required to perform a speech in front of a large group & Students are usually recorded. Taking into account the assessment is not even part of the overall English Language Grade a student receives, this exam is extremely harsh and puts unnecessary pressure on just 15/16 year olds. Up to 1 in 3 British teenagers suffer with Generalised Anxiety Disorder so this partically would affect them.",
        "background": "The English GCSE Speaking assessment is an exam that puts unnecessary stress on hundreds of students each year. It is no longer needed as it is no longer part of the overall English Language grade a student will receive on results day.",
