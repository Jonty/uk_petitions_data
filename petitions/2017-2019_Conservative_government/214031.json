        "action": "Improve the country's roads, repairing the pot holes and potentially save lives.",
        "additional_details": "We want to see an improvement in the reporting and repair process, leading to a reduction in the number of potholes and the time that a reported pothole takes to be repaired. A smartphone app that allows the public to easily photograph, document and report a pot hole would in our opinion be of great value. \r\n This is not an issue for tomorrow, but for today and failure to act could cost the lives of road users.",
        "background": "The continued degradation of the UK's road network is leading to an increase in potentially damaging and fatal potholes. As a leading Honda Motorcycle dealership we feel it is crucial to highlight this issue, which we feel is relevant to all road users, but in particular motorcyclists.",
