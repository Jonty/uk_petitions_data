        "additional_details": "The Vat was lowered from 20% to 5% but the question us: why are they taxed at all? Sanitary products can cost up to \u00a320 a money, so in a household with a mum and two girls, this cost soon adds up.",
        "background": "Female sanitary products are currently classed as luxury items and are therefore taxed, despite females NEEDING them on a monthly basis. This is a contributor to 'period poverty', preventing females in low economic areas from attending school or work for 25% of their lives.",
