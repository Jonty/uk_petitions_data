The media are jumping currently on a one sided view and declaring the amount of people that are signing up to it. Why then should there not be an opposite view shown to balance the statement ? Please sign this Petition to show that you agree with the current action by our Government.",
        "background": "There is a petition that is currently set up for the British people to petition against the the recent porogue agreement. Surely it is constitutional and correct to have one that states the number of the British public who agree with this recent action. Show your support for our current government.",
