        "additional_details": "Recently I have had a buyer pull out of our sale 2 weeks before completion which, unless i can find a new buyer quickly, means we will lose the house we planned to buy, our deposit and all of the upfront fees we paid coming to almost \u00a32000.\r\nA lot of people have been in the same situation costing families thousands of pounds that they cannot afford to lose. If we introduce laws such as Scotlands, home sellers have more protection against buyers pulling out at the last minute with no repercussions",
        "background": "In Scotland you cannot back out of a house sale once 'missives are concluded', yet this is not the same in England. This will raise confidence for sellers and save any last minute dissapointments which costs the seller time, money, uncertainty and stress.",
