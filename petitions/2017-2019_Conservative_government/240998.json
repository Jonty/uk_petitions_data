        "additional_details": "There is no way we can ever bring an effective complaint about this biased reporting, because all complaints against the BBC are handled internally. It\u2019s time to put an end to this biased reporting, we need to petition parliament to scrap the licence fee all together. Maybe if the BBC had to work for their money they wouldn\u2019t be so keen to keep attacking the party that has won the last 5 elections in Scotland and represents the majority of the people who live in this country.",
        "background": "Recent events regarding Scotland have been totally mis-reported by the BBC, it appears to many that the news reports are twisted to deliberately to show the SNP led government in a bad light. The BBC also appears to show the same contempt when it comes to reporting on  the SNP MP's in Westminster",
