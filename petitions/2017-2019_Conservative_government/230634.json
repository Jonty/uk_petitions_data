        "additional_details": "Alan Turing. A man who is widely regarded as the farther of modern computing, and who saved countless lives in WWII. Furthermore it would be a fitting tribute to a man who was relentlessly penalised and punished for a life choice that is now accepted in todays society.",
        "background": "Margret Thatcher divided a country and is too political to be displayed on the new \u00a350. The opposing petition to have footballer Harry Maguire riding a unicorn placed on the design, makes a mockery of the relevance of this honour. \r\n\r\nI hereby propose Alan Turing as a worthy candidate.",
