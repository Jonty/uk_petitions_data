In particular, we're not sure whether you're concerned about teaching of the history of particular nations (and, in which case, which nations you want to add to the history curriculum) or teaching of black history.  \r\n\r\nThe Government has published guidance about the teaching of history, including of non-European cultures, in English schools. You can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-history-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-history-programmes-of-study\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like the UK Government or Parliament to do. \r\n"
