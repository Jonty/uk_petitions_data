        "additional_details": "No British government should sign up to a back stop arrangement that according to the Attorney General will 'endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took its place, in whole or in part'. There is no means to compel the EU legally to conclude such an agreement, only a good faith clarification which can be satisfied by EU if they simply show that they have considered our proposal. Therefore, we must prevent this almost certain stalemate and re-negotiate deal to include a terminal clause.",
        "background": "If the government's Brexit deal is defeated in parliament, which is expected, then the governments next step should be to go back to the EU and re-negotiate the current backstop arrangement and replace it with a mutual termination on notice clause. Once agreed, parliament should vote on new deal.",
