        "additional_details": "The danger on motorways doesn't necessarily come from the speed of car travel, \"tailgating\" whether it be at 40mph, 70mph or 85mph is where the danger lies and efforts should be made to prosecuting these drivers. With a good distance between cars linked with the advancement of car technology since 1965 then a speed limit of 80mph or even 85mph shouldn't be out of the question in 2019.",
        "background": "A 70 mph limit on UK motorways was introduced in 1965. Car technology has come on a long way since my dad's Ford Anglia in the 1970s! France's limit is 80mph, Germany hasn't a limit but 80mph is advisory and the maximum speed recommended by International and European road design standard is 85mph.",
