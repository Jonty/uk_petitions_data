The law needs to recognised the impact and the facts it is emotional abuse towards the child and neglect when a child is abandoned by a parwnt. Cafcass and Family Court system does not work because lots of parents are trying to alienate each other and point score. Children are the victims. Say no to emotional abuse and neglect.",

It is a form of emotional abuse and neglect. But happens only too often because parents get away with it. There should be a stand.",
