        "action": "Make it compulsory for schools to offer girls a choice to wear trousers",
        "additional_details": "Therefore, I am asking for the government to make it compulsory for schools (both state and independent) to offer girls the option to wear trousers. This should already be required in a forward-thinking country and it greatly annoys me (and I'm sure many other girls and boys) that it is not. Requiring girls to wear skirts restricts the sense of freedom and does not reflect the governments own Equality Act of 2010.",
        "background": "In my school, it is compulsory for girls to wear skirts. However I believe that, in the 21st century, both male and female students should have an option to wear either skirts or trousers. The gender stereotype that girls should wear skirts and boys should wear trousers is outdated and ridiculous.",
