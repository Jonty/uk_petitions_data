        "additional_details": "The information that inspired me to create this petition can be found in the following article from the Guardian:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/news/up-to-12000-asda-workers-could-lose-jobs-amid-contract-row/ar-AAJ7PkD?ocid=spartanntp\r\n\r\nDespite ASDA having increased its profits significantly in the last year it still feels the need to treat the staff in such a deplorable manner while the bosses continue to enjoy ever rising bonuses.\r\n\r\nAnyone who does not agree to the deal will be dismissed.",
        "background": "ASDA is requiring staff to sign the so called \"Martini Contract\". This contract, while raising basic pay, would end paid breaks, reduce extra pay during holidays and reduce extra pay for nightshifts. Working hours and locations would also start to vary widely, creating uncertainty and instability.",
