        "background": "Every year roughly 850,000 driving tests are conducted but only 47-50% pass. That means one in two tests taken leads to a fail. Although the tests are getting harder, the price of it still remains incredibly high at \u00a362.00. Driving should be a fun and educational life skill not a burden.",
