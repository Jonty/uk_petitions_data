        "additional_details": "Your also unable to claim Carers allowance on top of a state pension. \r\nWhy are the government encouraging all Carers out of work? \r\nI personally care for a family member over 60 hours a week, but because I work around 20 hours a week I can\u2019t claim any help for caring at all. It\u2019s absolutely disgusting. We try to save the government money by caring at home instead of sending them to carehomes. And yet there is no extra help for doing this at all. Please review the whole system around Carers.",
        "background": "Carers are being restricted to much when it comes to claiming Carers allowance. Can\u2019t study more than 21 hours = can\u2019t get educated. They can\u2019t work more than 16 hours = earnings are restricted. Have to care at least 35 hours a week on top of all this, but then because they work, they can\u2019t claim?.",
