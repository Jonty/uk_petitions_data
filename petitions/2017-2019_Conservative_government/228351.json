        "background": "Today, 06/09/18, Karen Bradley announced direct rule for NI. She also announced a long overdue measly pay cut for MLAs, who aren't working, in addition to legislation blocking the people of NI exercising our democratic right to elect a new government in the absence of a functioning one.",
