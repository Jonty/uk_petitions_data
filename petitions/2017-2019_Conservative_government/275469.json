        "additional_details": "The Referendum was too vague of a question, which has resulted in too much infighting and confusion. It needs to be decided with a new one. Leave the EU with the deal. Leave without the deal. Or Remain. That way, it cannot be disputed what the people actually want. \r\nThen a new General Election can be called and we can move on and move forward as a country and finally put Brexit to bed!",
        "background": "There has been disgusting behaviour from our MPs and the public. It is time to make a final choice. It's time to choose what type of Brexit to have (With a deal, Without a deal, or Remain). Then once that is finally clear, we need to hold a new General Election so we can clear up this mess.",
