        "additional_details": "if a member of parliament is removed by loss of whip or changes parties, they no longer have the same values as they had when elected to represent the constituency in Westminster, and therefore can NO LONGER hold station in that area under a different \"banner or political affiliation\". A by election MUST be held so the electorate can decide if that person does continue to hold those values or that another person best represents their views.",
        "background": "An important principle of the UK Parliament that Members of Parliament are accountable to those who elect them. It is therefore absolutely right that all Members of Parliament are fully accountable to their constituents for what they say and do and this is ultimately reflected at the ballot box.",
