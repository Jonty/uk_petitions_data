        "additional_details": "On a day where record temperatures for July have swept the UK, Porthcawl Coney Beach seems to keep the donkeys and horses down on the sweltering sand with minimal water and shade. Although the water may be refilled throughout the day, they do not have enough shade. The days where temperature hits a certain degree, the animals should have a right to be protected from working in these unreal conditions. Please sign so these animals have a happier working life.",
        "background": "After the scorching heatwave the entirety of Britain has faced this year, it saddens me to see the donkeys and horses down Porthcawl Coney Beach still being out in the sun with minimal water and shade. This needs to come to a stop in this heat.",
