        "additional_details": "Children need life lessons about money, savings, cooking & cleaning. They need to be taught how to repair things and how to look after their own health and others\u2019. This must all be part of the current curriculum. A lot of children leave school and have no idea how to do many of these things. If children are taught all of this, they would have a better start to their adult lives. There isn\u2019t much mental health help for children, so teaching in schools would benefit them and the NHS massively.",
