        "additional_details": "The Amazon rainforest is one of the most spectacular examples of nature on the planet, and is a precious resource to all of humanity. It helps filter the air we breathe, supports a mass of natural diversity, and has inspired humanity to truly appreciate nature. This is about more than one country, we must protect the Amazon! The UK government must be the first to commit to this action, and must encourage others to do the same.",
        "background": "Brazil's President, Mr Bolsonaro, has stated his country is not equipped to fight illegal fires in the Amazon, and so an international effort is absolutely urgent. Demand countries contribute to an international effort to protect this precious natural resource!",
