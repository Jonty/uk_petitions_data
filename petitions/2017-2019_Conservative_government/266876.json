        "action": "Change motorbike tests to the old way of taking one test at seventeen years old",
        "additional_details": "The majority of motorcycle accidents on public roads are not caused by the power of the motorcycle. Accidents on motorcycles are most commonly caused by bad weather conditions, and many caused by other road users failing to see motorcyclists and causing a collision.\r\nRoad accidents are rarely caused by the power of the vehicle, regardless of if it is a car, van or motorbike. Accidents are caused by weather conditions and human error. The amount of tests is clearly discrimination towards bikers.",
        "background": "I, and countless other young motorcyclists feel that it is unnecessary and discriminative to force motorcyclists to take multiple tests before they are allowed to ride any capacity machine until they are twenty four years old, when you can drive any car at seventeen years old of any power output.",
