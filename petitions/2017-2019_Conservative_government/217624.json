        "additional_details": "The Bristish Goverment shouldn't be allowed to just take us into conflict without first having a parliament vote on the matter. We have gone into major conflicts in the past such as iraq on evidence about weapons that were never even discovered. Britain and other world leaders are just creating more chaos rather than helping the people of these countries. Not to mention the financial cost of this military action. Stop all actions in Syria without concrete evidence immediately.",
        "background": "Britain is again taken military action in a country that is already on the brink. The British goverment has rushed into other conflicts before without having sufficient evidence.There needs to be more investigating before making further attacks and parliament should have a vote that cant be bypassed",
