There is little to no awareness about cervical cancer.\r\nby reducing the age of smear tests and cervical screening today we can save lives, we can tackle cell changes early and prevent cervical cancer. \r\nIf I can do anything with my life I want to make this change happen, it's too late for me but it's not too late for the next generation of young ladies.",
