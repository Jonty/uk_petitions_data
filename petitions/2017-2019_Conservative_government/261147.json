The Government only provide a loan of \u00a310,609 (May 2019), but on average living costs will amount to \u00a37,700 for a 10 month course (Save the Student 2019). Those whose parents can't afford that can't afford to do a oligarchs degree.\r\n\r\nIf we truly want to support diversity, the government must provide additional loans so that more students can pursue a oligarchs.",
