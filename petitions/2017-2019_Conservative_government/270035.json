        "additional_details": "There have been many occasions over recent times when prominent MP\u2019s have openly thwarted their own stated election manifesto and \r\nParty\u2019s manifesto. Their own constituents who relied on that MPs integrity to deliver what they stood for, are left with no recourse and are denied a voice in Parliament. With the sight of MP\u2019s effectively lying their way to success in an election. What does this hold for the reputation of our democracy and its validity as a beacon of sound national governance.",
        "background": "The electorate rely on the words of their MP, in their integrity and honesty to carry out that which they promised in their manifesto. Buying votes for cash is prohibited, so should buying votes with false words be judged equally dishonest ,especially so in this day of extensive social media use.",
