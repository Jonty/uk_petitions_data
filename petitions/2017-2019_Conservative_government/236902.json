        "additional_details": "My friends do not understand the worrying state our nation is in. We have sex education and drugs education, but why do we not have political education? The Government decides our future, yet has led us into a political shambles.

My generation is clueless and voiceless, and after Brexit, we will be the generation left to pick up the pieces.",

If this simple difference is not clear, how can young people possibly hope to distinguish between a hard and a soft Brexit?",
