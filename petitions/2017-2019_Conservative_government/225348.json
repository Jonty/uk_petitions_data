Id been abroad then moved and had not received any notice. Ive seen a lot of other good law abiding citizens stung and bullied by this lack of empathy for small mistakes/archaic lack of email/mobiles within the law. I think its time for email/telephone to be added. To help the gov&us",

Its absurd that a small clerical error can allow a fine to lead to debt collectors at your door,  being treated like a criminal, when you would've paid had they emailed or called",
