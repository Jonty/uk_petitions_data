        "additional_details": "It would be very simple to create a central website (one could be built at very little expense), to which these large organisations must have a log in.  Individuals could then record their wish to unsubscribe from monthly paper publications (by organisation): expressing their mailing frequency preference, or requesting online issues instead.  The government should compel these organisations to have a membership to this system, and to respect the preferences of those receiving these publications.",
        "background": "Universities, schools, and professional bodies frequently post paper journals and other publications to their members. These are usually unsolicited, and often thrown away unread. In the era of online technology, they are a waste of public and private money, and needlessly damage the environment.",
