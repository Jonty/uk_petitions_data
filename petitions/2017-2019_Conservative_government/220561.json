As Israel continues to take Palestinian land, more and more Palestinians are being forced out of their homes, or kept inside in Israeli imposed curfews. Water supplies and electricity are also cut off so Palestinians are kept in inhumane conditions",
        "background": "As Israel won the recent Eurovision song contest, they will host next year's competition. However, at the moment, Israel is embroiled in a war crimes investigation after its overly violent reaction to the recent protests by Palestinian civilians on the Gaza Strip",
