        "action": "Companies holding halal certification must mandatory display the halal logo.",
        "additional_details": "Many companies in the U.K. hold halal certification, not all will display the halal symbol. Companies, including Cadburys, Kingsmill, Kellogg\u2019s, Nestle, Kraft and many more, claim halal certification assures Muslims that their products meet dietary requirements and that no alcohol is used in manufacture. However the general public should also have an informed choice but have no way of knowing if products are halal certified unless it becomes mandatory for all companies to display the halal logo.",
        "background": "It is extremely important that we should all have an honest choice, be fully aware of what we are buying, confident that we are informed of ingredients and should be aware if a product is halal certified as many people with other religions besides Islam are forbidden halal certified products.",
