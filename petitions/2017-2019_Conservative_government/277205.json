        "additional_details": "Approximately 140,000 people die each year in the UK due to the lack of first aid knowledge. That\u2019s the same number of people who die from cancer. Research shows that only 5% of adults are confident in applying first aid in emergency situations. These statistics need to change: not in 5 years, not in 10 years, but now. 140,000 lives taken each year are ones which could have been prevented if we just supplied the knowledge of first aid into school students across the country.",
        "background": "It is crucial that children are regularly taught basic first aid in schools. It\u2019s impossible to predict when these skills will be needed to save the lives of thousands of people. Would you feel safer knowing that everyone around you knew how to perform first aid?",
