        "action": "Extend the National Minimum Wage to Young Adults of 18 Years Old.",
        "additional_details": "A young adult has the right to vote, has the right to be married, can have a credit card creating debt and are seen as an adult by law. However, the government still discriminates us with separate wage brackets. It is not only unjust to pay younger people reduced wages for the same work, but it also allows employers to discriminate against those that are 21-24 not offering them employment due to the higher cost of employment.",
        "background": "The minimum wage brackets are discriminatory to young adults, devaluing there work effort by \u00a32.06 an hour for 18-20 year old compared to a 25-year-old. You should be paid for the job you do and not discriminated due to your age, young people also pay bills which are hard to pay with these wages.",
