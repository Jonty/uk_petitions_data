        "additional_details": "Using video footage as evidence of traffic offences is fine to an extent but it fails to hide what seems to be a bigger concern, that is a large decline in traffic police due to Government austerity measures.\r\nIt comes at a time when there are 27% fewer traffic police on Britain\u2019s roads than 2010.\r\nLet the police do their jobs, driving offences prosecutions by Dashcams are a violation of privacy! \r\nThe police should be the front line, not citizens.",
        "background": "As the police pull away from the front line, is the concept of \u201ccrowd-sourced police intelligence\u201d using dash cams the future of policing?  It sounds like something out of a sci fi novel but the way it\u2019s going it could be a reality within 10 years. A vigilante model which sets its path for failure",
