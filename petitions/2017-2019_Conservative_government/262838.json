        "action": "Bring political and economic education to secondary schools",
        "additional_details": "Some students were interviewed by the BBC and said that they found the news \"boring\", during which time the news consisted mainly of UK politics; specifically Brexit. This is mostly due to the lack of understanding that the students have on the news. This lack of understanding could be blamed on the lack of education in schools about politics. \r\nFurthermore, money is what drives a country, yet schools don't teach about money and economics sufficiently to students, who become unprepared for work.",
        "background": "Many students in schools in the UK are confused about what is going on in Parliament and how Parliament itself works. These students are the future of our country and will one day be able to vote. Political and economic education will secure a strong foundation for future voters and workers.",
