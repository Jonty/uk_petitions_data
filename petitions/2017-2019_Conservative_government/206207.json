        "additional_details": "What I am suggesting is, if you set a criteria where someone is on a lower income, where they couldn\u2019t afford a normal mortgage, aswell as all the other outrageous expenses hard working citizens have to pay, then they should be eligible. This then has a knock on effect where they don\u2019t fall in the \u201cI\u2019m better off on benefits\u201d trap. Instead they work they get their own house. Most importantly paying into the country instead of taking out of it. I\u2019ve ran out of space and could back this up more.",
        "background": "People cripple themselves monthly paying off their mortgage and then once it\u2019s paid off they don\u2019t have long left until they pass away, then someone else inherits all their hard work. Some can\u2019t afford it therefore falling in the rent trap, living with parents or staying in council housing.",
