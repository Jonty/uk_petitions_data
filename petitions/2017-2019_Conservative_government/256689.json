        "additional_details": "Women's rights are eroded in sport, as highlighted by Martina Navratilova and others. TransMen are not screened for cervical cancer as GPs don't know their natal gender. The damage to children is borderline criminal. The long-term effects of hormone-blocking drugs can be infertility, loss of libido, even cancer. Chest-binders cause shortness of breath, pain, overheating. We condemn FGM \u2013 yet kids are sent on a gender-changing journey that often leads them to the cutting or removing of genitalia.",
        "background": "The Gender Recognition Act must be amended to be based on factual data about a person's identity, acknowledging intersex conditions, whilst not harming children's health and women's rights, inc women in sport. Knowing sex at birth may also be important for police investigations, NHS assessments etc.",

For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Government to review and reform gender recognition law and the Equality Act to ensure that they offer appropriate protection to all. "
