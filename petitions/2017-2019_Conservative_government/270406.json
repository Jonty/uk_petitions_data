        "additional_details": "Due to the June 4 massacre in China and the confident crisis on the joint declaration, the BNSS was established in 1990 and allowed at least 50,000 HK citizens to become British citizens.\r\n\r\nCurrently, many citizens were being beaten up by the police and pro-China gangsters. Their life is in danger and their rights and freedom are vanishing. The British Government should consider the possibilities of the BNSS by granting the BN(O) holders the full citizenship and the right of abode in the UK.",
        "background": "Citizens in HK are facing a serious safety risk and threat from HKSAR and China when they are protecting their rights and freedom. The government should fulfil the constitutional and moral obligation to place them in safety by considering the BNSS to grant all BN(O) holders in HK the right of abode.",
