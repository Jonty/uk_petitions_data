        "additional_details": "NHS working conditions are incredibly stretched. Despite understaffing and underfunding, staff face criminal charges and losing their licence to work forever if they make an honest mistake. This is unfair, unconstructive and worsens patient safety. \r\n\r\nWe ask government to adopt a \u2018just\u2019/\u2018no blame\u2019 approach to healthcare investigation (like the aviation industry) to save taxpayers money, improve NHS working conditions and staff retainment, and streamline error investigation to make patients safer.\r\n\r\nThis petition has been co-authored by Dr Hugo Farne and Dr Jenny Vaughan",
        "background": "We ask government to adopt a \u2018just\u2019 approach in healthcare investigation to ensure staff aren\u2019t scapegoated for systemic errors. 1) Change the Law so staff errors are only prosecuted if intentional or grossly careless 2) Change the Medical Act so regulators are limited to retraining, not punishment.",
