        "additional_details": "While parental alienation is a criminal offence in some countries, it is not recognised in law in the uk. \r\nI love my daughter very much and want her back in my life. \r\nI know that I am only one of many thousands of parents who do not see their children because of the mental abuse inflicted on their children by the offending parent. \r\nThis mental abuse, should be recognised as mental abuse in law in the United Kingdom and should be made punishable by law",
        "background": "I haven\u2019t seen my daughter for the last 5 years because her mother has poisoned her against me. \r\nWe had the best father/daughter relationship. \r\nThis all began when I was getting married again and her mother could not handle another mother figure into my daughter\u2019s life.",
