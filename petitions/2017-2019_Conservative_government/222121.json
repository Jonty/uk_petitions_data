        "additional_details": "Affordable rates need be set for high street stores to offset the current decline in footfall, making it viable for that store or business to remain. Tax levels should also be reviewed according to turnover. Allow councils to liaise with landlords to discuss options of reducing rent or consider an  alternative use of an unoccupied unit. For example a sporting activity which would benefit the both the high street and local community by driving footfall back into the area.",
        "background": "Store rent, rates and tax levels are out of proportion to the current retail climate and are the major cause of larger stores in particular vanishing at a rapid from our high streets today.",
