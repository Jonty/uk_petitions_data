        "additional_details": "There has been no government in stormont for 13 months leaving the e ture running of the control to civil servants whom are completely out of their depth but trying valiantly none the less. For Northern Ireland to proper and look to the future a new government is required. I proposed a government where every member of the country is valued and heard. No more scabdals. No more petty disputes. No more letting past events dictate the future. NI for all.",
        "background": "It is clearly evident that the current members of the Northern Ireland government do not have the interests of the people of NI in their motives or their hearts. Too many scabdals and petty arguments. It is time for the people to take control of their government.",
