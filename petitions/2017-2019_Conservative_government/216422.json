        "additional_details": "I believe mp\u2019s should be brought into the real world and have pay freeze for 2 years, be forced to give back the 10% of the pay rise they got.  Money saved and taken back to be given as a pay rise to the emergency services who do a much better job then mp\u2019s do, the emergency services put their lives on the line everyday whilst mp\u2019s just sit around talking and stuffing their faces on tax payers money.",
        "background": "At present private and public workers only are getting 1 to 2% pay rises and get no support in travel, lunch or housing costs.\r\n\r\nWhy do mp\u2019s think they deserve pay rise way over the national average and still get public funding for their travel, food and housing?",
