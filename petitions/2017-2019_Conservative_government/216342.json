        "additional_details": "There's equal spaces for disabled people as there are mother and child. People only have permits for disabled. I had to attend two supermarkets today and faced the same issue. None of the disabled were taken as people know that they will be fined without showing their badges. Yet all of the parent and child ones were full. I watched men and women getting in with their bags and leaving with no children in the car. I then had to travel to a different supermarket just so I could find a space.",
        "background": "I would like the government to allow permits for parents. The spaces are already there in supermarkets but people abuse this. We need permits just the same as dissabled to scare and/ or fine people with no disabling issues. We need the space. It isn't just a convenience.",
