        "action": "Legalise Snus and various chewless tobacco/nicotine products in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Studies in renowned journals, such as the British Medical Journal and The Lancet, do not confirm any correlation between snus usage and oral cancer. Swedish males, the highest demographic for Snus use, experience the least levels of lung cancer in Europe. There is no hard evidence that snus increases any cancer, despite countless studies being conducted, therefore, showing that it is a much safer alternative to smoking. In no way should this product be illegal under logical law.",
        "background": "Not only does Snus and Chewless tobacco provide effective therapy against smoking, but it causes little health problems compared to smoking and vaping. There is no reason for such products to be banned in the United Kingdom, whilst smoking remains legal. It is a safer product, and a healthier one.",
