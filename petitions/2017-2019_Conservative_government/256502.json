It does not get the video removed from Facebook and there is now way of ensuring that the abuse is being looked into or even sent on to the correct services.\r\nThere should be a law to ensure that all videos that include any form of abuse must be passed on to all services necessary so that if possible safety/welfare checks can be made",
