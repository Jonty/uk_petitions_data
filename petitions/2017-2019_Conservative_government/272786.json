        "additional_details": "With the average tax being \u00a3236.66 per year and around 8.8 million vehicles sold privately in 2016, the DVLA could have made up to \u00a3173,536,000 in 2016 for overcharging tax.  Vehicle sales should include the remaining tax and the new owner should be responsible for taxing the vehicle from the 1st of the following month. \r\n \r\nThe Government must also issue a statement of the figures of the amount people have over paid in vehicle tax from 1/10/14 till present.",
        "background": "On 1/10/14 the DVLA got rid of paper tax discs and made tax digital. Owners can no longer transfer tax discs and can only get a refund for any full month\u2019s VED.  This means they have been charging double tax for up to 30 days for each vehicle sold privately in the UK. ",
