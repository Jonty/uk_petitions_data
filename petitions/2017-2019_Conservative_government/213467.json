        "action": "Eradicate current tiers of minimum wage pay based on age",
        "additional_details": "Considering the living wage in the UK is \u00a37.20 (Gov.uk, 2016), those under 25 are being paid significantly less than what is considered a \u2018liveable\u2019 wage, especially if this is their only source of income, as it is for many. Our government\u2019s legislature bans wage discrimination based on gender or ethnicity, thus why is it deemed acceptable to do so on the grounds of age?",
        "background": "There are currently 4 tiers of minimum wage pay depending on your age, with the under 18 legal minimum wage being \u00a33.45 less an hour than the minimum rate for over 25s, even when doing the same work. This is age discrimination and facilitates the exploitation of all workers between 16 and 24.",
