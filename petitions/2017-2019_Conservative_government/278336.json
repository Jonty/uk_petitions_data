We have people travelling for many reasons and we cannot afford to be late. We need more carriages on trains to big cities as well as the trains are packed and we get late from having to wait for the next ones",
        "background": "I want action as I use the train everyday for university and the trains are always delayed or cancelled or late. I want trains to run faster, quicker and with less delays and more security. Many people use trains and it is not effective when there are too many delays and cancellations.",
