When this is undermined by the overreaching actions of the executive, and the Monarch is invoked as an agent of undemocratic actions such as proroguing parliament to stifle democratic parliamentary debate, the Monarch should prefer the advice of parliament, when so instructed by the majority of parliament, in preference to votes in council when these two matters differ.",
