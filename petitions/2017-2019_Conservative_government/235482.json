        "additional_details": "The government is spending its time on its knees begging For a deal. This will never happen. If it did 8/9 other countries would leave the EU. It would then collapse. Forget a deal with the EU and forge deals with the other 168 countries of the world. Yes in the short term we will feel some pain. But this pain is directly sent from the EU. We must remember that fact. They are like all politicians looking after their own interests not the people\u2019s. two years is enough time. Let\u2019s go see the world",
        "background": "The people of the U.K. were asked a question in 2016. We answered it. We where not asked about a deal or informed about the Ireland issue. But we where told leave means leave by the EU. This was the will of the people democracy cannot end. Europe have short memories.",
