        "additional_details": "Schools in Dorset such as Queen Elizabeth's School in Wimborne Minster have banned mobile phones on site however this has caused many problems amongst students. \r\n\r\nFerndown Upper School is also considering banning mobile phones. \r\n\r\nAt many schools across the country, they do not only serve the area in which it is situated, but they also serve further afield and this causes major problems in arranging transport.",
        "background": "Many schools across the country are now banning students from using phones on site. However, this restricts students from contacting home (in cases of emergency), getting help from chatlines such as Kooth, when in need and many students now struggle to arrange travel to get to and from school safely",
