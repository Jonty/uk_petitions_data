        "additional_details": "Glastonbury festival have made the choice to ban the sale of single use plastics bottles at their festival. The UK government should support and follow, banning the sale of all single use plastics at festivals. With the ban of plastic straws, cotton buds and stirrers coming in April 2020, it is clear this ban should follow. Solutions such as, paper cups, biodegradable cups, and more are available but not used enough.",
        "background": "The amount of single use plastic used at UK festivals is extreme. The majority of festivals are not acting upon this. It is possible for 200,000 plastic cups and bottles to be used in one day at a UK festival. It is unimaginable what the total is across the year. We must act now!",
