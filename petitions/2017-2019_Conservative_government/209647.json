        "additional_details": "I hope this law is changed which will make it possible for thousands of families around the uk to be united with Their loved ones.I think it\u2019s unfair for a war-torn country like Afghanistan which has been and is in war since 1978, how can the uk government expect such uneducated population to read and write their own language let alone speak English.",
        "background": "UK has introduced English language test (Ielts), for the family members of British citizens without which its imposible to join them in the uk. I am personally affected by this as I have two kids under the age of 3 and I can\u2019t bring them to the uk because their mum is unable to speak English.",
