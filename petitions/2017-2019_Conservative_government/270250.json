        "additional_details": "This has already been done in various European countries. Not only does it reduce the amount of plastic being taken to landfills, as the bottles would be recycled and reused, but it also helps to reduce the amount of litter. In Italy, it is possible to exchange 30 plastic bottles for a subway ticket to reduce plastic pollution.",
        "background": "Reducing carbon emissions is not enough and so more needs to be done to reduce the amount of plastic going into landfills. This could be made possible by collection points being available near supermarkets, which would give out coupons or vouchers in exchange for recyclable plastic bottles.",
