        "action": "Secure the staff of Nottingham College the contracts they deserve",
        "additional_details": "Despite already not having had a pay rise since 2010, the contract now delivers no pay for work outside of teaching hours despite an increased workload, reduced sick pay, and reduced pay by up to \u00a31000 a year for some teachers to name but a few unfair clauses. The limit on teaching hours per week has been removed completely, overworking members of staff beyond their limits for unfair pay - meanwhile, the principal responsible for instigating the new contracts is earning over \u00a3200,000 a year.",
        "background": "As a recent student of Nottingham College, I believe that the staff create one of the most supportive learning environments in Nottinghamshire, allowing students to reach their full potential. However, staff have been forced to either accept a new unfair contract or face losing their jobs.",
