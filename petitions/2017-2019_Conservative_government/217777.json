        "additional_details": "There are no minimum space standards for new housing in Britain. Research by CABE and LABC Warranty shows that developers are making homes smaller and smaller. New homes lack space for family meals, for childrens play and homework, and for storage. Quoting the Net Internal Floor area (e.g. as defined by the Valuation Office Agency) would help buyers understand exactly what they are getting, make objective comparisons, and identify value for money.",
        "background": "Homes in Britain are traded in terms of rooms rather than floor space. This lack of clear information is a source of market failure. British homes are getting more cramped and less fit for purpose.",
