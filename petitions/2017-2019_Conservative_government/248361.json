This argument holds no ground as there are elections at many points for a multitude of different reasons.\r\n\r\nHalfway through a Parliamentary term there will have been hundreds of thousands of 18th birthdays. These individuals therefore did not vote for the government and did not have a say on the policies, should government then stop to call a new election? No. Leave means leave.",

Any change to this would harm our democracy.",
