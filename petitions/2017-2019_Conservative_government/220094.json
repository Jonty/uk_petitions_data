        "additional_details": "When the British public instructed our government to leave the EU, many argued that this was simply advisory. However, our MPs took that advice and voted, overwhelmingly, to trigger article 50. Since this time, many senior figures have sought to undermine the government's position. Many of these individuals hold, or have held, political or public office. Their behaviour should be carefully scrutinised and, if appropriate, they should be ejected from their positions and be stripped of any titles.",
        "background": "The Brexit process to date has drawn attention to many people who hold titles or public office and who have actively colluded with foreign powers in order to weaken our government's hand in securing the best possible Brexit deal. This could, undoubtedly, harm the national interest.",
