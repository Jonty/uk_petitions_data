        "additional_details": "Like the existing Tenancy Deposit Scheme, the deposit paid by the landlord should be held by an authorised party. In cases where a landlord does not fulfil their responsibilities, e.g. they fail make repairs in a timely manner, the tenant can claim for reasonable losses suffered as a result at the end of the tenancy.\r\n\r\nTenants are often credit and reference checked, however there is no assurance to the tenant that their landlord is trustworthy. This petition aims to address this unbalance.",
        "background": "Tenants are often required to provide a security deposit to cover repairs or losses suffered by the landlord where the tenant does not fulfil their responsibilities. As landlords also have responsibilities and can cause losses to their tenant, an equivalent deposit should be required of them.",
