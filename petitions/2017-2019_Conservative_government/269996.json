The government \u2018respects\u2019 the religious beliefs of Jews and Muslims but ignore mine! Government states that \u201cReligiously slaughtered meat is for consumption by Jews or Muslims\u201d. The FSA and DEFRA go on to say that this meat is allowed to enter the food chain unlabelled. I object to this practice. What about my religious beliefs my human rights and also the rights of animals?",
