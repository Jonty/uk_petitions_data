        "additional_details": "Kings College London have compensated their students as a result of the strikes. \r\nUniversity Minister has stated that students should be compensated for the hours of teaching lost. \r\nUniversities have been told to give strike refunds.\r\nStudents aren\u2019t being provided with a service they are paying for and should therefore be refunded. \r\nUEA has failed to provide replacement lecturers for the missed hours which is unacceptable. UEA students are therefore entitled to request reimbursement.",
        "background": "Students at UEA have lost out on hours of tuition due to the lecturers striking. Due to this UEA students are worried for their degrees and should be compensated for the hours missed. It\u2019s understood that lecturers aren\u2019t been paid for striking so their wages should be spent compensating students.",
