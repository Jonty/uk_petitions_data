From one hand you are trying to survive on a minimum money from another hand you are feeding yourself disease. This is the reason why I am writing about this, to persuade government to do more. We want organic with no added antioxidants, colours, emulsifiers, stabilisers, gelling agents and thickeners, flavour enhancers, preservatives or health damaging sweeteners in them.",
