Surely that's blatant false advertising when you need to pay well over \u00a3100 a year for a TV licence. How can it be called free view when it's far from free to view? So my petition is calling for a name change possibly but mainly to make any advertising clear on the actual cost of the TV licence and the need for one to watch free view.",
