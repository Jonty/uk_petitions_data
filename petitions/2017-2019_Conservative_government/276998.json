        "additional_details": "97% out of more than six and a half thousand responses to a consultation last year wanted to make it an offence for a wild animal to be used in a travelling circus.  \r\n\r\nUsing wild animals in travelling circuses is outdated and fails to reflect current public opinion on how animals should be treated and represented. There is no benefit to society or to the wild animals that justifies their use purely for our entertainment. \r\n\r\nBan the use of wild  animals in circuses NOW!!",
        "background": "Banning the use of wild animals in travelling circuses in Wales cannot be done on animal welfare grounds \"because the evidence isn't there\", the rural affairs minister Lesley Griffiths said. This is DESPITE Scotland having already introduced a ban and England doing so in January.",
