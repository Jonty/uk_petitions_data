        "additional_details": "The cost of delivering the 2016 EU referendum (not including campaign costs) was \u00a394.5 million. The majority of this expense could be saved by running a referendum alongside another nationwide vote.\r\n\r\nThe cost of administering the poll \u2013 including the running of over 40,000 polling stations, issuing and opening postal votes, and the counting of votes \u2013 totalling \u00a394.5 million.\r\n\r\nSource: https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk",
        "background": "Given the current deadlock, the UK now needs to hold EU elections in May. This is an ideal opportunity to hold a second referendum on Brexit, and avoid a separate nationwide vote. This will confirm the will of the people either to leave or remain in the EU in the light of all current information.",
