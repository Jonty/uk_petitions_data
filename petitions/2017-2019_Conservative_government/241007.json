The maximum sentence for perverting the course of justice is life imprisonment.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/false-allegations-rape-andor-domestic-abuse-see-guidance-charging-perverting-course\r\n\r\nThe decision on whether to charge someone would be the responsibility of the police and Crown Prosecution Service and not the UK Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling for a mandatory minimum sentence for offences of perverting the course of justice in sexual assault cases if that is something you would like to see happen."
