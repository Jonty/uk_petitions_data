        "additional_details": "The fixed term parliament act should have included in it \u201c if a nominated MP is found to be misrepresenting the majority of their constituents they can be subject to the recall of parliament act \u201c this would hand some control back to the people thus forcing MPs to honour the will of their constituents and would allow for a more functional parliament",
        "background": "Now more than ever many MPs are misrepresenting the people, constituents have to sit back and allow this to happen As there is no way to make MPs accountable, the recall of parliament act has very specific criteria so cannot be used in many instances unless there is a conviction.",
