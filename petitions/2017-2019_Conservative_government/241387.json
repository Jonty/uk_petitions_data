        "action": "If no deal for exiting the EU agreed by 10 March, Article 50 be withdrawn.",
        "additional_details": "Time is rapidly running out and we all know a no-deal will do nothing but harm. The government is deliberately delaying a vote on a deal they know is unacceptable, and we may end up without any agreement. Commonsense dictates that we need to protect our economy and way of life, and only halting this course will accomplish it.",
        "background": "To leave the EU with no deal would be disastrous, and no workable solution may be reached which could make this possible. We should then withdraw Article 50 and not reintroduce it until a workable plan can be agreed on.",
