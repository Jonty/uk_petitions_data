        "additional_details": "the pension shortfall should be split between everyone. For example a married couple that have to work an extra 2 years will be contributing somewhere in the region of \u00a325,000 between them, yet a married couple receiving state pension now are contributing nothing. How can this possibly be fair? surely it should be worked out on how many years each individual has paid up contributions.",
        "background": "it isn't right that workers leading up to pension age should have to foot the bill for the so called pension shortfall by being forced to work past 65. why shouldn't pensioners receiving state pension already contribute to the shortfall aswell?paid in since age of 16 yet I have to work til i'm 67",
