        "additional_details": "Homework is completely useless, as shown in Finland, where they have already made homework almost non-existent and yet they have the best education system in the world. In fact, recent studies have found that some students actually performed BETTER in tests when they hadn't had homework.\r\n\r\nAs well as the academical aspect of this, there is also the fact that kids are spending less time with their family. On average, kids spend an hour every night doing homework, instead of being with their family",
        "background": "Homework, as shown in recent studies, does not improve children's grades in any way and should therefore be removed from all UK schools.",
