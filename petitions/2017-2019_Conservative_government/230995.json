        "action": "Plant fruit and vegetable plants in public places to feed the homeless.",
        "additional_details": "I consider that many councils will oppose this as they do not want to 'attract' the homeless; councils are more concerned about their own profit than saving the lives of their residents. I hope that they will realise this is a life saving solution to a nationwide problem and will improve the tourism and economical prospects of the country. My hope is that councils will see the other potential benefits of the initiative; a more diverse ecosystem and a more beautiful and vibrant town centre.",
        "background": "I would like local councils across the country to plant fruit trees, such as apple, plum and pear trees, and vegetable plants such a tomatoes, in public gardens and flower beds. This will potentially save the lives of the homeless.",
