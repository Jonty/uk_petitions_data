Big fines should be given to teachers and parents and leaders of these demonstrations. And repeat offenders should have stronger  consequence When they are adults they can go on demonstrations but not as easily led children. LEAVE THEM OUT OF THIS. This is just a way of getting the figures up. Without the kids these demos would be small.",

Any child can be influenced by a day off and told something would be good just to get them interested. \r\nChildren need to be in school safety. Not led around protesting on our streets. Use adults not children. Keep them safe.",
