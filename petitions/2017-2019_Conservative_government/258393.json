        "additional_details": "Shockingly, the Europeans, coming to the UK have the freedom to bring their blood relatives from anywhere in the world to join them in the UK for free. This is totally unacceptable that British citizens have less rights in their own country than the European citizens who don't even have British nationality. How can the government give European citizens more rights and freedom than their own citizens. This is unacceptable and the government should give the same rights to their own citizens.",
        "background": "This petition is against the government policies in favour of European citizens coming to UK. Government should give equal rights to British Citizens and European Nationals.",
