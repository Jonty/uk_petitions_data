Rules change. Signs change. Road layouts change. Change the licence requirements. DVSA could call the renewing licence holder for a \"check\" free of charge. If the licence holder passes their check DVLA will issue a renewed licence. If the holder fails the check their licence would be suspended until they pay for each check and pass.",

Why not apply the same rule to all drivers?",
