They are then filmed and humiliated all across the internet for doing absolutely nothing wrong. Yet time and time again, these masked gangs are allowed to get away with it. This wouldn\u2019t be allowed in a city so why should it be okay in the countryside.\r\nI propose that all trespassing be made a criminal offence.",
        "background": "With the rise of anti hunting organisations, there has been an ever increasing threat towards hunt members, supporters and land owners for going about their lawful business. \r\n\r\nI propose that all trespassing be made a criminal offence.",
