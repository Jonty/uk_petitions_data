        "additional_details": "There is an extraordinary amount of pressure on teens taking GCSEs as it will set them up for life and are their most important exams. But this pressure is far too overwhelming and causing stress. With all this stress to get a good grade and pass with straight 9s. Feeling this overwhelming stress for a long period of time is often called long-term stress, and it impacts both physical and mental health. Stress also can cause high blood pressure and heart disease. However with classrooms especially designed to give experience in certain jobs and careers this would greatly decrease the amount of stressed out teens spending half their day revising things they may never need to use in the real world.",
        "background": "We believe that the GCSE system puts a  tremendous amount of pressure on teens\r\nAnd should be changed to 1 to 5 year work experience in specific areas.\r\nSomeone with 2 years experience will be chosen over someone with amazing GCSE scores in a job scenario.",
