We understand you're concerned about the treatment of people with autism in the criminal justice system, but we're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nThe criminal justice system takes account of people's autism in several ways. For example, an autistic person has the right to an appropriate adult at the police station. Court proceedings can be delayed for psychiatric reports and the courts can proceed under mental health rather than criminal legislation. Autism, and other developmental disorders, can be a mitigating factor in sentencing.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more here: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/explanatory-material/magistrates-court/item/aggravating-and-mitigating-factors/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.autism.org.uk/professionals/others/criminal-justice.aspx\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do to change the way the criminal justice system deals with people with autism."
