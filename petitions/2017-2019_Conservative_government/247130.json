        "action": "Exit EU on the 29th March.",
        "additional_details": "House of Commons library clearly shows an increase in the UKs exports outside the EU and a steady decline of exports to the EU. ONS also shows that we have a trade surplus with our trade outside of the EU but a trade deficit with the EU. There is no evidence to suggest that the UK will ever have a trade surplus as long as it continues in the EU. A successful economy must have a trade surplus to enable it to invest in eg NHS, Police, Education etc. Remaining in the EU will prevent us achieving it",
        "background": "Remainers have continually undermined the referendum of 2016 & are trying to overturn this democratic vote. The vote was clear, Leave the EU. There is no statistical evidence to support remaining but there\u2019s is considerable evidence to support the fact that the EU has held the UK back. Out means out",
