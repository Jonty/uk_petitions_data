        "additional_details": "There is also added behavioural implications. The dog can think the shock came from something around them at the time of the shock, such as a child, cat, the owner and not just bite them at the time, but become seriously aggressive because of it. \r\n\r\nThey can also make dogs very fearful. A dog who had been rescued now attacks anyone with something they deem to look like a remote control for an e-collar because they are so traumatised. \r\n\r\nThe collars are already banned in Scotland and Wales.",
        "background": "Dog shock collars are used by some animal behaviourists to control a dog's behaviour by using 'pain compliance' methods. The dog receives a shock when the owner presses a button a hand-held remote control.\r\n\r\nThese devices can and do malfunction and when they do they leave horrific burns on the dog.",
