        "additional_details": "As brexit is showing many MPs are failing the people who voted them in by changing sides when it suits them. The latest (at the writing of this petition) Sam Gyimah has just joined the Lib Dem\u2019s and insulting the constituents of East Surrey who voted for him as a conservative MP in the last bi-election. 60% conservative and 54% leave. He is now being paid by the people he has turned his back on. This needs to stop.",
        "background": "If an MP decides to change sides then their must be an immediate bi-election as they are no longer honouring their pledge to their constituents and party but still collect the cheque. It\u2019s a disgrace that they can do this and not honour the people that voted for them in that area.",
