(Local Constituency people voting only) MP's know once they are voted in they have 5 years to do what they want & not what the people are telling them to do. This goes for any single party in any single area, Labour, Tories or SNP etc.  People have a voice & it should not be ignored.",
        "background": "We have Elections every 5 years & the Opposition party has the power to call for a vote of no confidence in the ruling party at any time during those 5 years. Why is it we can't at local level get the same chance against our local MP?. We need law to enable the people to have the same rights.",
