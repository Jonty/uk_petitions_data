Why should there be more than one charity for example, Child aid or Foreign aid. Or any other charity that has many names.They need bringing together under one Administrative body.",
        "background": "In a simple shopping trip into the town centre, nearly every major shop -doorway and street corner has someone trying to raise money for a charity. Many of the charities are for similar causes but are under a different title. e.g. there are different cancer charities for nearly every body part. Why?",

In particular, we're not sure if you want charities to merge or to work together to collect donations. In any case, we can only accept petitions which call for actions that are the responsibility of the UK Government or Parliament. Whether existing charities merge or work together would be a matter for the charities themselves.\r\n\r\nCharitable fundraising is regulated by the Fundraising Regulator. You can find out more here, including how to make a complaint:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fundraisingregulator.org.uk/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n"
