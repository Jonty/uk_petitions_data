The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) is responsible for deciding on MPs' expenses and pay. IPSA is independent of both Parliament and Government.\r\n\r\nYou can find out how to contact IPSA here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.theipsa.org.uk/about-us/contact-us/\r\n\r\nIf you'd like the way that MPs' pay is decided on to change, you could start a new petition calling for the specific changes you'd like to see. For example, you could ask for the law to change, so that any increase to MPs' pay required a public vote, if that's what you want to happen. \r\n"
