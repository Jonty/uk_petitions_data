        "additional_details": "In the Porn industry we are required to be tested every 28 days and have to provide a sexual health screening certificate to Porn companies and other performers in order to be able to work, how ever on the current certificates Porn companies and performers do not require all STD\u2019s to be present on the certificate therefore people are still at risk of catching infections such as: Trichomoiasis, Herpes, Mycoplasma Genitalium and more! This is a big concern and I believe this should be a law.",
        "background": "I have worked in the Porn industry for the past 3 years and believe that sexual health is very important. On a sexual health certificate that we provide for Porn companies and performers in order to be able to work I believe should include every sexually transmitted infection instead of just some!",
