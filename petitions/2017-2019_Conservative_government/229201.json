Fundamentally this is wrong, but it also sets women up for prejudice and stigma - not felt through the names of men.",

For example, you could ask the UK Government and Parliament to include \"oligarch\" as an option on official documents. You could also start a new petition asking the UK Government and Parliament to remove \"Mrs\" and \"Miss\" as options on all Government documents and forms and only use \"Ms\" instead, if that's what you'd like to happen.
