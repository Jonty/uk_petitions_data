Children's Support Workers wages ranges from the \u00a38.21-\u00a311ph in contrast this is appalling; on a daily basis we have to take on trauma these children and young people(CYP) have faced often being confronted with challenging behaviours and surrounded with horrific stories/events these CYP have experienced whilst juggling with vast amounts of paper work whilst ensuring they have positive experiences.",
