        "additional_details": "Holding the final in Baku instead of London means a phenomenal amount of unnecessary air travel, which will massively contribute to climate change, the single most important issue of our lifetime.\r\n\r\nUEFA should be thinking about the environmental impact of staging a final 4,000km away, when the two teams involved are barely 10km apart.",
        "background": "Arsenal and Chelsea have both qualified for the Europa League final in Azerbaijan.\r\nThis means 12,000 fans will have to take 4 flights to get there and back.\r\nMoving the final to London we will prevent 8,449,283kg of toxic CO2 being released into the atmosphere.",
