        "additional_details": "Yesterday (14/08/18) I saw Santa toys for sale in Poundland. Other people have reported products in Tesco. This world is hard enough for todays children without depriving them of the one magical period each year to look forward to, without making them bored of Christmas songs by mid November. I accept businesses need to plan in advance for such a profitable period but the public face of Christmas should be reserved until advent.",
        "background": "Christmas is a special time of year for children, however, the magic is being diluted due to trade and commerce. It is August 2018 and already there are Christmas products on display in shops in the UK. This is absurd. Christmas advertising should be restricted by legislation to advent.",
