        "additional_details": "All qualified ACPs will have undertaken the MSc in advanced practice (level 7), this clearly defines the academia, and it is exactly the same for all disciplines, but within the role, some professionals are restricted in practice. The ACP is an advanced model to empower the patient experience/access to safe healthcare, ACP's are highly trained practitioners who can independently assess, diagnose, prescribe and discharge patients, supporting the shortfall of Doctors in practice, reducing delays.",
        "background": "The role of the ACP has developed and evolved and houses a multitude of AHPs and RNs, some can prescribe and some can't. This change to a protected title will afford those performing the role to access all the skills afforded under its title, such as non-medical prescribing, harmonising equality.",
