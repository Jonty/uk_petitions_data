        "background": "The election for UK Members of the European Parliament is likely to be held on 23rd May and offers the opportunity to break the parliamentary deadlock by canvassing the popular preference for 3 options.  This ensures MEPs will either not take up their seats on 1st July or will do so with purpose.",
