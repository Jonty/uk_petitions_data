        "action": "Donald Trump should not be invited to speak at the Houses of Parliament.",
        "additional_details": "We believe that the standing of Parliament would be damaged by a visit/participation by Donald Trump, especially at this sensitive time when Parliament is already riven with controversy over resolving Brexit and our future relationship with Europe. There is already serious discord between people over Brexit, likely to be inflamed during canvassing for the European elections. Discord would be further increased by giving a platform to such a divisive figure as Donald Trump.",
        "background": "We deplore the invitation to Donald Trump for a UK State Visit, but accept it will take place. We have deep concerns over his actions on the international stage, eg denial of the reality of Climate Change & its devastating consequences, plus ongoing doubts over his political and personal integrity.",
