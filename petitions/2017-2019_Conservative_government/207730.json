        "additional_details": "National Parks were created to conserve the landscape and economy for local people. The Lakes District is already over used. Park management needs to be refocused on unobtrusive conservation and stabilising economic growth consistent with maintaining a thriving, stable permanent local population only. It used to be very difficult to build anything but now business expansion is obvious, with costly building conversions and pressure to build big visitor attractions damaging the landscape and tranquillity.",
        "background": "Tranquillity and beauty in the Lake District are irreplaceable and too precious to be further damaged by business pressures. The area unspoiled is the attraction. It appears that our lake district is being seen only as a profit opportunity. Damage must be halted. Apply The Sandford Principle.",
