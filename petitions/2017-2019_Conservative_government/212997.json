        "action": "Raise the age of voting to 21",
        "additional_details": "At age 18, the current age of voting, most are still in full-time education or are still living at home. In addition, it has been clearly demonstrated that those aged 18-21 are too easily bribed by politicians with promises of immediate financial benefits, the ultimate cost of delivering which would be hugely damaging to our economy.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I call upon the government to INCREASE the age of voting to 21 years of age, by which time voters would at least have completed further education, if not also become financially self-sufficient and proficient after some years in the workplace.",
        "background": "It is my belief that anyone under the age of 21 has insufficient knowledge, life experience, work experience and responsibility for their own affairs to make an informed decision about the choice of political party to lead this country.",
