        "additional_details": "All other factors aside, the question : \"How Long Can the 2016 referendum Result Be Held As Valid For Purpose?\" needs to be defined. \r\nThe ONS and others can advise parliament as to how long the referendum vote represents the will of the people, and at what point it is likely to be out of date.\r\nThis is necessary due to ongoing deaths of older Leave voters and younger Remain voters entering electoral rolls.\r\nBy 2019 it appears that the small Leave majority will no longer exist.",
        "background": "The 2016 referendum showed opinion in a moment of time. The majority result of the referendum has been affected by demographic changes since the vote, such that by the time of Brexit in 2019 that majority is very likely not to exist. It would therefore become invalid for democratic purposes.",
