        "additional_details": "The BBC will argue that the licence fee enables it to provide advert free TV, however, when was the last time you watched the BBC and didn't see adverts for another BBC service?\r\n\r\nIt's time we had the choice. The choice to watch the BBC or not. It's time we stop paying one company to use another companies services.",
        "background": "When the BBC starting broadcasting it needed funding and the TV licencing system was born. Today we have hundreds of broadcasting companies. We can choose what we pay to see, but to see anything we have to pay the BBC. It's about time the BBC changed the way it holds us all to ransom to watch TV.",
