        "additional_details": "Mental health can change the way in which you take in information and how you perform in your daily life. This can affect the way that staff will teach and how the students make progress in their examinations. Mental health issues can often lead to you not doing mandatory things such as eating and getting enough sleep, these are very important factors needed to continue a healthy lifestyle.",
        "background": "We want schools to gain more access to mental health facilities that can greatly benefit their staff and students. Many people suffer in silence because of the lack of support that they can get, we want to change this to make sure that nobody suffers alone. This may include onsite counsellors.",
