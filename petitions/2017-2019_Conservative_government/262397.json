        "additional_details": "Three years ago, Brexit was a yes/no question. Now it is much more complicated. Many want to remain, many want to leave - some of those want to leave with a deal, some without a deal. \"The will of the people\" is often cited as being the driver behind political decisions, but the people have never been asked about whether or not they want to leave the EU with or without a deal. Whoever succeeds as PM will have to steer Brexit in this last crucial phase. Let the people have their say.",
        "background": "The country is in crisis. If Theresa May resigns now, whilst the issues of Brexit are very far from resolved, we will have a leader who may push the country in a direction the public do not want.",
