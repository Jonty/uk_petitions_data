        "additional_details": "A General Election will give us the opportunity to choose how we want to move forward as a country. Not just with Brexit but with many other salient issues. Such as crime, education and the NHS.\r\n\r\nA gridlocked Parliament unable to decide what it wants does not benefit anyone. A General Election is now the only plausible route out.",
        "background": "It has become clear that Parliament is completely out of touch with the people. Many MPs' who were elected on a manifesto that said \"no deal is better than a bad deal,\" have reneged on this promise and jumped to other parties. The public needs a chance to have their say. We need a General Election.",
