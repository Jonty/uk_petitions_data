The Brexit betrayal was completed last night with such an act by the PM. \r\nNot only has she shown contempt for the 17.4 million people but also for her cabinet by going against the majority in seeking a long extension to Article 50.\r\n\r\nWe will not let this absurdity continue any longer. A GE must be held so that we can sort out the mess May has put us in.",
