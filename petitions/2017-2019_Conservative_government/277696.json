        "additional_details": "Children are often refused access to their water or to the toilet at times which means children are being refused the right to take care of their primary bodily needs, sometimes causing unnecessary suffering and damage to physical and mental health. Children should feel comfortable in school, having basic needs consistently met for happier and healthier children where they are then at their best for learning.Having set times for toilet and water can cause health problems or worsen existing ones.",
        "background": "The UN\u2019s Convention on the Rights of the Child states in article 3 that the best interest of the child is to be the primary consideration at all times and that institutions responsible for children\u2019s care (ie schools) must conform with this. This right is often ignored!",
