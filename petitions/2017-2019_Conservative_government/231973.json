        "additional_details": "The law clearly states that you must not set off or throw fireworks (including sparklers) in the street or other public places. You must not set off fireworks between 11pm and 7am, except for: Bonfire Night, when the cut off is midnight. New Year's Eve, Diwali and Chinese New Year, when the cut off is 1am. Where as these laws are often flaunted and are almost impossible to police.\r\nSurely the safety of people who are reliant on companion animals should be paramount and this is compromised when loud fireworks are constantly going off. \r\nMaybe its like for the UK to follow suit of the Italian town of Collecchio who now only allow silent fireworks to help stop the distress caused to animals.",
        "background": "There is an ever increasing number of cases where animals, both domestic and non domesticated are facing a period of severe distress and anxiety during festive periods like Halloween, Guy Fawkes, Diwali and New Years.",
