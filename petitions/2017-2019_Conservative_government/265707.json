        "action": "Reallocate subsidies funding fossil fuel industry into renewable energy sectors",
        "additional_details": "Given the twelve-year warning which the UN\u2019s 2018 IPCC Report gave to prevent climate catastrophe, the UK Government's current promise to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050 is worthless. Following Parliament's declaration of a 'climate change emergency' in May 2019, this acknowledgement must be translated into actual, urgent political policy. The first step is stop funding fossil fuel companies and divest all subsidies, investing all of these into renewable energy sectors.",
        "background": "The UK Government currently pays \u00a310.5 billion p/a in subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, the highest of all EU governments. This is compared to \u00a37.38 billion p/a in subsidies to renewable energy sources. We must immediately reallocate all fossil fuel subsidies into renewable energy sectors.",
