        "additional_details": "Women were excluded from the House of Lords until the Life Peerages Act 1958 passed to address the declining number of active members. \r\n\r\nThe first women in the House of Lords took their seats in 1958, forty years after women were granted the right to stand as MPs in the House of Commons. There are 209 female peers out of 798 in the House of Lords today. Women make up 25% of the total members, compared with 32% for women in the House of Commons.",
        "background": "This petition is simply to ask the Government to address the patriarchal traditions that still exist within Parliament. They should acknowledge the fact that the House of Lords has contained women since 1958, and therefore should evolve to reflect changing society and the make up of our laws.",
