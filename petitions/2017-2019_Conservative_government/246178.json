This causes distress and a lot of emotion to family\u2019s but also takes away services from people who really need them. Services are already stretched and this is made worse by people making lies up to try get to people. If a person has real concerns why would they feel the need to hide. By making it so they have to use a name will minimise the amount of false and malicious referrals and complaints, saving time and money.",

Most anonymous referrals and complaints are made by people who are trying to cause trouble and make false and untrue statements. By stopping anonymous from being an option will reduce this from happening",
