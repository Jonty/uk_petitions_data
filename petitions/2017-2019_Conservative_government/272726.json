        "additional_details": "A voter who supports Remain may not wish to vote for any of the Remain parties in a General Election because they do not want that party (or it's leader) in power. \r\n\r\nA Brexit voter may not want to support the parties who are willing to leave the EU without a Deal' for the same reason.\r\n\r\nWe need a referendum which clearly tells parliament whether the public want to Remain in the EU, accept Teresa May's deal or leave without a deal. A General Election will not and cannot answer this question.",
        "background": "A General Election cannot give a clear answer on Brexit: each party has policies in a wide range of areas (the environment, tax, welfare) and the leader of the majority party would become Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nA Referendum on Brexit is the only way to decide what the public want to do.",
