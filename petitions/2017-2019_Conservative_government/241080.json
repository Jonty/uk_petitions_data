        "action": "Ban on NHS GP's using an unfair lottery appointment system.",
        "additional_details": "The Government has closed numerous A&E units and minor injury units.  Patients need to be seen by a doctor when they have a medical problem....not make multiple phone calls (if they can) to see if they can get through to their surgery before all appointments are taken!  Some years ago GP's used a walk-in service that worked really well.  If the appointment system was not allowed there would be no more missed appointments.",
        "background": "Over the last few years GP's have been allowed to use appointment systems that are an unfair lottery for the elderly and others.  Also some GP's make their patients queue up to get an appointment later in the day. Many patients need to be seen by their GP but have to weeks for an appointment.",
