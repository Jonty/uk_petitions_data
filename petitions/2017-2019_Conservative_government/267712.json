        "additional_details": "The Environmental agency were contacted to check that the vessel was registered and what was being sprayed. \r\n\r\nThe vessel was in fact a private contractor hired by the environmental agency to control floating pennywort. They said they were spraying Round-up (glyphospate) in the river, a dangerous and widely used pesticide. \r\n\r\nGlyphospate has been proven to cause problems such as cancer, cell mutation and bee decline.  Any use of the pesticide can run off and potentially cause harm.",
