        "action": "Revoke article 50 and establish a commission into concerns about EU membership",
        "additional_details": "EU membership entails a range of costs and benefits. A 1 year cross party commission could investigate the reasons the electorate voted 'remain' or 'leave' and identify the issues directly linked to EU membership. The Commission could publish its report and recommendations on which issues could be addressed by UK government policy without leaving the EU and which could only be addressed if Britain were to renegotiate EU membership. A proposal addressing concerns could then be made to the EU.",
        "background": "The country was divided fairly evenly in its referendum vote on whether to leave or remain part of the EU. At the time of voting the complexity of UK involvement and departure from the EU were not fully explained or debated. A 'yes' or 'no' vote could not capture the variety of issues at stake.",
