        "additional_details": "It is a matter of deep concern that a well organised extremist group can subvert a political party and entirely unfair that, once so subverted, the reasonable people have little choice other than to walk away and abandon everything that they have built over the years.\r\nWorse yet is the leader of a party can rip the nation apart in an attempt to keep their party together: perhaps we need legislation to allow for an aberrant party to be forced to split up.",
        "background": "This country is being destroyed by internal civil wars in both parties.\r\nThe only sensible course is for both parties to split up, but they cannot do so because, much like when a couple splits up there's a big fight over who gets the house & the kids.\r\nThere are laws to deal with that for couples.",
