Women and men, young and old are being abused and we turn a blind eye? If you have any humanity or empathy in you please sign this petition and create a world where boys can no longer be boys and girls are never made to feel ashamed or have to face these vile human beings.",
        "background": "This is a petition to campaign towards better laws against rape where the victims cannot be blamed.  It is a campaign in order to gain laws where the victims are never called liars and only sexual history with the alleged offender can be used.",
