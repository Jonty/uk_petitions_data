        "action": "Withdraw the notification of intent to leave the EU.",
        "additional_details": "The notification under article 50 is a notification of intent. Until the notification period of two years elapses, the notifying member remains a member of the EU and can therefore at any time withdraw the notification of intent.\r\nIt was clear from the start that leaving the EU was never going to be in the interests of the UK - neither economically, nor socially, nor culturally. In fact, the whole process was designed to line the pockets of certain wealthy individuals without regard to the wellbeing of the people. That these individuals succeeded in obtaining a \"leave\" vote merely shows the power of modern social media, especially when funded by dark money.",
        "background": "We, the people, DEMAND that the government withdraws the notice of intent to leave the EU (the so-called \"article 50 notification\").",
