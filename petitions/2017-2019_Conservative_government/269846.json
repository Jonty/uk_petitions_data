        "background": "councils only collect rubbish every other week and in the summer its disgusting when you have rubbish sitting around waiting to be collected which then smells and has maggots everywhere, i was told 1 bin per household, bedsit has 1 person and a 6 bed house has 8+ people and pay more council tax",
