        "additional_details": "When was the last time you needed to know the difference between cytoplasm and a chloroplast? You probably never have since sitting your exams. I'd say 80% of the information we learn in school will never be reflected on again after we turn 18. If we change the syllabus to teach useful, practical information, our students will be far better prepared to deal with EVERYDAY issues indefinitely, rather than once in a lifetime situations where we may be required to know that once fact or method.",
        "background": "The world we live in is constantly changing and becoming more equipped in helping us live without having to remember everything. Students should be taught so many important features of everyone's life, like voting, parenting, or even how to handle finances, which will actually support us in life.",
