It is recognised globally for producing high quality, broadly impartial news, information and entertainment. This is key to our democracy and global reputation, it cannot be commodified, by making it chase 'customers' in a Netflix style funding model. You only have to look at commercially driven US news to see what we would lose.",
        "background": "An independent and trustworthy source of news, current affairs and information is a fundamental pillar of our democracy. In an age of fake news and big data it is vital we protect the BBC from government interference. Don't let the current minority government reduce it to a subscription service.",
