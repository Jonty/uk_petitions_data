This has brought the motivation for Brexit into question as the EU are about to make this illegal. To show that Brexit was more than just an elaborate tax dodge funded by the conservative elite, the UK should adopt the same tax avoidance laws that are about to be put into place in the EU.  By doing so it proves that tax avoidance was not the main intention of Brexit.",
