They allow HPV to ruin their bodies and ultimately kill them from cancer. I am one of the lucky ones but girls are dying because nobody will change the law. \r\n\r\nITS TIME FOR CHANGE.",
        "background": "At the age of 18 I started with symptoms of cervical cancer and it took doctors 3 years to finally find HPV and pre cancerous cells. If they had left that until I was 25 i would most certainly be dead.",
