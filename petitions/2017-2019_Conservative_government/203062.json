        "additional_details": "In a local burglary on Winchendon Road reported whilst in progress police took 25 minutes to respond and stated they had to travel from Chiswick to attend the scene.  The criminals were gone by the time the police arrived.  The lack of a local police station has increased the public\u2019s feelings of insecurity.",
        "background": "Since the closure of the Fulham police Station on 6 June 2016 Fulham has felt a less safe place to live. There have been a spate of burglaries recently and several attacks by individuals on motorbikes. The triple stabbing at the tube station tonight shows how the local crime is rising.",
