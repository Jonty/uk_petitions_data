        "additional_details": "This petition is about wanting to reduce the amount of people that deem it acceptable to purposely hit cats, or those that don't necessarily hit cats on purpose however do not show any remorse on doing so, and do not choose to do anything about their actions which inflict physical and emotional pain on the cats and families in question.\r\nWhy is there a law against a motorist not stopping or reporting hitting  a dog but not a cat?  A cat is no less of a pet than a dog.",

I was a pet; my family loved me. \r\nWe are roamers & explore our surroundings, this does not mean that we deserve to be hit (& left) by motorists. \r\nPlease stop & report it. Most of us are chipped or have a number & address on our collars. The police can tell my owners if you can't.",
