It has come to a stage to start talking about the abolition of the House of Lords and any delay would raise anger among the public.\r\nFor those who don't know, there are currently over 800 peers, and many more to join soon. This is far too many.  A proportion of seats should be reserved for members from different fields like Education, Health, Arts, Environment, Trade and Industry etc.",
