        "action": "Have a general election in response to Boris Johnson winning the race to be PM",
        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson has considerable negative press surrounding his time as a journalist and as a \u2018public servant\u2019. Bad press in his personal life, a legal battle questioning his conduct in public office....notwithstanding all of this the conservative members have voted him as their leader. The British people deserve the right to vote on their leader considering firstly it was such a small majority and this majority was won by somebody else.",
        "background": "On 8th June 2017 the British Public voted in a general election in response to Theresa May succeeding David Cameron as Prime Minister. We face the same issue today - an unelected PM representing British Interests at home and abroad. To be fair, it should be put back to the British people.",
