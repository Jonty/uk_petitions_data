        "additional_details": "Please do not infer that this petition implies a hatred of migrants. England has always been a diverse country and I am proud of how tolerant and worldly we are. However, England is and always should be a country predominantly for the English, complete with our unique culture, traditions and values. At current rates of migration it will not be long before being 'English' is a thing of the past. So, in order to protect our English cultural identity please promote it and lower immigration. Thanks.",
        "background": "1 in 5 primary school children do not speak English as a first language. Foreign-born residents here have doubled in 10 years. UK population will reach 70 million by 2027 and 51% of this rise will be due to migrants. These migration rates threaten to drastically erode English cultural identity.",
