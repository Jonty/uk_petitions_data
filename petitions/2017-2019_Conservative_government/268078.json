Parked cars are deathtraps for dogs: On a 78-degree day, the temperature inside a parked car can soar to 100 degrees in just minutes, and on a 90-degree day, the interior temperature can reach as high as 109 degrees in less than 10 minutes. Brain damage or death from heatstroke in just 15 minutes can occur.  This has to stop!",

I am starting a petition that will hopefully result in it being made a criminal offence and to cause uncessary suffering to dogs that are left in cars in hot weather.",
