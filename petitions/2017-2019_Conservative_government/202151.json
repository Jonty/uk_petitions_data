        "additional_details": "We are told that the success of Brexit relies on the UK forging stronger links with the rest of the world outside of the EU. Boris Johnson has clearly shown, with his deeply insensitive remarks about Myanmar and Libya, that he cannot be the person to lead these efforts. We call on Boris Johnson to recognise his failings and step down, and and ask the Prime Minister to remove him if he is unwilling to do so.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson has proven himself to be incapable of fulfilling the duties of Foreign Secretary without embarrassing the United Kingdom by his constant gaffes and careless speaking. It is time for him to step down or be sacked before he tarnishes our reputation any further.",
