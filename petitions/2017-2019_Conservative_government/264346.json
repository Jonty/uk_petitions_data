        "additional_details": "We are all choosing channels and paying for those we want to watch. ITV offer alternative freeview funded by advertising for people unable to or unwilling to pay for tv. The draconian charge that is the BBC license is outdated. They do not need to be competitive. The public have no choice, its pay or go to court. Streaming channels can be controlled. You can't view channels not paid for. The BBC should no longer be treated differently and be protected by the law. They should offer viewers choice",
        "background": "When the BBC was the only channel and technology could not manage streaming. Paying a license fee was understandable. TV has moved on with SKY, Netflix,Amazon and Virgin all streaming. ITV is free due to Adverts. The BBC license is out dated and no one should be forced to pay if they don't view.",
