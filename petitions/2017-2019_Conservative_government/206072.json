We're therefore not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nIn any case, the decision not to stand against a Speaker in their constituency during an election is a convention among the main political parties. It isn't a decision or law that's made by the UK Government and Parliament as a whole. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition asking the UK Government and Parliament to debate the convention that other parties do not stand against a Speaker, if that's what you want to happen. You could also start a new petition asking for the position of Speaker to be appointed or elected separately in some way, if that's what you want to happen. "
