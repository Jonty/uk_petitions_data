        "additional_details": "The 75th anniversary of VE Day is an important day of national remembrance; people will want to commemorate & should be able to. \r\n\r\nThe existing May Day Bank Holiday celebrates quintessentially British life with long held community traditions across the country; Maypole,Jack in the Green, etc. \r\n\r\nThe principles so many fought and died for clash with the thought of damaging these traditional community events; both are too important to force people to choose between two such vital occasions.",
        "background": "The Government has announced that the planned Bank Holiday on Mon 4 May is cancelled and will be replaced with a holiday on Fri 8 May.  This forces the cancellation of existing community celebrations and fails to recognise their importance. Fri 8 May should be an extra holiday to commemorate VE Day",
