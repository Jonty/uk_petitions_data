There may be leaflets available at places such as GPs, but if your abuser is with you, you\u2019re not in a position to be able to pick that leaflet up. A victim of DA will have a few moments to herself in a bathroom. We, as a society, need to do our utmost to protect and help each other. A small leaflet with refuge information and a few facts may seem small but will hopefully go a long way.",

An average of 2 women a week are killed by their perpetrators and 5 women a week attempt to take their own lives in the context of domestic abuse. 1 in 7 children will live in a household were domestic abuse is present.",
