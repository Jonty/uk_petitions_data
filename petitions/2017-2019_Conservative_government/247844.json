        "action": "Brexit put on hold pending an enquiry into false claims in the 2016 referendum.",
        "additional_details": "With a new brexit date till the 12th April we need to act fast! the current political mess the UK now finds itself in - NOBODY voted for. It is in the UK's best interest to put 'Brexit' on hold while an enquiry to establish the full facts of the consequences of Brexit takes place. Then possibly a second honest referendum using only truths and hard facts, no false claims. Please sign this petition and share, for the good of us, the British public.",
        "background": "The 2016 referendum was based on dishonesty. Many people voted 'Brexit' without realising the consequences or what they were actually voting for. Had the campaign focused on the true facts, the overall vote might have had a different outcome. We need a public enquiry into the lies and dishonesty.",
