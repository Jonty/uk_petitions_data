Given that Brexit is the biggest challenge the UK will face in decades, it only seems right, should there be a second referendum, to allow 16 and 17 year olds to have a say on their future, as they will be the people who feel the consequences of Brexit the most.",
        "background": "Currently, you have to be 18 and over to be eligible to vote if you live in England, Northern Ireland or Wales. But in Scotland, you can vote if you\u2019re 16 and over. If we\u2019re old enough to work and pay taxes at 16, we should be old enough to vote and have a say on our future.",
