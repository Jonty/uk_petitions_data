        "additional_details": "This is an important part of British History and should not be sold, lost abandoned or forgotten about. This is about preserving and protecting our heritage and proud achievements. \r\n\r\nIn May 1943, Lancaster bombers of 617 Squadron left RAF Scampton to carry out air raids on the dams of the Ruhr valley.\r\nThe base has been at the heart of RAF operations ever since, But it is now being sold as the MoD tries to save billions of pounds!\r\nNot the ideal way to mark the 100th anniversary of the RAF!",
        "background": "RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire, which was also the headquarters of 617 Squadron as they prepared for the Dambusters mission in World War Two, has been home to the Red Arrows since 2000. The MoD plan to close this site to save money due to cuts in Government funding.",
