        "additional_details": "As shown by this link https://www.statista.com/chart/10320/drug-deaths-in-europe/ Portugal's system of decriminalisation has resulted in the lowest death rate from drugs if any country in Europe. By decriminalising drug possession users and addicts alike can get help to stop their addiction and use drugs in a safer manner. Moreover, the majority of drug users do not pose a threat to society and their lives are being ruined due to unjust drug laws. We help the disabled, why not drug users?",
        "background": "People are currently being needlessly prosecuted for consuming drugs. This method has proved innefective in curbing drug use and deaths. By decriminalising drug possession we can save millions of pounds on convictions and invest in harm reduction methods and education as shown effective by Portugal.",
