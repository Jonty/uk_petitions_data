        "additional_details": "Working in a school I understand the impact of children having time off during term time on their learning, achievements, friendships and emotional well-being.\r\nI also know holidays can be educational and a vital way for families to bond away from the stresses of day to day life.\r\nIt is currently cheaper to pay a fine and go away in term time than paying school holiday prices; If the mark-up from travel companies  capped then families can take their children away without them missing school.",
        "background": "An article in the newspaper today asked; Should parents be fined by schools for taking their children out of school in term time?\r\nThe question that should be asked is; Should travel companies be allowed to make school holiday prices so high that they are unattainable for low/middle income families?",
