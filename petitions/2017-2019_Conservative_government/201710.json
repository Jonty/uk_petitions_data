        "additional_details": "This dog went totally mad and for no reason at all, even the owner said he had never seen his dog behave like this and the dog went to bite him to.  This to me proves that dogs can be unpredicatable and therefore should be on leads when around other people and especially children.  Please help me get it made law that all dogs should be on leads in recreational areas so families can enjoy themselves without the risk/uneasiness of having dogs running at them etc.",
        "background": "I know of a few people that have been attacked by dogs not being on leads and also had their own dogs attacked by others whilst out.  I got bitten myself yesterday whilst out running in my local park, every week I pass this man and his dog and it usually just ignores me but yesterday it bit me.",
