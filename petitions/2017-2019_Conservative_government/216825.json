He was taken by an ambulance to a central London hospital where he was pronounced dead in the early hours of Wednesday morning.\r\n\r\nThis pensioner probably did not intend killing the intruder, he just was  protecting his property.\r\n\r\nWhat happened to being be-able to protect your property/family with enough force needed?\r\n\r\nLet this pensioner free, with no charge or no criminal record",
