In particular, we're not sure whether you're concerned about tobacco smoke or people smoking drugs, which is already illegal.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaning clearly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition calling for tobacco smoking to be banned if that's what you'd like to happen."
