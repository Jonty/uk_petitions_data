        "additional_details": "As reported by the BBC (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48384000), many EU citizens in the UK turned up to polling stations to find themselves ineligible to vote - through no fault of their own, but rather local authorities and councils failing to process paperwork on time.\r\n\r\nThere was a similar story for many British citizens.\r\n\r\nThe Government should take time and make provision for those votes to be duly counted and no MEPs should be announced before this has happened.",
        "background": "The #DeniedMyVote scandal is substantial in scale. There is a torrent of reports of non-Brit EU citizens in the UK and British citizens elsewhere in the EU being wrongly denied a vote in the 2019 European elections.\r\n\r\nThis fundamental travesty of democracy also very likely impacts the result.",
