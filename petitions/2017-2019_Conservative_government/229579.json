We want to work, we want to vote and we want to be equal in law.",

We cannot vote nor do we have equal working rights as adults however we can be charged adult prices in hotels and for public transport. A change must happen as we are fed up of being treated as children when we're not.",

In particular, the giving of discounts to under 18s would be the responsibility of the businesses concerned, not the UK Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition setting out clearly which rights you would like under 18s to have."
