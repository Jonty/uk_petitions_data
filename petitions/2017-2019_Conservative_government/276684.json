        "additional_details": "The Kurds have been fighting Daesh (ISIS) on the ground for almost a decade and have lost more people in the fighting than any other force in the region. They are the only cohesive infantry force that have actively taken the fight to ISIS, going door to door and rooting them out. Their role has been crucial in the defeat of the caliphate and the West owes them a huge debt of gratitude. The very least we can do is protect them from the aggression of another NATO member (Turkey).",
        "background": "Donald Trump has announced he will be pulling out the US troops currently stationed on the border between Syria and Turkey. Their role has been to prevent a Turkish invasion of Kurdish territory. It is crucial the status quo is maintained and our Kurdish allies are protected from Turkish aggression.",
