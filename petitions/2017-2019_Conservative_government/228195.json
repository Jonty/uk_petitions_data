        "action": "Relax Gun Laws in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "The UK has the strictest gun laws in the world which have only served to put guns into the hands of criminals and criminals only. As a law abiding citizen in the free world we should have a right to bear arms to defend our homes and selves when in public especially when terrorism and violent crime involving guns and knives is on the rise! The current gun laws prevent citizens from playing a part in countering crime.\r\n\r\nRepeal the 1997 Firearms act and re-legalise handguns \r\nLegalise concealed carry",
        "background": "Currently in the UK there is almost no legal way of self defence against criminals.\r\nThe nature of the law means the only people who hold and use handguns are criminals and criminals love strict gun laws and weapon laws because  they KNOW they are unopposed when they choose to commit violent crimes!",

We're also not sure whether you want to change the laws around self-defence.  \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Government and Parliament to change the law to allow any adult to buy and carry a gun, including a handgun, if that's what you'd like to happen.
