        "action": "Increase the budget for crime and justice and hire more police to reduce crime",
        "additional_details": "Since 2010, the number of police officers has decreased by almost 20,000, and Authorised Firearms Officers by 1,337, according to official statistics, alongside aggressive funding cuts of 18%. The number of police officers has decreased for eight years in a row.\r\n\r\nThis has caused a significant increase in crime recently, with the crime rate increasing by 10% in March 2016-17 and annual reports of violent crime doubling since 2012.\r\n\r\nWe need to increase the budget to stop this increase in crime.",
        "background": "Due to aggressive funding cuts and large decreases in the number of police officers during the coalition and Conservative governments, the crime rate has been rapidly increasing.\r\n\r\nA lower budget means police cannot respond effectively to all threats due to a lack of resources such as riot gear.",
