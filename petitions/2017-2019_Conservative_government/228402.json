        "additional_details": "A number of EU countries require vehicles to purchase a vignette in order to use their roads - for example Austria, Hungary, Switzerland and Romania.\r\n\r\nThe UK should implement a vignette requirement for non-UK registered vehicles, which could easily be appended to our existing vehicle tax system and use automatic number plate recognition cameras to police it, as they do with UK vehicle tax. Miscreants could be stopped at the border.",
        "background": "The number of non-UK registered vehicles using the UK road system, in particular large foreign registered HGVs, place a very heavy burden on our roads. The majority are fitted with long range fuel tanks and do not contribute anything toward the cost of repair and maintenance via fuel duties.",
