        "additional_details": "My son has no speech and is quadriplegic, he has been stolen from twice whilst in care homes. His disability is capitalised on by staff who want only to replace the item whilst being reluctant to report any safeguarding issues. When they are reported, the police and local authority can do nothing. This is an excellent environment for abusers to enjoy protection, rarely challenged.",
        "background": "The abuses given licence by the lack of cctv in care homes continues to rise each year. Almost everywhere cctv is recording us. In care homes these are not allowed due to privacy and data protection. The use of thermal imaging/audio only, would provide safety with dignity whilst deterring abusers.",
