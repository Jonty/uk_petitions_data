People are required to do this if they are making a witness statement for a criminal offence. They are not required to do so when reporting a crime. We also aren't sure whether you want this to apply to all referrals to social services, including cases that do not involve allegations of neglect or abuse.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition setting out clearly what action you would like the UK Government or Parliament to take."
