        "additional_details": "Madrid and New York have banned manspreading and I think London should follow in their footsteps. A campaign needs to be started on public transport to raise awareness of this issue.\r\n\r\nWe need to make these kinds of daily sexist behaviour visible, as they go unnoticed - this is the way forward. \r\n\r\nJoin us in making this issue come to light, so a positive campaign can be launched.",
        "background": "In my years of taking public transport I have noticed that a lot of men like to sit down spreading their legs out, taking up my personal space, making me feel uncomfortable and I am not alone in feeling like this. I believe we all have a civic responsibility to respect the personal space of others.",
