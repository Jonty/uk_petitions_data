        "additional_details": "They now have four young children. Destitute, they live in permanent anxiety, liable to detention and forced return. For the bride's kin nothing is more important than family honour : this requires killing the couple who have violated it. There are 1,000 reported honour killings each year in Pakistan. Removing the couple and their children into such peril is unthinkable . Re-location is unsafe. They should be given the protection of English law",
        "background": "In Pakistan the wife was put through a forced marriage and brutally raped. Escaping , she subsequently married her real love and fled to UK. Her kin regard the forced marriage as the true marriage and pursue  them for zina, living in adultery. For nearly 10 years the Home Office has refused asylum.",
