        "additional_details": "Many people end up choosing not to recycle packaging as it is unclear whether it is recyclable or not. Many manufacturers will only include recyclability information on the outer packaging, meaning when these products are then sold individually in shops, the customer will not know whether the packaging is recyclable. Making new laws regarding this will lead to an increase in recycling and a better planet.",
        "background": "Particularly in the case of items sold in multipacks, the recyclability of a product\u2019s packaging is often not clear. This means that less people will choose to recycle due to uncertainty. Recycling labels should be clearly placed clearly on both the outer and inner packaging of food products.",
