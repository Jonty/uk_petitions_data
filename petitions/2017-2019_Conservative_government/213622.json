        "additional_details": "Once an elderly persons hard earned savings have run out, the council revert to the belongings of that said person including their home. I am of the understanding that people who rely on the council for money or do not have savings are funded by the council for their care. Why should the government/ council have the right to take peoples hard earned money and property to fund care whilst others do not have to pay a penny.",
