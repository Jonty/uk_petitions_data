        "additional_details": "Jerusalem has been the heartbeat of the Jewish people for over 3,000 years. Ever since King David first declared it the capital of the Jewish people in 1010BCE. That is thousands of years before London was ever named Britain's capital and thousands of years before Islam was even invented.",
        "background": "This week, the US President fulfilled a campaign promise by recognising Jerusalem as Israel's eternal capital and has ordered the move of their embassy to reflect that fact. \r\nParliment needs to grow a pair and recognize that Jerusalem has always been and will remain the eternal capital of Israel.",
