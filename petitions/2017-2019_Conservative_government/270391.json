        "action": "Ban all uses of plastics, using things like bamboo as a substitute",
        "additional_details": "Plastic is causing 1 million marine animals to die due to plastic pollution, this in turn means that food sources are beginning to run out - leading to starvation among humans in the near future. Plastics take up to 1000 years to biodegrade, whereas bamboo can take as short as 4-6 months. Additionally, 50% of plastic is never reused, adding to the 8 billion kilograms of plastic polluting oceans each year. Nevertheless, the UK can reduce plastic pollution by using renewable, eco-friendly bamboo",
        "background": "Plastics are the main cause of pollution in the world, in order for it to be created, fossil fuels have to be used further adding to pollution. Bamboo, on the other hand, is renewable, eco-friendly and bio-degradable. It also has many other beneficial properties, such as being cost-effective",
