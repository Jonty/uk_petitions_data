        "additional_details": "Brexit was in part the people voicing their frustration with the government paired with public misinformation: Brexit will not solve the NHS. Brexit will not solve British social inequality. We need to hold the government accountable to fix the true issues of the country and stop using the EU as a scapegoat. \r\n\r\nYes, we are a democracy and people's voices need be heard. But the government has the responsibility to make the right decision to lead this country into a secure and prosperous future.",
