They left, relying on the annual increase to survive inflation. Using savings from the EU contribution, you can protect ex-pats reliant on UK state pension, who left before Brexit.",

Saying \"leaving EU will  not affect up-rating your UK State Pension only until April 2022 \"is terrifying pensioners.",
