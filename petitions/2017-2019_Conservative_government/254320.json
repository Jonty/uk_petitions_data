        "additional_details": "The recent round of indicative voting on Brexit has proven that a series of standard binary votes is not an appropriate way to decide on a complex multi option issue. A Preference vote could be chosen by the government and would carry as much political weight as a series of indicative votes, but would avoid tactical voting by MPs and ensure an outcome. The options could be selected by the PM and any incomplete votes should be discounted so not to skew the results.",
        "background": "Introduce a non-binding alternative to the aye/no binary voting system where multiple options can be tabled together. Options are ranked by preference where most likely one will emerge more popular. An improvement on indicative voting where MPs vote tactically and no clear majorities are found.",
