        "additional_details": "Living Costs Utilities, Rent, Food, Petrol, Clothing,Perscription fees are not cheaper for 18-24yrs, so this cannot be used as an excuse for paying them less. If two people are doing the same job but one is 19 and the other is 25 it is an act of  Age Discrimination under the Equalities Act 2010 to treat and pay the 19yr old less than his peer. Age Bands should be Abolished immediately and everyone should be treated the same no matter your Age,Sex or Colour.",
        "background": "Minimum Wage set by the Government is discriminating against people aged between 18-24 by allowing Employers to pay them less than 25 yrs & above for the same work. We should not allow people to be treated differently because of their age. Age Bands  should be removed from Minimum wage entitlement.",
