        "action": "Make outdoor learning compulsory and embed forest schools in primary curriculum",
        "additional_details": "Schools are not currently required to offer outdoor learning. With increasing numbers of children growing up in towns and cities, nature-based learning is often only accessible to a select few. Forest school activities have been shown to reduce stress, aid concentration and increase motivation. Outdoor learning promotes vital social skills, such as team work and communication, and builds confidence, resilience and creativity, to provide a more holistic experience within the education system.",
        "background": "Many children are growing up increasingly disconnected from nature. Outdoor learning develops awareness of the natural world and improves health and wellbeing. UK Government must ensure every child can access forest schools to develop key social and practical skills, and respect for the environment.",
