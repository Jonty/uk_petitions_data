        "additional_details": "The problem with this part of the theory test is that you have to spot 'developing hazards', and if you spot a hazard 'too early' you do not get the marks. Put this into real life, spotting a hazard too early? The entire marking scheme is pathetic. \r\nI do not disagree with the idea however, as spotting hazards is essential for safe driving. The hazard perception should be incorporated in the practical test and marked by an examiner, someone able to think, and not a computer.",
        "background": "The 'hazard perception' part of UK theory tests is one of the most hated parts of becoming a learner driver. \r\nThe hazard perception part is taken on a computer, where you click the screen when you see a developing hazard.",
