        "additional_details": "As can be seen in the US election of 2016, misinformation can sway the electorate and is ultimately unfair. Currently the ISPO can fine a newspaper for printing inaccuracies but those interviewed in papers, television news and radio news are free from restrictions and are permitted to be liberal with the truth, eg. Boris Johnson said to the BBC that he would be making 40 new hospitals, and it was later revealed that this figure was actually 6 hospitals.",
        "background": "Currently politicians and personalities are permitted to tell lies without any ramifications. This allows for public misinformation and unfairly shapes the electorate.",
