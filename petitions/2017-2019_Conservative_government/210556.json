        "action": "Allow 7 days per school year per family for families to go away during term time",
        "additional_details": "This would be akin to an employees holiday allowance at work however enables those families who are on lower incomes to be able to afford a family break without having to take out a second mortgage to fund it. Education should be taken seriously but as should quality family time which, with this current system, seems to pail into insignificance. Being fined for taking your child away on holiday feels like we're being punished for wanting time with our children. Something has to change.",
        "background": "Currently this Country has little to no allowances for term-time family holidays. This is in spite of extortionate price rises for holidays during school breaks. I suggest that families should be entitled to 7 days per academic year per family during term time to enjoy an affordable family holiday.",
