        "additional_details": "Consumers often buy tickets well in advance to make sure they don't miss out. Even if they change their mind months in advance, there is little scope for gaining refund.\r\n\r\nUnlike other online purchases, there is no legal right to opt-out during a 14 day cooling off period or to gain a refund if a child has used details without permission.\r\n\r\nMany services do not even offer human customer services to deal with issues, instead using automated bots. Greater protection for consumers is needed.",
        "background": "Currently event and rail tickets do not have the same levels of consumer protections as purchasing goods. \r\n\r\nConsumers will often purchase tickets without realising they have no right to refund or exchange, with the exception of cancellation.",
