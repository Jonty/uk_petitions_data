        "additional_details": "For the last 3 years MP's and civil servants on both sides have misled the electorate by choice because of self-serving personal or political parties interests. \r\nBusiness needs stability and given the inept media that seems to drive their own agendas has left ordinary people on both sides feeling frustrated.\r\nThe country needs to see from all sides that our political class can try to resolve this issue with-out political posturing and bring back to the UK electorate any trust in our Government",
        "background": "Politicians on all sides tell us that time is running out. Not have a summer recess may focus their attention. Business does not have the option to stop working and suspend a problem until it is convenient to deal with. For once politicians should lead by example and not put self-interest first.",
