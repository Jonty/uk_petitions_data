        "action": "No longer require a foreign language as part of the English Baccalaureate.",
        "additional_details": "Most students will not take the section of study seriously due to their disinterested nature. Perhaps, if they planned to visit a place, learning the language may seem more useful to them- Although typically this isn't the case. Take the Foreign Language GCSE from the English Baccalaureate and replace it with, perhaps another Science.",
        "background": "Children studying at GCSE level are faced with the prospect of having to learn a foreign language. It's a worthless subject. If students wish to learn a language, they should not be forced to study one at school (Where they will likely be forced to study French/Spanish.) Let them learn themselves.",
