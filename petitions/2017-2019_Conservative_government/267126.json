        "additional_details": "Helmets help prevent serious head injuries which can be life changing for families. The wearing of helmets for motorcyclists is mandatory by law and this should be extended to cyclists. More and more cyclists are using our over crowded roads and face very real dangers. Helmets would help prevent serious head injury.",
        "background": "Every year thousands of cyclists attend A&E with injuries following cycling accidents. Many already wear helmets and have as a result been spared serious head injuries. There are many people who do not wear helmets and sadly some of those sustain life changing injuries to their heads.",
