Not even an internship. \r\nWe know employers are obligated to give priority to nationals before international students.\r\nHence, we need the Parliament to sit on this issue. Create more opportunities for international students who are qualified. We have so much potential and ability. But we just need a chance to prove that which we are capable of.",
        "background": "It\u2019s been a challenge for international students studying in the UK to secure graduate positions during and after their study. I have been applying for roles and kept getting countless rejection emails which has been a source of stress mentally and emotionally. We need the parliament to take action.",
