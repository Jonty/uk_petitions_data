In particular, we're not sure whether you're concerned about the requirement to apply for Settled Status or whether you want to abolish the scheme altogether and replace it with something else.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, to scrap the Settled Status scheme and automatically grant all EU citizens resident in the UK indefinite leave to remain, if that's what you'd like to happen."
