        "additional_details": "We have seen the disgusting sight of MPs floating between parties which insults the people in their constituency who voted for them on their party manifesto. Should an MP decide to disrespect the voters and abandon the manifesto they were voted in on, then they should be immediately suspended and a by-election in their consistency held with 28 days (or other timescale reasonable to allow proper democratic process to be followed).",
        "background": "MPs represent a political party & are voted into parliament on that basis, therefore should an MP decide to defect or leave their party they no longer represent their electorate & this must trigger a By Election so that the constituents can decide if the want to continue with their MP with new views",
