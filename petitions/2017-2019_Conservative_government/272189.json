        "additional_details": "Too many MP's are switching parties in between general elections in order to adversely influence government, or opposition, power or policy. This is unfair on the people who voted that MP in post and can only be corrected by holding a by election or ruling that MP's cannot switch parties unless they resign.",
        "background": "When an MP is elected, some people would have vote for the individual, but others will have voted for the party. By defecting to another party an MP is depriving some of their constituents of the support he/she was elected on. It is only right that this is corrected by holding a by election.",
