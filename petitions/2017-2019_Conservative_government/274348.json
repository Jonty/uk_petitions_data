        "additional_details": "I call on the government to consider making it a legal requirement that all parents immunise their children before they can enrol them at a school or any childcare setting. I ask that the government takes into account the rise of the \u201canti-vaxxers\u201d movement and the damaging effects it is having on children. There is a rise of preventable diseases such as measles, mumps and rubella in this county and it needs to stop. The government needs to take action and Make it compulsory to vaccinate",
        "background": "Many parents are misinformed about the risks of vaccines, for example the misconception that the MMR causes autism. This is causing an increase in preventable diseases and putting children at Risk, Immunisation should be a legal requirement in order to enrol a child at a school or childcare setting",
