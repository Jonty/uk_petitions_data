        "action": "Ensure UK airports have CCTV in car parks and are secure.",
        "additional_details": "Airport car parks can be in very close proximity of aircraft, taxiways, gates and runways. Such areas should have comprehensive CCTV due to their location. A lack of CCTV delays investigations and increases the time it takes to get solid evidence. This ultimately delays the arrest of criminals who could pose a threat to the public and safety of aircraft. This petition would like to see the government make sure all UK airport car parks have CCTV to prevent unnecessary delays to investigations.",
        "background": "Following alarming reports of cars being stolen at U.K. airports and CCTV not having a visual of the car theft itself, has raised alarm bells over the security of our U.K. airports. It means that more serious criminal activity with a threat to life could take place with no CCTV to help investigators",
