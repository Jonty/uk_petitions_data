If this petition gets at least the normal percentage of the electorate that would vote in a GE, then goverment shouldn't just say - \"Nah, because we said so\" - like every other petition, hardly a democracy is it. \r\nId also like to vote with STV rather than FPTP to stop this horrendous two party system, but cant win them all.",
