        "additional_details": "David 'Screaming Lord' Sutch made politics more entertaining and, dare I say, palatable, for a sizeable proportion of the electorate.  \r\nWhilst taking the institutions of parliament and wider government seriously, he could not be accused of the same where he, himself was concerned.\r\nPolitics has gone mad the last couple of years, and what better poster child for our British sense of humour, self-deprecation, and defiance, could there possibly be, than Lord Sutch himself?",
        "background": "In these days where democracy has taken us to unprecedented places and situations, it is only fitting that we recognise such a man as Lord Sutch, who reminded us all that politics does not have to be boring, or even sensible.",
