        "additional_details": "Theresa May's Government has reneged on its promise to the Manchester people to foot the cost for the Manchester bombing, which devastated the city and its residents. The policing bill alone has cost \u00a39.8 million. We are calling for the Government to immediately guarantee the \u00a317 million pledged is made available to cover the cost of the bombing.",
        "background": "In May 2017 the Manchester Arena was bombed in a suicide attack. This claimed the lives of 22 people and injured 512 others. At the time Theresa May promised that the Government would foot the entire \u00a317 million, but it has now gone back on this and pledged only \u00a312 million in the November budget.",
