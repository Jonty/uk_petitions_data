So much so that passengers on a train at Hitchin had to stop the doors from closing to get stops reinstated. The whole introduction of the timetables has been a shambles from the start and has left many people stranded, as well as making lots of us frequently late for work. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-england-44299902",

We are all aware how poor the service has been, with hundreds of cancelled trains and even more delays, with little apology from GTR.",

The decision to refund ticket prices is a matter for Govia Thameslink.\r\n\r\nAlthough the UK Government and Parliament are not directly responsible for train ticket refunds, the Government can define the rules by which train operating companies refund rail fares. You could start a new petition calling on the Government to require holders of rail franchises to refund train fares, for example if the journey is delayed for more than 15 minutes, if that's what you'd like to happen. \r\n\r\nYou may be interested to know that the Secretary of State for Transport made a statement about timetable changes on Monday 4 June and MPs asked questions about it. \r\n\r\nYou can read the statement here: https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2018-06-04/debates/8053C64D-817B-4041-BB61-9C445FDC599E/RailTimetabling \r\n\r\nYou can watch/ listen to the statement here: https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/b00320b1-dbf7-4fdc-b51c-db3e8a5f200b?in=17:01:27 \r\n"
