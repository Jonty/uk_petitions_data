        "additional_details": "John Worboys is a serious danger to the public, especially to women. He will not stop raping and sexually assaulting women. He needs to be detained for the rest of his life.\r\nWe call upon the Government to review and reverse the decision made by the Parole Board to release him early. \r\nWe also call upon the Government to demand answers of CPS as to why further claims of rape by 100 plus women were not investigated at the time.",
        "background": "The taxi rapist John Worboys, who is believed to be Britain\u2019s worst sex offender, is set for early release after a secret parole board hearing decided that he no longer posed a threat to women.\r\nProsecutors failed to bring further charges after 100 women came forward to report he has raped them.",
