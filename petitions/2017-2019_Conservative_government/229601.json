        "additional_details": "Brexit has left a high degree of uncertainty looming large over the economy, and the future of our country in a rapidly changing world. The differences in Brexit policy put forward by different parties, and even by factions within the same party is a testimony of its incredibly complex nature. If Politicians cannot agree on what Brexit means, surely it is for the people to decide, with the option of changing their mind. This is not against democracy. It is in keeping with its highest principles.",
        "background": "Doubtless, Brexit is going to alter our country for many years to come, if not forever. This incredibly momentous decision was taken in a simple majority vote by the people with no clear understanding of what it means in practice. The government's interpretation of it must be put to the people.",
