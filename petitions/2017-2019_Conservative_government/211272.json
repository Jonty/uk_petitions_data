There is an equal pay law but clearly it is not effective as there are so many discrepancies between pay. We need the law to be re-examined to ensure that companies are keeping to the guidelines.",
        "background": "We are campaigning so women have equal rights to men. They have fought hard to gain equality some lives have even been lost through these experiences.\r\nWomen are paid 20% less than men with the same training and ability. Hence why no gender is stronger or deserves to be paid more than the other.",
