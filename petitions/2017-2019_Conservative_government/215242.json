It's that simple. \r\n\r\nNo more subsidised food & drink..take a packed lunch I suggest shopping in Aldi or other cheaper places. \r\nLive in only one house... relocate if needed. Do not expect mortgage and entertainment packages nor council tax to be paid for by public purse. \r\nTime to tighten the belts.",
        "background": "If the UK Government is correct that austerity measures are neccessary for the UK Economy to thrive then Westminster need to prove it by cutting off their own access to the public purse. \r\nThey all have a very generous Salary & should like the rest of us Do, have to use that to cover cost of living.",
