Unfortunately, this means that a lot of people are trapped in a living hell as they have no way of legally fighting back. My sister attempted suicide as a result of neighbour harassment and yet we were offered mediation - a victim should not be asked to take part in mediation with those harassing them. There needs to be an enforceable Law to stop this.",

The Police were unable to deal with this matter, in fact they were unwilling to look at the various files of evidence that had been gathered.",
