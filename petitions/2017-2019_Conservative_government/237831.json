        "additional_details": "Many of the topics from the old exam board such as The Suffragettes, are no longer being taught at secondary schools or colleges. I think this is poor. Young people especially women deserve to learn about what our ancestors fought for and how we wouldn\u2019t have the rights we do today if it wasn\u2019t for their battle. This topic shouldn\u2019t have been scrapped from the exam board- and especially shouldn\u2019t have been replaced by useless and uncurrent topics eg.The Norman Conquest and the Stuart era.",
        "background": "History is a brilliant and important subject, however I believe that key points in history are no longer being addressed. The Suffragettes was and is an incredibly important part of our worlds history-and I think that young people need to be taught about what these women did for our current society.",

You could start a new petition asking for the law to be changed so schools have to teach it if that is something you would like to see happen."
