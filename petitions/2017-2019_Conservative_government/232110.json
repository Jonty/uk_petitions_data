        "additional_details": "There have been many concerns about how this is seen as \u2018cruel\u2019. You are not allowed to eat or drink and can only go to the toilet a couple times a day, where you then have to be escorted to and from the toilet. It is like a prison and sometimes the reason for being in there could be something as minor as having a nose piercing and due to that have to be taken away from education and be made to sit and face a wall for 6 hours.",
        "background": "Isolation in secondary school is where a student is placed all day if they are seen to have misbehaved. It is a tiny desk facing the wall with 2 bits on each side so you cannot see around you. You get taken from informative lessons to sit and face a wall.",
