        "additional_details": "Given the gravity of scale of covering up by the NHS & lack of action taken by complaint bodies & those in Government, this new body should have all the powers necessary to investigate all complaints. In order to avoid harm to patients the government need to carry out an investigation across the UK to identify the systemic failure across the NHS & avoid future harm to patients. It must include victims left with ongoing health problems/disabilities & families who have lost a loved one since 1980",
        "background": "For over 40 yrs, the system has failed to protect patients who have suffered medical accidents/errors under the NHS. A toxic culture has prevailed within the NHS of closing ranks to cover up complaints. We need a new body to investigate all unresolved complaints and the misuse of powers/public money",
