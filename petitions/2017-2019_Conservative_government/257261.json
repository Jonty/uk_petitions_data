Not allowing disrespectful behaviour. An extension of this power should be used for vehicles where drivers or riders are likely to cause injury to others if the behaviour continued.\r\nA new moderate correction law should also be passed for lawful chastisement of a person who is believed to be showing disrespect to police or not supporting police officers",

We need to take unprecedented measures for the police to regain the respect and authority.\r\nPolice must be given the correct protection in law.\r\nCurrently officers using force are protected\u00a0when using reasonable force.",
