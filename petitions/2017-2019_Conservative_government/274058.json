        "additional_details": "Only 2.2% of UK employers are Tier-2 sponsors, which makes it challenging for existing international students with job offers to take employment without a Post-Study Work visa. It leaves them with no other option but to leave the UK. This adversely affects not only their careers but also their lives after having lived in the UK for three years and more for some students.\r\n\r\nSponsor employers: 30,451 (Register of Sponsors 2019)\r\nNumber of employer businesses: 1417,000 (Business Statistics 2018)",
        "background": "A new 2-year Post-Study Work visa has been announced for international students coming to the UK from 2020. The visa excludes thousands of current international students in the UK. This exclusion means the majority of these students with job offers are unable to build successful careers in the UK.",
