        "additional_details": "A deal was not on the the ballot paper in 2016 and should not be made the default option by parliament or the government. \r\n\r\nParliament have already demanded two delays which succeeded and have now ruled out a no deal exit. This does not just show how weak we are when negotiating, but the EU will not shift on their position because we can\u2019t threaten them with a no deal, \r\n\r\nIn 2016 we were told 2 years after A50 was implemented we would either leave WITH or WITHOUT a deal.",
        "background": "Repeal the Letwin/Ben bill and make no deal the default option, this would help not just with negotiations but so we have a fall back plan for if a deal is not reached.",
