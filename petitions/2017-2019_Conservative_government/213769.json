        "action": "Change the law to stop councils blocking complaints by withholding all records",
        "additional_details": "Currently Councils/County Councils can withhold records to block complaints and there is nothing that individuals can do. We have experienced failures by WBC and SCC over 30 yrs and have contacted our local MP who refused to get involved. We have tried to contact the Chief Executive of the Information Commission who has maintained silence and this is allowing the poorest in our communities and those who are more vulnerable to discrimination not to be able to pursue their complaints any further.",
        "background": "A request for full disclosure of all records was made to Woking Borough Council it appeared that they would comply until a request was made to the Chief Executive that he confirm if the Council were going to withhold any records and this resulted in the Council declining full disclosure.",
