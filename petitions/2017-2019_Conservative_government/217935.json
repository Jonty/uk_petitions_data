        "additional_details": "Focusing on preventing errors rather than finding a scapegoat in a \u2018just\u2019 (\u2018no blame\u2019) culture is how the aviation industry has saved thousands of lives. Healthcare investigation should thus adopt a \u2018no blame\u2019 culture which focuses on stopping mistake recurrence, and ensures individuals are not criminalised for system failures. The law should be changed so healthcare staff are only prosecuted if mistakes are intentional or grossly careless. Regulators should focus on retraining, not punishment.",
        "background": "Underfunding and understaffing has made NHS working conditions incredibly difficult. However, staff now face criminal charges if they make an honest mistake. They also face further proceedings that can strip their licence to work forever. This is unfair, unconstructive and worsens patient safety.",
