By announcing New Zealand as joint winners nothing will be taken away from England's achievements. Instead it will set an example which will be talked for centuries.\r\n\r\nEngland Men's Cricket team have already entered history books but by correcting this error this game will forever earn it's tag of Gentlemen's game.\r\n\r\nLet's give the greatest ever game - greatest ever ending.",
