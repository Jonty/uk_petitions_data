We understand you want to ease access to epipens but we're not sure if you want to remove requirements on pharmacies or on patients. We're also not sure if you want to remove other requirements or just a requirement to fax prescriptions.  \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nThere are already petitions about access to epipens, which you might like to sign. You're more likely to get action on an issue if you sign and share a single petition.\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/234712\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/258291\r\n"
