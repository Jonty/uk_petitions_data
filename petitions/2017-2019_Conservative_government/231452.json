        "additional_details": "I was talking to a veteran Police Officer of 25 years and he told me that covering roughly 219,190 people there are only 10 police officers on his shift at one time. I just do not understand how our local police forces are meant to keep up safe when they are massively overstretched. Please help the government gain awareness of Hampshire and our country's issues.",
        "background": "So far this year Hampshire Constabulary alone have had to cut over 100 officers and 50 members of staff. Bearing in mind that the average UK Police officers makes an estimated 9 arrests a year that is roughly  900 criminals that get to remain free and roughly 900 victims without justice every year.",
