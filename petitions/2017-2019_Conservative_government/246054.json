        "additional_details": "Multiple students from multiple Universities have had the same feelings towards this matter. Multiple students have considered dropping out. Yet we wonder why mental health is on the rise, with this pressure and lack of support, growth for learning in the lectures and seminars; and the constant worry of debt. We question is it worth it? Although money is one of the biggest worries of students. If only \u00a31000 was dropped per year off the tuition fee, this would most definitely decrease economic worry and stress. What a difference it would make to all students across England. Is Our mental health worth less than your money, or are you ready to make a difference to thousands of young peoples lives?",
        "background": "Tuition fees are far too high! From my own personal experience I believe that the amount of tuition fees is no where near the learning experience we receive. Many facilities are not refurbished, teaching is often crammed, thus understanding is resisted due to the short amount of time.",
