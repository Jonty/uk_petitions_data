        "additional_details": "The Telegraph and the BBC have noted the use of rubber bullets by the police. Online evidence, being shared by the protesters, also point to sexual assault and violent attacks carried out by the student wing of the ruling party, Awami League and the authorities.\r\nPer the WHO, there are 20,000 road fatalities every year in Bangladesh. The government's violent crackdown is thought to be fueled by fears of anti-government sentiments leading up to the general election.",
        "background": "The protests demanding more stringent road safety, were triggered when 2 students were killed by a speeding bus.The student-led protests are being targeted by state-sponsored violence. Bangladesh's government has also shut down access to mobile internet in many parts of the country in response.",
