        "additional_details": "The Monarch, as head of state, has the ability to do this and does not wield this power lightly, certainly not for centuries. This does not mean removing politicians from office, Queen Elizabeth taking control of the country, appointing people to positions of power or dictating policies in any way. This is an option meant for last resort to avoid tyranny, dictatorship or oppression, but in this case to avoid a critical mismanagement caused by systemic incompetence and/or corruption.",
        "background": "This government is totally incapable of running a bath, let alone a country. The Queen has the power to dissolve parliament in such a situation and call a general election. A drastic course of action, but at this point of crisis such action may actually be needed.",
