        "additional_details": "It is estimated that over 12 tonnes of plastic ends up in our oceans each year. \r\nThe plastic is appearing all over the planet, from beaches here in the U.K. To uninhabited islands in the Pacific. Not only is it choking sealife but it has become part of the food chain eventually ending up on our plate. A biodegradable alternative like Hemp plastic would stop this poison destroying our oceans and our planet.",
        "background": "Plastic is fast becoming a problem that humans have caused. Damaging our oceans, infecting sea life and ourselves whilst polluting our planet on a worrying scale. We need to act fast and greatly reduce the amount of plastic being produced. We need to switch to a bio degradable alternative, hemp.",
