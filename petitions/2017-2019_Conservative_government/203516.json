With the correct guidance and information women should be allowed to make decisions on their own care such as a hysterectomy, if that will improve their quality of life. \r\nThis can only be delivered if GP\u2019s gain additional training on women\u2019s health diseases.",
        "background": "If you are the 1 in 10 with endometriosis you may not know; constipation, STI's and mental health are some common misdiagnosis. Maybe 7 years later a surgeon operates. They tell you that they couldn't remove it all to 'protect' your fertility, you're left in pain with difficulty conceiving.",
