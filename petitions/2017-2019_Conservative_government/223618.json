        "additional_details": "Telegraph of 5 February 2018, reported Health minister  saying: \"Our NHS is always there when you need it, paid for by British taxpayers. These people, even though non-EU, pay taxes/NI as well which goes into the NHS. AAS believes in the United Kingdom as a country which champions fairness & subjecting applicants who already pay N.I to pay another mandatory NHS surcharge amounts to double taxation & therefore an unfair practice. AAS is therefore calling for a review and scrapping of this charge.",
        "background": "It has come to the notice of Association of Africans in Scotland (AAS), a charitable organisation that non EU families who legally live, work&pay taxes/N.I in the UK are asked to cough out an additional NHS surcharge (separate from the HO fees&other costs) when they renew their immigration documents",
