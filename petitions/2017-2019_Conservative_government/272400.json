        "additional_details": "This subsidy is  paid for by us in the UK through higher postage costs. This is a huge subsidy for the Chinese exporters. It is cheaper to send airmail from China than it is for us to send the equivalent WITHIN the UK. \r\nTwo million items a week are thought to arrive each week from China. They are transported by air freight to the UK.  Because the UK Govt is a signatory to UPU, it is a Govt. matter. Royal Mail must abide by the UN ruling. Hence we all pay  more for our stamps than is necessary.\r\nIt\u2019s no wonder why high street retailers are suffering and why UK manufacturing continues to decline. Let\u2019s stop subsiding Chinese imports NOW!",
        "background": "Because the UK Govt. is a member of the Universal Postal Union (U. N. agency) we are all subsiding items sent by China Post whenever a small package is delivered within the UK - because the UN recognises China as a \"Developing Nation\".",
