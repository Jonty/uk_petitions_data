        "additional_details": "The Child Benefit Charge should only apply once the total family income reaches the threshhold for both parents combined, i.e. a total Family Income of \u00a3100k. This way it's fair for all families, rather than those that have one parent earning over \u00a350k and the other significantly less, being charged. From the examples above, Family A & B should be able to claim the same benefit as family C, without the charges. Only if the total income for both parents exceeds \u00a3100k, should there be a charge.",
        "background": "Example: Family A have a total income of \u00a375k (Dad earns \u00a360k Mum earns \u00a315k) They receive NO child benefit. \r\nFamily B have a total income of \u00a375k (Dad earns \u00a355k, Mum earns \u00a320k) They receive REDUCED child benefit. \r\nFamily C have a total income of \u00a398k (both earn \u00a349k) receive FULL child benefit.",
