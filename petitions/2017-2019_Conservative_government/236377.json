        "action": "Reform the ban of all Autistic applicants to the Armed Forces",
        "additional_details": "The current ban on any autistic person to join any branch of the Armed Forces is unfair and discriminatory. It applies to any person with any history of autism or Asperger's, no matter how mild, and bears no consideration to whether or not they possess all the required and desirable skills for the job. This means a number of highly qualified individuals are being denied jobs in a field which is currently going through severe under-recruitment",
        "background": "Our country's armed forces are losing out on an incredible skillset. The blanket ban on autistic applicants is preventing many people who could prove mission critical from being able to play their part in protecting our nation, and we lose our chance to utilize their vital and often exclusive skills",
