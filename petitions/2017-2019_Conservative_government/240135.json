People move to Birmingham for our previous Outstanding provision. This has created such a gap in funding, services and the children are suffering. This needs to stop now before a child dies due to the failings. Again. Learn from history Birmingham!",

However, someone decided to save some money and close it. This is negligent, descrimination and continual failings from my Local Authority.",
