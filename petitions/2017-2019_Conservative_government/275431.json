        "additional_details": "Businesses are leaving the UK or entering administration. Medicines will be in short supply, Fresh foods will rise in price. Already the UK is being locked out of important research; UK scientists are being excluded from important trials. Skilled workers, for example NHS personnel, are no longer coming. In 2016 the electorate had no understanding of issues such as the back stop or the potential ramifications. It is often said that \"Brexit will not be as bad as first thought\". That's still bad.",
        "background": "There has been considerable turnover in the electorate since the 2016 referendum and polls now show a clear majority in favour of remain. The consequences of Brexit are rapidly becoming apparent and a mature electorate should have the opportunity to change its mind.",
