        "additional_details": "Due to recent events in parliament, it is clear the union cannot go on the way it is. It was always going to be a choice between our union, and the European Union - remainers have made that clear. \r\n\r\nThe English people should finally get a vote on independence from the UK. With a majority this would disband the Acts of Union (which would happen if any UK country voted for independence). This would automatically end our membership of the EU. \r\n\r\nTo the PM:\r\nPlease consider this option and get us out.",
        "background": "Scotland and Northern Ireland have had several referenda on being part of the UK. England is the only country not to have had such a vote.\r\n\r\nIf we have another referendum, it should be on our independence. If successful this would trigger the entire UK\u2019s departure from the EU with immediate effect.",
