        "additional_details": "Returning to work has become financially impossible for a lot of families due to Childcare costs. Often these costs are upwards of \u00a360 a day. This equates to upwards of \u00a315,000 a year.\r\nThere is a programme called FEET Funding which provides 15hrs free childcare to families who are in receipt of certain benefits, if the child in question has a disability or and education/care plan. This should be accessible to ALL children regardless of their situation. Give ALL children an equal start.",
        "background": "Children with disabilities, care/education plans or family\u2019s in receipt of certain benefits are entitled to 15 hrs a week free childcare. I propose that all children regardless of health, or family financial state be given the same 15 hrs and the same opportunities.",
