        "additional_details": "This cruel and barbaric act is carried out in the name of population control, but there are many humane alternatives. The cull happens twice per year, stags in February and does in November. Non-lethal methods of population control are mentioned in policy statements, but not applied. Hundreds of animals thus lose their lives for no clear reason. \r\n\r\nSign now to ask the Royal Parks\r\n\r\n-to immediately halt the culling of healthy animals, \r\n-to put into practice all the non-lethal methods that exist for animal population control and are mentioned in their own policy statement,\r\n-to gather scientific evidence on the biological and cultural carrying capacity of the Royal Parks,\r\n-to increase the cultural carrying capacity by education and by promoting greater tolerance.",
        "background": "Every year hundreds and hundreds of healthy deer are culled in London\u2019s iconic Royal Parks inc. Hyde Park and many more\r\n\r\nThe very animals whom the visitors admire and photograph are shot dead in astonishingly high numbers. Please help us send this cruel and unnecessary practice into history.",
