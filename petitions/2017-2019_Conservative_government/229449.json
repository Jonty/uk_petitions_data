Plus a lot of other country in the EU let 16 year old's get tattoos and some country's let you get one what ever age you want.This country is only a minority of country's that restrict you to get one at 18.And also when your 16 you can do things like leave home join the armed forces with parental consent, but no your not allowed a tattoo at 16 but your allowed to join the armed forces.",
