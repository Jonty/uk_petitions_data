        "additional_details": "Until 1983 retiring speakers were traditionally given a viscountcy, after which point life baronies have been granted. In January 2019 it was reported by the BBC that Speaker Bercow maybe denied a peerage: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46913477 This would end a tradition going back over two centuries. Speaker Bercow has defended the rights of elected members, and upheld the constitution of the UK whilst reforming some parts of Parliament. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45880544",
