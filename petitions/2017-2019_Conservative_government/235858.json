        "additional_details": "Sugar is the number 1 cause of children being admitted to hospital in the U.K. for oral problems. Type 2 diabetes has never been so abundant. High street stores are having to change their sizing criteria. Education is the most powerful tool in which you can change the world but when no one is properly educating and no one is properly listening, removing choice is the only way to get proper results.",
        "background": "The government is not doing enough to tackle obesity so, in places that are meant to be promoting health, a total ban on sugared products would quite simply just make sense. Being able to buy a chocolate bar and fully sugared drink in a gym is a total contradiction of its purpose.",
