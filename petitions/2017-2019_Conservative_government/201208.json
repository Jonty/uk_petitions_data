        "additional_details": "Even though Ofcom said it would be 'unwise' of an ISP to do this, no action was taken and I suffered for a year and a half. I contacted my ISP's and they said that they were doing nothing wrong. \r\n\r\nMy ISP later appeared on the BBC Watchdog show and the CEO admitted bad practice. \r\n\r\nLet's help make this bad practice illegal and an ISP subject to large fines when they continue to do it. Each time they add a new customer to an area like this it only compounds the problems to other existing customers.",
        "background": "For 18 months my 200Mb service ran at 5Mb or less. Why, because my internet company continued to add new customers onto a network that was already at capacity. \r\n\r\nI would like Legislation creating to prevent this from happening.",
