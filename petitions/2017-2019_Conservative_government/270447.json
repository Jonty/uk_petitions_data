        "additional_details": "Many cyclists ride through red lights at busy junctions, do not wait at give way signs and do not wear protective clothing (helmets/ reflective clothing/ correct footwear). With cycling on the rise, it is necessary to take the right actions for the safety of themselves and other road users as well.",
        "background": "With more cyclists on the road, many of them are not aware of the road laws, it's likely that accidents and road traffic collisions will be caused by uneducated riders. In order to track down dangerous cyclists they should have ID plates, like registration plates on cars, registered to the owner",
