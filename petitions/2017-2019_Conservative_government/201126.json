        "additional_details": "Following the introduction of the 5p charge on plastic carrier bags in England, usage fell by 85% in just 6 months. Millions have been donated to charity as a result of the scheme and millions more have been saved in clean-up costs. We can achieve the same with plastic straws.",
        "background": "Almost every piece of plastic ever produced still exists today. Most single-use plastic straws are discarded, often winding up in landfill, or contributing to the 8 million tons of plastic entering the sea every year. These end up killing animals, such as sea turtles, and are hurting marine life.",
