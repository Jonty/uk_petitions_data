        "additional_details": "This has been a well known fact for many years that insurance companies have been picking out every penny they can from young and new drivers with no justification. The cost of insurance supercedes the price of many young drivers value of the car sometimes up to 5 times.\r\nThis is hindering young drivers from wanting to drive and becoming independent as the cost is becoming extortionate and is only rising every year. There needs to be a cap on the amount insurance companies can charge.",
        "background": "Insurance in the UK has been continuously on the rise for several years. The cost of insurance for young drivers aged 17 years old even on low powered, low insurance grouped vehicles can run them up to the likes of \u00a31500-\u00a33000 with no cap. The average cost a new young driver will pay is around \u00a32000",
