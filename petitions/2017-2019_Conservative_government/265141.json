The plan to change the government of Iran is part of a oligarch plan of these Hawks who walk in the corridors of power in Washington DC.\r\n\r\nWe do not want the government of the UK to be party to this without a debate in Parliament.",
        "background": "The drums of war are now beating for Iran. I ask the government of the United Kingdom to show restraint wait for facts. \r\n\r\nKeep our hands off Iran and do not give moral support to those that want to go to war against Iran without any evidence.\r\n\r\nWe need Peace in the Middle East no more wars.",
