They already have to keep land clear of litter \"as far as is practicable\" and are responsible for providing bins. They can also issue fixed penalty notices to people who drop litter, and prosecute people who don't pay the penalty.\r\n\r\nYou could raise the issue with a local councillor, who represents you. You can use this page to find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling for a clear action that is the responsibility of the Government or Parliament. For example, you could start a new petition calling for the Government to provide funding to local authorities to pilot or implement \"ballot bin\" schemes. "
