Even if they survive they are all part of a food chain and eventually end up in our stomachs. Then it isn\u2019t just the wildlife that is suffering but it is us and our children. How can we provide them with a future and deny them of a healthy source of food. \r\nWe\u2019ve started to see whales washing up on shores with plastic inside of them.",
