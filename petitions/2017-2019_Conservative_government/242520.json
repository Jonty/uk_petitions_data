        "action": "Hold compulsory by elections when MP's resign their party whip mid term.",
        "additional_details": "There has been a rash of resignations in the Commons. That means that constituents expecting to be represented by a particular party's candidate now have an unaccountable MP representing them. Several of those Mps have publically called for the referendum to be held again because of \"changes in what the people voted for\", yet they see no irony in changing what party their constituents voted for.  We call for compulsory bye elections to be held in cases like this",
        "background": "The British public has been bombarded by calls to vote again over certain issues. The argument is that things have changed so a new vote is needed. By that standard, if voters elect a member from one party, and then that party is not represented, the same standard should apply.",
