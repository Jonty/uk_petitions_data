RSPCA can't do anything either. \r\nAs I said, not often does the UK have warm weather so least we can do is keep these poor animals safe from their owners stupidity.",
        "background": "When UK gets a warm spell people are forgetting the dangers of leaving dogs in cars regardless of windows being wound down. \r\nIt is inhumane, life threatening and totally unnecessary. \r\nIt is allowed in the States and with evidence of crime should be allowed here. Also penalty charge for owner.",
