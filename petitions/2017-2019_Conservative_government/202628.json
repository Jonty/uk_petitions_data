        "additional_details": "It has recently come about thanks to video game journalist Chris Bratt that digital software libraries are not considered to be assets and can not be transferred to a loved one if you sadly pass away. Furthermore, when you do sadly pass away these digital libraries of software get deleted wiping all monetary value from them as the terms of service are no longer valid.  \r\n\r\nFor further information watch Chris Bratt video here.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHLFUbU5ceI",
        "background": "Digital Software is everywhere in today's world, this why the UK should be the first country to consider any form of digital software to an asset to the purchaser of that digital software whether it being Operating Systems, Video Games, Music & General Digital Software.",
