We have had three years of chaos, wasted time and money. It looks like it is only going to get worse if we pursue Brexit. Most of all, I am Bored of Brexit. Let\u2019s bin the whole thing and get on with our lives.",
        "background": "I voted to Leave the EU in The referendum but would now vote to Remain. If you are in the same position (or if you did not vote in the referendum) then sign this petition. If there are more than 650,000 signatures then that implies the UK would now prefer to Remain in the EU.",
