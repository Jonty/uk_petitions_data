        "additional_details": "This current Government needs to have a back bone and stick up for everyone and not only for people that the US or Israel tell them too. They decided to bomb Syria because they used chemical weapon killing innocent civilians. Israel has killed innocent Palestinians for years and we have never bombed them, why, because we are like followers not leaders. Whatever the USA or Israel says goes. We are sick of this and demand a stop or arms sales to Israel or for mp's to have a vote on this matter.",
        "background": "This petition is for the UK Government to stop the Arms sales to Israel. These same weapons are being used to kill innocent people of Palestine. The current UK Government need to start listening to the people instead of taking orders from Israel and the rich backers of this pathetic Government.",
