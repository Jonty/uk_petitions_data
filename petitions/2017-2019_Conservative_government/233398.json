        "additional_details": "When I was in school I absolutely hated this. Luckily when I moved school in year 5 this wasn\u2019t a thing and I learned maths properly. I feel that the real reason women are not into stem subjects is because they actually listened as children and thought of numbers as this evil number line instead of something like one haribo sweet or half a love heart sweet. This a far more engaging introduction to mathematics and from a young age and the start we would see a more positive reaction to maths.",
        "background": "In primary schools, teachers teach students to add and subtract based on a number line and counting on their hands. This is a painfully slow and boring way of teaching children about numbers.",
