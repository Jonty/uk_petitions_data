        "additional_details": "With education toughening, rising standards from parents and rising suicide rates show how education should not be stressful to a point where teenagers are made to feel drained depressed. AS levels would make students feel as though they have another chance to get a better grade and would try harder instead of feeling disheartened.",
        "background": "A levels are hard enough,with all the added content. AS levels provide more opportunities for students to achieve better. Linear A levels are much more difficult and only worsen the UK education system. Toughening A levels was a bad enough idea. Bring back AS levels.",
