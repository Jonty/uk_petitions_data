        "action": "Hold a new referendum on leaving the EU before the forthcoming general election",
        "additional_details": "Some example questions are:\r\n\r\nShould the UK leave the EU without any negotiated deal.\r\nShould the UK leave the EU, but only with a negotiated deal ratified by parliament.\r\nShould the UK remain in the EU, but hold a public consultation and attempt to renegotiate our terms of membership according to the results. \r\nShould the UK remain in the EU on current terms.",
        "background": "Hold a referendum before any forthcoming general election, to avoid the election being fought solely on the issue of Brexit. So much has changed since 2016, and we know much more. \r\n\r\nThere should be an even number of questions on the leave/remain sides to avoid unfairly splitting either vote.",
