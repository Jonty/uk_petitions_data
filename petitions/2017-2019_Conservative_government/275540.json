Brexit needs to be resolved first and in a way that brooks no further discussion.  Two options, both of which can be immediately implemented, should be offered to the country.  On one side whatever deal the Gov't has struck by end October 2019 that the EU will accept (or No Deal if that is the position).  On the other Revoke Art. 50.",

Further, because it was undefined both sides in 2016 could say it meant disaster or paradise.  But now we know what a deal looks like. Now we can choose.",
