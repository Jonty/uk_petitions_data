It\u2019s not right. School leavers do the same job and get paid half as much as adults, even though they are in the same situation. It\u2019s not possible to be in full time education and work a full time job at the same time, so their education is massively effected by their hourly rate. If the minimum wage was the same it\u2019s possible to do both.",

Some 17 year olds still have a house to run with bills to pay, how can they juggle college and work enough hours at \u00a34.35 and still run a house. Some school leavers also have children! Is it fare?",
