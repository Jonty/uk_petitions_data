        "action": "Tighter legislation regarding animal breeding. More support for animal rescues.",
        "additional_details": "Thousands of dogs are killed per year because they are unhealthy or unwanted and cannot receive the support they need to live. \r\nYet thousands more puppies are bred privately each and every year to be sold at a staggering profit.\r\nTighter legislation and control of animal breeding and sale, especially during the holiday seasons, could give these charities and rescues (non for profits) the breathing room they need when those selfish enough to do so eventually abandon or give away their pets.",
        "background": "The way we treat animals in this country continues to go downhill. More small animal rescues and charities are failing due to underfunding and lack of public support, which means there are more animals left homeless and ill which more than likely will cause them to be 'destroyed'. This has to stop.",
