We're not sure if you also want to change the total period of statutory maternity leave and pay and, if so, exactly how you want to change it.\r\n\r\nYou can find out  more about the current rules here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
