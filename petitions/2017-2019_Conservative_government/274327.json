The police and the Crown Prosecution Service are responsible for deciding whether to charge people with a crime and the courts are responsible for sentencing. The police, CPS and the courts all operate independently of both the Government and Parliament.\r\n  \r\nYou could start a new petition asking for a specific change to the law. \r\n\r\nYou may find this guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service helpful: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/perverting_the_course_of_justice_-_rape_and_dv_allegations/"
