If they don't have family or friends to help out with children they will have to pay more expensive child care cost. Parents will be missing out on hearing about their child's  day, family time, putting children to bed and more. \r\nAs some stores require staff to be there outside opening hours it could be quite late before they get home especially if they are taking public transport.\r\nHelp stop the change",
