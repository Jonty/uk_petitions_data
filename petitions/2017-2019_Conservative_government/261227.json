        "additional_details": "If a Councillor, MP or MEP is elected for a term of office on behalf of a political party, and during that term they resign from that party, at present there is no legal requirement to also resign from their office. In some cases said officials will continue as independents, in some cases they will switch parties entirely.\r\nIt should be a legal requirement that in such cases a by-election is automatically triggered to ensure that the people are not deprived of the representation they vote for.",
        "background": "There have been numerous occasions where representatives of a political party have resigned from that party, but have remained in the elected post. This practice should cease and in future any such resignation should automatically trigger a by-election.",
