People of all abilities run super athletes and those passionate raising awareness and money for charity. Those at the back this year and others were hit with vehicles and sprayed with chemicals to get them to move. This will no doubt be because of local councils keen to reopen roads.

Official pacers are set times to help runners especially slower ones. They are told they will get to stay on the toad and not moved or harassed. This is being broken",
