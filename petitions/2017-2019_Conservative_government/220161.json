The police have said that the arrangement for people sleeping rough to hand over their belongings was optional, and that belongings were not confiscated against people's will. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could ask for the police to be banned from taking belongings from people who are homeless, even on a voluntary basis. \r\n"
