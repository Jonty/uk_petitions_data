This could be covered by the estimated \u00a38bn EU net contribution saved by Brexit (320,000 people saving \u00a325K PA) \r\nTo ensure the money goes towards home ownership, the tax saving could go into government ISAs which can only be used for home buying, capped at \u00a330k, means tested, and a ban on using for buy to let, house flipping for profit etc.",
        "background": "Rising rents, transport costs, costs of living and rising house prices are leading to a generation of renters for whom owning their own home is a pipe dream due to the difficulty of saving up a deposit, even at 5%. A responsible tax opt-out scheme would alleviate this.",
