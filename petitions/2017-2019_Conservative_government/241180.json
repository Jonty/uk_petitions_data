        "additional_details": "The recent much-publicised actions of Sir Christopher Chope have exploited technicalities in parliamentary process to derail important bills already read before both Houses. It is an offence to democracy for one person to be able to subvert any Bill that affronts their personal dogma. His actions have placed innocent children at greater risk of abuse, and shames the institution of Parliament, and all of us as a nation.",
        "background": "Important Bills are being blocked in a desultory manner which subverts democracy.\r\nTo prevent this, MPs should justify their objection to the house, and if accepted, obtain a seconder.\r\nFilibustering should be ended by allowing Members no more than a percentage of debate time for their contribution.",
