        "action": "Add \"real life skills\" in the national curriculum.",
        "additional_details": "Education should not just be about getting into a university, it should hold you in good stead for the rest of your life. Currently, our curriculum does not do this at all. Knowing how to analyse a book or use advanced trigonometry may be important in certain areas of life but not for life in general, and most people disregard the skills they have learnt in school because they are not useful. For education to be truly worthwhile, real life skills should be in the national curriculum. Thank you.",
        "background": "Skills such as sewing, knitting, managing your money, cooking, DIY, insurance, finding jobs, self-defence, first aid, manners (esp. in job interviews etc.) are incredibly important and useful to know in the real world, yet are not taught and are becoming increasingly rarer to find.",
