        "additional_details": "The current Tory leadership race strikes an eerie parallel with the same elections that take place in modern China today. In these elections, officials decide amongst themselves the chosen route for the entire nation of ordinary people to take, inevitably giving free reign to nepotism, bribery\u2014all the corruption and underhanded political intrigue that we see threatening national faith in our government today.",
        "background": "The procedures for political renewal have seized up, losing momentum at a time in British politics when every voice needs to be heard. We supposedly live in one of the great democracies and the fact we cannot exercise our control is accentuated by the dire circumstances in which we find ourselves.",
