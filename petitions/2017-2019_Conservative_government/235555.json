        "additional_details": "Either the House of Commons as a whole should take responsibility for this expenditure, or the government should. What is clear is that since they are responsible (and not the British people as a whole), some or all of our members of parliament should bear the cost of the no-deal Brexit preparations. \r\n\r\nIf the charge is divided between all MPs, the amount will be about \u00a39.5 million per MP. If the charge is divided between members of the cabinet, the amount payable will be about \u00a3280 million each.",
        "background": "The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, has stated that no-deal Brexit preparations are costing approximately \u00a36.2 billion. There is no majority in parliament for a no-deal Brexit; therefore these costly and damaging preparations are wholly unnecessary.",
