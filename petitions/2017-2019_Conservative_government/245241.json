        "action": "Pay Care Wokers/Support Workers hourly wage for sleep in shifts",
        "additional_details": "As part of the role, many carers and support workers are required to do sleep ins, this is usually paid at a flat rate between \u00a330-\u00a340 during these hours, you are on your feet and do not get a full nights sleep, you are considered as on call, you can not leave the service or take time out, you are required to stay at the service. I strongly argue that carers and support workers should be entitled to at least the minimum wage for every hour of the sleep in shfit.",
        "background": "Being a carer/support worker is a very rewarding role, however it is a very psychically and mentally demanding role. Carers and support workers usually work long unsociable hours including sleep ins. Carers and support workers do not usually get breaks as the role is very psychically challenging.",
