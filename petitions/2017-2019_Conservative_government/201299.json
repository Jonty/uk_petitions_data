        "additional_details": "I'm 26 and In forced menopause, I can't work so I hope to raise awareness and help other women. I experienced painful and irregular periods for nine years resulting in me being taken into hospital many of times in excruciating pain. I was finally diagnosed with Endometriosis January 2016, since then I have undergone three major surgeries and now I'm awaiting my fourth. There is no cure for Endometriosis and surgery is reoccurring \r\nAwareness needs to be raised and educating young women can help.",
        "background": "Endometriosis is known to devastate the lives of women and their families. As a young woman suffering with severe Endo I believe if I had knowledge of this condition I would have pushed for a diagnosis sooner. 1 in 10 women suffer but only few doctors know how to diagnose it, we need more awareness.",
