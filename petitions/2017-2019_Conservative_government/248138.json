Cages like ovo and the circus cage pets at home sell should be banned and replaced with cages such as the Alaskan, hamster heaven. The ovo&circus cage is equivalent to us living in a bathroom we wouldn't wanna live in the space the size of that so why should a hamster?",
        "background": "I want to stop the selling of cages under the minimal requirements which are 80x50, the cages that are under this size cause allot of stress for our small animals. Before i knew any better i had a small cage for my hamster he started to bar bite it and eventually lost his tooth because of this.",
