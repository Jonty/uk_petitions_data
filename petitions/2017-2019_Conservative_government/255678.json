        "action": "Remove Theresa May from her position as Prime Minister",
        "additional_details": "In the 2016 referendum the British public were asked if they wish to remain members of the EU resulting in a majority No vote. Once article 50 was triggered Theresa May had 2 years to negotiate a deal with the EU prior to leaving 11pm March 29th 2019. Failing to have a deal ratified by parliament May then asked for a 2 week extension to article 50 and on April 5th has asked for another. These extensions go against the will of the public and prove she no long represents their best interests",
        "background": "Theresa May has been unable to fulfill the will of the people regarding Brexit. Her withdrawal deal is unacceptable and flawed, and her continued extensions to the article 50 deadline is a betrayal of the will of the British people who asked to leave the European Union",
