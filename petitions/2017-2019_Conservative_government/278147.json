Public transport policy within London is the responsibility of the Mayor of London and Transport for London, accountable to the London Assembly.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling for a clear action that is the responsibility of the UK Government or Parliament. For example, you could call for free bus passes for people aged 60 and over in England, if that's what you want to happen."
