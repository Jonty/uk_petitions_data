        "additional_details": "Soros is outspoken about his desire to see all nation states and their sovereignty ended. He believes in 'open borders' and ever increasing mass migration from anywhere to anywhere, no questions asked.  That's free speech yet he has also manipulated Asian stock markets and taken bets on foreign exchange to destabilise governments and he funds the activities of 'foundations' - posing as moral academic bodies - that unaccountably indoctrinate his beliefs within all levels of society.",
        "background": "Hungary issued a \u201cStop Soros\u201d bill to crack down on subversive NGOs that pose national security risk resulting in the billionaire George Soros relocating his Open Society Foundation (OSF) from Budapest to Berlin.  This motion asks to follow Hungary\u2019s lead and stamp out OSF UK operations.",
