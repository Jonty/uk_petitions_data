        "action": "Ban trade unions in the UK from being political/donating to political parties.",
        "additional_details": "Trade unions should not be political. Members should not be exploited into financially supporting a political party in return for receiving access to legal advice and support to protect them in their place of employment. The biggest example of this exploitation can be seen in the Labour Party, who in 2016 alone attributed almost half of its funding to trade unions - millions of pounds from hardworking men and women across the country, often without being informed of the option to opt-out.",
        "background": "Many workers across the UK are encouraged and often need to join trade unions. However, millions are thus immorally forced to fund political parties that they may not want to fund or support, yet face the choice of either doing so or going without legal and employment support.",
