        "additional_details": "With the installation of this barrier it is hoped that this will stop suicide attempts from the bridge. The cost of this could be easily covered by the Dart Charge and this cost will be much less than the lives of vulnerable people and their families. It has been proven to half attempts made on a bridge in Bristol. Samaritans signs have also been used which could be beneficial on the DB alongside CCTV. This will save lives and needs to be brought to the attention of local authorities and Government.",
        "background": "There have been many people who have taken their lives on the Dartford Bridge in the past few years and these cases are still rising. This could be reduced and prevented in most cases by the installation of a raised  and curved barrier along the edges of the bridge to prevent people from climbing.",
