There's a law to deal with antisemitism but nothing to deal with crimes against other religious groups. The religious groups are minorities in the UK but they deserves to be protected. Protecting Jewish people with a specific law but nothing for other religious groups is a breach of equality. Introduce a new law or rename antisemitism by including other religious groups.",

Having antisemitism law but nothing for other religious groups except hate crime law is a form of discrimination similar to being antisemitism. Read additional details.",
