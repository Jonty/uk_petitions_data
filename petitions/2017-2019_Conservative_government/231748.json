        "additional_details": "Pragmatically, the Prostate Cancer Support Organisation has carried out its own screening sessions across Dorset, Hampshire and Sussex and having tested over 10,000 asymptomatic men, its results have identified a great number of men who would otherwise have been unaware they were living with a potentially fatal condition. As a result of following up asymptomatic men who have been referred to their GP and diagnosed with this disease, PCaSO has written evidence of the success of its initiative.",
        "background": "30 years ago free screening for breast cancer was introduced. Since then, men have waited for an equivalent test for prostate cancer. The National Screening Committee constantly refuses to recommend screening, yet 47,000 men are diagnosed each year and almost 12,000 men die of this disease annually.",
