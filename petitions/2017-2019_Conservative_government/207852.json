It\u2019s also required to scrutinise their expenses,scrutinise their contributions and limit their expenses.",
        "background": "Majority of nurses, police,teachers,soldiers and other public servants have been working on permanent contract and still they are subjected to these continuous cuts but on the other hands our parliamentarians get elected for 5 years and get multiple and periodic pay rises and also other benefits.",
