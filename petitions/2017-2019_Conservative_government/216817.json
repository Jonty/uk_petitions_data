        "additional_details": "As a public body..... We must either permit all collective religious observances or refuse them all. Our approach is to continue to refuse all such observances on the grounds that they are not traditional park-related activities and the disadvantages to the public at large of allowing them would almost certainly outweigh the benefits to adherents of a particular religion or belief.\r\n\r\nI do believe that Parliament needs to debate this particular issue as soon as possible, due to public outcry.",

This includes spoken or sung communal prayers or other events that are primarily religious in focus.",
