It was democracy.\r\n\r\nThe politicians cant agree, let the people decide (including 17  year olds) on the type of Brexit the country voted for.\r\n\r\nThere shouldn't be a Remain option, it is undemocratic and many remainers also believe that.",
        "background": "The peoples vote will never satisfy 1/2 the population, it will continue/escalate the arguing.\r\nIt is undemocratic to rerun as we have voted on Brexit. \r\nStop the politicians arguing for their own reasons. \r\n\r\nLet the people choose,   3 options \r\n\r\nMays/EUs, Labour 6 point, or No deal Brexits",
