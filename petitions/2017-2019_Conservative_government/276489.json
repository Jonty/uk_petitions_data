        "action": "Supreme Court Judges should publicly declare all financial interests publicly.",
        "additional_details": "Currently there is no register of financial interests publicly available in relation to our Supreme Court Judges. \r\nThis has resulted in widespread confusion and a question over their impartiality. \r\nFinancial interests of those in this top tier of the legal profession should be declared so as to safeguard their reputation for impartiality in cases they oversee. \r\nMany believe their ruling regarding prorogation to be politically motivated. Now is the time for them to prove their impartiality.",
        "background": "Following the judgement by the 11 supreme court judges to create a law that ruled Prorogation of parliament unlawful, it would be beneficial for the country for Supreme Court Judges to publicly declare financial interests so as to avoid allegations of bias or lack of inpartiality.",
