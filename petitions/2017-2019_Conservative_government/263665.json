        "additional_details": "I approached the Headteacher after my son himself asked me to contact the school to request he could wear shorts, he said it was affecting his learning in the classroom, he was just too hot, our request was refused! \r\nSome secondary schools already allow their students to wear shorts, some boys  protested in skirts at a school to get their point across, so why not just change school policy.",
        "background": "My son suffers from the heat a lot generally, last year especially. I feel shorts should be introduced as part of an all year uniform option, to both boys and girls, should they wish. \r\nMost girls already have choice of skirts or trousers, why should boys not have a choice at all.",
