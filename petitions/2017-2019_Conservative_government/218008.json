It is not fair to have to sit a life in the UK test and pay \u00a31330 to become naturalised. I\u2019ve gone to nursery, primary school, secondary school and  University and spent my whole working life in the U.K. The Government even recognise my 9 month old daughter as British so why do I have to pay over the odds when I pay tax and national insurance and have done my whole working life!",
