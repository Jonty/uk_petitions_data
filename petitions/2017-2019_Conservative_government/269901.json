        "additional_details": "Rarely discussed by MPs, the arguments against such a Bill stem from Edmund Burke\u2019s speech in Bristol in 1774. Burke argued that MPs are sent to Parliament as representatives, not delegates, and as such sit in the House as individuals, not bound by party constraint, but each free to choose how best to represent their constituents, even if that seems to be against their best interests.\r\nIn the 21st century, for the electorate to be denied a voice when their representative changes his or her own mind is patently undemocratic. We do vote for the party we support, which is why the Political Party names and logos were added to the ballot paper.\r\nPLEASE SUPPORT THIS PETITION SO THAT YOUR VOICE IS HEARD",
        "background": "This Bill seeks to ensure that all MPs;\r\n[A] Who join or create another party\r\n[B] or declare their Independence, or\r\n[C] Who \"lose their parties whip\" would be liable to stand in an immediate By-Election, so that their constituents could have the final say on their decision.",
