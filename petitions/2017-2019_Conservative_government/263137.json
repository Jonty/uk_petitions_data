        "additional_details": "The government must be held to account for failing to put timely and adequate measures in place to allow EU citizens and Britons abroad to take part in European elections in the UK as required by EU law.\r\n\r\nThe government must also explain why it failed to make the reforms recommended by the Electoral Commission after the 2014 EU elections or to take urgent measures to prevent voter disenfranchisement in May 2019 as called for by the campaign group New Europeans and a cross-party group of MPs.",
        "background": "Up to 2m EU citizens may have been unable to exercise their right to vote in European parliamentary elections in the UK. Many Britons abroad did not receive their postal ballots in time. An inquiry is needed to identify why this happened, who is responsible and to ensure this never happens again.",
