        "action": "Give all UK nationals living in the EU the right to vote in a second referendum",
        "additional_details": "Many British citizens living in the EU were denied the right to vote in the EU referendum. These people have just as much at stake if not more than their fellow citizens living in the UK. It is wrong that such a fundamental change which for some may require giving up their British citizenship has taken place without them having a right to indicate their views. Any fair minded individual would accept that they should have the right to vote in any future referendum.",
        "background": "More than a million UK citizens live in the EU, the impact on their lives is immense. Many are now having to seek citizenship in their host countries some of which do not operate dual citizenship and face uncertainty around healthcare systems and pensions. They should  have the right of a vote.",
