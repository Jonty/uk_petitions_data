        "additional_details": "For years newpapers and other written press have been driven by large impact stories to drive sales. We have lots of examples of corrections that have end up at the back of publications after stories have causes large scale damage to the person or persons involved in the inaccurate story. \r\n\r\nA law causing the same placement and column inches as the original story as well as a photo and name of the journalist who wrote the story wold create accountability for poor and often damaging journalism.",
        "background": "A new law that means any news corrections have to be reported in the same place and given the same size coverage as the original story. \r\n\r\nFor example, a story covering the front page, page 2 & 3 of a newspaper should then be covered in all three pages rather than at the back end of the newspaper",
