        "additional_details": "We demand his resignation and if that fails, we demand Theresa May to fire him as a Minister for Children and Families. \r\n\r\nIt is unacceptable that a Minister just stayed quiet at such a event. \r\n\r\nIt is beyond us, that he failed to question the logic behind such a 'men only' event. You can raise money for charity INCLUDING women and exclusion of women from such events is unacceptable.",
        "background": "Nadhim Zahawi attended the Presidents Club event in his capacity as Minister and front bench Conservative MP. \r\n\r\nAn event where women were sexually abused and threatened to be fired if they spoke out. \r\n\r\nHe has failed to hold the high expectations we expect from a Minister.",
