        "additional_details": "Tony has visited the site on an almost daily basis and along with BBC Breakfasts, Dan Walker, helped arrange a fly past on the 75th Aniversary. I propose Tony be recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours for his dedication and his shining example of the best in humanity. Thank you Tony and Thank you to the crew of Mi Amigo and all who fought and gave their lives for our freedom today.",
        "background": "Tony Foulds has spent the last 75yrs keeping the memory of the Mi Amigo alive. The B-17 crashed at Enfield Park, Sheffield on 22nd Feb 1944, killing all 10 crewmen. Tony, 8 at the time, was in the park with friends and feels the crew sacrificed them selves to avoid killing the children.",
