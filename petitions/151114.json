The 'Leave' campaign included many contradictory aims, being composed of factions across the political spectrum. As a result, there is no clear plan for the future of the UK.\r\n\r\nBy holding a general election, the alternative views for the way forward can be tested and validated by the UK electorate. The resulting government would have a clear mandate to implement their plan as part of the negotiations with the EU.",

A new government would be mandated with a coherent plan for the UK's exit from the EU.",
