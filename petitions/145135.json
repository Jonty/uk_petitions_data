        "additional_details": "The preoccupation with Article 50 of the European Treaty is a red herring. We should seize the initiative and start the process of getting our country back now, not wait months for an interminable Conservative Party leadership contest, followed by several years while we await permission from Brussels to leave. The Government has the authority of the people to act and it should do so NOW, not sit on its hands.",
        "background": "An Independent Peer has welcomed the result of the BREXIT referendum and calls for Government to repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and ALL its ammendments, rather than go \u201ccap in hand to Brussels for permission to leave the EU.\u201d Forget Article 50. Get us out NOW!\r\n",
