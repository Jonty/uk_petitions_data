        "additional_details": "Recently  BT billed me this charge when it was BT's internal wiring causing the fault. They say you inherit the wiring when you buy a property,which conveniently lets them off the hook. The wiring in my property is 20-45 years old so I think this is ridiculous to charge me.\r\nMy initial call to BT led me to being asked to open the connecting socket so that I could send a test pulse .This I could not do as there was no test button in the socket as it was so old.The operator had no  alternative but to send out the engineer. The engineer replaced some wiring in the house,the old connecting socket with one with a test button and replaced the old BT wiring junction connector. all BT equipment. \r\n",
