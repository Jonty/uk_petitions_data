        "additional_details": "Often people are put off donating because of Gift Aid complexities, Gift Aid fails or people get overburdened by different Gift Aid cards etc. Charities waste money dealing with complex Gift Aid processes.\r\n\r\nIdeally, there would be a single, simple mechanism to provide Gift Aid. This could be a single card type mechanism provided by Charities (recognised by Government and Charities). Alternatively, a unique identifier (eg a \u2018Gift Aid\u2019 number or possibly the NI number) would be sufficient.",
        "background": "The mechanism to provide Gift Aid to a charity is too complex, takes too much effort and fails too often.  It is almost like the Government does not want to provide Gift Aid. Everyone would benefit is this were simpler, and more successful with a single, easy, standard mechanism.",
