        "additional_details": "As most Britons are aware we are a union of great nations however England doesn't appear to have the opportunity to celebrate it's \"Englishness\" unlike the Scottish, Welsh or N. Irish for we do not have any major holiday to actually celebrate unlike the other countries that make up the union so I believe England should be granted a day off to celebrate and recollect with our English roots just like Scots do with theirs on St Andrews Day. It is unfair that we cannot celebrate our own identity.",
        "background": "I wish to start the petition to help gain support for St George's Day becoming a national holiday, a day to celebrate and reconnect with our roots and to celebrate the life of England's patron saint. ",
