        "additional_details": "The Brexit referendum result has split the UK irreconcilably and damaged it's reputation internationally. Over 16 million people do not want this. It has left people, businesses & financial markets living with great uncertainty. It is tearing the UK apart with no sign of reconciliation.\r\n\r\nThe only way forward is to partition the UK into EU and non-EU areas. This reflects the reality for many people who have dual nationality & the likely outcome of Scottish independence. ",

It is particularly fair to the many citizens who wish to remain in the EU but who are not eligible for either dual nationality or a likely separate independence referendum.",
