        "additional_details": "I am a constant traveller and  over time I have seen train and bus prices go up. From my personal experience I know I can fly in the EU for \u00a330 return(aprox) , where as my 45 minute train ride to the airport costs \u00a356 and \u00a357.30 return. The quality of these trains also is abysmal and I believe it is unjust to pay such a premium price.\r\nThis students story is also rather compelling http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/deals/deals-hunter/2016/01/26/flew-home-via-berlin-cheaper-than-train/.",
        "background": "The government should repurchase much of the public transport in the UK.The current cost of travel in the UK is extremely high, so much so that it is usually cheaper to drive and even fly. Standardising public transport will make it cheaper to travel and create greater revenue for the UK.",
