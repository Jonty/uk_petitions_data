        "action": "Make it easier to remove bullies from schools, at any age and fine the parents",
        "additional_details": "Parents whose children are victims of bullying are forced to remove their children from education for their safety, either to be home schooled or a change of school. Both of which can be extremely difficult for most. Why should victims have to change their friends, schools, routines and sometimes homes all because of bullies? It's time the bullies and their parents families faced the consequences of their childrens behaviour- not the other way round.\r\n",
        "background": "As a parent, i find it outrageous that there is so much 'red tape' surrounding schools and exclusions. A child has to be excluded for a total of 45 DAYS before a permanent exclusion is warranted. Most of these exclusions are related to VERY SERIOUS incidents, but why wait for so many to take place?",
