        "action": "Invite the US President to address both Houses of Parliament on his state visit",
        "additional_details": "The speaker of the House of Commons has declared that it would be inappropriate to invite President Trump. In doing  this, Mr Bercow has politicised the role of speaker which is a regrettable and retrograde step. It is important that the British people and their elected representatives hear what the leader of one of the most powerful nations in the world has to say and in the interests of free speech, Mr Trump needs to be invited, in the true spirit of the Voltairean principle. ",
        "background": "Heads of state have traditionally been invited to address Parliament on their state visits; starting with Harry Truman in 1947, six US presidents have so far addressed Parliament: Ronald Reagan and Dwight Eisenhower were invited twice. It is appropriate that President Trump is invited at this time. ",
