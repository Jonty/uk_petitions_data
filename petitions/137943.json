        "additional_details": "Whereas:\r\n- The referendum of 23 June 2016 was advisory and NOT legally binding\r\n- Mounting evidence suggests that any attempt to implement the result of said referendum would represent a wilful act of national self-harm\r\n- 2 of the 4 countries in the UK voted against leaving the EU and must not be forced to do so against their will\r\n- There is compelling reason to believe that leaving the EU will constitute an act of unjustifiable harm to the global community and UK residents and citizens",
