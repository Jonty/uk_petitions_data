        "action": "Legally require drinks manufacturers to use barley and wheat six pack rings.",
        "additional_details": "Arguments suggesting that enforcing a regulation such as this would be too expensive for drinks manufacturers are simply not true, if a small business can begin using such a product, then it should be no problem for multinational corporations to follow suit. This legislation would promote domestic wheat and barley agriculture, in addition to drastically cutting pollution and saving the lives of millions of aquatic animals each year who fall prey to harmful plastics. http://tinyurl.com/zbpo8nm",
        "background": "Saltwater Brewery, a small brewery operating out of Florida, recently invented 100% biodegradable six pack rings, made from wheat and barley which is safe for marine life to eat. Requiring drinks manufacturers to use these rather than plastic rings would reduce pollution and protect marine life.",
