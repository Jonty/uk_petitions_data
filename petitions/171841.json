        "action": "Remove all American military bases from UK soil.",
        "additional_details": "The United States has thousands of acres of UK soil for their own military use which is of very little advantage to us, they provide minimal economic benefits or defence as they are self sufficient and more likely to attract enemies to our shores.\r\n These bases are generally in prime locations and could be used in countless ways to boost our economy, housing, farming or simply given back to nature to enhance our countryside. American military bases are of no use to the UK, take our country back.\r\n",
        "background": "A relic of the second world war, the UK is littered with underused American military bases, thousands of acres of beautiful UK countryside is being left to waste with no advantage to the UK at all, it's just waste land, not even wildlife is welcome.",
