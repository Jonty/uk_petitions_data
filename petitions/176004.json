        "additional_details": "There have been previous attempts to pass such laws but they have been generally tied in with the introduction of proposed insurance and road tax for cyclists.  Most cyclists, however, also own cars and so the concept of paying for road tax and insurance twice is an incredibly controversial one.  In order to keep this proposal straightforward, I am suggesting simply that cycle registration becomes compulsory in the same way car registration is, as a means of identification.  \r\n",
