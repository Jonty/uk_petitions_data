        "additional_details": "I believe the United Kingdom should create its own Bank Holiday to honour Veterans, and 11 November should be the day.  \r\n\r\nIf creating another Bank Holiday is too costly, then take the early Spring Holiday in May and create Veterans day on 11 November. If it needs to be on a Monday or Friday, then the Friday proceeding or Monday following Remembrance Sunday could be options for the Bank Holiday.",
        "background": "The United Kingdom should have it's own, Veterans Day.  \r\n\r\nIn 1938, the United States of America made 11 November an Official public holiday called Armistice Day, and after WWII, in 1954, changing the name to Veterans Day to honour all Veterans. Canada calls theirs Remembrance Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
