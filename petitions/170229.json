        "additional_details": "Whilst restaurants, cafes and other public bodies and places have to make reasonable adjustments for people with disability, there is no requirement for them to do likewise for a medically diagnosed condition, such as diabetes and coeliac disease.\r\n\r\nHospitals often fail to provide any gluten free menu options for coeliacs and despite NICE guidelines, the NHS trusts are withdrawing prescriptions for gluten free food, the only treatment for coeliacs (yet still prescribe food for other conditions).",
        "background": "As someone suffering from diagnosed coeliac disease, I am appalled that there is no legislation which protects our rights (and those with other medically diagnosed conditions) from discrimination, unless that diagnosis happens to be recognised as a disability in law.",
