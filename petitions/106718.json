        "action": "Re-evaluate the eligibility for Child Care Benefit",
        "additional_details": "Eligibility should be on family income not individual..  Please change the system and also increase the threshold limits. Living in London with 60K having 2 kids and mortgage/rent is not easy\r\nPlease sign the petition to Government looks at it. Together we can make a change happen",
        "background": "Stop chancellor from unfairly targeting single-income and single parent families. A family where both parents earn below the higher rate threshold of \u00a350K and having double tax free allowance will receive child care benefit in full but a family with single income of \u00a360K will not receive any!\r\n",
