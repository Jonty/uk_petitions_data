        "additional_details": "Currently young drivers aged between 17-24 if employed receive between \u00a33.50 to \u00a37.05 if employed by a generous employer. \r\n\r\nIn Bradford City area you can expect to pay \u00a34000 a year for basic insurance to insure a car with a value of less than \u00a3500. \r\n",
        "background": "I started this petition to raise awareness of the struggle young drivers have to legally drive on the roads of Bradford once they pass their driving test. I work as a Driving Instructor within Bradford. It's sad to see driver pass and have to wait a long time to insure their car once they pass. \r\n",
