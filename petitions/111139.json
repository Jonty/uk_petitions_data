        "additional_details": "I have looked into obtaining respite care for my dad so I can take a break. The government doesn't pay for any respite care taken.I asked for advice and was told we have to pay for it.The government should provide grants or funding so we can avail of respite care for the ones we are caring for.If we decide to put our elderly ageing parents into a nursing/care home,won't it cost the government much more?Besides,our parents prefer to stay with their children/families where they will be happier.The carer's allowance is quite small when compared to the hard work we do. It will be a big help if we can arrange for respite care where the one being cared for doesn't have to pay out of pocket.",
