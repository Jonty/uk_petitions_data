        "additional_details": "The Campaign for Proper Mental Healthcare is a website designed to share people's personal experiences with mental health services and treatments on the NHS. People are not getting the treatment they desperately need, leading to further feelings of helplessness and desperation. The system is not conducive to helping people effectively deal with and overcome depression, anxiety, or other mental health problems. A maximum waiting time of a matter of weeks would greatly improve this situation.",
        "background": "This petition forms the basis of the Campaign for Proper Mental Healthcare (https://propermentalhealthcare.com). The NHS is failing people with mental health problems. Waitings lists up to nearly a year and impersonal, generic assessments are not an appropriate treatment. The system needs to change.",
