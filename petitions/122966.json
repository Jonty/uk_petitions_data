Also, there is a method to raise awareness of a company's wrongdoing (called whistleblowing) in the interest of the British public. However, this method only deals with certain issues and the allegations I have raised are not dealt with by this method. I can still raise any other issue as long as it is in the interest of the public. More info http://informationpi.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/information.html",
