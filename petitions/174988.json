        "action": "Make offering Gay Conversion Therapy a criminal offence in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Conversion Therapy is counselling or training which attempts to 'reverse' a person's non-heterosexual identity. This therapy often includes electric shocks, counselors encouraging suicide, and damaging ideology linking LGBT+ identities to sexual abuse from family members in early years.\r\n\r\nIt is scientifically proven that this therapy does not work\r\n",
        "background": "After events around the world such as the Orlando shootings and Trump's election, many members of the LGBT+ community no longer feel safe in the UK. \r\nThis legislation would help these people feel safer and more able to be open about their true identity.\r\n\r\n",
