        "additional_details": "We're petitioning to change this law to the following:\r\nLow stakes poker to be permitted in pubs with stakes kept to: \u00a310 Maximum per player with no maximum pot, in social clubs: \u00a320 maximum per player no maximum pot (modify the gaming permit licence)\r\nstake limits should now be raised as inflation no longer reflects the outdated limits set in the gambling act 2005 & an unrestricted maximum pot size\r\nWe believe that this change to the law would also benefit all UK pubs who are struggling to survive",
        "background": "The gambling act 2005 states: \r\nLow stakes poker is permitted in pubs, with stakes kept to a maximum of \u00a35 per player, with a \u00a3100 max pot per premises per day. \r\nLow stakes poker in social clubs, with the correct permit, allows a maximum of \u00a310 per player \u00a3250 total pot per premises per day",
