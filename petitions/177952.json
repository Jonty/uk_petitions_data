        "action": "Provide Devon Education Authorities with the National Average for Pupil Funding",
        "additional_details": "Just before Christmas the DfE announced the Stage 2 Consultation of this promised national funding formula for schools. We had hoped that this announcement would bring about a readjustment in funding that would benefit Uffculme School given our historic underfunding. We are shocked and dismayed to find out that the result of this for Uffculme is a 2.8% decrease in our funding by 2019-20. This means that our budget will be reduced by \u00a3140,000. \r\n\r\nHelp Devon Schools by signing this petition.",
        "background": "For many years Devon has been one of the lowest-funded education authorities in England. In 2016-17 this resulted in a shortfall of \u00a3290 per pupil when compared to the national average. Other schools are funded at much higher than the national average and who therefore receive considerably more.",
