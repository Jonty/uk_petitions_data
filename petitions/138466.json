        "additional_details": "Scotland may well be having another referendum for their independence due to the changed circumstances between the UK and the EU. Similarly, should EU reformation occur, the circumstances will  have changed. Therefore, the UK should be given the opportunity to have a new referendum on its membership in the EU.\r\n\r\nThis should be carried out prior to the triggering of Article 50 to ensure that our position and influence in the EU is maintained.",
        "background": "Due to fears of other countries exiting the EU, a reformation may take place within the union. If this does occur, then the UK should have another opportunity to decide whether it wishes to remain in a reformed EU or not, prior to the triggering of Article 50.",
