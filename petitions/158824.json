The purpose of this course would be to enfranchise young voters to vote sooner. \r\nHow to do this is for young voters to learn about all the political parties, policies, history and what they stand for and also how each party could effect there life",
        "background": "64 per cent of young people did not vote in the EU referendum due to high levels of political disengagement and changes to the electoral registration system. Turn out in local and general elections has also been low for young voters 18 to 24s.\r\nTo tackle the issue voters need to learn about politics",
