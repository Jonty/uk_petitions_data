If mothers are found to be abusing their children in anyway and the fathers are to be awarded full residency of the child/ren then they should receive some sort of legal aid or cut the cost of the fees. It's wrong that anyone should have to pay thousands of pounds to save or protect a child/ren",

If Cafcass orders a section 7 report and these findings prove the mother has abused her child/ren, cost should be cut for the fathers, to help protect their children. ",
