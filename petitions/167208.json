Both of these pages are full of people who are applying for PIP and ESA, and being turned down due to 'not looking tired enough' (fibromyalgia sufferer), 'being able to be woken up by strangers at their stop on a bus' (narcolepsy sufferer), 'being mobile' when the person has to use an electric wheelchair paid for by themselves due to benefit refusal (fibromyalgia sufferer) \r\n\r\nAusterity is being applied in the wrong places.

PIP is awarded if you qualify at a testing centre, where 'not looking tired enough' will get your application declined. ",
