The Government has a legal obligation to safeguard AONB as set out in section 85 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.\r\nThere is a current application to build on this area of AONB in Blewbury.\r\nI propose that the Government upholds their legal obligation by blocking this application and thus set a precedent to preserve AONB in the UK.",
        "background": "This land forms part of the North Wessex Downs, which is one of only 37 areas of outstanding Natural beauty in the United Kingdom. These areas have been described as the \u201cjewels of the English landscape\u201d and are nationally important and legally protected landscapes.\r\nThis land should be preserved.",

This means that it will assess the planning application against certain criteria and decide if a full inquiry is needed.
