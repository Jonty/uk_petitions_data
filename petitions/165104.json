        "additional_details": "Mum works part time for the last five years after giving birth but, had previously worked full time in the same role for ten years.  \r\nThe company decides to restructure and her role is made redundant.\r\nMum can only claim 15 years service at the part time salary.  \r\nResult, greatly reduced final payment.\r\nThe full time salary should be used to calculate the 10 years working full time hours and part time salary to calculate the remaining 5 years.\r\nResult, fair SRP using company records.",
        "background": "The current SRP is calculated by using your present salary only and this needs to change.  Working people that previously held full time roles within their company cannot use these years at the higher salary rate to calculate their final payment.  \r\nA fair adjustment mechanism needs to be created.\r\n",
