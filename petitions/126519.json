        "additional_details": "If teachers undergo training to help recognise signs of underlying mental illness' such as ADHD, autism, dyslexia, depression, anxiety and many more then this could well help to provide the correct support for a struggling child. Due to the traits of most mental illnesses this causes behaviour which is seen as \"abnormal\" and leads to labelling and bad stigma instead of leading to the support in which these young people need. Start supporting and stop labelling.",
        "background": "As a 16 year old who suffers with ADHD, dyslexia and depression I feel that training for teachers to recognise signs of underlying mental illness' is vital. My first 2 schools let me down due to lack of understanding and I weren't given a diagnosis or support until I was in year 11 sitting my exams.",
