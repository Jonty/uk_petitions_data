        "action": "Stop the planned closure of VOSA Goods Vehicle Testing Stations nationwide",
        "additional_details": "At present owners of vehicles above 3.5 ton pay \u00a3112 for an MOT at a DVSA test station. If closures continue and people are forced to ATF sites, then the price of MOT's on the same vehicles can be as much as \u00a3173. With the reduced amount of tests available at test stations, more and more people are failing to MOT their vehicles and as a result they are stopping trading. This will in no way positively affect the country.",
        "background": "The DVSA are reducing the amount of HGV/PSV MOT tests at test stations in favour of ATF sites. This is putting the cost of MOT's up hugely and reducing availability to small garages and operators. If this continues it will force the closure of small businesses and operators.",
