It is not the place of unsuccessful \u201cremainers\u201d to now focus on undermining the prospects of the U.K. and U.S. relationship. The likes of Tim Farron, Nick Clegg, Jeremy Corbyn, Diane Abbott, and the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg risk the potential economic benefits of a bi-lateral trade agreement for the sake of their own selfish, myopic, beliefs. These people are all paid by the public but have no regard for the public. \r\n",

President Trump\u2019s Executive orders are the business of the U.S. Government and any issues should be discussed between them and the U.K. Government.\r\n",
