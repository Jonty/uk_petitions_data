        "background": "A Prime Minister not elected by the British public will be in charge of the post-EU referendum negotiations. This is highly undemocratic.\r\nA new democratically elected PM should decide, on behalf of the British people, what is best for Britain after Brexit or if the Art. 50 should be invoked at all.",
