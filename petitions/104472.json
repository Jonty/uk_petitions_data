        "additional_details": "If latex allergy is on the rise so much the NHS , police and fire services no longer use it why are our schools ??? Protecting our children should be a natural duty of care. The more contact children have with any allergine the more likely they will become allergic to it too. \r\nPlease help our children and follow the NHS and stop using latex in schools\r\nI have had three calls in the last year where my daughter has been in contact with latex in school, the next time she may go into anafalatic shock",
        "background": "As it stands, latex products are no longer used by the NHS, Police forces and fire service all use latex free items due to the increasing amount of people allergic to the product. Schools are not required to be latex free sites. I believe it is time they where. It's protecting our children. ",
