        "action": "Teach the history of British Empire to primary and secondary students accurately",
        "additional_details": "British domination in Africa, the Middle East, the Americas, Asia and Australia entailed land grabs, slavery, torture, mass murder, incarcerations without trial, racial segregation, kidnapping, genocide, war, exploitation, rape, and ecological devastation. If students can study the Holocaust, they can and must also learn about hundreds of years of imperial and colonial violence. The 2014 curriculum update also omits the immense positive contributions of racialized people to the Western world.",
        "background": "When 59% of Britons feel proud of the British Empire, it is clear that education on Empire is incomplete. Changes need not instill guilt, but an accurate and accountable curriculum will instead motivate and educate students to create a more equal and just world. Full petition: http://wp.me/p8vFwG-4",
