        "additional_details": "The leave campaign achieved a vote of 17 million, a narrow majority of 52% to 48% over the remain vote of 16 million. However the leave vote was a clear minority (37%) of the 46 million eligible and registered to vote and an even smaller minority (26%) of the 65 million UK population. Referendums on matters of critical national importance are usually required to demonstrate support for change from at least a clear majority of the population. This result fell well short. It is not a mandate.",
        "background": "Membership of the EU is a critical to the nation. Only Parliament has the authority to decide and should do so in the public interest. Referendums are advisory and open to abuse. A single vote by a UK minority is not a mandate. Any Brexit should be subject to prior endorsement in a general election.",
