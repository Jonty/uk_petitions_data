Some people may ! ... But what we should have in schools ! What our children would benefit from is learning first aid and sign language ! ... We are more likely to come across someone in need of first aid then having to speak a language ! .. Having that knowledge alone can save a life !! .. Most people panic in situations unaware of what to do ! Knowing basic training can potentially save a life ! Lets get this in schools ! You never know when its needed !",
