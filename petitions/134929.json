        "additional_details": "75% of 18-24 years old voters chose to remain in the EU. This percentage increased as the age of the voter decreased. This means that there is a very high likelihood that 16-17 year old voters would vote in favor of remaining in the EU which given we have a high amount of people in this age group in the UK, would potentially dramatically change the result of this referendum.\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/edengoodall/status/746230210018717696\r\nhttps://twitter.com/dylanjonesevans/status/746232873565315072\r\n",
        "background": "We believe that this referendum has not represented those who it will most affect (16-17 year olds). They would have had a major impact on the result. I believe that reform needs to happen where in future general elections and referendums, 16 and 17 year olds must be able to vote.",
