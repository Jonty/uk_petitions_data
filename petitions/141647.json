        "background": "We respect that half of the voters want to leave the EU. However half of us do not. A 2% difference isn't and shouldn't be decisive enough to make such an important decision. \r\n\r\nAs a compromise, we believe our government should negotiate a opt-in EU citizenship for those of us who wish to remain.
