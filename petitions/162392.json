Therefore a 15 minute site visit done by South tyneside planning officer was not adequate enough to base a refusal on. The original application was altered by the planning officer to include Retail sales, this was done because they saw our clients collar and leads hanging on their pegs. So they assumed it was retail sales without getting facts. ",
