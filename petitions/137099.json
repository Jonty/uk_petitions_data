        "additional_details": "The British public has spoken, any other rule other than the one I wish to be put into play would be useless. A similar petition asking for a 2nd referendum is currently doing well, although it is completely unrealistic has they are petitioning for a rule to be implemented that if the vote is less than 60% and a turnout of lass than 75%, there should be another referendum, which means if another is held and get's 59%, then 3rd one can be held.....  This is unrealistic and the decision should be final!",
