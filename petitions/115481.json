        "action": "Reverse Ofqual/DfE's decision to abolish Critical Thinking at AS/A Level.",
        "additional_details": "Ofqual decided to abolish Critical Thinking despite the fact that critical thinking skills are tested by universities in BMAT, LNAT, and TSA for admission to elite courses. Numbers fell in the subject because universities had prejudicially not been including Critical Thinking in admissions offers, thus leading to a vicious circle of lowering school and student demand. Universities should be obliged to treat the subject equally with others once a new specification is created with their input.",
        "background": "Critical Thinking at AS/A Level will no longer be offered at AS/A Level from September 2017, even though it develops skills crucial for students entering university. Exam boards should be given the chance to develop new specifications, and universities required to include it in admission offers.",
