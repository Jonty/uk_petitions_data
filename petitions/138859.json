        "additional_details": "There are plenty more examples or false information and deceit throughout the campaign.  The only real way to give the British public a fair choice on the EU is to present the Exit deal vs remaining in the EU.\r\n\r\nSuch a big and long lasting decision should not be decided based on lies and deceit.  Our country should also not be considering a prime minister that has been at the forefront of the lies and deceit. Why is it 'OK' to lie to everyone from a position of power/influence and then carry on as if you didn't.",
        "background": "The leave vote is based on lies about lowering immigration. We are unlikely to leave the free movement agreement.  We will just lose our seat at the EU table.\r\n\r\nThe leave vote is based on lies about \u00a3350'000'000 a week becoming available for the NHS. This lie has been publicly retracted.\r\n\r\n",
