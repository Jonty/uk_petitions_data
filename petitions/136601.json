        "additional_details": "Smoking kills around 100,000 per year. Some of the cancers caused by smoking include lung, mouth, larynx, oesophagus and leukaemia to name just a few. Other problems can include heart disease, dementia, pulmonary fibrosis and gum disease. Smoking needs to be stopped right now. And if making it illegal is the only way, so be it. Sign now and create a healthier nation for the sake of a family member you might know who smokes. If smoking is made illegal, it could save the life of someone you know.",
        "background": "Smoking is the biggest cause of premature deaths in the UK. Cigarette smoke contains around 4,000 chemicals, among which are over 50 known carcinogens. It is clear smoking needs to be stopped. By making smoking illegal it provides smokers with an incentive; quit or face charges.",
