        "additional_details": "National service providers should provide customers who buy their utilities or products with free vectors of direct communication.  It is unethical to charge paying customers additional fees to speak to their service providers.\r\nThese, and other barriers to communication, serve to discourage customers from raising complaints and identifying problems. Opportunities for utility providers to monitor and maintain  service quality and delivery is therefore unfairly restricted and limited.",
        "background": "Essential utility and service providers charge customers who need to contact them by phone\r\nIdentifying, reporting and resolving service delivery problems is an integral part of their business and should not constitute an additional source of revenue.\r\ncustomer contact must be free - eg 0800 numbers",
