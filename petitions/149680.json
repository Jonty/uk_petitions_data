        "additional_details": "The recent EU referendum result shows that over 48% of the U.K electorate wish to Remain in the European Union. \r\n\r\nThousands of people who voted for Leave have since gone on record to say they regret their decision, and several major promises of the Leave campaign have been redacted.\r\nThere is no clear leadership or plan in place, the financial markets are predicting a major crisis, and the EU is pressuring the UK to speed up its exit. \r\nBacktracking may be embarrassing but it is safer long-term.",
        "background": "The EU referendum result, and subsequent events, have proved that the UK is too divided for any exit from the EU to be initiated at this present time.\r\nThe result is purely advisory and the U.K Government still has the power to veto it, simply by not triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.",
