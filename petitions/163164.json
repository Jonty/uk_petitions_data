A recent poll rated this as the top issue. \r\nIt sets a precedent for developing on former green belt common land. \r\nAn access road built has concreted over protected land illegally.  \r\nThe environment has been obliterated eliminating bird habitats, altering water courses & an endangered fern put at risk (only place in Yorkshire) and it will be visible from the top of the moor which easily overlooks the walls.\r\n",
        "background": "Baildon Moor is common land owned by Bradford Council who represent us! An oasis for local communities ever since the 1st railway line brought factory workers to spend a day in the fresh air. It would be an act of criminal negligence to allow this house building to occur within its boundaries.",
