        "additional_details": "Built up areas/residential areas: The sound of multiple displays up until 11pm/1am can be deafening as the bangs reverberate off buildings and wake sleeping children/stress out pets.\r\nFireworks have a 120 db sound limit: This is the same as a thunderclap. With multiple fireworks going off simultaneously and sounding like a thunderstorm for up to 5/7 hours straight, this can be extremely frightening for young children, babies and pets, as well as the elderly and any servicemen and women with PTSD.",
        "background": "The law in the UK currently states that you may not set off fireworks between 11pm and 7am, except for Diwali, New Year and Chinese New Year, when it's 1am. Requesting a change from these hours to a reasonable 2 hour time slot will help people with young families and pets during this time. ",
