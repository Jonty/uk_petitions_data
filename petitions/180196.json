By not unambiguously condemning this, she is betraying the values of our country and failing to represent the views of its people.\r\nShe should immediately resign as Prime Minister and there should be a general election so that the public may have it's voice on the UK's future relationship with the Trump administration.",

While others have unambiguously denounced the new US immigration rules, she has shown she regards winning a trade agreement as more important.",
