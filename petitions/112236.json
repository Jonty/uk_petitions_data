        "additional_details": "I receive credit card statements through the post, for credit cards that I have not used for years. I try to cancel them but its always too much hassle or they convince me to keep the card, just in case. I don't even know what credit cards I have, but I do know they have been paid off with a zero balance. If all unused credit cards with zero balance were removed from the system this would decrease credit card fraud due to lesser amount of live credit cards.",
        "background": "With the increase in Credit Card fraud, I have concerns about the amount of currently active credit cards currently being unused. I think that all credit cards that have been cleared of any monies owing and not used within a 12 month period should be disabled by the provider.",
