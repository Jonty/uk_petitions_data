        "additional_details": "The Scottish independence referendum was a close result. 85% of the electorate participated. The stay (or remain) campaign won narrowly, with just under 55% of the vote. Next time the majority will vote to leave the UK and want to rejoin the EU as an independent country. The peace process in Northern Ireland was successful partly due to participation in the EU. Fresh calls for a United Ireland may well lead to a renewal of violence. The British people did not vote for the break up of the U.K.",
        "background": "The majority of voters in England and Wales chose Leave. However, the majority of voters in Scotland and Northern Ireland voted Remain Nicola  Sturgeon has called for a new Scottish Independence referendum and NI MPs have called for a United Ireland. This will inevitably break up the United Kingdom.",
