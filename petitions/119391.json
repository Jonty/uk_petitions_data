        "additional_details": "Those signing this petition seek a change in the law requiring all tickets for music, comedy, theatrical and sporting events to include the price and make it illegal for the sale or resale of tickets at a higher than listed value.\r\n\r\nFines for breaking the law should be significant with persistent offenders of risk of a custodial sentence.",
        "background": "Tickets to popular music, comedy and theatrical performances and sporting events often sell out very quickly, largely to professional touts who resell these tickets at vastly inflated prices.  Profiteering in this way often deprives genuine fans the opportunity to see events at reasonable prices.",
