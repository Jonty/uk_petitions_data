        "action": "Introduce a maximum term limit for the role of UK Prime Minister",
        "additional_details": "The majority of countries in the world have term limits for their Heads of State. This is a widely accepted international norm.\r\n\r\nOften these limits apply to presidents rather than prime ministers. However, since the UK is a monarchy, and the Prime Minister is more powerful than the monarch in policy making, it is appropriate to impose such a limit on UK prime ministers.\r\n\r\nAt a time when the personal power of political leaders is so important, this law is critical to preserving political freedoms.",
        "background": "Many countries limit the time that one individual can hold the highest political office. This prevents one individual from dominating the political agenda for too long and amassing too much power. Thus it helps to guard against authoritarianism and the domination of particular interest groups.",
