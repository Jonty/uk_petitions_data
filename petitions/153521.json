        "action": "Withhold Art.50. Negotiate outline terms of Brexit. Call a referendum on these.",
        "additional_details": "It is unacceptably simplistic to ask the UK population whether or not it wishes to leave the EU without giving them at least an outline idea of what the terms of exit might be. This is an extremely complex and momentous decision which will affect not just us but countless future generations. Many of the pro-Brexit promises are already beginning to unravel and may do so further as exit negotiations proceed. The people deserve a chance to revisit their decision once the exit terms are known.",
        "background": "The UK has no obligation to trigger Article 50 prior to negotiating outline exit terms with the EU. The electorate deserves to have a voice in approving these terms before any EU exit becomes final. Substantial numbers may deeply regret having voted Leave once the exit terms become clearer. ",
