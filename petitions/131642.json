        "action": "Amend Environment Protection Act to allow prompt rubbish removal on private land",
        "additional_details": "Whilst the local authority embarks on the legal process, the problem escalates and more work is then required to keep on top of the rubbish now accruing in the public space.  The heaps of rubbish present health, fire and other safety risks in the meantime.\r\n\r\nLocal authorities should be allowed to issue a warning letter with a short notice period to remove the rubbish. Guidance and assistance should be provided to those landowners affected by persistent fly-tipping through no fault of there own.",
        "background": "Fly-tipping in many areas is getting out of hand. Often, rubbish is dumped in privately-owned alleys, garage areas, etc. Soon, the dumping is extended to adjacent pavements. The legal process for local authoritues to gain access, clear the land and recoup expenses is lengthy and costly.",
