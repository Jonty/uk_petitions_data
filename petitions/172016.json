        "action": "Give teachers the choice to retire at 55 with full retirement benefits.",
        "additional_details": "More teachers would choose to retire early and therefore could be replaced with newly qualified teachers. The benefits would be:\r\n* Mature teachers who wish to retire early could do so without worrying about financial barriers.\r\n* The teaching profession will be more appealing.\r\n* If the teachers were to be replaced by newly qualified teachers, it would cost less.\r\n* Happier schools with enthusiastic teachers who actually want to be there instead of having teachers who have no choice but to be there just because they can't afford to retire on the small fraction currently offered",
        "background": "Teachers can retire at the age of 55 but with reduced retirement benefits. The government should give teachers the choice to retire at the age of 55 with full retirement benefits (worked out by the number of years an individual has paid into their pension).",
