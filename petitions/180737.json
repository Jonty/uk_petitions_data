        "additional_details": "Other things he should be held to account for there is to be a state visit include: climate-change denying (which threatens the world), his misogyny, his refusal to avoid conflicts of interest by winding up his business interests, breaking his promise to publish his tax returns. His persistent lies are a stain on the USA's honour. If the UK is going to allow him to have a state visit, he should at the very least agree to be probed on these matters in a no-holds-barred tv interview with Paxman.",
        "background": "Donald Trump is undermining American decency. In particular, banning travel to the US for people from selected countries (including refugees in genuine need) and building a wall to exclude Mexicans are very worrying moves. If he is going to come to the UK, Jeremy Paxman should hold him to account.",
