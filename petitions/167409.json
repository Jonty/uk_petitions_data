        "action": "Ban all forms of Cold Calling In All Areas Of The UK",
        "additional_details": "People across the UK regularly receive cold calls through a number of methods... door to door, telephone etc from sales, PPi and many more. It is believed that a lot of people find this to be anti social and crime related to cold calling would appear to be on the rise, especially with the elderly, people with mental health issues and people at risk.\r\n\r\nDoor to door cold calling can be unsettling & telephone cold calling can be a nuisance as opt out services such as TPS don't seem to work.",
        "background": "We the people of the United Kingdom would like to petition the UK Government to place a ban on all forms of cold calling in all areas of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland).",
