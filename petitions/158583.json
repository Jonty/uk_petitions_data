        "additional_details": "Tony  Blair claimed that the invasion of Iraq was justified by the presence of weapons of mass destructions which could be readied within forty minutes. These claims were not merely mistakes in intelligence, they were blatant lies. Tony Blair, under the influence of George W Bush, went to war simply to effect regime change, an act contrary to international law. He has been protected by the British Establishment and he must be investigated and charged if sufficient evidence is found.",
        "background": "The illegal war against Iraq, a sovereign state, led to the deaths of over 400 British Military personnel and an unknown number of Iraqi nationals. The effects of the war have been so far-reaching that the world has become a more dangerous place.",
