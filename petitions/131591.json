        "action": "That Non Stun slaughter be debated in Parliament.",
        "additional_details": "The Food Research Institute state that killing an animal before it is bled out by high voltage electrical stunning does not affect the amount of blood lost from the carcass.  I have spoken to Jewish people on this issue they say they can see no reason why animals cannot be stunned first.\r\nA witness to Shechita slaughter described a knife was drawn 17 times across a bullocks throat. A shock on his face as he tried to move away.",
        "background": "I have researched what the doctrinal basis for Shechita is. We are in the new millennium and Shechita slaughter is no longer the most humane way to kill. When the Holy Prophet was alive, stunning methods used today did not exist.",
