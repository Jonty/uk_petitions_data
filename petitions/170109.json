        "additional_details": "Once a baby is born 9 times out of 10 the placenta along with the cord are usually disposed off within a medical waste bin? Surely hospitals could ask mothers (before having baby) if they would be willing to donate it instead and then pack it and ship it off to see if a match for someone with leukaemia, etc. No-one has to endure surgery (or worse case die) for this to be donated and it could help so many people?",
        "background": "I tried to donate my cord blood but hospital I gave birth in couldn't do this? I contacted a well established charity they turned me down as didn't have anyone within area. Surely cord blood cells are one of the purest forms of goodness there should be more done to collect this?",
