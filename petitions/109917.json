        "additional_details": "Since 2006 there have been 6 deaths, 9 serious injuries and countless near misses caused by dangerous powered gates.  It is estimated that only 30% of publicly accessible powered gates are safe for users and passers-by.  The aim of our petition is to focus owners\u2019 attention on the need for powered gates, which are pieces of potentially dangerous machinery usually placed near public areas, to be safe.\r\n\r\nhttp://gatesafetyweek.org.uk/information-about-our-petition-make-it-a-legal-requirement-for-all-powered-gates-near-public-areas-to-be-safe/\r\n",
        "background": "Existing health & safety laws do not extend to domestic owners, despite their gates frequently being on or near the public highway.  This means that such gates are frequently not maintained in a safe condition, creating danger to users & passers-by, especially children.",
