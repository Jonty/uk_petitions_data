        "additional_details": "Obviously not all tax revenue comes from people's income. There would still be a proportion coming from Corporation, Value Added and other tax raising streams. However these proportions could be protected so the percentage of burden on the population's income always remains the same.  ",
        "background": "It's time UK govt & people had a grown-up relationship with NHS and social care funding. Replace NI contributions with a stand alone tax to fund NHS & social care. The people would then see the true costs and politicians could say how much or how little they were willing to raise in their manifesto ",
