        "additional_details": "Flash Glucose Monitoring is a more affordable version of Continuous Glucose Monitoring. After around a month of use it is plain to me that the improvement in blood sugar management and care that is possible with these devices mean that the NHS should be funding them for all type 1 diabetics both to achieve savings through reduced complications and also out of duty to provide a high quality of life and care.",
        "background": "As a type 1 diabetic for 20 years, I am well informed on my condition. I have recently started self-funding and using a technology known as Flash Glucose Monitoring. I believe it can save the NHS money & improve care and quality of life for patients. Unfortunately the NHS doesn't currently fund it.",
