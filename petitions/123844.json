        "additional_details": "Many animals are bought and sold from pet shops without correct and accurate knowledge and information regarding many care areas such as diet, housing, environment, companionship etc.\r\n\r\nFor example: herd animals sold singularly to live alone, with inadequate accommodation, incorrectly sexed, of ill health.\r\n\r\nThings have to change.",
        "background": "It's currently too easy for the general public to impulse buy pets many of which end up being sold, rehomed, surrendered to rescues (or sometimes worse.)\r\n\r\nAll too often profit comes before welfare with many pet shops.\r\n\r\nPet shops keep breeders in business, leaving rescues to pick up the pieces.",
