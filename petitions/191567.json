        "additional_details": "\r\nMost cases of cystic fibrosis in the UK are now identified through screening tests carried out soon after birth. It's estimated that 1 in every 2,500 babies born in the UK has cystic fibrosis.\r\nA number of treatments are available to help reduce the problems caused by the condition, but unfortunately average life expectancy is reduced for people who have it. Extra stress also doesn't help.",
        "background": "Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition in which the lungs and digestive system can become clogged with thick, sticky mucus.\r\nIt can cause problems with breathing and digestion from a young age. Over many years, the lungs become increasingly damaged and may eventually stop working properly. ",
