        "action": "Amend voting age to reflect the school year",
        "additional_details": "To make an adequate generalisation about the societal and cultural awareness of young people, it would make much more sense to rely on their years of education; limiting voting by age is arbitrary.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the General Election 2015, students in their final year of college were only eligible to vote depending on whether their 18th birthday fell before or after May 7th. We should recognise that a period of a few days is inconsequential.\r\n\r\nColleges could then encourage youth participation.",
        "background": "This petition aims to grant the right to vote to second-year college students; in other words, to 17-year-olds who will pass their 18th birthday within the same school year as the vote.\r\n\r\nWe should recognise that students in the same school year have the same intellectual and cultural maturity.",
