Had I been monitored my incompetent cervix would have been diagnosed and our perfect son may be here today. \r\nI am petitioning for every pregnant woman who has undergone any type of treatment compromising their cervix to be monitored during their pregnancy to prevent baby losses like ours occurring in the future. ",
