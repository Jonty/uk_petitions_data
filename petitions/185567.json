        "additional_details": "It is well-documented that providing safe, non-judgemental access to health and family planning advice leads to an overall decrease in sexual-health related problems. Aggressive campaigning denies that access. \r\n\r\nVictims of abuse or rape, those who are unsure how to cope with pregnancy, contraceptives or sexual health issues might go away in fear then fail to seek help at all -  disastrous for the victims, and likely to create long-lasting problems for their families and social care services.",
        "background": "Blown-up, graphic images of abortion, and threats to film people attending BPAS surgeries are likely to scare vulnerable people away from the one place they could get state-sanctioned, impartial advice and assistance.\r\n\r\nPeople have a right to express their views but not in a way that harms others.",
