        "action": "Remove the plutonium stockpile at Sellafield by using the PRISM fast reactor",
        "additional_details": "The PRISM is a type of nuclear plant called a fast reactor. It is different to other nuclear reactors in operation today in that it uses fast neutrons. The fast neutrons allow the reactor to consume nuclear waste (including plutonium) as fuel.\r\n\r\nPRISM could be built at Sellafield to consume the stockpile of plutonium located there. The reactor would consume plutonium whilst producing low carbon power. \r\n\r\nThis would also create high-tech jobs and improve the UK technical capability",
        "background": "There is over 100 tonnes of plutonium in storage at Sellafield. It costs the taxpayer \u00a380 million a year to store. The stockpile is a potential danger to the public.\r\n\r\nA new nuclear reactor called PRISM could consume the plutonium as fuel, providing clean energy whilst eliminating nuclear waste.",
