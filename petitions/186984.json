        "action": "Criminalise the sale of a reduced size product sold without prominent labelling",
        "additional_details": "There are countless instances where 'standard' sized products have shrunk without notice or publicity. Many household brands are guilty of the practice and many retailers aware that what they are 'newly' offering, frequently as 'an offer' is no more than a smaller item frequently in a similar sized outer package as before. To criminalise the retailer for selling such products without adequate warning notices on packaging and shelving for a period of 3 months would stop such deception immediately",
        "background": "Increasingly products are sold in smaller sizes, frequently with identical sized outer packaging or EANs. This is deliberately designed to mislead the consumer. By making it a criminal offence to sell a 'reduced' size item without prominent packaging and shelf info for 3 months this will stop.",
