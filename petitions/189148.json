        "additional_details": "Why \"Thermal Insulation Engineer?\" or \"TIE\"\r\nTIE's specialise in reducing thermal conductivity, preventing heat loss or heat gain in process pipe work, vessels, boilers often in complex configurations and difficult and dangerous locations.\r\n\r\nWith no consultation to work force or the unions, the UK government is removing our title 'Engineer' and replacing it with 'operative.' Please reconsider this matter\r\n\r\nThis has been our trade title for almost 50 years and we want it to remain exactly the same. ",
        "background": "In the late 1960's, the men of the insulation industry, then known as 'Pipe and Boiler Coverers' or 'Laggers', went on a 16 week strike. The purpose of the strike was simple, those men wanted 'craft status.' \r\n\r\nThey achieved that and the new job title would be known as Thermal Insulation Engineer.",
