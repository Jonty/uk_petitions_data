        "additional_details": "For all those out there who voted leave on the 23rd of June, sign this petition to make sure the referendum isn't over thrown. The decision has been made and therefore it should stick. Things will only get better we just need to hang on and have a bit of hope. Listening to the media and these MPs trying to scare us all isnt the right way forward. The pound will only get stronger and we will only prosper and grow as a country. ",
        "background": "Over 17 million people voted to leave the UK on the 23rd of June 2016. If it had of been the remain side who had won that day then we most likely would not have a petition signed or be talking about having another referendum. We have voted to leave the EU and this is a decision that should stay put.",
