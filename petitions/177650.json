        "additional_details": "Addison's occurs when the body can't produce enough steroid hormone. When illness/injury occurs in someone who is healthy they produce 10x the normal amount of cortisol. Someone with Addison's can't do this so an immediate dose of cortsol injection is necessary to avoid adrenal crisis. An adrenal crisis is a life threatening, medical emergency. \r\nSo I ask that\u00a0ALL medical professionals know what Addison's is and are trained how to treat someone presenting with suspected adrenal crisis. ",
        "background": "I have Addison's and wear a medical alert bracelet. There has been several occasions where I have become very ill because of a delay in my treatment because staff did not have sufficient knowledge of Addison's and would not take my medical alert bracelet as confirmation of my illness/treatment.",
