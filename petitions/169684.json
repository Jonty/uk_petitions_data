        "action": "To change the law on minimum wage rates to equal pay for all regardless of age.",
        "additional_details": "This would entail raising the currently extortionate low wages for those under 21 years of age to the same levels as those over, or to that of the living wage. By no means does this petition propose a wage deduction for the older classes.",
        "background": "For many jobs in the UK, how much one is offered for employment is dependant on their age. This is an unfair and unjust system. With quickly changing socio-economic norms and people becoming independent ever younger, it's time we level the pay rate for all ages and build a stronger economy for all!",
