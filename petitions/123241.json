        "additional_details": "There are 650 seats in the House of Commons and 816 in the House of Lords. An MP is paid \u00a375,000 per year before tax, and a Lord is paid a daily allowance of \u00a3300 tax-free. By reducing MPs wages by \u00a310,000, and cutting a Lord's daily allowance to \u00a3150, potential savings of \u00a36.5m and \u00a3122,400. Further savings could also be made if the maximum expenses cost were also reduced.",

The law could only be changed by Parliament.\r\n\r\nAllowances paid in the House of Lords are a matter for the House of Lords."
