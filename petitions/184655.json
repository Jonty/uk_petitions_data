        "additional_details": "I have severe Fibromyalgia which sometimes leaves me so exhausted I can spend an entire day asleep. Walking is so painful I sweat so it runs, I can't bear to go out. Just being able to be \"normal\" applies to many who are disabled. Cleaning a room within my home expels so much energy the remainder of the day I need to rest. As a mother keeping up with the tasks of being a suitable parent exhausts me. There is mounting evidence to support the effects of this disease and the limitations it causes. ",
        "background": "Evidence and experience show benefit applications from those with Fibromyalgia, Mental Health or anything that isn't clearly visible to the assessor during ESA/PIP ASSESSMENTS are becoming impossible to demonstrate the long term effects these conditions have on the lives of the individual and family",
