        "action": "Reduce the UK working age to 14/15 to ensure experience for secure futures",
        "additional_details": "This petition is to reduce the UK working age to around 14 or 15 as more and more young people are out looking for work. Surely, if we are expected to pay adult fares on public transport, we should be allowed to earn money in order to pay for it? Young people want the right to vote in elections to help dictate their futures, so why shouldn't we want to work to secure our futures and prove that we are capable? You can't get a job without experience, so please, give us the opportunity to get some.",
        "background": "Many think that 16 is a good age to start working, however I (at 15) am expected to pay for things like bus fares myself. These days busses can cost up to \u00a36 for a SINGLE fare. This amongst other things is the reason young people like me need the chance to get reasonably paid jobs and a fixed wage.",
