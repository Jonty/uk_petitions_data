        "additional_details": "Since me and my friend having one he hasn't used his car in a month which has benefited the Ozone layer, he has never been dangerous on it and neither have I. If they are used correctly and safely they are just the same as a bicycle or skateboard, a fun mode of transport. I think the law should be changed that they are not allowed on roads but are allowed on pavements if are used safely and correctly ",
        "background": "The law on mini segways is 180 years old and outdated. They're  a harmless mode of transport, I understand they are unsafe on roads which I agree with but they should be ok on pavements if they are used safely. They're no more dangerous than mobility scooters or bicycles. Plus they are Eco friendly ",
