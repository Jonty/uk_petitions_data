        "action": "Make domestic violence a crime in its own right with clear sentencing guidelines",
        "additional_details": "Watch BBC's Behind Closed Doors and consider how often the sentence actually fits the crime and achieves justice for victims of DV. See www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual for common assault, actual bodily harm and grievous bodily harm. Unless the assault breaks the skin or bones, highest charge is ABH, max sentence is 5 years, likely 3 or less, out in half the time, minus remand time: likely released from court or very shortly after. Impact on victims and children is lifelong.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The impact of domestic violence on victims and children and the financial and emotional cost to society is huge. Violence is rarely an isolated event but part of a campaign. Again and again, perpetrators walk free from court  or receive nominal sentences: proportionate justice for victims is rare.",
