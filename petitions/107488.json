        "action": "Not tax compulsory overtime that civil servants, crown servants do due to work",
        "additional_details": "When staff are called in at short notice during rest days and have to cancel family engagements this is disruptive and expensive, when staff are off duty and come across incidents they have to deal, when incidents run over a long period staff have to stay back to complete work or wait to hand over. It is only FAIR that a little gratitude for all the sacrifice is shown with this gesture. Thank you for your time",
        "background": "As police, medical staff and other emergency services we have to respond to what ever we see or come across and as a result have to work outside our agreed working hours or during our rest days, this is not by choice and we think it FAIR that we are not taxed on these hours",
