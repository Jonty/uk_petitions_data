        "additional_details": "If this is implemented your contributions into a pension may be taxed BEFORE you contribute thus reducing how much you can save or increasing the tax on your income.\r\nSimilarly the entire pot may be taxed when you take it! \r\nPension pots take years to accrue and changes can be devastating especially to people near retirement.\r\nEven if you have taken your pension this would affect your family and friends.\r\nWe need to tell the chancellor to STOP MESSING WITH PEOPLES PENSIONS.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Currently pension contributions are paid from your income BEFORE it is taxed.  And when you take your pension, you can take 25% of it tax free. \r\nThe chancellor is considering changing this IN THE16th MARCH BUDGET so that the 25% is taxed AND tax is taken BEFORE you contribute into your pension. \r\n",
