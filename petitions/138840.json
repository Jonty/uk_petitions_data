        "action": "Hold a Yes/No Referendum on London's EU membership with Independence from UK.",
        "additional_details": "London is the fifth largest metropolitan economy in the world with a GDP of 700\u20acBN, which would make it the 6th largest economy in EU as an independent nation state, in front of the Netherlands.  Integration into the EU would provide better security for jobs, as companies would need not move from London to stay in the EU.  We would also be able to continue the great progressive and equality agendas we have in London, securing and improving on current rights.  ",
        "background": "We the undersigned call upon HM Government to hold a Referendum in London as to whether/not London should remain a part of the UK, or gain Independence and join the EU as a full member.  With 60% of London wanting to be a part of the EU we ask that we be given a real chance to decide if we stay.",
