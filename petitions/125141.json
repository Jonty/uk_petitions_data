        "additional_details": "In recent light of Iain Duncan Smith's resignation, George Osborne's economic incompetence backed up by his lack of formal economic qualifications, cruel cuts and reverse 'robin hood' actions are not helping the UK economy and proving that we're not 'all in this together' or that he is fit for the job of chancellor. Osborne should follow in IDS's footsteps and resign or be sacked.",
        "background": "We do not support Osborne's cuts, plans to sell off RBS at less than half the amount the public paid for them, his cruelty to members of society who are the most vulnerable and have no faith in his austerity ideals. We demand his resignation or that he be sacked.",
