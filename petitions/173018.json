        "additional_details": "The average daily commute has just increased to 2 hours and the general public is being forced to spend wholly unacceptable amounts of time in cars for what are often small journeys. Forcing drivers off the road through increased taxes or toll roads is not the answer. The answer is obvious but the government won't take the action required to tackle the problem. Road traffic needs to be spread out over the 24 hour period and allow vehicles greater than 7.5 tonnes to only travel between 8pm - 8am",
        "background": "The UK has a problem with its ageing road infrastructure that simply cannot cope with the volume of traffic that uses it on a daily basis. The volume of road traffic needs to be spread out across a 24 hour period, lorries greater than 7.5 tonnes should only be permitted to travel between 8pm and 8am",
