Now we have an opportunity to make the 'Leave' campaigners promise to put the \u00a3350 million saved from the EU into the NHS.\r\n\r\nToday, half the country is rejoicing, half the country is despairing. But the NHS unites us all. We need to hold them to their promise of \u00a3350 million a week for our NHS.\r\n",
