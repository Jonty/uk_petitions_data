        "additional_details": "Firefighters have to buy scrap vehicles from their own budgets at times when front line services are being cut and cars, seized at the roadside by the Police are being crushed into cubes when they could be used in training. Purchased vehicles are used VERY sparingly in order to extend training as they cannot afford to buy them when seized cars are being cubed daily. These skills that require practice save lives - please sign this petition as it could be your life saved by your signature one day!",
        "background": "FIREFIGHTERS have to purchase scrap vehicles in order to train in essential skills such as roof & door removal, car fires & people extraction so that WE can be saved in emergency situations. WHY are we crushing vehicles seized at the roadside when we could GIVE these to the FIRE FIGHTERS!? Help NOW!",
