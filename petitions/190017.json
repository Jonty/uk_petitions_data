The exact map can be seen on the velobirmingham.com website.\r\n\r\nResidents were not consulted and many people will be trapped in thier houses in rural areas just to get a paper to allow 15000 cyclists a day out. \r\n\r\nMany businesses will be forced to close, such as pubs, golf courses & petrol stations as no-one will be able to get to them, yet no compensation is being considered.\r\n\r\nTown Councils were led to believe this would be a relatively small affair, with staggered road closures and/or cyclists protected by rolling road block. At no time were mass road closures discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The residents of rural Worcestershire & Herefordshire have been advised that roads within our area are to be closed from approxiamately 06.00 - 15.00 (Exact time depends where you are) to allow a mass cycle ride. \r\n\r\nWe contest this action is unacceptable and illegal.",
