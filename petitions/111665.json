        "additional_details": "Currently the UK has NO standard protocol set in place to treat this type of tumour nor is there a cure. So why should anymore children suffer this awful monster alone? Why is this tumour silently taking away our precious children?  \r\n\r\nResearch Centres & Hospitals need to be doing a lot more to help find this cure! Our little girl suffered extreme pain, late diagnosis & poor care & treatment from our local Hospital. They continue to deny they failed Rhiley! ",
        "background": "We lost our beautiful, funny, little girl to an AT/RT tumour on 23rd April 2015. She was just 3 years old. Rhiley Kim Bennett was diagnosed with this type of tumour on 12th June 2014. It is so aggressive it took her away from us in less than a year. The symptoms are devastating! ",
