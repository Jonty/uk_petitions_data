        "additional_details": "A significant amount of voters were unaware of the consequences of their Brexit vote. It would appear that the government (500 MPs) had not fully assessed the consequences of the vote either, as there are no active plans in place covering all aspects of policy. The government should reassess the viability of the Referendum, as it cannot fully represent the true views of its citizens, regardless of how they voted. To continue with results from a poorly set Referendum is not good governance",
        "background": "Voters are unable to make informed decisions if questions are set at too high a level. Questions must be broken down to levels in which risks and opportunities can be assessed for results to be deemed democratic. Otherwise, voters are subjected to misinformation and falsehoods, skewing results.",
