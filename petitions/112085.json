Each of these locations offer services such as stay and play groups, antenatal, parenting classes, health drug and alcohol services, family support and advise and help for victims of domestic abuse. If Luton borough council reduce these services this support will no longer be provided at a personal level. And as seen by other councils, to much would be taken on and Luton would fail the community and lives could be at risk.",
