We are proud to have some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world.\r\n \r\nThe Government\u2019s position is that we would prefer animals to be slaughtered as close as practicable to their point of production.  A trade in meat and meat products is preferable to the long distance transport of animals to slaughter. Once the UK has left the European Union (EU), there will be the possibility to consider further measures in this area. \r\n\r\nUntil exit negotiations are concluded, the UK remains a full member of the EU and all the rights and obligations of EU membership remain in force. During this period the Government will continue to negotiate, implement and apply EU legislation.\r\n \r\nWe have made clear in Brussels that we support improvements being made to enforcement across the EU of existing rules on the long distance transport of livestock. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs",
