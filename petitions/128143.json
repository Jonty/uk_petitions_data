        "additional_details": "During WW2 Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre. He devised an electromechanical machine that could find settings for breaking the codes of the German Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic; it has been estimated to have shortened the war in Europe by two to four years.",
        "background": "Alan Turing was a pioneering English computer scientist, mathematician, cryptanalyst and theoretical biologist. He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.",

Your petition does not include where you would like the statue to be placed. The erection of statues would most likely be the responsibility of the local authority where you would like that statue erected. For example, in London, it would be the responsibility of the London Assembly or one of the borough councils. "
