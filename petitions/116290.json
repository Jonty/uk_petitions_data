To be gay or homosexual means to like same sex (in men or women) but to be lesbian only applies to women. Bisexuals like both genders, transsexuals feel that they are born in the wrong gender body, and queer is an umbrella term for anything else that isn't the 'norm'.",

I want to our generation to be taught about LGBTQ+ as standard.",
