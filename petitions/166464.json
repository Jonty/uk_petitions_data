        "additional_details": "Any offence with a 30 month+ sentence stays on record for life regardless of the type of crime/number of offences committed. Yes people need to be punished for breaking the law but if there sentence is served and they commit no further crimes they should be able to move on and build a life. People cannot get jobs because of their record and end up re-offending, homeless and with mental health issues. Changing the law will reduce crime rates, improve peoples well-being. ",
        "background": "If an offence stays on your record for life you're punished for life. The law should be changed so that if no further crimes are committed after 10 years the offence should be removed from there basic record. Enhanced checks for work places with children/vulnerable adults should stay permanently.",
