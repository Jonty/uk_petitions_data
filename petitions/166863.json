This isn't about security anymore, but more about politics. If people are still wanting to travel then that is their choice and I have spoken to many people who want to return to Sharm. ",
        "background": "It's been nearly one year since the flights to  Sharm El Sheikh from England ceased. Many other places that have been affected by the current issues are still accessible, such as Paris, Brussels and Turkey. Many Brits want to go to Sharm but are being made to travel via other routes.
