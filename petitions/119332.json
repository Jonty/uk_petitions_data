        "additional_details": "We the British people, want the threat of imprisonment or punishment against our brave soldiers removed permanently if they should happen to kill an enemy insurgent. That no law suit can be filed against any military personnel fighting for the good of this country.  Either that, or all our troops be brought home immediately to prevent any further chance of legal action.  If Mr Cameron had been the leader in the 2nd World War, I have no doubt that the Nazis would have easily invaded this country.",
