His family moved back to Fiji and are now unable to join him. He has seen his family once for 2 weeks in three years. It is unfair to have free movement within Europe yet serving Soldiers are unable to be accompanied due to archaic Visa regulations ",
        "background": "I highlight the case of a Fijian Soldier who is serving in the British Army who has been separated from his family due to current UK Visa laws. As this soldier does not earn the \u00a327,000 required, his family are forced to remain in Fiji. He is also required to find \u00a36000 just for a Visa application. ",
