        "additional_details": "First Aid is a vital skill to have, and everyone should have the opportunity to learn basic lifesaving skills. However,  I am specifically targeting this petition for parents, as our kids have a habit of getting themselves into all sorts of mischief, and almost everything poses a hazard to our little ones! \r\n\r\nI am calling for basic First Aid info to be provided to parents and carers, be it through at a course, or even leaflets handed out at antenatal appointments. Anything to spread the word.",
        "background": "I am starting this petition after my son choked on a slice of tomato. I went on a First Aid course whilst pregnant, but it cost \u00a345 each for my husband and I. Some Childrens' Centres provide courses, but often, you are not aware of this until you actually become a parent and use the Centres!",
