There is now a very real risk of the UK disintegrating if this vote is simply seen as a mandate to remove the UK from the EU. The Government may accept the the result as advisory, but should now discuss will all devolved assemblies and with the EU as to a means of obtaining a compromise on the views expressed by this divided nation.",

However the results represent the majority view of the English and Welsh but not of voters in Scotland, Northern Ireland and London. It would undemocractic to force this result on the UK as a whole.
