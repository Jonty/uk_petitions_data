        "additional_details": "It is impossible for a woman to live on an average of \u00a3112 weekly from the government, with rent or mortgage, bills, food shopping and a new baby to take care off its questionable as to how she would survive without going back to work almost immediately after giving birth or alternatively having to quit work to receive far better benefits from the government this would certainly put more pressure on the government  but If full pay for 6 was made compulsory it would save on government resources.",
        "background": "It should be compulsory for companies to pay an employee that has been with a company for at least a year their full monthly wage. Too many companies are not offering any benefits to new mothers putting the burden on the government system to pay this amount.",
