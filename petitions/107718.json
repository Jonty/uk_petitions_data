        "additional_details": "The cyst is the nerve and therefore cannot be cut out. When the neurological symptoms become severe and the sacrum is eroding and remodeling, surgery may be the treatment of choice.  \r\nThe surgery is not available under the NHS, either routinely or through specialised commissioning because of a lack of evidence for its effectiveness. \r\nUK citizens have to pay up to 30.000 \u00a3 for a private surgery abroad(Cyprus or USA).\r\nhttp://tarlovcyst.co.uk/\r\nhttp://www.tarlovcystfoundation.org/home0.aspx",
        "background": "Also known as perineurial cyst or sacral nerve root cyst, the Tarlov Cyst is a dilation of the nerve root sheath or outer covering of the nerve. Cerebral spinal fluid gets trapped inside the sheath and forms a cyst. The fluid in the cyst can put pressure on the nerve and cause debilitating symptoms.",
