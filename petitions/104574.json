        "action": "Appoint an independent pay review body for civil and public servants.",
        "additional_details": "Civil and public servants' pay has devalued significantly over the last five years. Additionally, changes to their pensions mean that many are taking home less money now than they did at the start of the coalition Government. An independent pay review body would award a pay increase that is based on the need to pay a fair day's pay for a fair day's work and not on a failed political ideology. \r\nFair pay in the public sector would lead to higher pay in the private sector and a stimulated economy.",
        "background": "MPs were recently awarded a pay increase of 10% together with financial support to help top up their pension pots. Civil and Public servants, also working hard to support the running of the country, have had their pay capped and frozen for 5 years and now capped at 1% for a further 4 years.",
