        "additional_details": "\"Costly and disruptive electrification works\" have already been underway in Bristol and the Severn Tunnel. To delay capitalizing on the progress that has already been made is to ask the region to absorb the economic penalties from those works without view of payback in improved service.\r\n\r\nWe urge the minister Paul Maynard to honour his party's manifesto pledge, reconsider this decision and continue with the works as planned.\r\n\r\nhttps://goo.gl/IpVbRY\r\n\r\nhttps://goo.gl/osNOoe",
        "background": "On 8th November, it has been reported that electrification works on the railways between Cardiff and London via Bristol, among other works, will be arbitrarily and indefinitely delayed from the previous schedule.\r\n\r\nThis is an insult to the people of Bristol, Wales and the South West.",
