        "additional_details": "Anyone travelling from Millom and the south of the borough to West Cumbria face a 100 mile detour when the A595 is closed at Duddon. It is a ridiculous, inconvenient, and unnecessary situation that occurs far too regularly.\r\n\r\nThe inconvenience to residents and business is bad enough but we must also think of anyone unfortunate enough to have a medical emergency during these closures.\r\n\r\nAction must be taken to ensure urgent upgrades that are required to this major arterial A road are completed.",
        "background": "Cumbria has again experienced flooding and this has caused road closures - leaving residents stranded. This demonstrates once again the clear and urgent need for the A595 to be upgraded and ensure that it is fit for purpose. \r\n",
