The 16-17 year old are the people the campaigns targeted as a vote for. \"Vote for your kids...\". Although 0-15 year olds are too young to understand, us 16-17 year olds are not. \r\nI'm sure 99.9% of 16-17 year olds watched the results with a hatred for leave voters and those who claimed that they voted on our behalf. \r\nI feel that this right for to vote is just as important in this modern day as the Suffragette's.",
