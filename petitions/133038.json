        "action": "Provide anonymity for those accused of sexual offences.",
        "additional_details": "The stigma attached to an allegation of a sexual offence is devastating and one that can last for a significant time. The reporting that the accused has been acquitted or case discontinued does little to repair the damage to a personal or professional reputation.\r\n\r\nIt is averred that Parliament have an effective debate on the issue of anonymity in sexual offence cases and afford the accused the same protection as the accuser, subject to the discretion of the Judge in the case.",
        "background": "The media continues to report on sexual offence cases where the accused is acquitted or their case is dismissed but where they have been publicly named. This has lead to serious damage to personal and professional reputations along with public vilification.",
