        "additional_details": "If mortgages are transferred up until 6pm, that means removal company staff will be delivering late into the evening to get finished. This will cause health and safety risks unloading in the dark, breaking the Working Time Directive employment law, and exceeding legal driving hours for HGV drivers, as well as creating stressed customers who are upset their goods are being delivered late, and many more problems. A simple 1 day move will turn into 2 days doubling the costs to customers overnight!",
        "background": "The potential changes to the CHAPS banking system, allowing mortgage transfers to be carried out up until 6pm, will cause absolute mayhem for customers buying and selling property in the UK. And for removal companies who deliver their furniture that late in the day.\r\n\r\nDo not allow this to happen!",
