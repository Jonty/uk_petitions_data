        "additional_details": "The majority of people who decided to leave the EU were the older generation. They decided our future for us. 75% of young people voted to stay and it is only fair that more of us get to voice an opinion. \r\nFurthermore the leave campaign lied in their propaganda and many who voted leave regret that decision. \r\nImmigrants who have lived in this country also deserve a right to vote. The decision will heavily impact them and as they have been in the country for a long time they can make a decision.",
        "background": "We need a second referendum for the decision to leave the EU but this time give 16 year olds the right to vote as it heavily impacts their generation and they deserve a say in their future. Immigrants who have lived in the country for more than 5 years should also have the right to vote.",
