        "additional_details": "The dogs are often not killed humanely. Dogs are often beaten to death as the Chinese like adrenaline soaked meat. \r\n\r\nSince the local government denies any official involvement or endorsement of the festival then this should be something that can be raised quite easily with the Chinese government. \r\n\r\nI accept the Chinese right to eat Dog as we eat Cow, Sheep etc. My objection is that the dogs are frightened an abused before inhumainly killed. Please can you debate I feel that there is little I can do, so looking for my government to help.",
