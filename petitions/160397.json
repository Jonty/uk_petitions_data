        "action": "Remove the NHS from political control. HM Government to set NHS budgets only.",
        "additional_details": "Constant reorganisation by politicians has damaged the NHS: it is divisive and saps energy, focus and productivity; there has been little time for benefits to show. Some change has been driven by political ideology from both sides without much clinical benefit. Governments only look 5 years ahead, until the next election. A quick fix for 5 years is no good. An independent but accountable, properly managed NHS would use research and sound experience to make plans for us all for the long term. ",
        "background": "The NHS should be run by a board of governors who are accountable to Parliament, like the BBC, with sensible targets, acceptable staffing levels and long-term plans. Politicians could then honestly debate the real issue, FUNDING, allowing a clear choice between parties which would interest voters.\r\n",
