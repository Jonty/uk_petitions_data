        "additional_details": "According to the Institute of Advanced Motorists, 57% of cyclists admit to running red lights. A 2013 YouGov poll found that 35% of cyclists admit to ignoring red lights at least \u201coccasionally.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf caught jumping a red light, cyclists can be issued a Fixed Penalty Notice of \u00a330.\r\n\r\nThe Law is unfair. A motorist jumping a light,  will lead to a Fixed Penalty Notice of 3 points and \u00a3100 fine.\r\n\r\nThe same Law should  apply to cyclists who should also carry third party insurance as a minimum.",
        "background": "It seems to becoming more apparent that cyclists in London and more recently Manchester are failing to stop at red lights, risking serious injuries to pedestrians.\r\n\r\nThe problem has also been increased by delivery companies using cyclists to deliver goods and failing to stop at red lights.",
