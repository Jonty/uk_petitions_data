Both Brexit options should be fully explained to the UK electorate, the likely economic, social and longer term outcomes set out by independent agencies.   Younger voters 16+ should also be allowed to participate as the decision once implemented will affect them. ",
        "background": "Following the lack of a Brexit plan, two Brexit scenarios should be put to another Referendum.  The first dealing with returning sovereignty to the UK Parliament, keeping the free movement of people within the UKEU alongside access to the EU economic area.  The second option no access to EU area. ",
