        "additional_details": "We need three things ASAP:\r\n1. The parties (old guard, and maybe new?) should propose their Brexit plan. \r\n2. A General Election should be called soon - ideally Spring 2017.\r\n3. The plan people want most will receive a proper mandate.\r\nWe can make something good happen. We will have to look beyond our party allegiances to do so. Please get stuck in. Share, like, petition, .... or come up with something better than this.",
        "background": "A referendum vote to leave and \"take our freedom back\" is not a plan - its a protest. We need a plan on how we leave and what we do next.\r\nThis plan should have an electoral mandate from us all - Brexiteers and Remainers alike. \r\nThat is the only way to can build a new unity and a strong future.
