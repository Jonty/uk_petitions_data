        "background": "Yesterday, the government reneged on it's previous commitment to reunite and accommodate a large number of unaccompanied asylum seeking children to the UK through Europe. Individuals and agencies  offer a safe home to these children. Decision to backtrack on this demonstrates a lack of compassion.",
