        "additional_details": "A town in Italy made a switch last year to \"silent fireworks\". These are just as pretty, colourful and good fun but they don't cause disturbance to either people or animals. \r\n\r\nhttp://dogtime.com/trending/33475-town-italy-switches-silent-fireworks-reduce-anxiety-animals\r\n\r\nI think it's time that Britain makes the switch and begins using noise reduction fireworks as it's a perfect compromise for those who don't want to celebrate without them. \r\n\r\nPlease sign if you, too, agree!",
        "background": "With so many UK holidays that use fireworks, it might not seem right to celebrate without them to some people. However, fireworks cause great distress to animals, and even to certain children. This is why I am calling on the government to make the all important switch to noise reduced fireworks!",
