        "additional_details": "A recent story is of a women who put her cat fluffy into the washing machine on a boil wash.  It took 10 minutes for it to die.  The terror, pain, betrayal & agonisingly slow death is beyond imagination for that poor kitty who only loved and trusted his owner.  These attacks are getting drastically worse.  Society is becoming immune to the horror and children grow up thinking animal cruelty is acceptable.  We cannot allow this as a civilised society. Give our animals a voice, help protect them.",
        "background": "Everyday we see horrendous acts of cruelty, torture, abuse and killing of our beloved pets, strays & Wildlife by evil people who seem to get little or no punishment. We need HARSH prison terms, lifetime bans on owning & working with animals for any type of animal abuse, lifetime offender register.  ",
