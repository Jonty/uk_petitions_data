        "additional_details": "After the EU Referendum result coming today (24/06/16), showing a \"decisive\" 52-48% result to leave the EU, questions are being raised once more as the real benefits of becoming independent. The value of the pound has hit a 30 year low and an unnecessary uncertainty moving across the nation. Let's protect the financial market for the United Kingdom and Europe by making London a city-state.  ",
        "background": "In light of the EU Referendum, London has spoken, wishing to remain in the EU. To save the financial market, the value of the Pound and the UK economy, it would benefit us to create a self-sufficient city-state for London and neighbouring areas.",
