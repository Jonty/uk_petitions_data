Every minute that passes that we don't have these terrorist situations under control, it costs lives. 129 were killed in Paris with France's 278,000 armed police resource. How many will die with only The Uk having 6,000 armed police. We must increase our numbers. If we don't act now, and increase our armed police numbers in a time of need, how many lives will this cost! ",

They dealt with this extremely well. UK has a force of 6,000 armed police. ISIS will attack the UK,and fatalities will be horrific, we must act now",
