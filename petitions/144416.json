        "action": "Enhance democracy by ending corporate domination of the media",
        "additional_details": "We the undersigned demand an end to the domination of our media by a small number of individuals. The EU referendum demonstrated the dismal state of our democracy. Journalist Anthony Hilton asked Rupert Murdoch why he was so opposed to the European Union. 'That\u2019s easy,' he replied. 'When I go into Downing Street they do what I say; when I go to Brussels they take no notice.' We deserve a more democratic system than this and we should set about creating one immediately.",
        "background": "A plural and diverse media is an essential part of a healthy democracy and yet in the UK three companies control 71% of national newspaper circulation and five companies control 81% of local newspaper titles. We demand a debate on how to end corporate media domination  and how to enhance pluralism.",
