        "action": "Make newspapers print apologies the same size as the original story",
        "additional_details": "The proposal here is make it law, that when a newspaper has to issue an apology or a retraction, it has to have to same visual impact as the original story.\r\n\r\nIf they print a front page headline that later appears to be incorrect, the apology MUST be on the front page, taking up the same amount of space and having the same impact.\r\n\r\nLikewise with online media. If the article goes online at 2pm, the retraction must be published at the same time and distributed via the same social media outlets.",
        "background": "After this summers referendum, no matter how you voted, we can all agree there was far too much false information been circulated by the press.\r\n\r\nWith this change in media regulation, the papers might reconsider publishing an article they are not 100% certain on.\r\n",
