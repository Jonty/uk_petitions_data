        "action": "Create new Special Economic Zone for London, NI & Scotland which remains in EU",
        "additional_details": "We know the EU isn't perfect and needs radical reform but for many in the UK that doesn't mean we should leave it. This petition requests that the creation of a Special Economic Zone is discussed in Parliament. This Zone would remain a member of the EU and contain London, and perhaps other interested contiguous regions.\r\n\r\nThis SEZ would enable these regions to continue trading from within the EU thereby fostering increased trade, investment and job creation.",
        "background": "Although a majority of the UK voted to leave the EU a large majority of those in London, NI and Scotland voted to remain. These areas will suffer the most from the UK leaving the EU. Special Economic Zones have been created in many countries, including China, with much success.",
