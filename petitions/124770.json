        "additional_details": "My son was bullied and his friend assaulted by an older pupil who threw stones at them badly injuring my son's friend. The police were involved as this was considered common assault. The school took no action against the pupil as they said this was a police matter and was contrary to their won policies.\r\nMy daughter is now being bullied, I have reported this to the school but have little faith anything will be done.",
        "background": "My children and other friends children have been subject to bullying. We are also dismayed and frustrated at the lack of action by schools on the issue of bullying and their wish to brush it all under the carpet whilst bullies seem to be able to carry on making other people's lives a misery.",
