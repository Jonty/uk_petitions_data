        "background": "Tax laws should only ever apply going forwards in time. \r\n\r\nNew or Clarified taxes should NEVER apply retrospectively, its illegal even in Russia & Iran. \r\n\r\nWho can plan if new tax bills from 20 years ago 'appear' because HMRC clarified/created new taxes and backdated them 20 years?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
