        "additional_details": "The recent EU referendum has shown that modern day politics has woken up to the ability of the electorate to force change. There is less apathy and more awareness.\r\nPR would allow the electorate to be represented in a fairer more proportionate way, reflecting today's views. We now have 4 main stream parties who should equally have a share of seats in the House of Commons according to the % of votes cast. ",
        "background": "The current system of first past the post is antiquated and needs reform.\r\nIt discriminates against the majority, promotes tactical voting, and the current system has created a culture of too many safe seats. \r\nWe need a system where every vote has a say.",
