        "action": "The Chancellor\u2019s intent to hike BTL stamp duty is wrong. It has to be reversed.",
        "additional_details": "The government has decided to tax private individuals out of the Buy To Let market in favour of commercial organisations and those with more than 15 properties.  This is in effect a 'land grab' that will remove the last route to decent pensions for average people and is effectively a tax on \"Strivers\".  In short the government sees buy-to-let as the cause of the UK housing crisis, a view which is totally flawed and needs to be rethought.",
        "background": "The Chancellor's decision to hike buy-to-let stamp duty on the back of removing relief on interest payments for buy-to-let investors is deeply unfair and represents a savage attack on private investors.  The Chancellor is effectively mugging the savings of thousands of \"Strivers\" across the country.",
