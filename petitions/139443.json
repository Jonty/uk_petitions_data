        "additional_details": "The leave campaign won the vote on 23 June by a very narrow margin. \r\n\r\nThe vote also exposed enormous divisions between people of different ages and in different regions. Younger people, particularly worried about their futures, overwhelmingly voted to remain. \r\n\r\nThere is a lot of concern that those who voted leave did so on a false prospectus, that we could maintain a strong economy and drastically cut immigration. \r\n\r\nSo let's have another think when we know what the leave option really is. ",
        "background": "Leave campaigners have no clear answer on the terms of Brexit. Would we be like Norway, Switzerland or something else? Each has different terms on trade & on free movement, which may disappoint leave voters. We should therefore hold another vote on the precise terms before triggering Article 50.",
