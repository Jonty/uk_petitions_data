        "additional_details": "Police can make arrests for emotional & psychological abuse but most cases never reach court and will be nfa(no further action) due to lack of evidence. Cps should look at all previous calls the victims make against the perpetrator instead of focusing on one sole incident. If past calls/complaints/statements are looked into as well it would make a case stronger and prevent abusers getting away with the abuse and also prevent victims feeling let down by the system or feeling vulnerable",
        "background": "Emotional & psychological abuse cases are being thrown out of court due to lack of evidence as emotional and psychological abuse is harder to prove. But multiple calls will be made about one perpetrator and cps never look at past complaints leaving the victims vulnerable",
