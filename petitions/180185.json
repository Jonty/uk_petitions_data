        "additional_details": "Because of the evidence given above, proving by the same standards, the illegitimacy of the referendum, we call for the Government to withdraw the European Union (Notification of withdrawal) Bill 2017; as to leave the EU is not in the nations interest, it'd simply be a 'populist gesture'.",
        "background": "On the 30th January 2016, a petition calling for President Trump to not have an official UK state visit, signed by over 1.27 million people was dismissed by Downing Street as a 'populist gesture'. As this was the margin that the EU referendum was based on it must also be a 'populist gesture'",
