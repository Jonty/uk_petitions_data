        "additional_details": "SCD patients produce unusually shaped red blood cells that become stuck in blood vessels. Lack of tissue oxygen triggers sudden attacks requiring hospital treatment. The sickling can also cause organ damage, strokes, bone damage and disability. Denying funds for HSCT is an act of false economising that fails to consider the cost of repeated hospitalization. The procedure is safe and it's routinely used in the US. https://www.channel4.com/news/sickle-cell-bone-marrow-transplants-offer-hope",
        "background": "Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is the most common inherited blood disorder in the UK, affecting 15K people, mostly of African/Caribbean descent. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only cure but funding in the UK has been refused. Clinicians are asking the government to reconsider its decision",
