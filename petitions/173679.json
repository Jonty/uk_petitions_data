        "additional_details": "The Care Act 2014 alleges residents fully or partially funded and placed by L.A.'s are protected under the Human Rights Act 1998. CQC guidelines (2/11/16) purport that residents are protected under Article 8 BUT the Housing Act 1988 provides ultimate powers for providers to ban, restrict and evict; some instigate malicious falsehood and staff will support as fearful of reprisals. The above Acts need amending to ensure all public members are protected in care homes, irrespective of fee source.",
        "background": "Your Voice Matters was set up 2010 after I was banned from a care home http://www.yourvoicematters.org.uk/rights2speakup4care. Providers possess the powers of a landlord. They can ban and restrict loved ones (or any professional) and evict residents; Also PRIVATE paying residents have no protection.",
