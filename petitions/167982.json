On ringing Salisbury hospital to enquire why I had not received a date, I was advised that the hospital was in crisis and many procedures had been cancelled. Later that week I discussed with my GP who confirmed that 'ALL' hospitals are now in crisis as the government will not fund the NHS. The crisis has nothing to do with immigration, or industrial action, but lack of funding.",
