        "additional_details": "Currently you can only apply for flexible working arrangements when you have been in employment for 26 weeks. Many job seeking parents cannot work prescribed hours and care for a family, and so they are excluded from the job market. \r\nRigid working hours exclude many parents from contributing to society and contributing to their family income.\r\nEnable employers to offer greater flexibility with working hours for parents from the start. Enable flexible start and finish times, not prescribed hours.",
        "background": "The cost of childcare is not the only barrier influencing parents returning to work (that's another story). Many parents find it incredibly difficult to get a job due to the rigidity of working hours. We shouldn't have to choose between going to work or being a parent. Let's change that!",
