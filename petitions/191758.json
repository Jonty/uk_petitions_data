        "additional_details": "If you take your pet to the vets on a week day you look to pay between \u00a320 and \u00a340 for a consultation. Emergency vets are an out of hours service and therefore should be paid extra, however being asked to pay nearly 9 times the week day amount is disgraceful. These vets proclaim to be animal lovers yet because of these prices animals are being forced to suffer and even die because people with normal paying jobs cannot afford those prices!! It NEEDS be illegal to charge stupid amounts of money!!",
        "background": "Being a big animal lover, i find it really offensive and disgraceful that if you have no choice but to take a sick pet to the vets on a weekend that you have to pay the extortionate prices just for a vet to enter the same room as your pet. It has to stop!!",
