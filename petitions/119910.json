        "action": "Introduce mental health education on the national school curriculum",
        "additional_details": "The Mental Health Foundation has a statistic that says one in ten children are affected by mental health problems. Yet not all of these children may understand what a mental illness is. Lack of education can cause stigma which may not be lost as the children grow up. This means that many people with mental health problems can grow up feeling isolated. We put a lot of devotion in for physical problems, but not enough for mental ones.  PSHE does good work in setting the minimum for education.",
        "background": "The government introduced financial education to the school curriculum as it saw the impact that poor financial education had on society. By these standards mental health education should be added to the curriculum as well. For something that affects so many people, not enough people know about it.",
