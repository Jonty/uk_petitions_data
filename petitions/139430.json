As blogger David Allen Green says \"... The referendum result creates a democratic imperative for the UK to depart but it doesn\u2019t create a legal one\u201d.\r\n\r\nIt is not just the relationship with EU that is at stake, but the actual union of the UK.",
        "background": "British parliament is sovereign and the recent EU referendum is not legally binding.     The vote to Leave was marginal.  This is such an important decision for the UK that it should not be made on a marginal result from a referendum.   If Article 50 of EU Treaties is invoked then it becomes law.",
