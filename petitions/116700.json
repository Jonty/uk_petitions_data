        "action": "Make Network Rail provide free public toilets in train stations.",
        "additional_details": "Providing these facilities should not be a way of generating revenue. I have seen  tourists, mothers with young children, elderly people struggle to find change. From my experience, stations in other countries provide free facilities. We want to encourage people to use public transport so let's make it as easy and pleasant as we can.",
        "background": "Many stations outside of cities provide free toilet facilities. In central London, for example, Mainline stations charge up to 30 pence to use the facilities. The cost of providing these facilities should be included in the price of train tickets. ",
