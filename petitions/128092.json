The work was commissioned by the Speaker\u2019s Advisory Committee on Works of Art, and not Diane Abbott herself. \r\nThe Committee commissioned a number of works of art at the time. You can find out more about the role of the Committee here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/other-committees/works-of-art/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou could start a petition calling on the House of Commons not to spend money on commissioning art.\r\n"
