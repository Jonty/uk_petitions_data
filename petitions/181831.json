        "action": "Make it a criminal act to present wrong information to influence a public vote.",
        "additional_details": "There has in the past year been an upsurge in politicians and individuals presenting fake facts to influence votes of national importance.  These \"fake facts\" and \"fake news\" have been seen as an acceptable tactic by the perpetrators. Our country needs to get this under control and send a signal because its continuation will undermine the democratic process.  Without sanctions these types of lies will undermine our society. The action needs to cover both traditional and social media.",
        "background": "With the recent public vote in the UK it is clear that the argument was heavily influenced by individuals knowingly communicating wrong information.  The act of knowingly presenting unverified facts for influence should be  punished.  The message is that our democracy will not accept such behaviour.",
