        "additional_details": "Why should we live through the consequences of other people's choices? As we will have to put up with them for the longest. Why is this referendum different to Scotland's referendum where people like me did have their vote? As a 17 year old apprentice and learner driver Why am I not responsible enough to vote for my future. I believed my country wouldve protected young people's future. In my opinion I think that if other people like me would've had their vote my future would've been secure.",
        "background": "I am 17 years old and I have woken up this morning to my future being chosen for me. I believe that 16 & 17 year olds should have a vote on the EU referendum. We are the future of Great Britain and should have our say as well as anyone else. Weather that would be adding our votes or a new referendum",
