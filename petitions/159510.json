        "additional_details": "I suffer from asthma personally and have suffered since I was diagnosed at the age of three. As well as my inhalers I take something called montelukast every night, my prescriptions each month can add up, especially when my asthma plays up severely and have to take steroids. I Know you can get pre payment cards which means saving money, but that's not the point. I didn't ask for asthma, but I have it, through no fault of my own. And I have to pay for it, and so do many others. ",
        "background": "Inhalers and medicines are vital especially to those with severe asthma, not taking them due to being unable to afford them, could result in an asthma attack which could lead to death. So why must asthmatics pay for the very medicine that helps them breathe? ",
