        "additional_details": "Steven Crabb was texting this young woman from the cabinet office, conducting his affair on tax payers time.  He has misrepresented himself as an honest and honourable family man.  He has misrepresented himself as a devout Christian with Christian values and used these representations to deceive the public for his own gain and career .  Really he is a dishonest man with no value for his family  and no care for the Christian value of sanctuary of marriage.  He is a hypocrite and should resign",
        "background": "This is a man who has held himself up as a committed Christian and a family man while really he is nothing of the sort.  While using this as his angle when running for PM he was having an affair and lying to his wife, constituents and the public.",
