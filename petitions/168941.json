        "additional_details": "A minute earlier Dylan's rescuer could have saved his life. Currently the UK has nothing in place to prevent these needless deaths. Schools don't educate about the dangers in & around open water & there is no funding in place for prevention. Since Dylan died there has been another 2000 water related deaths. I want Dylan\u2019s death to serve a purpose rather than for him to have died in vain. I want people to live because Dylan died.  We need change and we need it  now! ",
        "background": "One 2011 July day my son Dylan went swimming at a local quarry; 20 minutes in he got into difficulty, unable to swim the short distance to safety. He reportedly died from cold water shock which has 4 stages; probably in the last stage when everything that has fought to stay alive relaxes.",
