There are widely available techniques to secure this data with minimal cost to enable this. Industry standards exist to protect private data and yet they are routinely not adhered to.\r\n\r\nThe Vtech hack is just the latest in a series of data breaches. It's long past time that the government stepped in to force companies to secure our personal information.",
