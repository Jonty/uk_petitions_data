        "action": "Reconsider debating ignored petition on Jeremy Hunt signed by 330k",
        "additional_details": "Jeremy seems to be immune to being held to account by parliament & the public he serves. He has caused a crisis within the NHS -a crisis of trust, of poor morale, and of recruitment & retention. He's gone about his plans for a 7 day NHS in completely the wrong way, alienating a generation of doctors & public. He's lied about mortality rates & imposed a deeply unpopular contract on junior Drs, claiming that David Dalton's letter with CEO 'support' is adequate assurance of the contract's quality ",
        "background": "The petitions committee recently chose not to debate a petition signed by almost 330,000 who have no trust in Jeremy Hunt as Health Secretary. This is not acceptable. The public have spoken. He has lied about mortality and ignored the concerns of the medical profession who wholeheartedly disagree.",
