        "additional_details": "The Mosul Dam was built out of a material requiring continuous grouting in order to retain its structural integrity. In the aftermath of ISIS's capturing of the Dam, the grouting equipment was lost, and they don't have enough manpower to both fight ISIS and protect the dam. The Government should spend a section of its foreign aid/defence budget on providing this equipment, and in some manner freeing up the Peshmerga or the local population to regrout the the dam.\r\n\r\nhttp://bit.ly/1RSTTb1",
        "background": "The Mosul Dam is near collapse, with upcoming flooding threatening to cause the dam to break. If it did break, it's estimated that the ensuing flood could kill over 1,000,000 people, and displace millions more, causing a horrific level of death, and further increasing the scale of the Migrant Crisis",
