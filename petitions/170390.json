        "additional_details": "As campaigns may be biased their protest to lies is inadequate. In commerce lies are justifiably banned. If voters can\u2019t judge what they are voting for democracy is meaningless. Lack of detail for Brexit implications contributed \u2013 & no consent for its form. We must also recall consequences little discussed: nearly half-in-half results; possible UK break-up; many years of negotiation likely; renegotiation of all current world trade deals; less EU trade access; & EU rules for us we have no say in.",
        "background": "Unlike exaggeration & forecasts (where some variability may be inherent) lies are wholly false without factual basis. Among many, 2 prominent were: \u00a3350 million/wk paid to EU \u2013 to go to the NHS; & Turkey on the cusp of EU admission. Genuine & thorough campaign info about the EU & Brexit was scarce.",
