        "action": "Amend The Equality Act 2010 to include lifestyle choices.",
        "additional_details": "Over in the USA, 30 States have made  similar legislations to protect workers personal life. \r\nIf we amend the equality act 2010 to include lifestyle/personal life's of workers, this will include a lot of lifestyle choices, Anything from smoking to being vegan. It's ridiculous that some companies won't employ smokers. Why should a business go out of its way to not employ someone who smokes which is a personal choice, even if the employee agrees to smoke off premises?.",
        "background": "Many companies in the UK are starting to use \"anti-smoking policies\" that they will not hire, and even terminate an employees contract for smoking, even if they smoke off the employers premises. \r\nI feel as if the government should update the equality act 2010 to include lifestyle choices.",
