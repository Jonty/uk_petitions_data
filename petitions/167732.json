        "action": "Acknowledge 'secondary modern' schools are created by grammar schools.",
        "additional_details": "There are currently 163 grammar schools selecting high ability pupils and 400/500 schools with low/medium ability pupil intakes as a result. These 'secondary modern' schools can not perform in the same way as a comprehensive school when the balance of pupils is so different.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to ask the Department for Education to identify these schools and classify them as 'secondary moderns' or similar new name. This will help us research these schools properly before there are more.\r\n",
        "background": "The government want to create new grammar schools but say 'secondary modern' schools will not exist. Schools surrounding grammar schools can not contain a full range of pupils of all abilities, this means they are are not truly 'comprehensive' schools. I want this difference officially acknowledged.",
