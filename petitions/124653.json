        "additional_details": "The Sun newspaper, in particular, has published some dangerously misleading headlines. Most recently, perhaps, they chose 'Madman in cockpit' as a suitable summation of the tragic plane crash involving Andreas Lubitz last year. Others, again from the Sun, include 'psycho cabbie' and 'bonkers Bruno'. This language promotes the idea that people suffering with mental illness are either dangerous or are not deserving of respect. This misreporting endangers mental health patients. This has to change.",
        "background": "Unfortunately, there is still a lot of stigma surrounding mental health issues in this country. This stigma is propagated by the mass media's use of words such as 'lunatic', 'psycho' etc. in their stories. It is not acceptable to publish sexist or racist terms; make it the same for mental health. ",
