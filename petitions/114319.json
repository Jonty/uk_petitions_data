        "additional_details": "MY child suffers from Cystic Fibrosis and can spend 2/3 weeks every 3 months in hospital if admitted which can be a long time without a tv access. Yes they get between the hours of 10 and 4 for free but this is not acceptable. In hospital Children are awake all hours so are the parents so sometimes the only bit of comfort they have is the TV access. We all pay our Tv licence fees so we shouldnt be made to pay extra in hospitals.",
        "background": "Times are hard enough as it is when a child is admitted to hospital. Whether its for a day, a week or even months. The cost of food, parking, travel expenses for the parent is overwhelming without having to pay to watch the television too. ",
