        "additional_details": "If there were to be an accident involving a car and cyclist, the motorist would face consequences due to damage caused. There is an increasing call for drivers to be safer when it comes to cyclists, and the way in which they use the road (eg passing with enough space) but how do we guard against unsafe cyclists on their mobile devices, taking a call and/or sending a message. It is unsafe for a motorist and therefore unsafe for a cyclist. ",
        "background": "It has become evident, that there is an increasing number of cyclists on UK roads, pavements and cycle ways, utilising their mobile phones whilst actively riding. Not only are they putting themselves and pedestrians at risk, but the driver of road vehicles. ",
