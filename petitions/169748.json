        "additional_details": "The MAR charts was not requested at my GP and was missed out.  District nurse request a JUST IN CASE BOX. This GP didn't have a box policy.\r\n\r\nThe Debbiebox is a palliative care box which will have telephone numbers, drugs, MAR chart and DNR form, syringes it will be done by a GP alone.\r\n\r\nCurrently each GP has their own policy it should be standard practice so no miscommunication happens resulting in mistakes and someone dying in pain. \r\nThis would stop compensation claims and is cost effective. ",
        "background": "My mum spent 4 hour dying in pain due to MAR chart missing. Ambulance Crew couldn't give drugs needed. My mum died hospital 1hr pain free. I had to watch her. Just in Case box is NOT standard practice. We want a Debbiebox in place in every GP with MAR, DNS and drugs and comes direct from GP. ",
