        "action": "Make bin collection at a later time of day, preferably during the afternoon.",
        "additional_details": "Firstly, the road I live on is narrow and as a result, the huge bin collection truck blocks the whole road and sometimes, the truck drivers don't pull into spaces to allow other cars to pass, they just block up the whole road which is very annoying.",
        "background": "Every morning I find it a huge problem getting out of my front drive to get to school and my parents equally frustrated to get out to go to work, I propose that bin collection happens during the afternoon as many people won't be trying to get out of their house at that time to go to school or work.",
