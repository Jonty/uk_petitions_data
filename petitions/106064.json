        "additional_details": "The Balisong knife is a beautiful tool and how its used is also an art form but since the Criminal Justice Act of 1988 they were made illegal to import and thus own. There have been claims that the Balisong knife was banned because it was used in crime when in actual fact you are more likely to find someone using a lead pipe in crime rather then a 100-200 pound knife and there was also a claim that it was banned because people hurt themselves with it well that's their fault.
