        "additional_details": "The campains on either side in the build up to the recent EU Referendum have been little more than a source of false information. It is not a surprise, then, that many Leave supporters were unaware of what they were voting for, and the consequences of this result. In light of those corrupt campaigns, the only way we can truly understand the value of the EU is in the aftermath of our leaving it. Leave voters deserve a chance to make a decision based on this valid information.",
        "background": "The result of the EU Referendum is a result of a corrupt and lying campaign, meaning many citizens decided to vote to leave the EU because they were told this would solve problems that it wouldn't. This petition aims to pressure parliament to repeat the referendum, as voters are now better informed.",
