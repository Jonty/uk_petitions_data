        "additional_details": "Nursery settings are charged VAT on most services they use and this is money that is then moving away from direct resources for the children. By claiming back VAT on purchases this would give the settings more cashflow in the accounts to buy or replace resources. Giving children a good start is important and resources and equipment is expensive so a small change in legislation would help save millions across the childcare sector which should go directly to the children's learning.",
        "background": "With Day nursery settings providing an important start to children, it's important that they are able to put money into the quality of care and education as. By being able to register as 0% VAT this would allow them to claim back any VAT they are charged providing more money for education resources.",
