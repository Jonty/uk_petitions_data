        "additional_details": "The UK electorate was also led to believe that continued access to the EU single market would be likely if we voted to leave the EU. Many people believed this but the government has stated it will not be seeking to remain in the single market. There is clear evidence of dissatisfaction with the presentation of information from both sides prior to the referendum and subsequently numerous leave voters have expressed regret that they believed the misinformation upon which they based their decision.",
        "background": "The only slogan on the side of the Leave EU campaign bus stated in large letters that if we left the EU, \u00a3350m per week could go to the NHS. The government has now stated that this will not happen so the reason thousands voted for Brexit and the democratic will of the people has been ignored.",
