        "additional_details": "Whilst this would likely be illegal to do directly we can legislate to make the carriers of uninsured persons responsible for their treatment. As no carrier would want to face a bill of hundreds of thousands of pounds,  it would be likely that they would protect themselves by making health insurance a mandatory term of carriage when buying a ticket and enforce this at the check in desk. This would effectively prevent health tourist before they arrive in the country. ",
        "background": "We cannot refuse to treat someone in the country already as this is inhumane,  likewise recouping the monies post care is problematic. The best way to do this is to prevent those without suitable insurance from entering the UK at all.",
