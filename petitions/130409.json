Or when there is an opinion from big business or the IMF for example it is big news.\r\n\r\nFor example there was a speech by both Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson yet the BBC website mentions both but the main image on the page is of Mr Cameron's speech.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36289037\r\n\r\nThe section \"EU referendum campaign live\" only mentions a comment from the World Bank.",
