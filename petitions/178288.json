        "action": "Abolish the House of Lords if it delays Brexit.",
        "additional_details": "A significant number of Members of the House of Lords have stated they oppose Brexit. Should the House of Lords in any way delay legislation so as to prevent the Government meeting the 31st March 2017 deadline it will have shown it despises the will of the people and the democratic process. Should it do so then the House of Lords must be abolished as it will have demonstrated that it and its unelected members have neither place nor purpose in a modern democracy.",
        "background": "The EU Referendum was held in July 2006 to decide whether the UK should leave the EU or remain a member state. The majority of the people of the United Kingdom voted  to Leave the EU.  An Act of Parliament is required for the Government to meet its pledge to invoke Article 50 by 31st March 2017.",
