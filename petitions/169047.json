According to the article above his lawyer is arguing that 'It is extremely unfair his family is not able to visit him in the United States'.  Victims families will never see their loved ones again either! This man has been sentenced in the USA & therefore should remain incarcerated in the USA! The ECHR appears to benefit criminals rather than the victims, this has to stop!",
