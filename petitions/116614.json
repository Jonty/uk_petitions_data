        "additional_details": "Once again Mr O'Dowd has released jobs for the newly qualified, inexperienced teachers without a thought for those highly qualified professionals who have been seeking work for a number of years.  Where else in the world would it be of an advantage to have little or no experience in teaching and be recommended for a job? A just society would allow for teachers to apply for jobs based on their merits and experience, however this does not matter to Mr O'Dowd.  ",
        "background": "Minister O'Dowd has announced that there will a provision of \u00a333 million to allow teachers aged 55+ to retire in Northern Ireland.  However they can only retire if newly qualified teachers replace them.  This is discriminatory against teachers qualified 3+ years who are seeking permanent posts.",
