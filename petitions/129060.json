        "additional_details": "Currently only those who are deemed 'priority cases' (For example, those with children, pregnant women, minors aged 16 or 17) can be legally given accommodation by local authorities.\r\n\r\nNo wonder then that the homeless people you see are usually single. This has to change!! The law MUST change in order to help ALL homeless people. It must be a priority of this government and local authorities to provide emergency accommodation to ensure homelessness becomes a thing of the past once and for all.",
        "background": "Homelessness has risen significantly in recent years as a result of benefit sanctions, a decline in the supply of council housing, cuts to services providing help and support to the homeless and so on. ",
