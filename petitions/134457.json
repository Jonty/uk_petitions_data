        "additional_details": "There is a youth parliament for people aged 11-18 who are educated on poltics and current affairs. A person aged 90 can vote and not live to see the changes yet a person aged 16+ will. Politics is an a level option to sixth forms which learn about issues leaving the EU faces. ",
        "background": "In the EU referendum, people aged 16 and 17 did not get a say in their future. We are given the same information about the referendum and educated enough to make an informed decision just as a person aged 18 and over is. This is why I would like to start a petition to lower this age for our future. ",
