        "additional_details": "The new House of Heroes will consist of 100 members, who will be known as 'My Honourable Hero'. Of these 100, 33 will be \"Everyday heroes\", 33 from the Armed Forces and Emergency Services, and 33 Heroic National Treasures, plus 1 speaker to moderate.\r\n\r\nHeroes will be nominated by public ballot and will serve 2 year terms.  \r\n\r\nWe owe so much to those few brave men and women who do so much to help so many.",
        "background": "The House of Lords is out of date, bloated, unaccountable and does not reflect modern Britain. It's time we abolished this glorified old people's home and replaced it with a new House of Heroes; an institution consisting of the kind of people who make Britain proud. \r\n\r\n",
