        "additional_details": "Abuse of disabled parking bays is *rife all over the UK. Vehicles, skips, storage, smoking areas, temporary buildings, cancer screening/blood donor vehicles, temporary displays and more appear all too often in these bays, stopping those who NEED them from using them. Emergency Service Vehicles should ALSO have their own separate parking bay(s) to stop abuse of the disabled parking facilities - a disabled person cannot undo their disability. \r\n\r\n*Ref: www.facebook.com/wantmyspacetakemydisability",
        "background": "Many with disabilities struggle just getting in & out of a parked car, disabled bays are essential. It should be illegal for any non blue badge holder to park their car in a space reserved for those with disabilities. Without this 'The Equality Act 2010' is no longer effective.",
