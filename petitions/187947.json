        "action": "Cancel future General Elections as the British people have already voted",
        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister has set an example to us all of how 21st-century British democracy should work. The Prime Minister has made clear, for example, that there must be no second referendum on membership of the EU because the British people have made their choice. If there can be no second referendum on such a profound constitutional change, then any further General Election is also unnecessary. We want the 56th Parliament of the United Kingdom to mean the 56th Parliament of the United Kingdom.",
        "background": "In May 2015 the British people elected the 56th Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Government must demonstrate commitment to  the election's democratic outcome and make a success of it. There must be no attempts to revert to the 55th Parliament, no 57th Parliament and no further General Election.",
