        "additional_details": "Whilst the UK is a beacon of democracy around the world, it is severely lacking when it comes to voter participation.\r\n\r\nThe potential benefits of introducing an online voting method are many and include greater levels of participation; accessibility for those with vision impairments and other disabilities; long-term savings in the cost of elections; and accurate vote counts.\r\n\r\nFor information on the benefits of online voting and how it can be made secure visit webrootsdemocracy.org/reports.",
        "background": "It's time for democracy in the UK to enter the 21st century and for online voting to be introduced.  Research has shown that over 95% of our 19,000+ elected politicians were voted in on turnouts of less than 50%, and many citizens with disabilities are currently locked out of the democratic process.",
