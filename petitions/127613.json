        "additional_details": "It would cost an estimated \u00a332 billion for the first year, and possibly less than \u00a31 billion for each subsequent year. To put this in perspective: total government spending is \u00a3772 billion. After one year, a government handout of pianos would be less than 0.013% of the total expenditure. In other words, damn good value for money. (And imagine a less-stressed, less-alcoholic, less-nicotine addicted populace -- that would probably cut \u00a332 billion from the NHS budget alone.)",
        "background": "Every person, every home -- every family -- is improved by having a piano. Imagine all the family sitting round the piano making music together. And imagine the joy a piano would bring to the lonely, immersing them in a limitlessly beautiful world. It would be an immense social good.",
