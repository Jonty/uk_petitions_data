        "additional_details": "The rabbits suffer this every 3 months some going into shock. After\u00a0several years of pain they are hung upside down and have their throats slit. The people who do this are sick and cruel. So please sign the petition to urge the government to diplomatically put pressure on the Indian and chinese governments to end this horror. If you don't believe me about this then visit petas website  and watch the overwhelming  evidence filmed by them on the cruelty these rabbits suffer.",
        "background": "Rabbits are loving and gentle creatures yet china and india want their fur to export to countries just to satisfy human vanity. However they literally grab the rabbit and rip out its fur until it screams in terror  and agony, this disgusting and inhumane practice MUST STOP NOW! ",
