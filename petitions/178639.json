I feel it unfair that I and others in my situation do not have our salary protected for a certain number of weeks a year and are forced to either go in to work sick, have our salary compromised or take more time that is required off just to claim SSP, which I have only ever done once. \r\nI would like to see employers be made to offer sick pay/salary protection to employees in service for over 2 years",
        "background": "I am a reliable employee who only takes time off when I am genuinely too ill to get to work but will still go in when I'm too unwell to because I do not get sick pay. Yes I'm entitled to SSP but I would have to be off work for more than for days and it doesn't cover my wages. ",
