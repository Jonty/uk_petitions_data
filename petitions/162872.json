        "action": "Legalise cannabis for recreational use by over 16s",
        "additional_details": "If cannabis was commercially available in UK pharmacies & supermarkets, not only would British businesses profit massively, but the VAT attached would make millions of pounds for the UK economy, which could be spent on things such as a better-funded NHS & more modern facilities for our schools. \r\n\r\nCannabis has often been branded as bad for one's health, when in reality, it often soothes anxiety; prevents glaucoma; and doesn't have a harmful effect on your organs like tobacco & alcohol can. ",
        "background": "Cannabis has been a Class B drug in the UK since 2009, meaning that it's illegal to sell, distribute, or use the drug in any way. However, millions of people throughout the UK still take advantage of cannabis for their recreational use, often turning to backstreet dealers who are making thousands. ",
