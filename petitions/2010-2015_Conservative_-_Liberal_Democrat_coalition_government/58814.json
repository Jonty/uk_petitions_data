        "additional_details": "We want the to government to fix the cruel family immigration system that is keeping husbands, wives, children and entire families apart by thousands of miles.\r\n\r\nFamily life should be a right, not a privilege.\r\n\r\nThe current income bar of 18,600 is destroying thousands of families lives and there is evidence to prove this. Figures show almost HALF of sponsors applying to bring family to the UK can not meet this figure. This is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nIf the UK resident sponsor has enough funds to meet the recommended living allowance for themselves and the family being brought into the country, then a direct family member, spouse or child should be able to come and reside with them in the UK.\r\n\r\nIt is both immoral, and unfair that spouses and family members who are fit and willing to work can not come to reside with loved ones in the UK.\r\n\r\nNot to mention all of the young children affected by these laws.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition so we can change this wholly unfair system.",
