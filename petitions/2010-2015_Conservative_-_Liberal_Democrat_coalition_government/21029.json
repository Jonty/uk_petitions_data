        "additional_details": "Currently, only babies born after 24 weeks gestation can have their birth or still birth registered. A baby born stillborn, regardless of the circumstances, before 24 weeks cannot be registered and therefore goes unacknowledged by the country. Obviously, the families of these precious babies will remember them, but families should also be allowed to officially register the birth of their child, regardless of why they came early or how early they arrived. Not being able to can cause huge distress for families. Our children were here, they were alive, they had heartbeats. They were born and they deserve to be recognised in the official records of this country.",
