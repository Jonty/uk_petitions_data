        "additional_details": "We, the signatories of this petition believe it is now time to drastically reform prisons. Membership of Europe and the Human Rights acts have made a mockery of the judicial system. In todays financial climate, prisoners are often living in better conditions, without financial concerns, than those of us who are struggling to make ends meet from day to day on the outside. Prison is a life choice for many criminals who find it easier in prison than on the outside. Make prison a punishment. Take away TV's, take away pool tables, take away computer games and turn prison into a deterrent against crime again.",
