        "additional_details": "As most people who use the Great Eastern or West Anglia Mainline and the suburban branches will know, services on these lines have deteriorated under Abellio Greater Anglia, in fact they are far worse than they were under National Express East Anglia, and believe after the amount of criticism National Express received due to the East Coast issue, that Abellio should be stripped of the Greater Anglia franchise immediately and it be placed under the state control until the Contract comes up for renewal in 2014.\r\n\r\nGreater Anglia provide poor customer service, poor crisis management and poor services, so why should they be allowed to continue the franchise any further",
