This is to recognise the dangerous environment and physical nature of the work. It is unrealistic to expect staff up to 68 years of age to physically restrain and intervene in violent incidents with young, fit and sometimes disturbed prisoners.  THE GOVERNMENT MUST RECOGNISE PRISON OFFICER'S STATUS AS A FIRST RESPONSE EMERGENCY SERVICE AND SET A NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE FOR PRISON OFFICER AT 60.",
