        "additional_details": "COWBOY TRADESMEN are ruining peoples lives and costing the government millions. The law DOES NOT currently require tilers, plumbers, bricklayers, plasterers, joiners or any trade other than electricians or gas engineers to be qualified before entering a persons home to carry out potentially dangerous installations. Any person in this country can decide to build a house for somebody. There is NOTHING stopping them doing this potentially lethal act. The law needs to be changed so that genuine government-endorsed City & Guilds qualifications NEED to be SHOWN and VERIFIED for ALL TRADES before any work can commence both privately and commercially. Not just gas and electricity - ALL TRADES. Independent crash-course qualifications will NOT be accepted. The introduction of this law will reduce cowboys, prevent injury, lower the number of court cases, and increase work to good and honest tax-paying, qualified craftsmen. Cowboys don't pay tax because they don't care.",
