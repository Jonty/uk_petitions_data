        "additional_details": "According to the BBC's own figures during 2011 it costs the public a total of  \u00a33.6 billion in licencing fees. The service that they offer is in no way beneficent to the public, and is already provided by many other channels free of charge.\r\n\r\nThis Petition is calling for the BBC to seek an alternate source of revenue that is not a direct tax upon the public. And if the BBC is not able to accomplish this target by the year 2015 to liquidate its assets, and to use the revenue to provide tax cuts for the public.\r\n\r\nthe initial liquidation of stock would provide roughly  \u00a34.7 Billion, and the Removal of the TV license would save the public an additional  \u00a33.6 Billion per year. This would equate to a saving of roughly  \u00a3130 per person in the first year, and a saving of roughly \u00a357 per person every year after. ",
