        "additional_details": "At time of writing, the Syrian Uprising has been raging for almost 18 months, during which time the Syrian Government has shown a complete disregard for international law and humanity by committing mass slaughter against the people of Syria, indiscriminate of their role, gender or age. In light of these ongoing atrocities, as a supporter of the Responsibility to Protect initiative (itself established as a response to the international community's failure to act during the Rwandan genocide), the UK Government must use its position on the international stage to help bring an end to this slaughter, protecting civilians through the establishment of safe havens and a no-fly zone.",
