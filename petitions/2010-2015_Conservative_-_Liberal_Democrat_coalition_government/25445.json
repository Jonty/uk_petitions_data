An example of this is the planned strike by ASLEF on Boxing Day whereby trade union officials actively encourage their members to vote for action even if they are on annual leave or other absence. The individual member can effectively vote for strike action and receive full pay. On this basis, there is nothing to lose by supporting the action. Voting undertaken by absentees should be regarded as ineligible.",
