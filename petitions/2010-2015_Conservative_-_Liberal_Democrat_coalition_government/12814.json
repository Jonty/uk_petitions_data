        "additional_details": "It has become obvious that coalition government for this country doesn't work. There have been to many trade off's within manifestos and this has lead to the British voting public being misled. In other words government by default. This country, especially at this time needs a strong and focused government with a mandate from the voting public, yes, I accept we couldn't, or didn't vote a clear majority to any one party, but I believe that the party who lost the most votes should be automatically discounted from the next round of election's and consequently the manifesto of the strongest party would be adhered to by the letter, so the British public would be completely aware of the next five years plans for the country.
