There should be checks on bankers\u2019 greed like selling insurance that are not required by their customers, inflating interest rates by deception (under LIBOR), filling the pockets of their high ranking officials by millions of pounds of undeserved bonuses, while starving businesses badly of required injection of funds by demanding payment of high borrowing costs or else go without. Greed, incompetence & power in any areas of society/profession (including banking) need regulating by checks and balances. How can banks that need bailing out by HMG then pay their high ranking officials millions of pounds?",
