The Citizens advice Bureau is a charity open to everyone no matter what gender financial position, whatever race or colour.  Ealing has a similar service which is means tested, and therefore  exclusive.  Ealing citizens do not have access to information about the benefits system as an example and a whole host of other information to which they are entitled.  There are billions of pounds of unclaimed benefits because people do not know they are entitled.\r\n\r\nPlease sign so that all the citizens of Ealing are allowed the same right to information through the services of the CAB as in every other London Borough.",
