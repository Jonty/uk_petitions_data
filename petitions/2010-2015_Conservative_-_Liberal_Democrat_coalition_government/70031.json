There are perfect  premises on the Strangford road but due to the council merger down council are scared to make a decision.  Surely if we could lease these premises for 2 years this would be better than them staying empty and the council paying the rates on them (using your money) Please sign this e petition to help save CAPAA and ensure this valuable and enjoyable resource for people with autism carries on. Having worked here myself I know what a fantastic place this is for people with autism to socialise and be themselves.  ",
