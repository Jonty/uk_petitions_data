We are treating this illness with a serious lack of respect.\r\nWe need to petition all world wide governments to impose a minimum quarantine from those countries directly effected. This is to both contain & protect those countries effected & those volunteers that could potentially effect the countries & families they are from. Need I remind, that we impose far stricter controls on animals & livestock that actually pose a far significant threat. Thank you.",
