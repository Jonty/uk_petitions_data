        "additional_details": "Judging by the small media attention of this current affair, and how unpopular it is in the UK public arena, I hereby write this petition to 'encourage more prison time' for sex offenders as opposed to community service.\r\n\r\nCurrently;\r\n-The Sentencing Council suggested 'high level community orders' for those convicted of trading or possessing child pornography\r\n-The current benchmark jail sentence for those with a small number of images is three months\r\n-Only those with pictures of children posing alone or small quantities of images of children engaged in sex acts, but not with adults are not jailed\r\n(Official news have reported)\r\n\r\n& In 2011, of the 261 people found guilty of sexual activity with a child under 13, 134 were jailed and 90 were given community sentences.\r\n\r\nCriminologist Dr David Green said it was 'sending the wrong message'.\r\n\r\nDo you agree?
