        "additional_details": "Following the recent computer glitch where millions of people spent the weekend without their hard earned cash, citizens of the UK deserve the full protection of government against any future \"glitch\" in systems owned and operated by banking institutions. The Government should take steps to take ownership of the systems and safeguard the core consumer banking infrastructure to protect inter-bank transfers, ensuring that this fiasco is not repeated. Even customers of other banks have been affected by their employers use of the bankline systems owned and operated by the Natwest and RBS. The Government is urged to to debate this issue as a matter of urgency.",
