In 2011 my mother's liberty was taken from her under a denial of liberty (DOL) order which resulted in her being put into a care home.\r\nBut because my mother and father have spent their entire lives saving for their old age, the State has decided that my mother has to pay for her own care.\r\nHow can this be right that the State can take away my mother's liberty and then force her to pay for her care as well? We do not expect prisoners to have to pay for their keep, when their liberty is taken away from them, so why does the State expect  law abiding people, to have to pay for their care when their liberty is taken away from them?\r\nThe government has announced that it will not implement the Dilnot commission's recommendations until, at least the next parliament. The commission's recommendations need to be implemented now (and the law on paying for care under a DOL) and this must be debated in Parliament at the earliest opportunity",
