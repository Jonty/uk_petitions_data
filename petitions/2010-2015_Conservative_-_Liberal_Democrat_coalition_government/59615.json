        "action": "Add the motorcycle Compulsory Basic Training course to the driving test for all drivers",
        "additional_details": "At present to be allowed to ride a motorcycle a person must satisfactorily complete a CBT (compulsory basic training) course, which teaches riders hazard identification and perception skills to make their riding safe.\r\n\r\nAs many people are aware a large proportion of motorcycle accidents are caused by drivers of other vehicles either not paying attention, not knowing what to look for, or just being arrogant.  I personally do not ride a motorcycle these days, but having completed a CBT I am equipped with skills for spotting hazards, and a bit more respect for those who do choose to travel on two wheels.\r\n\r\nI ask the government to consider changing the driving test for cars to include the motorcycle CBT to increase drivers' hazard and motorcycle awareness.  I am not proposing, however, that drivers should spend a minimum period of time on a bike before moving to a car, which differentiates this petition from 48256.",
