        "additional_details": "There is already a petition up demanding no 'MASS' immigration from these countries.  That allows the government to define the level of immigration which can be called 'MASS' immigration.  That just will not cut it with the majority of the people of this country (that is why those so called 'government ministers' of ours cannot allow us a referendum on our membership of the EU, because they KNOW they will lose it - it was recently said that no referendum on anything will be held if there is a chance they might lose it).  What WE want is absolutely NO new immigration from ANY member country of the EU, especially not the criminal classes from Bulgaria and Romania - their respective governments are drooling at the thought of getting rid of their criminal underclass to the UK within 24 hours of their joining the EU.",
