I am now only \u00a310's a week better off! I will continue to work because it's the right thing to do!\r\n\r\nAfter 12 weeks, Jsa claimants should have all their benefits totted up and should be made to work a proportion of this off this while claiming. Let's be honest no one spends 8 hours a day looking for a job. This could be helping with local council departments etc.. Housing benefit is ridiculous in London, why do we pay double or triple the national average for people that don't work. When it would be much cheaper to house them in cheaper areas.\r\n\r\nThe country is too worried about social divisions and everyone needs to understand you get out what you put into life.",
