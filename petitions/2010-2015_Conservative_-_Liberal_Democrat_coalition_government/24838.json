        "additional_details": "I would like the government to make it illegal for UK companies to obtain or use data obtained by overseas call centres outside of the scope of UK/EU laws on telephone preferencing.  As a specific example the current \"PPI\" has resulted in many calls every week from a call centre outside of the EU urging me to claim for something I never had in the first place.  There appears no recourse to my service provider or other body to stop these nuisance calls.  If the Government make it illegal for UK companies to make use of any data collected in this way it will remove the market and the calls.\r\n\r\nThank you",
