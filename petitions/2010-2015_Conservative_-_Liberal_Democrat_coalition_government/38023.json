Too many people assume that they have a right to free healthcare regardless of their own lifestyle, leading to binge-drinking, drug-taking, morbid obesity and smoking related diseases (a short list, there are too many to name). The NHS should be free and available to those who are truly sick or in need; people whose conditions are no fault of their own. People do not take care for themselves anymore as they assume that the government will bail them out. Why should those of us who choose to adopt healthy lifestyles pay our tax and national insurance to fund those who don't. ",
