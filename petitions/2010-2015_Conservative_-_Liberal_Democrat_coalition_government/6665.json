        "additional_details": "I believe the government should end jobseekers allowance. Even in these difficult times everyone and anyone can find a job and there is no excuse to be claiming benefits. The jobseekers allowance doesnt provide anywhere near enough to live on and hard working people have to pay far too much for people that dont want to work. i claimed job seekers allowance for 2 weeks, it arrived in my bank account 2 months later then when I was out of work, and when I had actually found a new job so was of no use anyway. Use me as a case in point, I was made unemployed in 2008 and the first employment agency I went to found me a job working in a nusery on the first day. I took this despite having an engineering degree and the job being nowhere near the equivilent of what I had been made redundant from. I did this job for 3 weeks in which time I found a job of similar stature to which I had been employed in previously and then commenced employment in my field again.",
