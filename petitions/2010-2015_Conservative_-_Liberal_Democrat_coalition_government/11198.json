        "additional_details": "We the undersigned would like the Internet block, currently put on UK TV programmes being shown abroad, removed. I have tried to watch TV programmes via BBC, CH4 and ITV iPlayers and been refused access, It is accepted that as people abroad do not pay a UK licence fee then they should pay to watch those programmes. As an example, \u00a31 for half hour programme, \u00a32 for one hour programme, \u00a33 for a feature length programme. This could be done by adding a Credit Card payment option to the various iPlayers. The BBC iPlayer would be an obvious choice for a trial.",
