        "additional_details": "We the British public hereby propose that children under a care protection plan should be allocated one social worker rather than many different ones.\r\nIt is damaging to children to keep introducing different strangers to them and expecting them to bond enough to open up and discuss in depth any information that may be relevent to their care.\r\nBy assigning only one regular social worker the -sometimes already vulnerable- child will feel more comfertable in their presence and therfore be more trusting and more inclined to speak truthfully.\r\nThis ruling would also dismiss the chance of having to repeat assesments that have already been carried out, easing the already lengthy process that the child has to endure. It will also speed up the assesment time and allow room for a more detailed and indepth insight into the circumstances therfore allowing desisions to be made quicker and be more informed.",
