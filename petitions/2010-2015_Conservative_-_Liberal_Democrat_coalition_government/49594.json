        "additional_details": "An average of 2 women a week are killed by a male and/or former partner. This petition asks for a new offence to be created with mandatory long term prison sentences for all \"control crimes\". The following offences should all be considered \"control crimes\" in law, i.e. the unlawful controlling of another person through the use of violence, threats of violence, phsychological abuse etc. The following should all be considered to be control crimes; domestic abuse, domestic violence, people trafficing, pimping, slavery, kidnapping and hostage taking. I petition the Government to enact new legislation which  mandates a minimum jail term to be served of 8 years  for all convictions for \"control crimes\" and a maximum term of life.",
