Some earn more in retirement than the vast majority can ever dream of receiving at the height of their earning power.\r\n\r\nPublic Service Pensions are a BENEFIT not a BONUS.  It is immoral for anyone to retire on taxpayer funded pensions that are greater than the average national salary. Those who wish to receive more should make their own arrangements through personally funded investments.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAY YES TO CAPPING PUBLIC SERVING PENSIONS AT THE NATIONAL AVERAGE SALARY.  ",
