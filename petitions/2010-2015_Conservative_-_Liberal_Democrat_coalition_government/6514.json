There are alternatives, but the government chooses to ignore them, highlighting the fact that the cuts are based on ideology, not necessity.\r\nOne alternative is to make the banks pay for free insurance provided to them by the taxpayer: a chief executive at the Bank of England put the cost of this subsidy at \u00a3100bn in a single year. Another is to clamp down on tax dodging by corporations and the rich, estimated to cost the state \u00a395bn a year\r\nEither the tax avoided and evaded in a single year or the taxpayer subsidy to the banking industry could pay for all of the \u00a381bn, four-year cuts programme.",
