Bring in the ARMY.\r\n\r\nI think that the parents of any child under the age of 18 that is caught loitering should receive a \u00a31000 fine.\r\n\r\nIts pretty clear that the police dont know what their doing when CHILDREN riot.\r\n\r\nThe whole world is looking at us and laughing. This is the messege you want to send? What hope have we got to host the 2012 olympics???",
