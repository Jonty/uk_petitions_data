        "additional_details": "The London 2012 Olympics was amazing. It united a nation - it had us all completely engrossed in what was a famous sporting experience. No day encapsulated that more than the 4th of August 2012, 'Super Saturday', probably the greatest sporting day this country has ever had.\r\n\r\nBut with each day that passes we seem to lose a little of that Olympic spirit and the desire to get out there and enjoy sports. We need to bring that spirit back. That's why I'm proposing an annual National Sports Day on the first Saturday of August each year to help maintain the Olympic Legacy and boost participation in sport across the country.\r\n\r\nI'd like to create a designated day each year in which schools, companys and communities organise fantastic sporting events. Please sign this petition to help make that happen.",
