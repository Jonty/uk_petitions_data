        "additional_details": "I would prefer to see no government aid given directly to any of the world's top 50 economies except for occasional disaster relief if needed.  Money for particular needs, such as environmental issues or medical aid should be given to charities experienced in the field, who are much better at getting value for money than are governments.  All monies given must be strictly accounted for.  And no money should be given to any country however poor who persecute sections of their own population, whether on gender or religious grounds or any other. ",
