        "additional_details": "It is the experience of Haines Watts Chartered Accountants, who specialise in advising and supporting owner managed businesses across the country, that when HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) are required to make repayments, such as the VAT repayments that will be due to Golf Clubs following the recent European decision in the case of Bridport and West Dorset Golf Club, there can be significant delays.  We call upon the Government to ensure that HMRC devote sufficient resources to speed up repayments legitimately due to businesses and to individuals. This would put much needed funds back into the economy.",
