        "additional_details": "Un-Metered Water Rates are currently based on an outdated 1990's Rateable value system, which can differ immensly per household, thusly this makes some people forced to pay \u00a3250 for water a year, where others get it as cheap as \u00a3130 a year.\r\n\r\nI recommend the government look into basing water rates on council tax bills or by postal code, therefore making the water rates the same for each household in the same area, instead of totally different bills for the same resource.\r\n\r\nIf I subscribe to Sky/Cable I pay the same charge as someone else, why should I pay more for the same water as my neighbours, which is based on an outdated charging system.\r\n\r\nVote for a fairer system, everyone should pay the same rate for unmetered water, regardless of where they live.",
