Work should pay better salaries than many people have to live on. There should not be cuts to the NHS and charities because of accountants in businesses not paying their staff enough for hard work.\r\n\r\nThere also needs to be greater support for people to be defended with legal aid in employment tribunals and the time limit for making a claim for wrongful dismissal should be extended so that companies can not get away with sacking people without evidence which I am afraid happens all too often ...\r\n\r\n",
