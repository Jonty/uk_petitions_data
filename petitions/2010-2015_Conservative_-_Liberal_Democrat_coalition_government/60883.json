        "additional_details": "This petition is to place a Global ban on trades of ivory both legal and illegal trading. Elephants and other animals are becoming more and more endangered and they need our help. Ban All Ivory Trades.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of 2012 through to March 2013 over 32,000 elephants alone were killed illegally. We can't sit down and turn our heads the other way anymore something has to be done about it.\r\n\r\nMary Rice - Executive Director of the independent environmental investigation believes that 90% of china's ivory is illegal.\r\n\r\nI ask you to sign this petition in order to stand up for a dying species who alone can not defend themselves against horrible poachers armed with machine guns, axes and chainsaws.\r\n\r\nThe Only Thing That Needs Elephant Tusks Is A Elephant!",
