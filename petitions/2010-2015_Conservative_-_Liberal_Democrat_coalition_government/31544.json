        "additional_details": "We the undersigned wish to express our outrage at the proposed changes to Sunday Trading Laws during the forthcoming London Olympics.  This shows a total disregard to all retail and distribution workers.\r\nA survey of over 10,000 Usdaw members completed in April last year found that:\r\n\u2022\t91% opposed large shops being able to open all hours on a Sunday\r\n\u2022\t95% thought the current ban on large shops opening on Christmas Day and Easter Sunday should continue.\r\n\u2022\t47% have caring responsibilities for children, elderly relatives or others that make it difficult to work on a Sunday.\r\nDeregulation would do little to stimulate growth or create jobs, but would have a very detrimental impact on the lives of millions of shopworkers and their families. Any change would fly totally in the face of the government\u2019s commitment to be family-friendly\r\n",
