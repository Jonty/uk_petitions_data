        "additional_details": "2013 marks the centenary of English composer Benjamin Britten. There are countless performances of Britten's music planned for next year and the music world will come together to celebrate the outstanding contribution that he made to music in the 20th Century.\r\n\r\nBritten wrote for the most prestigious opera houses and for community based projects. Amongst his output is a charming version of the National Anthem.\r\n\r\nPerformed at the 2012 Paralympic Opening Ceremony, Britten's version of the National Anthem brings more vibrancy, excitement, and passion than the more frequently used version. I believe that it should be adopted for use in all major ceremonies, royal events and international sporting fixtures.\r\n\r\nThis YouTube link will enable you to hear it in full:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fro3J4n5_Sc\r\n\r\nWhat more fitting way could our country honour a legend of British music than by adopting his version of our nation's anthem?\r\n\r\nEdward Benjamin Britten OM CH: 1913 - 1976",
