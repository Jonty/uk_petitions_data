        "additional_details": "Building state of the art nuclear fission plants that are safe and cost effective makes lots of sense, but only as a stopgap measure. One must also consider the cost of decommissioning, subsequent storage of nuclear wastes and the possibility of nuclear plant blow out due to accidents, terrorism or wars. Increase funding should be given in research into the \u2018holy grail\u2019 of nuclear fusion should be given to those doing such research, like the collaborative projects in European atom smasher (CERN) in Switzerland researching into dark matter, anti-matter, producing energy by nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion (unlike today's nuclear fission) does NOT yield radioactive products. Priority should also be given to research into ecologically friendly technologies like hydrogen fuel cells for vehicles, renewable wave and wind power, hydroelectric power, biofuels. biomass fuels, fuel efficient engines/appliances, ramjet and the scramjet.",
