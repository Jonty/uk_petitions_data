        "additional_details": "The present form of e-petitions which allows only that people vote for and not against the petition is defective in that it provides no indication of support for the contrary view.  It is proposed that e-petitions should allow both types of vote. Not only would this provide a clearer picture of support (or lack of support) it would also eliminate the tendency for separate contrary petitions to be set up. The threshold required to qualify for debate would probably have to be changed and it would also have to take account of the number supporting the contrary view.",
