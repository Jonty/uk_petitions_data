        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the government to condemn the actions taken against peaceful protesters in Turkey.\r\n\r\nProtests over the redevelopment of a recreational park in Istanbul have been mishandled by the police and Prime Minister Erdogan's government. This has led to wide spread public protests against the government and its increasingly authoritarian administration.\r\n\r\nPolice responded with rage. They have been continuously firing pepper gas and water cannons to peaceful protesters and have been using excessive force. There are unacceptable human rights violations occurring in several cities in Turkey.\r\n\r\nTurkish media and TV channels are silenced by the government and people rely on foreign and social media to keep informed.\r\n\r\nAmnesty International's Europe director John Dalhuisen said: \"The excessively heavy-handed response to the entirely peaceful protests in Taksim has been truly disgraceful.\"\r\n\r\nSigning this petition would help draw international attention to the issue.",
