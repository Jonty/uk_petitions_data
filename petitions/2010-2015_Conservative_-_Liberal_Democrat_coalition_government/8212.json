        "additional_details": "We, the public, respectfully request that the government establish compulsory conscription into the military:\r\n\r\n1) We request that all those convicted of participating in the August 2011 riots, should not be sent to prison (unless in exceptional circumstances) but rather be drafted into the military where they will work, develop their minds and hearts and learn to protect and serve their country.\r\n\r\n2) Furthermore, we propose that compulsory conscription be established for all youths that choose to leave school before they have completed their A levels (unless exceptional circumstances apply).\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\nThose rioting and looting state they are doing this because they are financially destitute, have no hope for their futures and the police/ communities don't have respect for them. We the public say, let them be given the opportunity to earn respect, develop a purpose in life and learn self respect in the army.\r\n",
