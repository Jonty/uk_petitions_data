        "additional_details": "New DH guidance has banned all prone restraint without proper consultation with in patient MH / LD staff. Although the focus on violence prevention is welcomed- the absence of an evidence based alternative to prone restraint when managing extreme aggression / administering IMI medication means that this guidance puts all staff and patients on adults in patient units at great risk. I'm calling for proper consultation with staff and a change of wording in the document.",
