Prison is a life of luxury many of us aspire to and there is so much money in unpaid fines that we could re-finance the planet if it were all collected.  There are some crimes which DEMAND the ultimate punishment and the rape and anal fucking (there is no other appropriate description of what these people do to these kids) of children by 60 year old male perverts, aided and abetted by females, is one of them.",
