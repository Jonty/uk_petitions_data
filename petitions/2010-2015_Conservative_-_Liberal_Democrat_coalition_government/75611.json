        "additional_details": "This petition has been created to get the government to raise the amount of funding the NHS is given to its specialist services for transgender individuals.\r\nUsually PCTs would commission local provider services to provide the full range of care requirements for their population. It has always been a principle of the NHS that it cares for all health needs for which there is evidence of an effective treatment.\r\n\r\nPCTs, with limited funds every year, set priorities for how many of each kind of service they would budget for. This budgeting process is reflected in the contracts they then make with provider organisations.\r\n\r\nIf too few places for a service are contracted then either referrals need to stop for the remainder of that financial year (something which has happened in many areas in 2011-12) or they would need to come up with extra money \u2026 which can only be done by reducing the spend elsewhere.",
