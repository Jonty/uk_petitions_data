        "additional_details": "The laws on racial crimes are unjust as everyone is of a particular ethnicity then racial crimes should be as equal as they are to everyone, our country calls for equality, equality in marriage of gay and straight people, equality of men and woman in the work place, then why not the truthful equality of all ethnicities, if a white man is racist towards a black person then this is racism but if the other way round this is not racism in these pressing times of terrorism we must all be able to unite our country in the fact that we can come together in equality. So for this reason I believe our ministry of justice should change the racial laws to create equality.",
