        "additional_details": "Scotland's Justice Minister, Kenny MacAskill, was arrested in 1999 in London by Metropolitan Police in suspicion of being drunk and disorderly.  He was held for at least the duration of an England v. Scotland match, then released without caution or charge.  It seems that he was, therefore, wrongfully arrested.  This petition seeks Justice for our esteemed Justice Minister by seeking compensation, although technically time barred.",
