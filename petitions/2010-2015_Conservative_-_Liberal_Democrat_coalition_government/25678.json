        "additional_details": "This is a fast growing market and is largely unmonitored and self regulated. Currently thousands of animals are being trafficked online each day without the same level of protection afforded to those animals sold via pet shops or other establishments involved in the breeding or commercial trade in animals. The online market is a very easy way for those involved in the unscrupulous or illegal trade in animals to remain unlicensed, anonymous and untraceable. We call on the government to launch a review into the trade in animals online with a view to introducing stricter regulations for commercial websites offering animals for sale. Current legislation appertaining to pet shops, commercial breeders and those individuals or establishments involved in the commercial breeding or  trading of animals are not easily transferred to the online market as it is currently a very difficult market to police.\r\n",
