We can persuade him to take action against this monstrous crime. The Great Barrier Reef is in danger of being taken over by a coal seam gas export facility which means draining millions of cubic metres of sea floor. What will happen to all of the species which depend on the Great Barrier Reef - the answer is clear. They will perish without our help. The Great Barrier Reef is now so endangered that it is almost certain that it will soon become a World Heritage site. TAKE ACTION AND WE CAN PREVENT THIS ALL FROM HAPPENING.I have already recently launched this petition the site is https://secure.avaaz.org/en/petition/Save_The_Great_Barrier_Reef_5/?Day2Share please sign ",
