        "additional_details": "Jeremy Hunt has been made Health Secretary in the reshuffle, however is on record saying that the NHS should be dismantled. Jeremy Hunt is a dangerous person to have responsible for the NHS, if this is his viewpoint.\r\n\r\nJeremy Hunt also believes in homoeopathy, for which there is overwhelming scientific evidence that it is not effective, and is nothing more than a placebo.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nMaria Miller has been made Minister for Women and Equality, despite having voted AGAINST equal gay rights, AGAINST the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, which would give female same sex couples the ability to receive fertility treatment, and is in favour of defining homophobia, racial hatred and prejudice as simply just \"Freedom of Speech\"\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned demand David Cameron to reconsider these decisions, and put people with a better record of supporting the areas they are now in charge of.",
