The \u201cruler\" of Jammu Kashmir at the time chose 2/3 of Kashmir to be part of India without having to ask the people of Kashmir to decide what they wanted. For the last two decades Kashmiris are facing unabated human rights violations at the hands of Indian armed forces. People live in constant fear and danger of dying from unnecessary daily bombings. Night life in the valley no longer exits. Living a normal life is impossible.\r\n\r\nWe want the government of United Kingdom to please step forward to support the Kashmiris right to choose whether they want to be part of India or not. India is okay with violating Kashmiris human rights and continues threatening Pakistan to kill their people along the borders unnecessarily.\r\n",
