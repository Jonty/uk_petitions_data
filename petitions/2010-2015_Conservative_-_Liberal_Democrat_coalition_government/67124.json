If they are so important then they should also be taken out of school hours.\r\nIt would seem highly unacceptable to a school if after 6 weeks summer holidays a child requested a day off on the very first day back to school in a new year but it is ok because it's a Training day?\r\nEither stop fining parents for taking their children out of school unless for extreme cases or stop training days being a reason for children to miss days of school.",
