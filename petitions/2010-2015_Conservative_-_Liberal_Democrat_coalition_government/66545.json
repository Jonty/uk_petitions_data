        "additional_details": "Sadly, one cannot deny that racism exists today in our society. It should be common knowledge that racism is wrong, and yet we still see it.\r\nCertain publications show biased views towards some sections of society, such as immigrants. Is it right to discriminate because of nationality? It is a sad truth that outright racism exists. However, it is possible to become more tolerant.\r\nThere are many other prejudices.These can be prevented through education and a building of tolerance, and through breaking down fears.\r\nMore, therefore, needs to be done to prevent racism. It can be done in the form of education of young people; in education of adults even; in campaigns to stop racism-related violence; in prevention of the media from publishing unacceptably biased material.\r\nI hope that this e-petition will persuade the Government to do more to prevent prejudice, and to ascertain that a person will never judge another on anything but personality.\r\n",
