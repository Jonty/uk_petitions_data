        "additional_details": "Many studies have been found that suggest that THC kills cancer cells, yet the research studies carried out have been small and many studies have been inconclusive.  One issue is that not all studies are planned properly and they all are looking for different criteria.  Rather than individual institutions carrying out their own small scale investigations I propose that the Government perhaps with the aid of charities such as Cancer Research UK could pool resources and carry out a very large scale study specifically on the effects of THC in the treatment of cancer.",
