        "additional_details": "Over 100 people are admitted to hospital every week from an injury sustained by a dog. These alarming figures have soared up to 66% higher in the last decade alone and dogs are a major health risk for children. An increasingly higher risk than the figures for most childhood illnesses! That is alarming? Most victims of dog attacks are helpless children who have been mauled by their so called 'family pets'\r\n\r\nCURRENT LEGISLATION OF 2011 STATES THAT NO CRIMINAL ACT TAKES PLACE IF THE DOG ATTACKS THEIR VICTIM IN THE DOGS HOME OF RESIDENCE AND YET CAN BE AND NORMALLY IS ONLY DESTROYED IF THE ATTACK IS ON A PUBLIC STREET!!! HOW CAN THIS BE ALLOWED?\r\n\r\nWE are campaigning to welcome a change to current legislation & pleading for people to see that a dog attack is still an attack regardless of where it takes place and the law should be there to protect us.\r\n\r\nGIVE POLICE THE POWERS TO SEIZE DOGS THAT ATTACK NO MATTER WHERE THE ATTACK TAKES PLACE, AN ATTACK IS AN ATTACK.",
