Efforts to improve it have failed because there is an authority vacuum. Major intervention and a new\r\nstructure are urgently required to ensure children are given priority.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to set up a National Adoption Authority to bring together control over all elements of the adoption system, including the\r\ncourts. Governed by a mixed representative body covering the whole spectrum of adoption, its role would be to ensure that policies and guidelines based\r\non medical and child development evidence and best practice worldwide are enforced and success measured.\r\n\r\nBarriers to adoption need to be broken down and the authority vacuum needs to be filled - Support the call for a National Adoption Agency.\r\n",
