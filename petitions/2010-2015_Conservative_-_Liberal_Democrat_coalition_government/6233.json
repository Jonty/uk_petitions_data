The Independant newspaper ran a petition resulting in thousands of signatures. YouGov's own poll showed 72% of the public in favour or a ban and Parliament has already debated this issue with a majority vote for a ban.\r\n\r\nAnd today we learn that Peru and Bolivia have both been added to the growing list of countries who ban the use of wild animals in circuses.\r\n\r\nA ban on wild animals in circuses has the will of the public and the will of Parliament.  This petition asks that the Government now move ahead with legislation to introduce a ban.",
