        "additional_details": "Should Scotland choose independence in the referendum, strict checks at Scottish borders; analogous to border checks in England & Wales would be required in order to prevent illegal immigration from Eire. The time for debate, discuss & contingency plan on this issue is now. Independent Scotland must find the resources herself to fund to secure her borders, in addition to free NHS, prescriptions, schooling and higher education, as well as funding  affairs of  state like: border checks, immigration, Scottish passports & driving licences, embassies, foreign affairs, EU membership, civil service, Inland Revenue, momentary system, policing, prisons, legal aid, welfare benefits, etc, etc. Independent Scotland\u2019s economy may well be stretched. Also new RN warships may not be built in an independent Scotland.",
