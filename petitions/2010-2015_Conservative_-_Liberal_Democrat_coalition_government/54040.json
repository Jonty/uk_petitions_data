To allow the taxpayer to pick up the potentially HUGE compensation tab will do nothing but further empower those out of control criminals in our government to commit more and even worse criminal acts.  THEY MUST BE STOPPED.  David Cameron hates it but this country is STILL a democracy and he needs to be removed, and removed soon.",
