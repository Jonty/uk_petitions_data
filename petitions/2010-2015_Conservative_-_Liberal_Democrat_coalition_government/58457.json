Now anyone can type in your name and find you. Over the past few weeks I have tried changing my name twice so that it does not include my last name but still when you type in my last name, my profile becomes visible.\r\n\r\nAs a teacher this is a serious problem, I like many others have been victims of identity fraud on Facebook and more recently my profile photo has been taken by students saved and passed around the school. This has happened to many members of staff. It is a total invasion of our privacy, which Facebook used to safeguard us against. But for some reason they no longer feel it is necessary.\r\n\r\nFacebook please bring back the option for people to choose whether they can be searched for by name. We need protection.\r\n\r\n",
