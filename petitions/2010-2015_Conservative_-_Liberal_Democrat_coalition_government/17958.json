        "additional_details": "As the BBC has devolved from an organisation which upheld and represented all the best of British traditions and culture to a politically biased, anti-religious, unpatriotic pressure group attacking everything that could be regarded as British, using words, phrases and programmes with which it attempts to subliminally degrade pride in this country, and is apparently managed by  inexperienced youthful  egotists, we demand that it be disbanded and/or all executive powers held within the organisation by persons ranked or graded as presenters or above,  be cancelled or otherwise deleted. That a new board be structured and appointed for a three year period chosen by a panel consisitng of three unconvicted MPs, Two bishops or archbishops legally qualified to be so designated, i.e. not self appointed, three members of HM forces ranked between sergeant and warrant officer inclusive and one member of the royal family in line to the throne.",
