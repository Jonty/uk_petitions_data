        "additional_details": "This is a request for the government to change the current pattern of National School Holidays (can only be implemented by the dept. of Education)\r\nWe want the government to:\r\n- Reduce the school Summer Holidays to 4 Weeks (currently 6 weeks)\r\n- Increase the Christmas Holidays to 4 weeks (Currently 2 weeks)\r\n\r\nIt will not only markedly improve school attendance as parents will have better choice in deciding when to take their children for a holiday, it will also prevent missed school days lost due to usual extreme weather in January.\r\nAlso, 6 weeks over summer is too long for some children/ young people to remain out of formal education and inevitably gives rise to them getting into trouble.",
