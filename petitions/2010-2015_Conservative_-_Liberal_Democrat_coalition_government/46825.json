This should be applied equally to all seeking benefits, whether they are born in UK, British, EU immigrants or non EU immigrants. In this way the European Union cannot object and future benefits claims would be more restricted and controlled.\r\nFurthermore, review all current claimants who do not meet the above criteria, examine their visas, residency status and situation with a view to withdraw benefits where applicable and reasonable. i.e. If a claimant has been in this country for less than two years, should they be on benefits?\r\n",
