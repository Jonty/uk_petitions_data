For their own safety, they should not be on any road in the UK where it is deemed unsafe.\r\nCyclists must dismount on a shared path with a large proportion of pedestrians and slow down when on a less densely used path when a pedestrian is seen. Also cyclists should be required to have a horn fitted to their cycle to warn of their approach.",
