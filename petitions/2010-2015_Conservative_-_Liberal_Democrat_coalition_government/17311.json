        "additional_details": "We petition the Government to change the law so that all pubs can become \"free\" pubs, so that a pub landlord can purchase his/her supplies from whatever supplier he/she likes.  This would stop the current system whereby pubs are tied to certain companies and have to purchase all their supplies through that company, instead of, for example, being able to deal with the breweries directly.  This would change the current pub \"business model\" that is leading to good pubs being closed up and down the country every week.",
