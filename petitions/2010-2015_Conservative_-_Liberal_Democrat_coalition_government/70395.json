I wish the Government to bring in a complete ban of ownership of this breed of dog in the UK so that no more children have to die in the jaws of these dangerous and unstable breed of dogs. There can be no exceptions, no licence or muzzled required by law rule but in fact a complete outlawing of owning a Pit Bull Terrier of Pit Bull type breed of dog.",
