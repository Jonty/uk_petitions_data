        "additional_details": "It's a national disgrace that in the 20 years since introducing student loans, we\u2019ve educated our youth into debt when they go to university, but never about debt. We're a financially illiterate nation, with millions caught by misselling, overborrowing and being ripped off. Is it any surprise we\u2019ve just had a debt imbued financial crisis. This must change. Companies spend billions on marketing and teaching their staff to sell \u2013 it's time we got buyers' training. The most cost effective way to start is to ensure every child in the country gets a basic understanding of personal finance & consumer rights before leaving school. This isn\u2019t a large resource requirement. Some schools already do it, but the majority don\u2019t and that needs to end. Unless it's compulsory, head teachers can\u2019t prioritise for it. 97% of people support this, yet no one will take up the baton. We have one of the world\u2019s most complex consumer economies; it's time our children were taught how to thrive and survive in it.",

This e-petition will remain live, and people will be able to continue adding their signatures.\r\n\r\nThe Government has provided the following response:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Government agrees that young people should have access to good quality personal finance education, so that they leave school with the knowledge and confidence to manage their money effectively.  Parents can also play a crucial role in helping young people to become financially aware in their day-to-day lives.\r\n\r\nSchools already use Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education as a framework within which to teach young people about personal financial management.  The existing PSHE programmes of study include elements aimed at ensuring that by the time they leave school, pupils should be able to manage their money, understand and explain financial risk and reward, and identify how finance will play an important part in their lives and in achieving their aspirations.  We are currently carrying out a review to determine how best to support schools to improve the quality of all PSHE teaching.\u201d\r\n\r\nJustin Tomlinson MP was allocated a half-day in the Chamber in Backbench time and the debate took place on 15 December 2011.
