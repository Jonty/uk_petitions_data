        "additional_details": "Legislate to restrict the number of daily air transport movements at Heathrow Airport to no more than the current daily average. This is to ensure there can be no increase in flights flying over central London and into Heathrow, which causes unacceptable disruption, noise and air pollution, even at current levels.\r\n\r\nThis proposed legislation is not intended to restrict growth in the number of passengers at Heathrow, which could be through the adoption of larger planes such as the A380, which carries up to 100 more passengers, whilst also having an average fuel saving on other large aircraft.",
