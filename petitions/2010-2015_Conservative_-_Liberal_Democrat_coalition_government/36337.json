        "additional_details": "The BOE deputies should have excused themselves from voting for QE as it was a clear conflict of interests.  Stop further QE as it ruining the economy.\r\n\r\n Pensioner groups may not like quantitative easing but two would-be pensioners at the Bank of England have not done too badly out of money printing, the institution\u2019s annual report shows.\r\n\r\nCharlie Bean saw his pension pot as Deputy Governor of the Bank of England rise by more than \u00a31m\r\n\r\nCharlie Bean, 59, and Paul Tucker, 54, the two Deputy Governors, saw the value of their final salary pension pots rise by \u00a31.04m and \u00a31.35m respectively last year due mainly to a fall in gilt yields. For Mr Tucker, it meant his pension pot increased by 37pc to \u00a35m, while Mr Bean\u2019s leaped 41pc to \u00a33.56m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
