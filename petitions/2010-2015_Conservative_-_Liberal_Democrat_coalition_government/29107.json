        "additional_details": "The Thames Estuary Airport is a brilliant idea for improving infrastructure to make it suitable for the 21st century. However, is it located in a strategic location?\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned, beleive that parliament should discuss moving the planned airport west, where road and train links are already at acceptable standards.\r\n\r\nMany former Cold War Era sites, such as RAF Greenham Common, are slowly decaying, with no private or public investment for commercial airport conversion.\r\n\r\nSurely converting a former RAF/USAF base will be much cheaper for the taxpayer, than building the proposed artifical 'boris island'.
