The opportunity to play outdoors can improve children's physical and mental health as well as help them learn crucial social skills. These include learning to manage risk and communicate with other generations. Anyone who has been to the many street parties across the UK will have witnessed this. Street play allows for social activities and benefits that are not possible in other places.\r\n\r\nIt's time for the Government to introduce Play Streets across the UK and defend children's right to play safely.
