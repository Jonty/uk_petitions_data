        "additional_details": "We are fed up hearing and dealing with industrial action on public transport. Particularly with reference to the Olympic Games. Millions of commuters will face horrendous journeys with increased passenger flow. We  are not entitled to a discount on fares or in fact paid more to work during this period. Why should bus drivers, tube drivers and the like be treated any differently? STOP this industrial action. We are all facing the recession. Those in the private sector have been forced to take pay cuts and work longer hours while those in the public sector are demanding more money for carrying out their duties. They should feel privileged to be a part of the games and not exploit the system to extort more money that could be put to better use. End this selfish, opportunistic behavior NOW!",
