        "additional_details": "David Beckham's exclusion from the GB Olympic Football Team is against all the principles that the 2012 Olympic Games in London stand for.\r\n\r\nThe Olympic ethos of participation over success appears to have been lost.\r\n\r\nDavid Beckham devides opinion in the footballing world but there is no doubt that he epitomises what the Olympics in London should be all about, patriatism, endevour and public support.\r\n\r\nOne of the key challenges of the post 2012 Games will be to encourage participation in sport, this is a missed opportunity to advocate this by the inclusion of a public icon revered by the youth of this country.\r\n\r\nI call upon the Government to intervene to ensure that David Beckham is reinstated into the GB Olympic Football Team and give the Games and the Country some badly needed inspiration.",
