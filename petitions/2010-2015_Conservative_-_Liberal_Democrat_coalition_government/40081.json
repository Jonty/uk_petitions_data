        "additional_details": "Everyone living in Britain should be allowed to run the country by themselves without the help of a government. Morally, it is our country and should not be left down to one person and it is right that everyone gets a say in what they want to see happen in politics. This way, everyone's view is counted for and it will reduce apathy in  political interest. The government should be disbanded in order to rebuild society on new foundations to build up a better economic and social structure.",
