What checks are being carried out against the various claims & undeclared rental income from properties still owned in the UK?\r\nMaybe open up another hotline, a cheap a quick countermeasure for a problem that is set to grow due to the euro crisis\r\n\r\nAll entitlement to benefits other than a pension should be stopped immediately. Claiments should then be made to apply in person at the relevent Embassy or Consulate & their applications considered accordingly.\r\n",
