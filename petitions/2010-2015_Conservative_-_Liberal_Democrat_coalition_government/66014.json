Current estimates indicate that only half of single mothers due child support payments receive the full amount from fathers, with half the remaining women receiving partial payments and the remainder, none at all.\r\nThe CSA are too busy targeting the EASY cases and treating parents who want to pay unfairly, whilst turning a blind eye to the absent parents playing the game.\r\nCSA need to work with the authority's to enforce the appropriate punishment regularly and make sure they have no choice but to pay for their kids.\r\n",
