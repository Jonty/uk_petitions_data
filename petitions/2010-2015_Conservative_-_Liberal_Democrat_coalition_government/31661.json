        "additional_details": "We the undersigned object to the planning proposals for Little Drayton Community Centre as follows:\r\n\r\n1) A Listed Building application is pending on the building and we object to any planning decisions being made until English Heritage has completed their decision.\r\n\r\n2) The building was a gift that was presented to the community for their use, therefore planning permission should not be granted for any purpose other than those originally stipulated for benefiting the community directly.\r\n\r\n3) According to a recent online survey initial figures show that 82 people have replied so far. Of these 84% of local people want the building to be re-opened for public use.The LDCC committee has been working hard for many months to do just that. We feel that permission to develop it into private accommodation is depriving the community of a building intended for their use and would be ignoring public opinion.\r\n\r\n",
