        "additional_details": "We the undersigned demand that the Government re-instates the '10 day rule' whereby headteachers have the discretion to grant holidays 'in term'. This will allow hard pressed families to continue to afford family holidays and stop the current practise of 'price hikes' during school holiday periods. Many employers now dictate holiday dates for staff (Armed forces & Emergency Service to name a few), soon the family holiday will be a luxury only the wealthy can afford. ",
