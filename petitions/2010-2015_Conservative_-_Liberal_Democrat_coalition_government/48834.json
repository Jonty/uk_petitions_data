        "additional_details": "In the same way that people with a different colour, race, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins should be able to live their lives free of threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, as laid down by the Public Order Act 1986. People with disabilities should also be given the same protection in law.\r\n\r\nIn recent years an increasing number of attacks have occurred, ranging from physical attacks to verbal abuse. At times some parts of the media have also been complicit in fostering ignorance regarding disabilities and in creating hatred of people who have disabilities.\r\n\r\nTherefore it is a matter of urgency that a new section on Disability Hatred should be added to the Public Order Act 1986 in line with Racial Hatred. People who have disabilities have a right to live their lives free of threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour.",
