Sign your name here.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean you automatically support any other system like socialism, just that you are anti this one.  True change for the better can never come while we look to old beliefs of the past.  For there to be change, true change, we need to be prepared to give up old ideas or new ones can never be created to take there place.\r\n\r\nThere are many unsolvable problems with this system, for example climate change, economic inequality, lack of opportunity, poverty, unemployment, resource depletion and corruption.  Change can only come about if the system itself is under threat, look at what the bankers achieved.  ",
