This would ensure than all MPs are made more accountable to their constituents and those who fail to represent their constituency appropriate can be removed and replaced with someone who will represent their constituent's views.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and Members of the Cabinet should face additional scrutiny and be rated for efficacy/proficiency by all UK Constituents.\r\n\r\nFailure to improve and connect appropriately with the people of UK will be met with removal from Parliament or additional special measures to be put in place.\r\n\r\nMPs Expenses accounts much be more accessible and accountable to the public to ensure that no inappropriate expenses no matter how small are claimed.",
