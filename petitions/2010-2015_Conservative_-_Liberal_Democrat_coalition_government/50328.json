        "additional_details": "Current legislation says that schools must teach for 190 day (380 sessions). However some local authorities publish term dates that include the 5 non teaching days.\r\n\r\nBecause Head teachers have the discretion to select these 5 training days from the 195, parents are disadvantaged with working arrangements and childcare provision.\r\n\r\nIF 190 day term dates are published to parents by the Local Authorities, parents have reliability and guarantees for life planning. Local authorities and Head teachers can then locally (and privately) agree the dates of the remaining 5 training days without having to affect or disrupt children and parents.",
