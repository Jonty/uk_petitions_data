        "additional_details": "We the undersigned wish to petition the Chancellor of the Exchequer into stopping the beer duty escalator. At two percent above inflation, the escalator is too harmful to the sensible British drinker. We recognise that beer duty has already risen 35% since 2008, and the escalator will add a further 7% at the next budget.\r\nBeer and pubs support over one million jobs in this country, so by hurting the employer the duty is doing nothing to help keep these employees in employment. We urge the Chancellor of the Exchequer to fulfil the coalition agreement, in which it states they will \u201c\u201creview alcohol taxation and pricing to ensure it tackles binge drinking without unfairly penalising responsible drinkers, pubs and important local industries\u201d.",
