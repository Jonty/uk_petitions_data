        "additional_details": "Mother should have the rights to BF the baby, and the BF rights should be protected by law. A court should not decide if the baby should be BF or bottle feed. The baby is incharge of BF and it should be the baby and mother decision when to stop BF. There is no law in place to protect the mother and the BF baby from dads who wants them baby for overnight contact at a very early age. The judges are not sympathetic to BF babies in this country. I found loads of studies who are saying that bay\u2019s should be exclusively BF till 6 months of age, then the recommendations of WHO is to BF till 2. There are all sorts of campaigns out there in support of BF. We go to a local clinic run by a lactation consultant. There is no law in UK to protect the mother and the BF baby. There is not fare for little babies to be forced off the breast in this way. If a mother decided to bottle feed her baby, no court in this country will tell her to BF the baby.",
