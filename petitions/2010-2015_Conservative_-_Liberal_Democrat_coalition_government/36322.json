        "additional_details": "There is no specific referendum demanding our withdrawal from the EU currently existing on the Government ePetition website.  There are many petitions which obfuscate about having referendums about in or out of the EU - and much else besides BUT NOTHING WHICH GIVES PETITIONERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIGN UP TO SPECIFICALLY DEMAND OUR WITHDRAWAL.  Let this petition be our referendum, an unequivocal message to David Cameron that we want nothing more to do with the corruption that is the EU.  If you want out of the EU, PUT YOUR NAME ON THIS PETITION.",
