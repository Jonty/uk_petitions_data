        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call upon The Secretary of State for Education to shelve proposals to delegate the removal of children from their parents away from local government.\r\n\r\n\u2022 We confirm the protection of children is core to the social work task.\r\n\r\n\u2022 We believe the duty to take a child away from their parents and family is a task which should always be held up to public scrutiny and political accountability.\r\n\r\n\u2022 We believe vulnerable children should be looked after by organisations which are regulated.\r\n\r\n\u2022 We believe the current stranglehold on local government finance is not the result of austerity measures but of a political mantra in England to reduce the role of the state.\r\n\r\n\u2022 As a profession we believe there is a strong and legitimate role for all sorts of providers of social work and children's services, but that the decisions about the future lives of vulnerable children must rest with the state and judiciary.\r\n",
