We would be much more competitive with the \u2018Richard Branson\u2019s\u2019 and \u2018Alan Sugar\u2019s\u2019 directing policy and using their influence/contacts.  At the moment it\u2019s not worth individual like this going into politics.\r\n\r\nFor example pay each MP \u00a32.5M+ per year, scrap expenses, and introduce percentage based bonus on project delivery, manifesto targets and increases in publics standard of living.\r\n\r\nI know that many people will reject the idea for ideological reasons but the \u2018cold hard fact\u2019 is that it would have a high probability of being much more cost effective that the current system.\r\n",
