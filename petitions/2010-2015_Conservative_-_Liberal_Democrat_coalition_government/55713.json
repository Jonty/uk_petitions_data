The present lack of provision protecting cohabiting couples upon relationship breakdown is unsatisfactory and unfair to them and their children;\r\n2. The law of intestacy needs reform to protect the position of those in cohabiting relationships when their partners die;\r\n3. The Law Commission\u2019s proposals are fair, proportionate and workable and would not in any sense undermine marriage or civil partnerships;\r\n4. Achieving fair arrangements for cohabiting couples on relationship breakdown and intestacy is a necessary part of creating a fair society.\r\n\r\n",
