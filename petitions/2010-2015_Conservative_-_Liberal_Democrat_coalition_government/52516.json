        "additional_details": "After watching Griff rease jones \"my father and the forgotten army\" I was shocked that there are no honours or memorials in the UK for thousands of west african and Indian troops that gave their life fighting for the british empire. An achievement that was stated as being one of the greatest most important campaigns of world war II. Why is this not taught in world war ii history at school as well. Please can this issu be looked at. ",
