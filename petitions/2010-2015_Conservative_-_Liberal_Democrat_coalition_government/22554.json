        "additional_details": "On the 22/9/1943 three British midget X class submarines carried out a raid on the German battleship Tirpitz.This resulted in the ship being severely disabled.The commanders of X6  and X7 were both awarded the Victoria Cross and survived the raid.However Lieutenant Henty-Creer  commander of X5 (killed on the raid) was not awarded a Victoria Cross.This was because there was no proof that he had reached the target,even though X6 and X7s commanders had sited his craft near Tirpitz.I feel that Lt Henty-Creer showed equal outstanding bravery and should be awarded a Victoria Cross posthumously.",
