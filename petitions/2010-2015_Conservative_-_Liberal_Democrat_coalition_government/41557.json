The result can be years of delay and severe hardship for spouses or children, even though they are meant to receive substantial amounts of money or property. Unless they can afford a barrister and go to court they are powerless.\r\nLet's change this so that execs can be fined, personally, if they fail to do their job in a timely fashion. Then create a hardship fund from the proceeds. ",
