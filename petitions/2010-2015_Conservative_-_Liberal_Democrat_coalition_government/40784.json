        "additional_details": "Given the furore at the Saville case and the subsequent cover-ups by the BBC, now is the time to withdraw the tv licence fee.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to financially back an institution that condones and protects paedophiles.\r\n\r\nI have long thought the licence fee is outdated, but this has just brought it to ahead.  The BBC also wastes vast sums of money on expenses for their highly paid excutives.\r\n\r\nThe programming on BBC extremely poor and very little worth watching.\r\n",
