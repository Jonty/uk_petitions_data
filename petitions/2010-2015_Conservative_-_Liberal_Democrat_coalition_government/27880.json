For example being followed, people that have been kidnapped and have got access to a phone but unable to ring, If somebody was being burgled and they are upstairs and burglers are downstairs, ringing police and speaking to them would probably be too loud.\r\n\r\nI personally think its a great idea and I'm sure people who have been victims of crime in a situation were they couldn't phone the police would rather have texted to ensure their safety.",
