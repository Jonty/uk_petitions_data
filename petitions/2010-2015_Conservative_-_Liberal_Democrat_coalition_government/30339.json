It is not necessary and would be a criminal waste of good existing radios. DAB is of a lower quality than current FM, and it often sounds like the studio is under water, with gurgling and bubbling !!\r\n\r\nWhile the government looks set to gain \u00a3billions of VAT from the sale of DAB replacement radios, and the sale of frequencies released, the radio listeners cannot afford it. Of course, our planet cannot afford this wastage either.\r\n\r\n",
