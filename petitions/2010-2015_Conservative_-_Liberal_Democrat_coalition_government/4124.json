        "additional_details": "We are calling on the Government to reconsider the decision to award the Thameslink contract, worth \u00a31.4billion, to the German company Siemens in preference to the Bombardier factory in Derby.  It is still not too late to reverse the decision and safeguard at least 3,000 British jobs, with 1,400 at Bombardier and thousands more with their suppliers.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, call on the Government to reopen the Thameslink Rolling Stock Procurement Programme (TRSPP) tendering process. We also believe that, in line with other EU countries who prioritise their own national interests, the British Government should take into account the social and economic impact on British workers and their families when awarding contracts.",
