Increase bands by a percentage that is similar to national annual pay increases so that housing remains affordable.\r\n\r\nScrap schemes to help 1st time buyers as affordable housing would now be available and use the funds to pay off negative equity on mortgages caused by the change. This would also take pressure off of those with mortgages that are reduced by this thus allowing them to spend more of their money and help to drive the local economies forward.",
