        "additional_details": "This winter has seen hundreds of animals trapped and put at risk due to flood waters. This in turn has placed huge pressure on various agencies and charities. In turn many people have put their lives at risk trying to rescue and deal with the situation. If flood plains were not allowed to be used for grazing during the most hazardous months, the risk to welfare of animals and humans alike would be greatly reduced. Local councils should have the powers to stop these fields from use, and ensure that\r\nowners of any animals within the danger zones remove them to higher ground or a place of safety before flooding happens.",
