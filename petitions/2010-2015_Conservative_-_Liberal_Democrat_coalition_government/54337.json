In 2006, The Lancet Journal estimated 654,965 Iraqi deaths related to the war, of which 81,000 were innocent children.\r\nIn 2010, Whitehall released figures estimating the cost of British funding of the Iraq conflict at \u00a39.24bn, and worst of all it cost the lives of 139 British troops.\r\n\r\n10 years later, we are being forced to do with Syria.\r\n\r\nWhy we shouldn\u2019t go to war:\r\n\r\n500,000 the loss of innocent civilians\u2019 lives (500X more than the current lives lost)\r\nWar with Syria will naturally lead us to war with Iran\r\nSyrian Rebels have in the past used chemical weapons on civilians with the help of outside intervention and not the Syrian government\r\nWar with Syria will cost the UK tax payer excess of \u00a310bn & the lives of more British troops\r\nIn 1988 CIA helped Saddam Hussein carry out chemical weapons attack on Iran\r\n\r\n75% of Brits do not want war or blood of innocent people on the hands of our nation & risk the lives of more British troops.",
