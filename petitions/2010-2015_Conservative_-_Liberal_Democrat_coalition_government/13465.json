        "additional_details": "HMT is putting up money from it's reserves to help businesses get up and running following the recent riots.\r\n\r\nWhy should the tax payer pay for the repairs? Why should innocent business owners have to pay higher insurance premiums as a result of making a claim?\r\n\r\nAs well as convicted rioters loosing their benefits, the courts should also order them to pay a substantial amount towards the repairs plus the retail cost of the goods they stole. This money can be recovered through PAYE in the same way tax is collected and student loan deductions are taken from our salaries each month.\r\n\r\nBy linking it to individuals national insurance number, they can pay it off as a % of their earnings. It also means young offenders will pay once they start earning.\r\n\r\nAlthough HMT is still paying right now, at least some of this cost can be recovered and put to good use elsewhere. ",
