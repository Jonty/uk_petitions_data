        "additional_details": "We, the residents and supporters of Slade Green, urge Bexley Council to reconsider their decision to award the running of the new Community Facilities in Slade Green to an outside provider from Lewisham, not from Slade Green.\r\nSlade Green has a local group, Howbury Friends, who applied to run the centre, who have the full backing of this community. Our understanding was that this process was to ensure the local community would be running the facilities. The proposal put forward by \"our \" preferred bidder had the community very much at heart. To ensure that the new facility provides for the community well into the future, we need to have a group that knows us, and that we know and trust.",
