        "additional_details": "Sex Education in the UK requires an overhaul. The education received tells nothing of issues such as the issues involved in LGBTQA+ rights, feminism, abuse, disability, sexism, bullying, rape, and so forth. It basically says that a penis goes into a vagina, and you have to wear a condom and take birth control, or you will get STI's/pregnant. This, I believe, is unacceptable, ignorant, and below the standard of education that we should be providing for teenagers.",
