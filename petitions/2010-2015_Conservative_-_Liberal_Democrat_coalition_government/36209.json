At the moment it is up to the employer to decide whether it is will be unpaid or not. This also begins to blur when you ask for time off to attend for example your child's assembly. As we are encouraging stronger family values in society, this law needs revisiting and revising to reflect values and commitment so working parents/carers do have the right and with pay to be a part of key moments in their children's lives without the fear of no from their employers.",
