        "additional_details": "75% of Britons aren\u2019t getting a decent night\u2019s sleep and the consequences are disastrous. The nation\u2019s health and well-being is suffering. 10% of us are now classed as insomniacs and 10 million NHS prescriptions are issued every year for drugs to get us to sleep.\r\n\r\nProductivity in the workplace is suffering - we work the third longest hours in Europe, but each year sickness absence costs British industry an estimated \u00a3100bn.  Everyone deserves a good night\u2019s sleep and a good bed can help.\r\n\r\n47% of us admit that we need to change our beds and mattresses but even though we know sleep is important, in this tough and worrying economic climate, we put it off.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s support British manufacturing, jobs and workers.  Let\u2019s make Britain bright eyed and bushy-tailed once more.  Let\u2019s make it easier for everyone to get the sound night\u2019s sleep they deserve.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we petition the UK Government to abstain from collecting VAT on all beds and mattresses.\r\n",
