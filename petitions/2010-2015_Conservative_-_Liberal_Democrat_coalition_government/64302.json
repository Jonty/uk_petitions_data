        "additional_details": "Term time holiday fines are almost unique in that they are the only fine which cannot be appealed in order for a further independant review of the fine to take place. The County Councils indicate they will not over rule a headteacher in their decision to refuse term time leave, or to report a parent to be fined.\r\nQuoting an encyclopedia source.....\r\n'In de novo appeals, a new decision maker re-hears the case without any reference to the prior decision maker. In appeals on the record, the decision of the prior decision maker is challenged by arguing that he or she misapplied the law, came to an incorrect factual finding, acted in excess of his jurisdiction, abused his powers, was biased, considered evidence which he should not have considered, or failed to consider evidence that he should have considered.'\r\n\r\nSign this petition if you believe parents should have the right to appeal term time holiday fines in order to create a more accountable and democratic process.",
