        "additional_details": "The North West has 6.8 million people, more than Scotland but has no real power  to govern itself. What I want is a system of Regional Assemblies with taxation powers such  as local Corporation tax levels and other budgetry powers. As well as powers over local budgets, they should be able to give businesses loans/grants like the Scotish Parliament does with Scotish Enterprise. This would kickstart the local economies.\r\n It would be based on the Lander states of Germany",
