        "action": "Allow any school to teach Intelligent Design as a valid world view within the scientific discipline.",
        "additional_details": "In the UK we allow for differing views, cultures & ideologies of fellow citizens whilst holding fast to the common values of peace, respect & understanding. Sadly these values are being eroded when it comes to a belief in Almighty God as Creator of the earth & all life upon it. Intelligent Design as a valid worldview is no longer tolerated by our Government in any scientific context within our schools. This is a denial of Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights & our nations heritage. Neither Intelligent Design nor The Theory of Evolution provides empirical evidence within a lab. They are differing interpretations of facts & are both accepted upon the basis of faith according to a persons chosen interpretation. Therefore we the undersigned petition Her Majesty's Government to allow any school, academy or Free School to discuss or teach Intelligent Design as a valid world view within the scientific, philosophical, social & religious disciplines should they desire to do so.",
