        "additional_details": "We the undersigned demand that the Department of Health does not downgrade the role of Chief Nursing Officer to two rungs below the role of Chief Medical Officer. Not only does this go against clear promises made by Health Minister Anne Milton, but downgrading the role sends a clear message to nurses that their contribution to the health & well being of this nation is undervalued. The role of nurses is becoming ever more important and given what we know about the health of the nation the role of nurses will only become more important. We call on Anne Milton to keep her promise and Health Secretary Andrew Lansley to ensure that the voice of nurses is heard at the very highest level by maintaining the role of CNO on par with the CMO role and permanent secretary to the department.",
