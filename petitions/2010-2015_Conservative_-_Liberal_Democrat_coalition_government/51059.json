        "additional_details": "many council homes were sold to hardworking people and it appears that you are praying on the vulnerable to get back houses on the 'buy back scheme'. Many people who have found themselves out of work due to the economy and have handed over their homes to you as you will only help them for two years. Whereas council tenents in the same boat get housing benefit. This is wrong when alot of mortgages are less than the housing benefit. Not all those on benefits get a free ride. Mortgage interrest is taken from their allowance I.e. j.s.a and after working up until 2 years ago I paid my taxs so should be entitled to help. Evidence of contunuous knock backs from employers is available. Right to buy should be abolished and more help given to help hard working people keep their homes.",
