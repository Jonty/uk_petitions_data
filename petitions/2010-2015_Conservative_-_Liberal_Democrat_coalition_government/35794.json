Richard Hagen and Tom Kibble have revolutionised our understanding of the fundamental forces of nature, as demonstrated correct by the recent announcements of a Higgs boson candidate from CERN.\r\n\r\nFor their contribution to science and humanity, I propose that they all be given knighthoods. Only Higgs and Kibble are British citizens, thus I propose that the other surviving theorists be given KBEs.\r\n\r\n(Brout passed away in 2011; perhaps he could be given a posthumous recognition of some sort.)",
