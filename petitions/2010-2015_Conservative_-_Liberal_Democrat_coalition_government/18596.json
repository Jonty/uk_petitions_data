However this should at least be in line with the Army or Police force, instead of being increased.\r\n\r\nI propose three things to be debated:\r\n\r\n1) The amount of international aid remains static until 2015.\r\n2) International aid is cut by the same percentage as the Armed forces.\r\n3) International aid is cut by the same percentage as the police force.\r\n\r\n",
