        "additional_details": "I have created this petition to make the effort to make living easier for animals, I have found many people have come to the conclusion that with so many people out there getting what really matters to them heard is almost impossible.\r\n\r\nI don't see it in that way, I see life as many people with goals and with these goals and the correct intentions they will really make a difference.\r\n\r\nThe point of this potation is not to stop animal slaughter but to make it more bearable for the animals by:\r\n\r\n- Having regular checks on UK slaughter houses throughout the year\r\n\r\n- 24 hour CCTV footage of everything inside the slaughter houses\r\n\r\n- Improving the conditions that these animals must live in.\r\n\r\nI don't think anything should deserved to suffer especially in todays modern society as it's just not necessary anymore. Its our responsibility to make a change so I really hope you agree with this potation and sign it to improve the lives of many animals.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading. ",
