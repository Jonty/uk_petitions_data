These people have not spent their enough of their life with those of us that are not so privileged and so run a country that benefits themselves and not the majority. It is foolish to believe that these people are really more intelligent than our comprehensive school educated people and it is becoming more apparent that these people get into these positions due to the school they go to as opposed to their ability to serve the country. Now we are in the 21st century, education has improved and we expect a government that reflects this by ensuring that those educated in comprehensive schools have a greater representation in government, in line with the proportion of people that are educated at them.
