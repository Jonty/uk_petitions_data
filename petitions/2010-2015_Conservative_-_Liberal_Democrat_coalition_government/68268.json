        "additional_details": "This is to have \"Biker\" made into a recognised religion. To be able to have the right to wear a crash helmet wherever you like without discrimination. We as bikers should be allowed to wear what we want, where we want. This will also help to combat the EU madmen who want to force us to live by their rules and wear what they want us to wear.... This is about freedom of choice, freedom to be a biker, coz that's what being a biker is all about... Freedom. Other religions have that freedom, so why not us? Also, Well, next time ya get ya census forms through the post, put biker as your religion and if enough bikers do that, it will become a recognised religion within the UK... Garages couldn't do now't about it then seriously, do it",
