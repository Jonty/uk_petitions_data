        "additional_details": "It has been reported by Danish journalist Mikkel Jensen that there has been widespread \"cleansing\" of the streets in Brazilian cities by authorities murdering street children at night and then disposing of the bodies. Whole areas near World Cup venues have been \"cleaned up\" in this manner.\r\nThe Government must force the FA to re-call the England team at once and take other appropriate action in terms of a total boycott of the competition such as a ban on screening in the UK of any of the competitions fixtures.\r\nFurthermore, an explanation from the Brazilian government regarding these claims should be sought and trade sanctions should be imposed.\r\nThere is little time remaining to act on this atrocious situation which is equal to any human rights atrocity committed anywhere in the world.
