        "additional_details": "We the public call on Mr Cameron and his central Government to stop vilifying the disabled and using derogatory remarks such as benefit cheat and/or Scrounger. We call on this Government to be mindful of the damage these and other such words can do to the disabled, and many of which feel hatred is being incited against them, and indeed the general public do pick up on these remarks and use them in the street. It is also most unfair to use such terms against a population that in the main want to work and many do just that. We call on this Government and the Media to backtrack on such despicable remarks and publish a front page apology to those that have been so cruelly treated by such remarks. Only that will restore the trust that this Government has lost in such a short space of time amongst the disabled population.",
