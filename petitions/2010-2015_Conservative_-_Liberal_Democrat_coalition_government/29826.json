        "additional_details": "it is proposed that children in primary schools should not be asked to work on \"targets\" but on  \"learning objectives\" or \"specifications\". The word target is defined both \"as an object to shoot at\" or a \"person against whom unfriendly comment or behaviour is directed\". Language shapes thinking and it is unacceptable to continue using a word with negative interpretation when educating children.  It is time to start using positive thinking and positive terminology in schools using a top-down approach if necessary. A top-down approach involves training educators first.",
