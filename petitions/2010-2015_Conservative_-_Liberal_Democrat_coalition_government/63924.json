        "additional_details": "BAN HALAL AND KOSHER SLAUGHTER IN THE UK\r\n\r\nResponsible department: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\r\n\r\nUnder UK law, all farmed animals have to be stunned to render them unconscious before slaughter. However, a special legal exemption (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/731/contents/made#sdiv12) which applies ONLY to Halal and Kosher slaughter, means that animals slaughtered, \u201cby a religious method\u201d for halal or kosher meat - are exempt. We believe that on animal cruelty grounds, that this exemption should be removed. This not racist, is not anti Muslim or anti Jewish. It  concerns unimaginable animal cruelty in the UK.\r\nAnimals slaughtered by the above method suffer prolonged  painful and cruel deaths, after their throat is cut they are left to bleed to death whilst still fully concious and in unimaginable pain . Please watch the video at www.liveleak.com/view?i=703_1309045039 and then decide if you should sign this petition and then PLEASE pass it on!",
