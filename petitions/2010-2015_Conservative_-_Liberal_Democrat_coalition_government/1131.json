        "additional_details": "Many British people work overseas, often for long periods. During their overseas stay they may marry and start families.\r\nI am suggesting, that if either the Husband or the Wife is British, the family as a whole, should have the right to return and remain in the United Kingdom, unless there is a clear indication of a threat to the UK or some other criminal intent.\r\nIndividuals who leave the UK for work do so with the intent to improve their lives. Often they will remain overseas, but some through unforeseen circumstances may have no option but to return. Currently these people face their families being broken up by the fact that their families are not permitted to enter the UK with them unhindered.",
