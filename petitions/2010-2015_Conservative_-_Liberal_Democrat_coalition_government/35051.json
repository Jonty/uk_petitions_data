        "additional_details": "Shared custody of children for  separated parents means that  neither parent is carrying the entire burden of parenting while the other is considered absent. It means that Children Have Two Homes, two stable bases where they can feel secure. It means they continue to have a real family life with both parents, which makes them feel more loved.\r\n\r\nResearch has determined that even when there\u2019s strong animosity between the parents, shared custody works well for the children and has been shown to be much better for the long term emotional and mental well being of children.\r\n\r\nAt present, shared custody is not the norm in Britain. This Petition asks the Government to pass legislation that unless there are compelling reasons against it which have been certified as such by a family court, then shared custody of children should be the norm when their parents separate unless one parent opts out.\r\n\r\n",
