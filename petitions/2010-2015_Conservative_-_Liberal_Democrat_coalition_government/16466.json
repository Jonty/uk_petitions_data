        "additional_details": "The City of Liverpool Cruise Liner Terminal is currently being considered for full \"Turnaround\" facilities. This means that instead of major cruise ships and ocean liners just visiting the city at Pier Head they can start and finish their cruises there.\r\n\r\nThis would be a major boost Liverpool and the North West's economy. In times when public money is short and there is a need for new jobs this would be of great value to Liverpool and the North West where public funding cuts will hurt more than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis petition hereby calls upon the DfT to conclude that Liverpool's plan is sustainable and worthy of approval. It also calls upon the opposition to the Turnaround facilities to recognise Liverpool's historical importance to the industry and that it is in everyone's interest not to allow a monopoly to exist in Southampton.",
