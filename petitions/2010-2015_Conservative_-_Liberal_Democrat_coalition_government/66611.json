        "action": "Abolish Private Prisons",
        "additional_details": "Private prisons cannot rehabilitate inmates to make them better for society as prisons are supposed to.\r\nPrivate prisons will always put profit over social good. This explains the overcrowding of private prisons: HMP Doncaster has 50% more prisoners than it can accommodate. Profit is being made at the expense of prisoners' health and wellbeing.  This is systematic exploitation to fund a private system. In America, occupancy guarantee clauses in private prisons lie at 90%, with American prisons bringing in $3billion in revenue annually, over half of that comes from holding facilities.\r\nWithout resistance, more private prisons will be introduced: this fundamentally undermines welfare principles of the UK.\r\nSign this petition to enhance justice in UK society by abolishing a prison system fuelled by capitalist gains. Prisons in the UK must be nationalised to avoid further exploitation.\r\n",
