        "additional_details": "With the seemingly endless stream of e-petitions which attempt to make the government force travel companies to operate a loss making business, in order to subsidise people with children to go on holiday to their preferred destinations at the peak of summer, I wish to see some balance.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evidently supply and demand, one of the foundations of business. It may surprise some of these petition signers that some places are actually more expensive in winter, outwith school holidays - but then why would they have a reasoned thought process before jumping on the bandwagon with a couple of clicks.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you think these people are time wasters and companies should be allowed to charge as they see fit for a luxury product in a competitive marketplace.",
