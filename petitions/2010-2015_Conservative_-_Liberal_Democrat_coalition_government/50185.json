        "additional_details": "Pinewood Studios is a major British film studio close to London that has recently had a \u00a3200m expansion plan turned down by its local council. It's been predicted that these plans would lead to 3,000+ new jobs being created and \u00a3150m a year for the UK economy. Entertainment in the form of Film and Television is one of the UKs leading exports and investment in Pinewood would increase production and quality of British entertainment.The \u00a3200m is a private investment so would be at no cost to tax payers but could lead to countless benefits.
