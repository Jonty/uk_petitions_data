        "additional_details": "Please could you sign this petition if you agree that urgent action needs to be taken with regards to the speeding cars around the roundabout on the B2177 from Cosham to Southwick. Cars are coming from far afield jst to drift around this roundabout, causing lots of late night noise and skid marks on the road. It would not work with a speed limit as this too would be ignored, it would require anti-skid caoting or traffic calming measures. It is only a matter of time before someone gets hurt - I dont want it to my family - do you?",
