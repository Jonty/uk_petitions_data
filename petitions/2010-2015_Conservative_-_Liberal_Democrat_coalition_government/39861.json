        "additional_details": "Enough is enough.  A person who abducts, sexually assaults and murders a child should face a mandatory death penalty. Currently they face sentences of differing lengths living a life of relative luxury in prison, costing us the Taxpayers approximately \u00a330,000 each per year (MOJ figures for 2010/11). The death penalty may serve as a deterrent, but even if it does not these people do not deserve to live. I believe that the majority of people in Britain support this view and politicians should not be allowed to ignore them any longer. The Government should support a Bill to reintroduce the death penalty for these crimes.",
