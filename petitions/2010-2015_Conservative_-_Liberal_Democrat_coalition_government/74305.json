This description is untrue and has been foisted on local residents and boat owners by an unelected and unaccountable body.\r\n\r\nThe Broads Authority receives nearly half its income in River Toll receipts. We demand that DEFRA ensures this is more closely reflected in toll payers\u2019 representation on Authority. Toll payers should elect their representation on the Authority.\r\n\r\nWe request DEFRA institute an independent review of local residents\u2019 representation on the Broads Authority.\r\n\r\nDEFRA should instruct the Broads Authority to enable public access to the entire Broads network.\r\n\r\nThe Broads are the only location in the UK where specialist inland craft have developed in any number. DEFRA should instruct the navigation authority to recognise our unique maritime heritage\r\n",
