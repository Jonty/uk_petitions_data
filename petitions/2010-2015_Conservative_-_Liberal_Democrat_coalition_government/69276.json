        "additional_details": "A group of passionate youth are currently campaigning for a Political Awareness to be introduced into secondary curriculum. Through surveys we have discovered that most adolescents are uneducated about politics, therefore we think it is important for them to know about politics before they are of age to vote. Furthermore, most young people do not know how or why to vote, which constitutes a lack of interest not only in voting but politics as a whole. Moreover we think it is important for young people to use their voice since we (young adolescents) are to lead the future generations.",
