Adequate HMG funding for administration costs before & during an election campaign of political parties should be in proportion to the number of votes they have received in the last general election. Donors and lenders (even at commercial rate of interests) to political parties can be suspected having the hidden agendas of receiving certain favours in return. Political parties can also be looked upon with suspicion, with endless speculation as to their real motives for some of their policies, as well as speculations about possible conflicts of interests. Funds received by political parties from donors and lenders should not collectively be from certain specified interest groups (like the TUC or CBI) and any loans, donations received by political parties should be declared & published to the public.
