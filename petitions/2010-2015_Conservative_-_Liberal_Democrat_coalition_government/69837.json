        "additional_details": "The Scottish Independence Referendum showed how a large portion of the population can become energised by the potential of having a greater stake in the issues that affect them. The centralised nature of decision making within the UK is outdated. Each area has different advantages to be capitalised on and specific needs to be addressed. It would benefit most citizens if the UK had a written Federal constitution, divided into states each with a constitution of their own, with each state responsible for most its own tax and the policies it spends those taxes on. Certain issues including foreign policy and defence would remain the responsibility of the Federal Government. ",
