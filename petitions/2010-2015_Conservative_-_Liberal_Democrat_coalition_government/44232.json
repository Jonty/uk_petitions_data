We feel  The Government and Parliament should set an example and apply the same hardships to themselves as they are asking of the rest of us.\r\nWe call upon this Government cut MPs Pay back to 2002 levels in line with cuts in the public sector, freeze MPs pay for the duration of this Parliament, abolish MPs Allowances, and apply the same redundancy terms to MPs loosing their seats as are applied to the majority of workers loosing their jobs through no fault of their own.
