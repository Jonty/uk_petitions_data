        "additional_details": "A petition calling on HM Government to review cuts of 20% to the policing budget, and the proposed introduction of Police and Crime Commissioners. The recent disturbances across England have highlighted just how much the police are needed, particularly with the 2012 Olympic Games and events being held across the UK.\r\n\r\nWe feel that cuts of 20% to the policing budget could \u00a0damage public confidence in the police service, could delay response times, and will have an impact on levels of crime as there would be 12,000 fewer front line police officers to investigate crimes.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we call upon the government to authorise a royal commission into policing, which would mean a fully independent commission which would set out the best way for a fully effective police service that is fit for purpose. This is not a party political point scoring issue, it is a matter of national importance and security.",
