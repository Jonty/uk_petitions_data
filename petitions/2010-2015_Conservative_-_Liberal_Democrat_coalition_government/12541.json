Also No.71 which serves part of Bradley Stoke South.\r\n\r\nThese services are being replaced with two new services which are designed to serve very few of the residents in Bradley Stoke South.\r\n\r\nThe residents of Bradley Stoke South want the No.72 to be retained at peak times, and re-organised in non-peak times, so that local residents who are reliant on bus transport are not cut off from work, shops, doctors, hospitals etc.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bradleystokejournal.co.uk/2011/08/12/bus-changes-bad-news-south-town/#respond",
