It is a massive waste of tax payers money.\r\n\r\nThere is however, an alternative that the government wilfully overlooked in spite of the weight of common sense and logic, which is the Ultraspeed mag-lev system.\r\n\r\nThis system has the following benefits over HS2:\r\n\r\n1)Quieter (no track contact, little to no noise)\r\n\r\n2)Faster (London to Birmingham in 20 minutes)\r\n\r\n3)No need to build track through untouched areas of the land( the track can be built alongside or above existing road. The 'engine' is the track itself, so it can follow the contours of the land).\r\n\r\n4) Lower future maintenance costs (the train does not make contact with the track)\r\n\r\n5) More economically friendly, for this apparent 'green government'.\r\n\r\n6) Costs less to implement.\r\n\r\nMore details can be seen here:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Ultraspeed\r\n",
