        "additional_details": "Currently the National Minimum wage is the same regardless of the time of day or night you work.\r\n\r\nPeople who work night shifts are regularly paid a premium on top of a companies normal wage but for many this is not the case.  Since the introduction of the NMW (which was a good thing in general, though it does require some revisions) many night shift workers are no longer paid a premium for working at night but are paid the national minimum wage.\r\n\r\nStaff who work night shift should receive a higher NMW by law.\r\n\r\nI propose that workers who work between the hours of  midnight and six o'clock in the morning are paid a mandatory extra \u00a32 per hour above the current national minimum wage.",
