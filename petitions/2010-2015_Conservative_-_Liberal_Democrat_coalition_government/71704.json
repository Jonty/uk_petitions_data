This is a tax YOUR CHILDREN are paying long before they are working. What message does this send them? 'Strive to do your very best, but not too hard.'.\r\n\r\nCurrently, ALL families with a Higher Rate Tax Payer (HRT) will lose some/all of their CB, with no consideration of that family's circumstances. However, other families, with incomes up to \u00a3100k will keep all their CB so long as they have no HRTs. The existence of a HRT in a family is insufficient evidence to base that family's needs upon.\r\n\r\nMany minority groups have been affected, for example, single parents, stay at home parents, disabled parents who cannot work etc.\r\n\r\nThese are not the people with the broadest shoulders, that the government say must carry the biggest burden.",
