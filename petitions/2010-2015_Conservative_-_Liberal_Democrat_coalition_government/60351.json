        "additional_details": "I want this government to get rid of  jokes about adopted people on the television, they are not funny and they are rude and insulting. They are usually at the end of scenes in a show where something has gone wrong for the kid then it is added as a sort of 'as if things couldn't get any worse' joke, \"Oh by the way you're adopted\". Outright racist jokes aren't allowed and neither are ones about disability or likewise issues so why should people who just happen (through no fault of their own) to be adopted have to be joked about, it's sick and disgusting. Would you want to be ridiculed because of something as petty as that? No, I guess not, so government, if you do ANYTHING for the people then stop comedians putting jokes about adopted people on T.V.",
