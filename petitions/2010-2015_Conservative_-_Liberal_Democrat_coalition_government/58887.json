        "additional_details": "Thankfully childhood cancers are relatively uncommon. Although this is a good thing, it is also a reason why for some types there are no established initial treatment protocols or protocols for cancers that have relapsed or have not responded to initial treatment. For these children, quite often their only hope is to self fund treatment in clinical trials abroad which can cost tens and hundreds of thousands of pounds and families find themselves desperately trying to fund raise. No family should have to beg for the life of their child, each child should receive full funding for enrolment onto high quality clinical trials abroad and bring us in line with other European countries.
