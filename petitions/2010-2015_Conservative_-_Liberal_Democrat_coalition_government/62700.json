        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned call on Government to rethink its decision to scrap the \u00a3347 million Local Welfare Assistance fund. This fund is used by councils to provide emergency support. Its removal will make it increasingly difficult to help vulnerable people facing short-term crises, as well as place an enormous strain on third sector organisations in local communities who exist to help those in need.",
