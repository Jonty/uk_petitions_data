        "additional_details": "With the number of Childrens Home victims rising into the thousands, would it not be acceptable to state that because we were meant to have been cared for whilst placed in these Government residencies, that the Government could pay a small Support Allowance to allow victims a slight chance of bettering their lives due to the enormous effects these places had on us. Many children relied upon the Government for care and support and in many proven cases, the Government failed in its duties to provide that support.",
