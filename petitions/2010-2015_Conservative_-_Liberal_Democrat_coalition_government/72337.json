Mental health services are at breaking point with cuts to services and budgets people are needlessly suffering and getting to the point of crisis or worse before action is taken. Preventative and community services need to be improved and given an increased budget to prevent so many people getting to the point of crisis. Crisis teams need to be more readily accessible and fit for purpose which at the moment they are not. More beds and better guidelines need to be put in place to protect and improve inpatient care. Regular checks need to be made to ensure these standards are being met and patients need to have more access to advocates for when things are going wrong. These things need to change now this mental health service is no longer fit for purpose and is putting people's lives at risk.  ",
