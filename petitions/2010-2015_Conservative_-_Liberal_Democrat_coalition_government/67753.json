        "additional_details": "This petition is to gauge the opinion of the residents of Seaham on the proposed banning of dogs from Seaham beaches from April 1st to September 31st annually starting from 2015. We feel that this is unfair to elderly residents and locals in general as they willl be forced to walk from Seaham to the hall car park end of the beach before they can exercise their pet. This would not stop the dog fouling problem in and around the beach area and we feel it is a knee jerk easy option to impose a ban instead of addressing the real issue of irresponsible dog owners.",
