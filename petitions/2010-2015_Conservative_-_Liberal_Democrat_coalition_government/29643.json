        "additional_details": "Baroness Warsi has demanded (14th February 2012) that religion must be given a greater role in public life.  A democratically elected government must be autonomous from any and all religious groups and affiliations in order to promote tolerance between religious groups within society and to protect non-religious members of society from persecution.  An individual's beliefs (religious or non-religious) must be protected by central government - this can only be achieved where state and religion are entirely separate.  Government-backed promotion of religion in the public arena is also entirely contrary to the democratic system.  A firm rejection by the government to this restricting and repressive demand is required.  As an act of respect to all of the citizens of Great Britain and to prove the government as a fair and resolute advocate of democracy, the government should finalise the separation of state from religion in the form of legislation.",
