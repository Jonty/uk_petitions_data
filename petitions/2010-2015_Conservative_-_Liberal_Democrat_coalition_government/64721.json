        "additional_details": "The undersigned oppose changes to NHS funding formulas which threaten to close St Katharine Docks Practice of Dr Sarit Patel in E1W 1UA. The funding cuts mean patients in greatest need will be left with diminished or no access to health services. The situation will be exacerbated when 1800 homes planned for London Dock adjacent to Dr Patel's practice are built.\r\n\r\nDr Patel's practice is a model of NHS England's policy of moving the focus to GPs as the access point to the NHS. He meets or exceeds targets for all key indicators. He exercises exemplary patient care, achieving a 91% plus approval rating in a recent patient survey.\r\n\r\nWe call upon Health Officials & Politicians to recognise the damage that the funding cuts are causing for Dr Patel\u2019s Surgery and the huge concerns that the threat of closure has caused to patients. We urge you to take immediate action to restore funding to a level with allows Dr Patel to continue providing the necessary level of health care to his patients. ",
