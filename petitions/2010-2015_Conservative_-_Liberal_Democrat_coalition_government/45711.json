HLS has been the subject of much controversy in the past and has been investigated by many animal rights organisations for their shocking treatment of animals and their unnecessary testing.\r\n\r\nThese beagles can be successfully rehomed - they are used extensively for testing because of their gentle and willing natures.\r\n\r\nPlease allow action to be taken to ensure that these beagles are not sent to further testing laboratories to live out their lives in tiny cages undergoing even more cruel testing. Let them be put up for adoption by one of the many caring animal rescue organisations in the UK.",
