        "action": "No to UK leaving EU as it will have dire consequences in collaborative scientific research and other projects, as well as economically, socially, etc",
        "additional_details": "The advantages of UK being part of the EU includes (1) Being part of an economic blog whereby trade restrictions are minimal (2) Mobile pool of workers with few restrictions in working in another EU countries, thus solving labour storage in some areas (3) EU countries using their combined economic and political influence to espouse their case/position and objectives to the rest of the world (4) Strengthening a common shared European cultural identity and prevent wars amongst EU nations (5) Easier travelling in the EU by EU citizens (6) Facilitates collaborative ventures in expensive projects (like airbus, research, building, transport links, etc). For example \u2018Galileo\u2019 (Europe\u2019s version of GPS) will be operational by 2013. Many of the 30 UK built Galileo satellites are already launched by the European Space Agency. However it is good that UK currently opted out of EU foreign policy, security, taxation, defence, immigration control and the Euro monetary currency.",
