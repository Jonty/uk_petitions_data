        "additional_details": "We are currently experiencing high volumes of traffic through our small village in South Staffordshire due to motorway engineering works between Junctions 12 and 13 of the M6.\r\nNot only does the volume increase during the day but extremely so at nighttime when more work is being carried out.\r\nThe main road through our village is a 30mph single carriageway and residents are becoming increasingly annoyed with this due to its convenience for the highways agency as our village is right in the middle of these junctions. Constant flows of traffic are interspersed with air brakes, horns, accelerating and decelerating whilst approaching junctions and islands.\r\nWhilst other areas of motorway are changed into contraflow, M6 junction 12-13 gets diverted and this needs to stop for the residents that live on the main road and in the village",
