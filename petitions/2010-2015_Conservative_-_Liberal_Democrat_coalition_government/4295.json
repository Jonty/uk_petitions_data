        "additional_details": "The payment of 42 pence per unit for energy generated by solar power is an absurd waste of money and an effort for the government to appear to be \"doing something\" about green issues.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be a scientific and economic review of these tariffs.\r\n\r\nThis is not an anti-green petition it is a petition to ensure that there is scientific and economic evidence to back up the provision of a feed in tariff. We as a country should pursue renewable energy sources that our educated experts believe are viable and not create these policies to entice green voters.\r\n\r\nIf our experts decide that an energy source is viable then we should pursue it but the propping up of energy sources that are never going to reach a level that can sustain us is madness.\r\n\r\nLot's of companies are getting rich off the back of this solar feed in tariff from tax payers money. Could the government have a qualified person check if this is a good idea? As you do not seem to have done so yet.\r\n",
