        "additional_details": "Put a reasonable cap on the profit that companies can make per customer e.g 15%. Energy pricing in the UK is not competative and is more like a cartel. The public are seeing continuous rises due to cost incurred by the companies but don't see any reduction when companies get their fuel cheaper, this is unfair as these companies are making very high profits per customer. They should also make available to their customers how much fuel they buy and the price at the time, how much profit they will make from the fuel once their running cost are deducted so the public can see if the company can justify the price they charge. If an agreement can't be met then they should be nationalised so the excessive profit can at least go back into the public purse.",
