Five year elections provide no real accountability from MPs and Ministers hide in their ivory towers and ignore the public.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the government to implement minimum standards of service from MPs and Ministers in response to enquiries from the public.  MP's accountability is limited to constituents but Ministers must account to any British citizen.\r\n\r\nAn integral part of these standards is a complaints system with the power to implement meaningful sanctions.against the MP or Minister personally.",
