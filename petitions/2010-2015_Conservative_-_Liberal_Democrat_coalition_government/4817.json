        "additional_details": "We live in a modern multicultural society, faith is very important to many people within it. However many people do not stop to think about our states attitude towards religion. Although we think of ourselves as a secular society our head of state is still head of the church of England, we still reserves spaces on the benches at the house of lords for bishops. The government and the law look the other way on many issues in respect to religion from equal employment rights, stirring up hatred in communities, teaching false science to children and most recently changing the law to protect people harbouring peadophiles.\r\n\r\nThis is not a petition agaisnt religion, it is simply one stating that religion should not be above the law.",
