        "additional_details": "Static car cruises (or Static car meets) are designed to allow car enthusiasts to show off their vehicles and meet other enthusiasts who share the same interests. However, recently these events have been associated with lunatics with no care or concern for other motorists on the road, and the Police aim to close down many of these events.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that without these static events, there will be fewer places for car enthusiasts to go, and could result in more illegal racing racing taking place on public roads.\r\n\r\nMy aim is to raise awareness of this problem and to show the public that we don't want to drive in an antisocial manner, nor do we want to endanger other motorists or pedestrians. We simply want to create social events in local car parks for car enthusiasts to show off their cars and all the hard work, money, effort and dedication they put into them.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition!\r\nThanks for the support\r\n",
