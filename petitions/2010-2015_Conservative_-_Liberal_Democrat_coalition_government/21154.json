        "additional_details": "Television programmes have shown us that when illegal immigrants/illegal workers have been caught by the Border Agency, many are released on bail and later abscond. Therefore, these people should never be released on bail. A new detention facility should be built in the Falkland Islands to detain up to a maximum of 10,000 people who cannot be returned to their country of origin, or whilst awaiting asylum decisions. This would also place many illegals outside European Human Rights laws which are often abused and should not be used by non-EU citizens. A detention facility on the Falkland Islands would also create work for people local to those Isles and for UK security companies during transportation. It would also discourage people who know that they would be released on Bail because there are not enough places in UK detention facilities.",
