        "additional_details": "The Government are going to break up the Forestry Commission and bring about the destruction of this much respected cross border organisation. Why are they doing this? They say it is the right time and it fits neatly with the new policy they introduced in January 2013.  We believe the FC should continue in its evolution, which it is has been doing successfuly since 1919. It's true we need some minor changes to the Forestry Act and we realise that we need to work differently to meet future challenges and opportunities.\r\nMuch of the success of the FC is due to highly motivated, professional and vocationaly driven staff.  By breaking the FC apart we could damage that commitment from staff in the replacement organisations leading to a decline in public benefits as a result.  We call on the Government to halt this process and commit to maintaining a fully integrated and sustainably resourced FC for another 100 years.",
