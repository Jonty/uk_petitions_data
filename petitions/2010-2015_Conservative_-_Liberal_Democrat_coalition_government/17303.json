        "additional_details": "This is a suggestion for a remedial alternative for people facing the loss of their driving licence, and who then make it clear that they need to drive to in order to get work, or similar.\r\n\r\nI believe that in this instance it would be of great benefit to the driver (and other road users) if they were offered the possibility of having all but Licence code A1 (mopeds and small-engined motor bikes) prohibited for a set time period. This would allow them to continue to travel large distances, while posing less of a potential threat to other road users.\r\n\r\nIf the driver agrees, it means them driving a vehicle considerably more vulnerable to other inconsiderate drivers; hopefully allow them to see their own driving in a new light.\r\n\r\nIf the driver refuses, then it should help to make the decision of giving them an outright ban more clear-cut.",
