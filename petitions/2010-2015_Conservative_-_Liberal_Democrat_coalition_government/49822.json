        "additional_details": "Unless he is prepared to spend a week teaching, Micheal Gove should not be in a position to make decisions regarding education and the future of our children. The increase in reliance on data, not people, to judge schools, the nonsense that is the phonics test, the longer days and shorter holidays to name but a few of the anti-childhood ideas, indicate that he doesn't understand children or the work put into teaching them. The teaching unions have no confidence in him, neither do most parents, it's time for him to go. ",
