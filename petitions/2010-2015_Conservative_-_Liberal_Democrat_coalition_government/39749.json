        "additional_details": "The UK Police Chief Alex Marshall of ACPO, has announced that he needs to deploy Drones (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) over UK airspace to further invade the privacy of the UK population. This is obscene considering we are one of the most monitored countries in the world. We already have tens of thousands of CCTV camera's in use to monitor the UK population.\r\n\r\nThe large amounts of money used for this project should instead be invested in real Police Officers who the public can reach in times of need. Drones do not provide this security.\r\n\r\nIf this goes ahead it will further push the UK into a complete Police State. A red line needs to be drawn here.\r\n\r\nThis has been met with fierce scepticism from numerous human rights groups and from the Met Police themselves.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to send a clear message to Alex Marshall that we the British public will not accept this further blatant intrusive surveillance and instead invest the money into real Police Officers.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
