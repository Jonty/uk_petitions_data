More and more people are using food banks\r\nMost of the country we are sending money too really don't need the money for example India they have their own space programme.\r\nMost of the countries we send money too have a dubious human rights record again India.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and get the MPs to stop wasting our money abroad and then they can use it in the UK to help the people that deserve it.\r\n",
