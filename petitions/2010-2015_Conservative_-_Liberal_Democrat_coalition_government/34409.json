        "additional_details": "I think that the speed of mopeds (currently 30mph) should be increased to at least 50mph, to ensure that they have the capabilities to travel at a safe speed on dual-carriage ways. There are many reasons for this: the biggest one is usually death.\r\nMany moped riders are involved in accidents as they are forced to ride in the left hand lane at all times (even to the left of the left lane) whilst on a dual-carriage way due to the fact that larger vehicles need to overtake them to continue at the speed limit.\r\nIf you ride a 50cc moped on the road at 30mph, there are usually cars behind you travelling at 50mph (very dangerous). Also, it is extremely dangerous to change lanes, for example: You are in the inside lane you need to get into the right-hand lane to turn right and have many other vehicles moving at 50mph behind you. How do you possibly turn right safely? With the extra power, a moped could easily merge between lanes to get into the right hand lane, making the lane-switch safer.",
