        "additional_details": "At present, the public transport network on the Fylde Coast needs radical improvement.\r\n\r\nPublic transport links between north and south Fylde are virtually non-existent, and this isn't acceptable.\r\n\r\nExtending Blackpool's tramway to the south (possibly using the South Fylde railway line) would solve this problem, provide a more environmentally friendly way to travel, boost tourism, link south Fylde directly to Blackpool North station (when this link is built) and decrease traffic congestion significantly.\r\n\r\nI am aware that there is a study being undertaken regarding the future of of the South Fylde line, and I encourage that the results allow for a tram link.\r\n\r\nAfter speaking to local residents, I can assure you that the link is wanted, and would be welcomed greatly.\r\n\r\nWith government funding, this could easily be achieved, and the economic future of the Fylde could be secured. Places such as Manchester are improving and extending their tram systems frequently, so why not Fylde?",
