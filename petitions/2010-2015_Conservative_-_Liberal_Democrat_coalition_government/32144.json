        "additional_details": "The current raising of pensionable age will do nothing for the economy, unless millions more full time jobs are created, & will drastically increase the number of unemployed. Where are all the extra jobs going to be found to keep people in work longer? The pensioners are not registered unemployed, the younger jobless generation will be.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to request the Government to stop the increase in pensionable age & revert to women retiring at 60 & men at 65.",
