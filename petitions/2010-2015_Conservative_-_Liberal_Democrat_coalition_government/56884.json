        "additional_details": "The publicised purpose of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership is to promote economic growth for both the US and the EU/UK. However, the success of of this treaty would allow corporations to subvert our national laws and rights.\r\n\r\nFor example, If legislation was brought in somewhere in the EU to ban one of Monsanto's toxic pesticides/fertilisers/GMOs etc, because research concluded them to be harmful/unethical, Monsanto would then be entitled to compensation from that government, for loss of potential profits. This treaty would place even more power in the hands of multinational corporations and de-prioritise ethics and public well being, for profits.\r\nIt would also give us less power with regards to such issues as: saving the NHS, regulating the banks, and in environmental matters and the progression of renewable energy.\r\n\r\nIt is critical that we do not let this happen! We need to let our government know we are completely apposed to this! ",
