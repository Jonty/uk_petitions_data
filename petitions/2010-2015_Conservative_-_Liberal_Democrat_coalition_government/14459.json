        "additional_details": "In light of the voicemail interception scandal and the attitude Ofcom show towards the people it should be working for, we the undersigned require the government to scrap Ofcom and the Press Complaints Commission. We require the government to create two new regulatory bodies: (i) A media regulator charged with regulation of TV, Radio, Print and Advertising (by rolling the ASA into this regulator); (ii) A spectrum management/protection regulator (as was the Radiocommunications Agency) charged with the protection and management of the radio spectrum, the Wireless Telegraphy Act, plus management of all Electro Magnetic Compliance standards and tests (moving all jurisdiction away from BIS). These two new bodies should report directly to the Cabinet Office and not departments, such as BIS, which might serve to obfuscate/obstruct their work.\r\n",
