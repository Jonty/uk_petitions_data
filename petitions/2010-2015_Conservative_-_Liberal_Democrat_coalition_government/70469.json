        "additional_details": "With falling police numbers and an increase in the number of assaults against Door Supervisors (including several which have resulted in death); I believe that all Door Supervisors should be allowed to protect themselves, their colleagues and the customers in their charge.\r\n\r\nTo that end, I am calling for all Door Supervisors to be routinely issued with handcuffs and side-handled batons. Training, for the former, already exists. However, Door Staff are not allowed to carry or use batons; yet their issue could drastically reduce the number of violent assaults, in licensed premises and in particular, those against Door Supervisors.",
