        "additional_details": "The government is looking to reduce the country deficit and motorists are looking for a better deal when travelling on the roads. By combining petrol prices with tax and insurance will ensure a steady stream of money into the government thus reducing the deficit.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere would be no change from the current system where people with bigger engines pay more so where more fuel is used then the customer would also pay more. This would also lead to a fairer system people that have low mileage requirements pay less.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis also reduces the amount of money the motorist has to spend on car insurance where the cost is ever increasing and going towards shareholders and not the road network.\r\n",
