This is particularly pertinent when she is paid over \u00a365,000 to represent her constituents, and when she has expressly stated in public that her main reason for wanting to take part is to raise awareness of her personal belief that the abortion limit in the UK should be lowered from its current 24 week limit, a stance at odds with the Prime Minister's recent statements that there are no plans for debate on the matter in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to either insist she steps down as an MP, or that her MP's salary of over \u00a365,000 is docked for the duration of her time in the programme, should she appear.
