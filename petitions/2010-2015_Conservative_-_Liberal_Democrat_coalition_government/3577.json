        "additional_details": "I propose that road signs and speed limits should be metricated. Speed limits should be converted to km/h, distances to km or metres as appropriate, and height/width limits to metres.\r\n\r\nMost of the British public are now familiar with metric measurements, and it's likely that more know their definitions than those of miles and yards. Safety will be enhanced as signs and limits will be clear to visiting drivers from other EU countries.",
