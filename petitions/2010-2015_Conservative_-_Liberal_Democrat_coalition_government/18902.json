        "additional_details": "Automated checkouts are becoming increasingly prominent in dominant chains.  Chains which have served to displace independent shops and are monopolising our high streets are now introducing automated checkouts.\r\n\r\nWhile these stores will argue that they are not laying off staff as a direct result of automated checkouts, this technology will dramatically alter future employment habits.\r\n\r\nStores such as large supermarket chains, having removed independent stores, now have an ethical obligation to local employment, and the use of automated checkouts should be limited to ensure local jobs are not reduced.\r\n\r\nThis petition proposes that not more than 25% of all checkouts in a single store should be automated.\r\n",
