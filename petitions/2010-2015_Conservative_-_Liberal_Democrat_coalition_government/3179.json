        "additional_details": "Sign this petition if you believe that the UK should become more involved in efforts relating to space colonisation and exploration.\r\n\r\nReasons for doing this include: 1) Economics; several precious metals and rare isotopes which our industries can utilise exist on other bodies in the solar system. Space tourism may also be a viable industry in the future. 2) Morale and inspiration; it would help show our nation's technological prowess and encourage our youth to consider a career in science or engineering. 3) Ensuring human survival; war, overpopulation and natural disasters may in the future make Earth an unsuitable place to live. If we colonise other worlds, we may have somewhere else to migrate in such a scenario.",
