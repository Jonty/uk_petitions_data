Eliminate discrimination against EU citizens resident in the UK when compared with Commonwealth citizens in the UK.\r\n2. Make it possible for all EU citizens resident in the UK to vote and  stand  in UK Parliamentary elections, even if they are not UK citizens.\r\n3. Grant all mobile European Union citizens the right to vote & stand in the national elections of the European Union country in which they live, even if they are not citizens of that country.\r\n",
