        "additional_details": "The basis for calculating stamp duty on a property is distorting the market and making it difficult to sell homes just above each threshold.\r\nFor example there is 7% stamp duty payable on a home of \u00a32,000,000 which amounts to \u00a3140,000 in stamp duty. A property priced a pound less at \u00a31,999,999 the stamp duty payable is \u00a340,000 less at \u00a3100,000.\r\nThis is not just a problem for higher value homes, the problem occurs right up the chain and makes it difficult to agree sales of homes just above each threshold.\r\nSomeone trying to sell a home priced in \u00a32m-2.3m bracket will often be forced to accept an offer below \u00a32m because buyers would rather pay 5% than 7% stamp duty.\r\nThe Government should act to smooth this effect. There are numerous methods without impacting tax revenues. I am happy to assist as a consultant if the minister in charge finds it difficult to find a solution.\r\nOverall the problem is not the amount of tax, it is the way that it is calculated that is inefficient.\r\n",
