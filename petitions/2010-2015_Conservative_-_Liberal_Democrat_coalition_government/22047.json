        "additional_details": "The current threshold, 100,000 signatures, at which an e-petition can trigger action in Parliament is too low.  Setting it at 500,000 signatures would show that there is considerable concern over an issue and that Parliament should debate it.\r\n\r\nWhen the debate takes place, the result of the vote should not determine policy.  The debate should be about aspects of the subject of the petition which members believe need to be taken into account.  The vote at the end of the debate should be a free vote on whether members think the government should come forward with legislation or action about the issue. Then the government could decide how it wanted to deal with it - for example, by legislation, by making operational changes, or by studying the issue further through a select committee.\r\nThis would allow a voice for the public, but still maintain the sovereignty of Parliament.",
