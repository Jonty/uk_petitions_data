        "additional_details": "Over the previous 10 years uk motorcycle tests have been made increasingly harder, to try to reduce bike related deaths on our roads, but nothing has been done to educate car drivers. I propose that the same rules should apply across the board and bring the current uk car test under the same restrictions as motorbikes.\r\n\r\nFor example a 17 year old passes his motorbike test, under current laws he can now only ride a 125cc bike until he passes an aditional 2 part practical test when he reaches a minimum age of 19. However a 17 year old passes his car test on the same day can instantly jump behind the wheel of his parents range rover sport, which is essentially a 2 ton battering ram and drive on his own.\r\n\r\nWould it not make sence to impose similar restrictions on new car drivers aswell as new bikers so that all road users can be more aware of each other?",
