        "additional_details": "Pay Paramedics what they deserve and upgrade them to band 6 on the NHS A4C pay scale. The Paramedic, contrary to belief is not a glorified ambulance man of old. The Paramedic is a Jack-of-all-trades in the medical world. As independent clinicians, Paramedics now have over 40 drugs at their disposal and may administer at their discretion. With advanced training in Advanced Life Support, Cardiology and Trauma, they are also trained in many other areas of medicine and require foundation degrees / diplomas to register as Paramedics. Add to that the injuries caused by manual handling of patients, abuse, assaults and the cut in public sector pensions, we ask you, the government, to pay Paramedics what they deserve.",
