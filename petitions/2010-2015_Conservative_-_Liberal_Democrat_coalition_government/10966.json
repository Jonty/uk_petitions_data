Many young people do not like or are not good at ball games.\r\nI recall when I was in school many would stand about on the sports field and if the ball hit them that was their contribution to the class.\r\nIt is time to look at other ways of keeping our young people fit starting from when they start school. Most children love music I would introduce dance exercise, aerobics and spinning classes these would help keep young people fit and anyone can take part without feeling they are poor at it as we can all move to music the steps etc do not matter the fact is we are moving and having fun whilst we exercise. In addition, I would introduce Yoga to keep children supple and help their relaxation.\r\nBall game Sport would be optional.\r\n",
