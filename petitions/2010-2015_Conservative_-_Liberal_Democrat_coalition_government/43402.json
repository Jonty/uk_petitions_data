        "additional_details": "I'm sure a lot of parents and carers of children know just how valuable it is when you go shopping to be able to park in a Parent & Child space. It is not a case of being able to walk a short distance to the shop, it is about having the room to safely manoeuvre a child and buggy out of the car, ensuring safety of the child.\r\nAnd so it is absolutely infuriating when people, with no child, use these spaces for their big car or to avoid walking further than 20yards.\r\nI am petitioning to make p&c spaces permit only. It could be enforsed by:\r\n1. The parents receive it with the other documents when they have their child.\r\n2. Other carers of children (childminders, foster, grand parents) could apply separately.\r\n3. It would expire after 12 years.\r\n4. It would be a permit that states the registrations of the cars who use it.\r\n5. Shops could fine those who use them, as like Disabled Spaces.\r\n6. Shops could also discourage inappropriate use by placing spaces at the back of a car park.",
