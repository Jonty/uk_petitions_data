        "additional_details": "Until the 1980s one could buy a loin pork chop with a portion of kidney attached. It is surprising how many people remember this cut of meat fondly. However, EU rules banned this cut and a pork chop with a separate piece of kidney just isn't the same. This petition calls on the government to negotiate with the EU to allow this cut of meat once again.",
