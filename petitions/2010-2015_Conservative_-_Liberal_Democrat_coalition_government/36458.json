        "additional_details": "Exchequer Secretary David Gauke made the statement paying a tradesman cash in hand for work done such as window cleaning, gardening, plumbing etc. is morally wrong. Surely the cash economy has it's advantages in that the person paying is paying with funds available to them & the trader does not have to wait for a cheque to clear or have it declined. Perhaps the answer is to allow cash-in-hand transactions up to say \u00a315 and any transactions over that amount would have to be put through the books thus being taxable.",
