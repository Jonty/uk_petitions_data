        "additional_details": "In the current climate, paying for a parking ticket is difficult enough.  However, when you haven't got the money and go over the number of days allocated for payment (usually 28-30 days), is it fair that the fine goes up by 50%...?\r\n\r\nI am not against parking fines per se, however, there must be a better way to enforce these fines rather than a draconian 50% increase for non payment per month.\r\n\r\nMany people have less and less disposable income and finding this kind of money is difficult.  Having the opportunity to pay it over a period of time without fear of a substantial and disproportionate hikes must be a reasonable request.\r\n\r\nI propose that rather than this flat rate charge, I propose interest is charged instead.  It can be based on an average rate of current bank loans or an appropriate amount can be decided.\r\n\r\nEither way, a 50% hike is surely disproportianate whichever way you look at it.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n",
