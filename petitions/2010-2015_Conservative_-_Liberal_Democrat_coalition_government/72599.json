It should be second nature. It can be daunting to check - especially when it is not known how to do it correctly. Searching online to try and learn how can sometimes cause more harm than good.\r\n\r\nChecking for lumps should be taught in schools, stressing the importance of it so that it is done regularly.\r\n\r\nProsthetic models can be used to demonstrate what is 'normal' and what may not be.
