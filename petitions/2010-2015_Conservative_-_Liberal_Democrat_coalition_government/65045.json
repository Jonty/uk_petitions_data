While also strengthening other forms of public transport to stations for such trains.\r\n\r\nHS2, a very costly, very fast train line from London to the North - vs - Underground tube train system operating from Leeds to surrounding areas of Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nBenefits would include strengthening the local economy, offering thousands of jobs locally; reducing congestion within the city centre, enable quicker, more energy efficient, cleaner forms of transport for a stronger future.\r\n",
