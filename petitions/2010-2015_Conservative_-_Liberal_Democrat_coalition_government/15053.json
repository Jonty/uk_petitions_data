The technology was already there 50 years ago, and materials and so on have advanced a great deal since then.\"\r\n\r\nThe MPs were more concerned about discouraging US  businessmen (wanring access to zero G experiments) and space tourists from increasing their carbon footprint by flying here.\r\n\r\nThis will give Britain an enormous first step into space at 1/5th of the annual cost of the NERC quango (one of several existing to \"raise awareness\" of alleged catastrophic global warming).\r\n\r\nCommercial space industry is growing at 5% annually in the UK an 17.6% in the US. The commercial opportunities are literally unlimited. ",
