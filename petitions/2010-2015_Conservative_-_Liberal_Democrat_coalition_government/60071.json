        "additional_details": "The Government should criminalise the destruction of food by supermarkets that has gone past its \"sell-by\" date. It should make it obligatory upon such shops to organise collection of such food by such groups as the Salvation Army and Crisis for distribution to those living in poverty in Britain, particularly to the homeless. Failure to comply should be met with heavy fines which should be used to provide food for such groups of people.",
