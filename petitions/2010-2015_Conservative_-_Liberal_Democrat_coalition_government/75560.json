        "additional_details": "On Monday 9th March 2015 brought the end to long running BBC programme 'Waterloo Road'. This petition is to bycott the axing of the show and rethink the whole idea. The show has been a huge part of most peoples lives and to take it away from them - from me is disasterous! The show is such a huge importance to its home in Scotland bringing up and coming actors and actresses, also showing what Scotland has to offer in TV. There are so many reasons not to axe the show, some that include; it's the best programme on TV,  brings a huge viewing from young people, brilliant story lines, different from any other programme from its uniquness. The list is endless! Please save our TV programme, save our school, save our Waterloo Road that we grew up with to love!",
