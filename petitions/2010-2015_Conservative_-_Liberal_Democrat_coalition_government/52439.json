(Education example)\r\n\r\nIt is time that the Minister for Education has Teaching, or child and education studies background.\r\nOn 12th May 2010, Michael Gove took the top job in education, Secretary of State. In April 2013, 2 he received a vote of no confidence as well as other unions asking why someone who is untrained as an educator can tell professionals in the education system how to do their job.\r\n\r\nMinister for Health, should be a Doctor or a Nurse/Healthcare professional.\r\n\r\nTreasurer should have a Finance background.\r\n\r\nYou would not employ someone with no experience in a field straight into a CEO level job, so why can this happen in government?\r\n\r\nMinisters must be a trained professional with leadership experience from the field they are taking.",
