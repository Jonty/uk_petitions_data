The mandatory minimum should be the existing Department of Education 2005 module; available to view at http://nso.archive.teachfind.com/node/175600\r\n\r\nAll teachers should be trained to understand dyslexia, its impact on learning and what constitutes dyslexia friendly practice. Teachers should be aware of when to signpost learners for assessment and when to provide appropriate intervention. ",

            "details": "As this e-petition has received more than 10 000 signatures, the relevant Government department have provided the following response:\r\n\r\nThe Government agrees that teachers should be well prepared to meet the needs of all pupils.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Government does not require Initial Teacher Training (ITT) providers to deliver particular sessions within their programmes. Instead, the Secretary of State\u2019s Initial Teacher Training Criteria specify that:\r\n\r\n\u201cAll accredited ITT providers must ensure\u2026that the content, structure, delivery and assessment of programmes are designed to enable trainee teachers to meet all the standards for QTS across the age range of training.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe new Teachers\u2019 Standards which came into effect from September 2012 state that:\r\n\r\n\u201ca teacher must\u2026.adapt teaching to respond to the strengths and needs of all pupils,\u201d\r\n\r\nand in particular:\r\n\r\n\u201chave a clear understanding of the needs of all pupils, including those with special educational needs\u2026..and be able to use and evaluate distinctive teaching approaches to engage and support them.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe are mindful of the need for trainee teachers to have opportunities early in their training to learn more about special educational needs and that is why we are increasing the number of ITT placements in special schools or specialist settings within a mainstream school, from 1000 placements between 2009 and 2011 to up to 2000 from September 2012. The placements enable trainees to address the professional standards for qualified teachers (QTS) in relation to SEN/D.\r\n\r\nThe Department currently funds the Dyslexia-SpLD Trust to develop an online Continuous Professional Development framework for teachers, which includes a self-assessment and guide for further study.  We are also continuing to work with the Dyslexia \u2013SPLD trust to explore how we can make use of their expertise in  further strengthening  the recently published advanced materials on Dyslexia, Autism and Communication Needs.\r\n\r\nOfsted routinely inspects ITT provision. As part of this process, it monitors and evaluates how well individual training providers train teachers to meet the needs of all pupils with SEN and disabilities including those with dyslexia and specific learning difficulties. The quality of SEN provision within ITT has been identified as a priority as part of the new ITT inspection arrangements.\r\n\r\nThis emphasis on trainee teachers meeting the needs of all pupils is further backed up by Ofsted\u2019s new framework for ITE inspections. The grade descriptors for the quality of training include a judgement on how training prepares trainees to meet the needs of pupils with special educational needs.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore the responsibility of ITT providers to ensure that they design their programmes so that trainees achieve the outcomes a defined in the Teachers Standards. It would be inappropriate for the Government to mandate ITT providers to deliver any particular sessions.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.",
