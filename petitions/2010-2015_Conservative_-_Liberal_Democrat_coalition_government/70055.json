Any seller who has a survey done regardless of whom it is conducted for must receive a copy of any survey to ensure it is correct and accurate\r\n2. That if the surveyor has recorded items that are incorrect or inaccurate has to have a method to complain and have items corrected.\r\n\r\nThis should not be confused with low valuations that do not meet your expectations, as this is subjective, but any report written, YOU must have a right to see as the owner of the property. and a method to correct anything inaccurate ",
