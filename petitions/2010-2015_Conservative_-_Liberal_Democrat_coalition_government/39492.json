        "additional_details": "Mobile phones are being supplied by hardware companies and mobile networks with pre-installed applications and widgets. There are a number of pre-installed apps that users would like to uninstall because, they do not want to use them, or they have other applications that they prefer. These phones do not allow the user to uninstall these. This is a restriction, is anti-competitive and is a restriction on free trade. We feel that under EU and English law that we should have the right to uninstall these items.\r\nTo summarize the option to uninstall applications and widgets that are not wanted by the user/owner of the mobile phone should be the default position, and to not offer this option is anti-competitive.
