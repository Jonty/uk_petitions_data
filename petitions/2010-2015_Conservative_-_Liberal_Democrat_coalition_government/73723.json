Not to preach on the streets or even allowed in newspapers. Stop all religion in general which does not effect the freedom of human rights but instead allows others to have their human rights to not be forced with hearing about Muslim or Christian values. Anyone found doing so should be fine and told to pack up their belongs from the street and vacate the area. In doing so no more Muslim protest nor Christian nor any other religion. ",
