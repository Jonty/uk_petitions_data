        "additional_details": "Home Carers get paid below the minimum wage. Dont believe me? Check out the working time regulations, then ring around five random home care providers and ask if they pay travel time. The answer will be no. Dropping the average hourly rate for an average home care worker down to approximately \u00a34.90 per hour. Home Carers often work 14 hour days plus just to earn 7 hours pay. Such poor pay and long days mean many carers are forced to leave, thus having a knock on effect of the elderly we are caring for as there is no continuity, with different people all the time. This is often confusing and upsetting for people who struggle on their own as it it. Carers are not greedy. We know we are among the lowest paid in the country but we love what we do. We just want a fair wage for a days work to enable us to keep on caring for your mum's, dad's,  aunts, uncles and grandparents.\r\n",
