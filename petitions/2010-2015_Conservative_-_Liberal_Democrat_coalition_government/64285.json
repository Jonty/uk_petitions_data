On the 11th of November each year it would be nice if they could put a poppy cross on the grave or graves.\r\n\r\nI believe this would serve two purposes, educating the children about why we wear a poppy and remember the fallen and it would take some pressure of the Parish Councils that are responsible for some of this work.\r\n\r\nNot only would it educate our school children but it may also make those who live on the edge of society think about their actions and the privilege of living in a democracy.\r\n\r\nCommunity Service, Probationers and low risk prisoners could be used to do the major maintenance of War Graves and War Memorials in their area, how much this would involve would vary.",
