These are among the most vulnerable members of our community, and their illness is difficult enough, without the humiliation and stress of 'proving' what they suffer.\r\n\r\nWe ask that cancer patients automatically receive welfare benefits, and that all seriously ill citizens of the UK be exempt from welfare testing.  The ill deserve our compassion, not our suspicion.\r\n",
