As a matter of urgency, we believe that Ebola Treatment Centres with facilities comparable to those that prevail in the west should be funded and set up across the 3 countries, so that anyone with symptoms of Ebola could immediately be taken to a centre where they could get facilities similar to those that prevail in the west so that they could get Western Style intervention without the need to be taken to the West.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to give urgent consideration to leading the way in the establishment and funding of centres as detailed above in sufficient numbers to curtail this dreadful pandemic at source before it runs completely out of control and becomes a truly global problem..\r\n",
