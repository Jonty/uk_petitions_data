        "additional_details": "I now have 4 different rubbish/recycling collections each week - mostly collected from open containers whose contents litter the streets after the collections. Surely this recylcing could be collected in one separate 'recyclables' wheely bin. This could be taken to the local prison and inmates enlisted to sort out the contents while behind bars. Following their release, these ex-prisoners could be offered a job and paid for doing the same work as they did while in prison. This policy will increase recycling (as it will be easier for householders), reduce council expenses (as recycling will not be sorted on the streets) and reduce prioner reoffending as they will be released a good work ethic and a job which they are familiar with.",
