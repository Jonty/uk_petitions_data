        "additional_details": "The land next to Stonards Hill Recreation Ground is used constantly by the residence of Epping and is generally thought of as another part of the park.\r\n\r\nThe land has recently been fenced off and is under threat of development. These fences have trapped the wildlife inside the field and have blocked entry into their burrows. This can be seen in the dramatic increase of small animals such as rabbits (that would normally be hiding from humans) since the fences where put up.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, 'Old Pastures' in Epping should be made into common land and easy access should be restored from the recreation ground.
