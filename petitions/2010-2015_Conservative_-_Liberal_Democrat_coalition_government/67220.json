        "additional_details": "Millions of people hardly ever, or never use their telephone landline for calls, Millions feel forced to keep it just for broadband.\r\n\r\n Alternatively, HM Government should put forward a business directive of a one off payment for home owners and tenants that want a landline for Broadband only.\r\nThis should be in the form of a small one off payment when you buy or rent a house and you should only need to renew if you move to a new home. The current level of charging by BT openreach is far too expensive for Broadband only users.\r\nMaking Landline payments more affordable is good for business, vast amounts of business and sales are done online and it would make sense to vastly lower the overpriced BT driven standards.\r\nIn the near future many will ditch Lindlines for faster mobile connections that they can tether to computers or tablets. Landline charges need to be reduced or nationalised now.",
