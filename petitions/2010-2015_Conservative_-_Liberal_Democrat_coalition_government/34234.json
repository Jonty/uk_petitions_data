        "additional_details": "Introduction of the EYFS saw many leave childminding who couldn't or wouldn\u2019t meet the required standards. This obviously improved quality of care.\r\nProposals to separate and relax inspection procedures for childminders (whilst allowing them solely to care for up to 5 children) will not raise standards and presents real risk regards safeguarding. Particularly as it is likely to re-attract and facilitate many in providing second rate care and baby warehousing.\r\nEconomic climate means some parents will inevitably choose cheaper options over quality. It is transparent that any money government saves by changing the inspection process will be awarded to whichever private agency wins the lucrative contract to inspect. No saving in real terms, rather a redirection of funds.\r\nWe strongly object to changes to inspection for childminders, most who want to be able to evidence their commitment to quality. More importantly, however, we object to a policy which inevitably puts children at risk.",
