        "additional_details": "The government must undertake a complete and independent review of the purpose, role, staffing levels and function of every department, quango etc. within the Civil Service. Efficiencies can be made, but only by an independent body with teeth that can review effectively without allowing any nefarious ambitions to be supported. We need a streamlined civil service, removing duplication and ensuring that the British people are receiving value for money in these challenging times.",
