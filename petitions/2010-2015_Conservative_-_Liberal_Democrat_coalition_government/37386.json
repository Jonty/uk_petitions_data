Some must live with Alzheimer's, knowing they will forget their loved ones, and loose their communicative ability and freedom.  Some must live in homes where they need care 24/7.  This is a life we should have the right to choose.\r\n\r\nI am a human being.  I wish to die in a humane, dignified  way.  ",
