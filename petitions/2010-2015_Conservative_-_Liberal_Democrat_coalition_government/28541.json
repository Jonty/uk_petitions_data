Dismiss any teacher who mistreats a disabled child;\r\n2. Ensure they are registered as unsuitable to work with children;\r\n3. Investigate the inadequate responses and actions of the Board of Governers and Local Education Authority in the above case.\r\n4. Ensure that all schools provide adequate access to toilet facilities for all both in the classroom and outside of it.\r\n5. Ensure this does not happen again in any UK school.\r\n6.
