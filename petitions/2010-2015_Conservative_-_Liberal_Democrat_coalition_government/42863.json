        "additional_details": "We call on government to abolish the yearly 1% cap increase on benefits.\r\n\r\nIt is unfair to burden the poor even more by only increasing benefits by much less then the rate of inflation. Especially, when those earning over \u00a31 million PA get a \u00a340,000 PA tax cut.\r\n\r\nWe say all benefits should be increased by no more or less than the rate of inflation to ensure benefits are uplifted to meet cost of living for those receiving benefits and living in poverty..",
