        "additional_details": "When the British Army went into Afghanistan, Tony Blair committed \u00a3200m to wiping out Heroin production. It is more now than ever. The farmers get pennies for their crops. Why don't we pay them more, refine it and give it away to users for nothing?\r\nNo more drug related crime. Dealers out of business.\r\nCountry saves Billions. Nobody is going to use it just because it's given away for free, if they do, then chances are they would have paid for it anyway. I want the Government to consider this option. The war on drugs was lost years ago, we need to get smarter.",
