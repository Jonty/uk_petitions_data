        "additional_details": "We have seen selfish, feral youth of modern England on our streets.  This is partly due to the abandonment of discipline in our society.  It is time we gave young people a sense of pride in their nation, a sense of belonging, and respect for authority.  National Service would accomplish this.  This may not be something that politicians could bring in unilaterally, but a referendum would give such a measure democratic legitimacy.",
