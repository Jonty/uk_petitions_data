        "additional_details": "Tyrell Matthews-Burton was killed whilst celebrating his 19th birthday on 23 July 2013 in Malia, Greece.\r\n\r\nThe initial Greek investigation did not do forensic tests to Tyrell\u2019s clothing. The loss of essential evidence forces Tyrell\u2019s mother, Sharon Matthews to bring a civil case against the three British men accused of murder and accomplice to murder. The case now substantially relies on witness testimony.\r\n\r\nDespite the overwhelming British interests in ensuring a fair trial and active investigation, our government continues to sit on the sidelines and this incident remains stubbornly outside the public eye.\r\n\r\nDavid Cameron has stated that the government cannot intervene in this investigation, and we are asking for this decision to be reviewed, as he had demanded the governments involvement in the investigation of the Thailand murders, which he made a point of justifying this by saying, the matter involved two British citizens. Tyrell was a British citizen.",
