        "additional_details": "To this day- Gibraltar is being constantly bullied by Spain. Gibraltar does not seem to have the support from the British Government and we urge those in Parliament to stop betraying the British citizens of Gibraltar and start acting on their behalf. The people of Gibraltar have given everything they have to Queen and country. The people of Gibraltar are proud of being British and all they ask for is that we get a little bit of respect from the British politicians. We do not expect England to go to war with Spain over Gibraltar but please do not ignore us in order to please your amigos in Spain. We need you England. Please do not turn your back on us now.",
