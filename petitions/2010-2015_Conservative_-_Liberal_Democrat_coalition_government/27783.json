        "additional_details": "At present virtually anyone can get shotgun licence and start shooting wild birds and animals without having to prove they can shoot proficiently. Thousands of birds and animals are injured every year due to complete lack of control over abilities.  I propose an annual shooting test which all shotgun licence holders must pass to retain their licence. I also propose that shooting laws should be revised to ban shooting within 200 yards of roads, houses, public footpaths, etc.  Make this 'sport' safe and humane.",
