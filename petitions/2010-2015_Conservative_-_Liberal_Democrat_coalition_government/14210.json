        "additional_details": "I propose the conversion of all current and suitable disused railways into truck only motorways.\r\n\r\nI believe this will ease congestion on the already overstretched motorway network, lower the journey times for all traffic, and save the country \u00a3millions.\r\nLarge sidings at virtually every major town and city could be converted to truckstops and marshalling yards where freight can be transfered to smaller more town friendly vehicles.\r\nLarger multi-trailer HGVs would be allowed on these Truckways thereby reducing the enviromentally harmful emissions.\r\nThe metalwork (rails,gantries,cables,etc) could be sold of to pay for the initial resurfacing of the roads.\r\n ",
