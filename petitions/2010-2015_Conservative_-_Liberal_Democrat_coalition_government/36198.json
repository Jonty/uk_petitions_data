        "additional_details": "Many MPs spend much of their time (in development of their international aspirations) dealing with and discussing matters going on in foreign countries.  It has never been addressed that the costs incurred by these MPs during these activities should be treated as a charge against the already HUGE amount of money UK taxpayers are forced to send overseas, against their will.  Any MP who is NOT dealing with matters relating to his constituency, preferring to spend his time dealing with matters going on in foreign countries, should have his costs - expenses and tax free allowances, travel, subsistence etc (the list is endless) NOT taken from the taxpayer AGAIN, but taken from the obligatory allocation of taxpayer pounds to the International Aid Budget, which is not supported by the majority of the population, anyway, and should be made to bear the TRUE total cost of foreign matters dealt with by MPs.",
