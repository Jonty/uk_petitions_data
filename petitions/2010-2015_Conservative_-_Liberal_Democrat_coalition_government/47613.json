        "additional_details": "The CMBC budget for the Mixenden area is \u00a34.5 million soley for SureStart Children Centres (as stated in CMBC Budget papers) against \u00a388,000 (pounds) for MPRC per year. CMBC have recently reviewed the services for duplications in this area, between our small Registered Charity and the local SureStart Centres. We feel this was not a fair review!  We are a small non for profit organisation where as SureStart Centres are a business and should be self-sustainable. We would like the government to look at how CMBC has treated MPRC regarding its review. Our Centre is unique, working at a low level with people with no confidence, helping them achieve accreditation and giving them employment value - this is what David Cameron stated he wanted, required and needed for his local areas. The \u00a330k the Centre will lose in September 2013 will mean loss of one complete service. \u00a330k in the year2 - 2014 will see the end of a 33 year old organisation doing what the government stated it required.",
