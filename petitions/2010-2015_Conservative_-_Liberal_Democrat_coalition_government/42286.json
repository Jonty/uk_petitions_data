        "additional_details": "8 homes have been targeted by Islington Council for redevelopment on this estate. Occupiers are leaseholders, elderly, families - many of whom have lived on the estate since it was built.  The council want to demolish these properties.  The residents want to keep their homes.  They feel safe. Their children attend local schools; people have local jobs; loved ones receive care from family members; they are all part of an existing supportive community. They want to stay in their homes.  As it is.  We want the government to stop this proposed development.  Let the council utilize housing stock that is empty and unused.",
