        "additional_details": "Government should help with the cost of spectacles. The poorer the person's eyesight the more they have to pay for their lenses. Why?\r\nSome may need complex lenses that may cost more than a hundred pounds each (retail), plus the cost of frames. Pricing of frames should also be questioned.\r\nSpectacle wearers are actually worse off than people with normal eyesight due to high costs. New spectacles are needed at least every two years and can be as much as \u00a3300.\r\nPaying for spectacles should be affordable to all.\r\nPeople should be given an allowance, determined by their Optician, towards their lenses and this would be refunded. This subject is overdue for a complete reappraisal and financial help should be considered.",
