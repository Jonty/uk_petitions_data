Why must we suffer huge cutbacks, being told there isn't the funds, when the government is ploughing millions into other countries? We want to be put first. After all, charity begins at home!\r\n\r\nYou can't expect to treat the people of this country as if they are the last on the list. It is your duty to put us first!\r\n\r\nThe changes we would like to see are that the government reviews its foreign aid policy, to ensure that there are sufficient funds to support the people of Britain first! As it stands, the people of Britain are being deprived of their needs, for no good reason!  This needs to be addressed!",
