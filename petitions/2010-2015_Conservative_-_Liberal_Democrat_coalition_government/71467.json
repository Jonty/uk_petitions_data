        "additional_details": "The Croydon Advertiser has launched a campaign for better access at Norwood Junction.\r\n\r\nThe station has six active platforms but only one is currently accessible to wheelchair users.\r\n\r\nThere are no lifts and Transport for London has said it can't install any because of the station's narrow platforms. We don't think this is good enough.\r\n\r\nMore than 3.5 million people use the station every year, making it one of the busiest in south London.\r\nIts current accessibility arrangements should be a priority for the Department for Transport, Transport for London and Network Rail.\r\n\r\nWe want the Government to fund improvements at Norwood Junction, helping make the station accessible for all.\r\n\r\nPlease sign our petition.",
