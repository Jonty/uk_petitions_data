        "additional_details": "Abortion is the deliberate taking of existing human life & as such we should not be allowing doctors to play any part in it. Doctors are here to ease suffering & promote life, not to take it. Doctors are not here to play God ie acts of sacrificial kindness, doctors are here to heal/support. They should be encouraging abstinence, safe sex, avoidance of exploitation etc all things that are breached when condoning abortion. They should also let all recognise the serious mental/physical harm done by inflicting abortion on mothers of unborn children & not let this be brushed under the carpet just so advocates of abortion can benefit.",
