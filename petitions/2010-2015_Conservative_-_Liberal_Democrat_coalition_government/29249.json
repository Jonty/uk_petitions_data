        "additional_details": "We agree that:\r\n\r\nIn the UK Blood is donated as an act of charity by individuals.\r\n\r\nDonated blood should be made available to different organisations at different costs.\r\n\r\nPrivate hospitals charge very large amounts for blood transfusions during operations, amounts far in excess of the basic costs for the blood itself.\r\n\r\nPrivate hospitals should pay the maximum the market can afford as they are profit making organisations whilst NHS hospitals should continue to receive blood at low cost.\r\n\r\nThe profit generated from this approach should be used to provide further funding to the wider NHS.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
