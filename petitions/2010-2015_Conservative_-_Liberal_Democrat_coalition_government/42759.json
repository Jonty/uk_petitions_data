In most cases this is unable to transport \u2018Category A\u2019 patients, who are the most critically ill or injured and as such, most likely to need rapid transport.\r\n\r\nThis \u2018loop hole\u2019 needs to be closed to protect patients, particularly in rural areas, where long backup delays are caused by Ambulance Trusts manning RRVs over Ambulances in order to claim this target.
