        "additional_details": "David Cameron has reshuffled the cabinet.\r\n\r\nHe has selected a man known to be in favour of shale gas extraction and ending renewable energy subsidies to be Environment Secretary. Cancelling renewable energy subsidies would guarantee the UK would miss its emission reduction targets. The brother-in-law of the new Environment Secretary is also a renowned climate sceptic, giving him a clear conflict of interest.\r\n\r\nAlso, Jeremy Hunt has been promoted to Health Secretary. This is a man who believes in the benefits of homeopathy, despite almost all leading medical practitioners and medical studies showing its lack of effectiveness.\r\n\r\nThese two choices alone clearly point to the misguided approach taken when deciding appropriate people to take on some of the country's most vital roles.\r\n\r\nWe would like an open debate in parliament to discuss this substantial issue.",
