        "additional_details": "Stamp duty at 3% is hitting the economy as average wage earners cannot afford \u00a37,500 duty when buying the average priced house at \u00a3250,000.  Add solicitor's fees and estate agent fees and the average house-buyer has to increase their mortgage  by \u00a313,000 to cover these costs.  I am asking the Government to either raise the threshold to \u00a3500,000 for the 3% duty or better still to keep it at 1% right across the board.  Builders, DIY stores, furnishing stores etc would all benefit financially as a new house always needs a lot of new items.",
