        "additional_details": "Siting parliament in London no longer makes economic sense. London is expensive, congested, and far from the geographic and population centre of the nation. The presence of parliament in London draws more and more organisations to the capital creating an overheated local economy and drives the population expansion to the southeast and away from the regions. The houses of parliament are no longer physically able to provide the space, accomodation or technology for a 21st century society and a purpose built parliament building is long overdue.\r\n\r\nMoving parliament to the regions would provide economic benefit to the nation, and present an opportunity to create a more efficient working environment for our elected representatives.\r\n\r\nGovernment does not have to be located in the capital city - other nations have found benefit in such a separation. There is no economic case for continuing with London as the home of our parliament. This cost saving is long overdue.\r\n",
