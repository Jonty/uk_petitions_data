I propose that the government considers charging obese people for operations and cures of directly weight related illness's as I believe that it is unfair that the taxpayers money is being drawn away from people who really need it through no fault of their own rather than being frittered on obese people who have allowed themselves to become so large through their own pitiful self control. It would also act as motivation for obese people to lose weight which is much needed in these days of gluttony and laziness.",
