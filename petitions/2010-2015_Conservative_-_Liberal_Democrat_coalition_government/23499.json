        "additional_details": "It is proposed that lessons on the history of science and the basic principles of geology should be mandatory for all pupils up to Key Stage 3 (Year 9).  The many  evidences for the antiquity of the earth should be clearly and simply explained, in order to explain why ideas such as young-earth creationism are invalid.  Pupils should be taught to recognize that the age of the earth and the theory of evolution are two separate issues.",
