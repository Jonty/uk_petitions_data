        "additional_details": "Young people are constantly surrounded by airbrushed and digitally enhanced images.\r\n\r\nWe are asking the Government to introduce a simple numerical scale to show to what extent an image has been edited.\r\n\r\nWe are asking the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to make this 1-10 scale compulsory on every edited image, in the corner or caption of the image.\r\n\r\nWhilst this will not eradicate the issue of airbrushing, we believe it will allow young people to differentiate between realistic images and those which are completely unattainable, thus promoting greater self-esteem and confidence of some of our most vulnerable members of society.",
