        "additional_details": "I was shocked to discover Gove has removed American books from the GCSE English syllabus, including To Kill a Mockingbird. Here are just a few reasons, listed below, by myself, online friends and authors as to why the titles should be brought back. We are currently tweeting using #SaveOurBooks.\r\n\"Cultures are becoming increasingly interconnected. Separating literature into countries is not the way to go.\"\r\n\"These books give students a view of society & cultural change wider than that of the UK.\"\r\n\"Racism is such an important issue to address in education, and To Kill A Mockingbird tackles it.\"\r\n\"The titles removed are among the greatest in literature. They're influential & more engaging than many English classics.\"\r\n\"The books teach universal lessons, build on our empathy & allow us to experience the world through different points of views.\"\r\n\"Great literature comes from more than one nation.\"",
