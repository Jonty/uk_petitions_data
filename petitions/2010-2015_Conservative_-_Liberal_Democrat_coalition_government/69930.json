The style Emperor/Empress is higher in status than King or Queen. Once HM the Queen passes the longest reign milestone set by Queen Victoria some recognition should be given which sets her apart from all other reigning monarchs. The Imperial Title should be for her lifetime/reign only and neither be transferred to her successors nor linked to any territorial entity.",
