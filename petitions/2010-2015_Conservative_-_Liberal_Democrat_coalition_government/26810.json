        "additional_details": "Currently there is a huge injustice in the amount of parental leave men and women get. Whilst women receive almost a year of paid leave, men get around 2 - 3 weeks. This means that the mother has the chance to create a very close bond with the child, but the father doesn't. Furthermore, the expectation that companies will have to pay more for the parental leave of potential female employees results in unequal employment opportunities for women. We ask that maternity leave and paternity leave are combined, allowing individual couples to decide how they divide this time between the mother and father.",
