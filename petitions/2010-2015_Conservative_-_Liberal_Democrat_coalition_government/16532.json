        "action": "Cut soft degrees that have low graduate prospects and invest taxpayers money in other areas",
        "additional_details": "To pass legislation that will mean universities have to prove with statistics that their graduates are going on into a graduate position within 12 months of leaving university. If the graduate prospects are too low and below a set threshold the course should be cut from the curriculum as its not beneficial to students, only a financial tool for the institution. This will see less places at university, increase competition for graduates making them push and apply themselves more and mean more money is being invested in areas fundamental to the world such as the medical profession, computing and scientific research. It will also stop people going to university doing easier courses for a free ride at the expense of the taxpayer.",
