        "additional_details": "MoJ & their agencies, social concern groups and NFP's need to work collectively to address UK Recidivism, runs at 66%. Prisoners are failed by the system. NOMS Mantra is \u201cIncarcerate & Protect\u201d.\r\n\r\nPrisoners need help to resettle in the community and get back into a family and work mindset. Often leaving prison, not ready to return to work nor equipped to return home. Most are homeless, jobless, addicted, in debt! Ready to reoffend - written off by society; with no hope; so become statistics! No surprise recidivism is static.\r\n\r\nDemand results to address this, funding must be made available.\r\n+ WORK: we have jobs & some placements, employers are waiting for our ex-offenders + Accommodation: living in Community - NOT Hostels + Mentors: Trained Volunteers who agree to journey with prisoners as needed.\r\n\r\nClearly, most initiatives used so far have failed, badly. There is no Plan B, we are plan B - everyone must take responsibility!\r\n",
