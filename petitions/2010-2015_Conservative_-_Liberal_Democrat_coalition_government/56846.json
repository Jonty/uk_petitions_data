        "additional_details": "Standing Charges are payable regardless of use of service. Charges made by services like Electric, Gas, District Heating and water services only contribute to higher bills and for fuel causes fuel poverty. Standing charges in todays markets is not a justifiable charge. Metering equipment should not be paid for by the service user, this is a charge that should be paid by the service provider as they require metering to bill the customer. Therefore, a service user should only have to pay for nothing more than what they are metered for service suppliers should be the ones to cover the cost of these devices out of their profits.",
