        "additional_details": "In the event of Scottish independence, I petition the Government to remove the Scottish flag from the Union Flag, replacing the blue of Scotland with the green of Wales.\r\n\r\nThe Government will argue to keep the blue of Scotland as the Union flag represents the union of the crowns of England and Scotland and is therefore not a political flag. However, this would be mis-representation of the facts, as whilst the flag was originally introduced on the basis of the union of the crowns, it has since come to represent the political entity of the United Kingdom. Therefore, if Scotland leaves the political entity of the UK, then their representation on the flag of the UK should end. This would then present the opportunity to have Wales properly represented on the flag by adding the green from the Welsh flag, ",
