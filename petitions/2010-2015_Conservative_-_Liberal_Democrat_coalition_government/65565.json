        "additional_details": "The system for voting in the UK needs an overhaul, the First Past the Post system encourages tactical voting, voting for a party you disagree with as your first choice \"will never get in\", and can also mean that an MP that the majority of people in a constituency do NOT want.\r\n\r\nApproval Voting changes this by allowing people to vote for (or approve) one or more candidates. With Approval Voting, a party's true support is accurately reflected in the results of the election. Approval Voting prevents votes of similarly minded people being split and it also prevents tactical voting and the marginalisation of smaller, popular parties as voters will no longer feel they are \"throwing their vote away\" if they vote for the smaller party.\r\n\r\nHere is a very well presented explanation of Approval Voting by the YouTube Channel, Thought Cafe, that can hopefully can explain it better than I can:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCWjioIlVis",
