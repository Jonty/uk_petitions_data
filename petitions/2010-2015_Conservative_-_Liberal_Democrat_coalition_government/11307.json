This petition calls for Government to pass a new \"stop and assist\" law making it a legal requirement for citizens to assist people in distress, with criminal liability for bystanders who fail to do so. Such laws currently exist in other European countries including Spain, Germany and France, where the failure to provide assistance is punishable with imprisonment or a fine. ",
