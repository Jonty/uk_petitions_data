I speak for many people,  but all for one why aren't we stopping them from returning?\r\n\r\nWe deport foreigners for petty crimes such as theft or misilanius crimes.\r\n\r\nWe do not want fighters coming back to glorify faith killings. We don't hear of our soldiers doing the same.\r\n\r\nWe need to remove all Jihadist fighters so that our streets and homes are safe for our children to be children.\r\n\r\nPlease support this for a safer UK a beter UK.\r\n\r\nWE ARE GREAT BRITAIN!
