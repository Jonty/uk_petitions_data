        "additional_details": "Unlicensed pedicabs are a constant nuisance to residents in Fitzrovia, Mayfair, Soho and The West End.\r\n\r\nMany play loud music or have lights flashing in the early hours of the morning.\r\n\r\nMany take up space on pavements outside buildings, impeding local residents from accessing their homes.\r\n\r\nMany pedicab operators prey on late night revelers, pestering them to hire their vehicles at high expense.\r\n\r\nPedicabs are currently unlicensed and uncontrolled.  This means that people who hire them have no way of telling whose vehicle they are hiring and it is very difficult for local residents to report incidences of nuisance noise.\r\n\r\nWe want the Government to ban unlicensed pedicabs from London's West End.",
