        "additional_details": "In my part of town the bird population has been severely reduced over the last ten years. We have lost nearly all the birds and are left with at least three species of Birds of Prey, particularly  sparrowhawks. I miss seeing and hearing the songbirds and feel the RSPCA'S policy of protecting some species of hawk is outdated, due to the large number of hawks present.\r\nMany people feed the birds in their garden and if asked whether they would rather see blackbirds or sparrowhawks, I am sure the majority would say the former.\r\nThe RSPCA members that decide to protect all hawks seem obsessed with them and are unable or unwilling to review the situation  to allow for the protection of other birds which the public prefer. Even the TV channels wildlife programmes seem obsessed with promoting  Birds of Prey.\r\n\r\nI petition for the protection of ALL hawks be reviewed annually and the RSPCA be held accountable for their decisions.",
