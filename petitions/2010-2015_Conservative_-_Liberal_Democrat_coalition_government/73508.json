        "additional_details": "Anaphylaxis is a severe life threatening allergy which can strike at any time. Treatment is by adrenaline injections, which sufferers must carry at all times. Failure to administer adrenaline immediately can result in death, or lengthy hospital stays. Adrenaline injections are not free on prescription, unlike medications for other illnesses (e.g. diabetes). Injections go out of date easily and need to be renewed regularly. This is very costly for the patient. Stop discrimination against anaphylaxis sufferers and make adrenaline injections free on prescription.",
