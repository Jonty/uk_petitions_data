This leaves the women of Tendring, who wish to have a hospital birth no local choice of where they give birth.  They will have to go to Colchester general Hospital to use an already over stretched unit.\r\n\r\nWe want this decision reversed, and for the decision of where woman give birth given back to the women it directly affects.",
