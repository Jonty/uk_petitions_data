        "additional_details": "Having been a resident in Alton for nearly 10 years, I have noticed the increase in the dog fouling on the footpath and grassed play areas that surround Wooteys the Infant / Junior school.\r\nI also have a child who attends the school and on occasions he has had to have his shoes cleaned prior to going to school and when arriving home.\r\nI and a neighbour who have spoken to people believe the main problem in relation to this is the fact that people are walking there dogs unleashed and the dogs are wandering off and then fouling the footpath and grassed areas.\r\nThe aim of this petition is to get local residents parents and family to sign the petition for a by-law to be introduced to make dog owners keep their dogs on leads when walking them, this will then be easier to enforce and I think will cut down the dogs wandering off, and fouling on and around the footpath area and play areas in this area.\r\n\r\n",
