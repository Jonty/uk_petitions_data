Thereby making it MORE AFFORDABLE in this current financial climate  allowing the elderly to travel abroad for maybe 4/5 years, whereas a 10 year Passport may never be fully used because of  some infirmity, there would be no loss of revenue to the Government as people would simply renew as and when required !\r\n",
