It also acts as a virtual FREE advertisement for Camelot; which, I imagine, does not need it and, I would add, this free advertisement puts it at an advantage over companies which have to pay to advertise on commercial channels.  How can the B.B.C. afford this when the licence fee is being frozen?  This, of course, means that it has had to axe a number of programmes which, in my opinion, are FAR more worth keeping especially as a distinction from the commercial channels which have to show the most POPULAR programmes, as opposed to the most thought-provoking, due to their dependence on advertising.",
