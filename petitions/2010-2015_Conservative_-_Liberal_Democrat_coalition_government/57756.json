I just hope that MPs have got a few quid put away for their future, because SOMEBODY is going to HAVE TO DO SOMETHING PDQ to change the way we treat our taxpayers, and the first thing that must be done is to dispose of the 650 or so dishonourables who have CONTINUOUSLY demonstrated that they have ABSOLUTELY no interest in the well-being or welfare of the people of this country.",
