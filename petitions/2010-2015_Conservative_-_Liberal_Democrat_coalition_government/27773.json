Inspection results can be published and made widely available.  We believe that this system would be efficient and in the national interest as it allows us as a population which MPs are failing to uphold the very best standards.\r\n\r\nCriteria for marking could be fluid depending upon their role within the House of Commons but we believe it should again mirror Ofsteds criteria very closely.\r\n",
