        "additional_details": "This is a petition to open Fulham Boys School this September. Our boys were looking forward to starting here this year and their dreams have now been shattered. We met lots of staff members, had 2 transition days and our school uniform fittings. Then we get told 24 hours and just under 11 weeks to go the school will not open. How devastating is this to our boys? Us as parents got left with schools we didn't want but have an chose a fantastic school with a gutsy head teacher and 2 whole years of learning from FBS. Please reconsider your decision it, our children's education matter nothing else. We parents are backing FBS 100% and this petition was signed by friend an family and teachers whom we know and are as upset as us.",
