        "additional_details": "Noise Harassment from neighbours in new built houses, where walls are thin - deliberate low level noise at short intervals, to disturb a person, so as to make them leave.  This can be from banging pots and pans, triggering electronic noise, dragging furniture on the floor, banging doors, etc. - noises that is not necessary for a normal life to function, and they are constant at short intervals.\r\n\r\nEnvironment Health Officers from council cannot deal with it as the low noise is not counted as statutory.  And, police cannot deal with it either as it is not counted as criminal.  The courts cannot give a sensible judgment on it as there is no law to protect the victim from constant low level noises.\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Social Behaviour Act, 2003, has left out noise harassment, and in this category to include deliberate low level noises. This is affecting someone\u2019s day to day living.  I would like this to be added to the Anti-Social Behaviour Act, 2003,  Thanks.\r\n",
