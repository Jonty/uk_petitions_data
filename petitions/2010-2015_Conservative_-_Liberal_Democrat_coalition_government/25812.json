ROJ TV is not only the biggest Kurdish TV station but also the one with the highest viewing rates among all TV channels in Turkey.\r\n\r\nDespite this and maybe rather because of this the Turkish Government keeps putting pressure on the Danish government for closing down ROJ TV under the pretext of \u2018struggling against terrorism\u2019.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever it\u2019s clear that the Turkish Government\u2019s efforts are associated with the oppression of the Kurdish language which de facto is still forbidden as ROJ TV is broadcasting its news and cultural programmes in this particular language.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the pressure on Denmark as licenser demonstrates Turkey\u2019s dismissive attitude towards the freedom of press as it tries to close down a critical media coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\nROJ TV is our free voice and ROJ TV is enlightens our view on the world and on what is going on in Kurdistan",
