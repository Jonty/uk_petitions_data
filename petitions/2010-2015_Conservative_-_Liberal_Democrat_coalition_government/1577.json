        "additional_details": "Spending money on renewing a nuclear weapons program whilst telling the rest of the world not to have nuclear weapons is a savage hypocracy. These are not defensive weapons only offensive, if we renew we will never fire them. The money spent making and servicing these weapons is unjustifiable and pointless. The world is a safer place without nuclear weapons and we can be seen as global leaders in taking the world into an age without nukes if we chose not to renew. The world would be better off and we would be financially better off.\r\nSo I urge you to sign this petition and at least force a full debate on the renewing trident.",
