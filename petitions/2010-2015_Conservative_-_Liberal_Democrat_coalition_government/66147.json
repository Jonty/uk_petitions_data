Travel costs are now so expensive that finding the cost of travel in advance is impossible for many. Travel expenses may also not be claimed from private hospitals acting in NHS. Government should reintroduce travel warrants for long distance travel to NHS establishments or private hospitals acting for NHS for those who would be eligible for free prescriptions.",
