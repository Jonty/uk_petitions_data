        "additional_details": "Since a child I have been pushed towards being taught certain subjects that now have minimal use to me. I think that the education system should push children and teenagers to chase their dreams.\r\n\r\nI have always wanted to study film and be able to make steps in making movies. I had to wait until I reached the age of 16 before I was given the option to actually try film making. I think if teenagers such as myself would have the opportunities to chase our dreams from a younger age, we would be put under much less stress than we do under the current system.\r\n\r\nAlso many people aren't given the chance to really think of their dream as they are made to be too busy with the subjects that will be meaningless in the near future.\r\n\r\nSubject such as Mathematics and English should stay compulsory as people do need to know the basics. But the stress and pressure made on other subjects is too much.\r\n\r\nChase the Dream!",
