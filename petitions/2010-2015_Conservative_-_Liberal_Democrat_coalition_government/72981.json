        "action": "A unilateral suspension of the introduction of the new EU VAT laws for micro businesses and sole traders",
        "additional_details": "The new EU VAT regulations coming into force on 1 Jan 2015 change the way in which VAT (consumer tax) is charged on digital services - instead of the tax rate being applied according to where the supplier is located, the seller must determine where the buyer is located and apply the relevant local rate of tax to the purchaser.  So that means if you live in Italy and someone in Germany purchases your digital file, you need to pay VAT at the German rate to the German authorities. Just to be clear, that's a total of 75 different tax rates across 28 different markets!\r\n\r\nSmall business and sole traders will have to become VAT registered to trade with the EU.  The EU should be supporting small businesses not creating barriers to trade.\r\n",
