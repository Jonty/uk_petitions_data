        "additional_details": "In the last twenty to thirty years the notion put forward about rehabilitation in prison has not worked. Serious offenders commit crime and often serve a reduced sentence in a relatively luxurious way. If an offender commits a crime he/she should serve a punishing sentence, without luxuries. For the first three months an offender should be on the basic nutrients and should work to achieve their luxuries and status to be allowed back to freedom. If he/she has good behaviour for the first three months then a reward of some television time and so on. Excercise/education should be allowed.Work should consist of general upkeep of their suroundings and other work to benefit the state such as chain gangs cleaning roads and ditches, digging roads for resurfacing and the like. Tougher attitudes toward crime will make prison a deterrent to committing crime.",
