        "additional_details": "In keeping with the recent moves to allow homosexual marriage, straight couples deserve the right to be classed as homosexual and refer to themselves as 'gays'.\r\n\r\nWe petition the government to recognise the discriminatory nature of the use of these terms as exclusive to same sex couples.\r\n\r\nWe petition the government to amend legislation so that anyone can refer to themselves as gay or homosexual, whether they are or not, and that the option appears on all forms and registers as an option alongside marital status, gender etc.\r\n\r\n'gay' and 'homosexual' should be recognised as being a term of personal preference, and should not actually stand for anything, in the same way that marriage no longer means 'between a man and woman'.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the term 'husband and wife' should become purely a matter of choice. Either or both partners in a marriage should be at liberty to choose either term, and this should be recognised in law.",
