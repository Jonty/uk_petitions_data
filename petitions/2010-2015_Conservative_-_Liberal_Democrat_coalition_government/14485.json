This is also a problem when the bill payer may not be the person using the phone. It is difficult to get these stopped as they constanly change their text number and even more difficult to get your money back. It should be a legal reuiremnet for all service providers to allow all chargeable received messages from any service to be blocked when requested and possible options for all phones to allow these to be blocked without being charged",
