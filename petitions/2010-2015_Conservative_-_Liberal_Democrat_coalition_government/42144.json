        "additional_details": "We want the UK government to impose a 20% turnover tax on Global companies with a UK turnover of \u00a350 million or above.\r\n\r\nThe turnover tax should be applied to any company that declares low profits in the UK but very high profits in a tax haven or low tax country AND where tax haven profits are largely contributed to by the UK arm of the same corporation.\r\n\r\nWhy should you vote for this petition?\r\n*  It is unfair for these global corporations to 'syphon' money from the UK in this manner.\r\n\r\n* It gives many global  companies an unfair competitive advantage which is slowly putting UK only businesses out of business.\r\n\r\n*  Such practices are often a tax on the lower classes of UK society, making millions for the most wealthy in society.\r\n\r\n* This tax is far better than increasing the tax burden on ordinary people.",
