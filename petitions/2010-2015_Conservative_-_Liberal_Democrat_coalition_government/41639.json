        "additional_details": "The ABAE & AIBA boxing associations state that all boxers must be clean shaven before a fight.\r\n\r\nThis is a violation of Human Rights as some religions such as Islam and Sikhism make it compulsory to keep a beard. This rule therefore deprives them of competing in the sport and shows total disregard of the Equality Act 2006.\r\n\r\nDue to inadequate reasoning behind the ban of beards, I think it is necessary that we all speak up and change this unnecessary ban to allow practising Muslims and Sikhs to compete in boxing if they wish to do so. We must stand up now so that we can set precedent and highlight the fact that we will not allow for our human rights to be abused.\r\n\r\nPlease show your support by signing and sharing this petition to help change this absurd rule.",
