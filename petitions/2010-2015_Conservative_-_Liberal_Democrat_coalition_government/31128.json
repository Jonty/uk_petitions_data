        "additional_details": "Universities are increasingly discriminating against independent school pupils in their admissions. I want the government to ensure that all pupils are looked at equally, whether they are state or independently educated.\r\nThere seems to be the assumption that independent pupils pay their money and get their results, but they too have to work extremely hard for these results.\r\nIn many schools - state and independent - competitive entrance exams mean that only the brightest are selected. Such schools are full of very clever pupils.  They have proven their ability through such an entrance exam, and it would follow that a highly selective school's results would be very high. I do not see the sense in holding these people back for the sake of envy.",
