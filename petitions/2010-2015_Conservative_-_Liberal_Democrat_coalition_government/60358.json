This would have a huge impact on improving a deprived area of South London:\r\n- better transport links to jobs and facilities in East London (current bus services are slow and indirect, tube overcrowded and national rail provision disjointed)\r\n- increase in footfall for local businesses\r\n- assist with regeneration of Somerlyton Road area and Loughborough Junction",
