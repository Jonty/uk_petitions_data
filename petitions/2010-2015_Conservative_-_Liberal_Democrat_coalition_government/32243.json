        "additional_details": "Please could the government simplify, and make more fair, the tax system with regard to family related benefits, tax credits, vouchers, etc. I propose that the government scrap benefits for working families above the Basic Rate of income tax threshold and instead introduce a system of Tax Allowances. In addition to the Personal Allowance for the tax payer, families should be able to claim allowances for non-working spouse and for each child. Single parents should have an additional allowance as a Head of Household.\r\n\r\nThis kind of system would be more fair to families, help to encourage people to work, be simpler to understand, and would save the government and employers hundreds of millions of pounds in administration costs (if recent estimates on the cost of introducing child benefit tax charges is any guide).",
