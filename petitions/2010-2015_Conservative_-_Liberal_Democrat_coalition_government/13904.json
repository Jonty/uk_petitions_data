The opt out has to be honoured by the sender within 28 days, and the address tagged so that no further mail shots are sent to that address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an additional benefit, reducing the number of unwanted commercial mailings will save money for Local Councils who will not have to use landfill or recycling utilities to dispose of millions of bits of unwanted paper each week.\r\n",
