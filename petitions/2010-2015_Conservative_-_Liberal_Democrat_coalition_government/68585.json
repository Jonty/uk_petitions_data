        "additional_details": "India has introduced the death penalty for rape convictions BUT rape is still soaring.\r\nJune 2014, two young girls were hanged from a tree after being gang raped in India. A minister from the ruling party said that rape \"is a social crime, sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese are every day occurrences in India. Rape is the fastest growing crime in India, increasing by 902% over 1971 to 2012. Rape is reported approx. every 20 minutes.\r\nUK government should help women of India. By reasoning with India\u2019s political party, we can make them realise that the world is disgusted by their lack of response to rape crimes.\r\n\r\nIndia needs to take the following action:\r\n1.\tEducate for Equality\r\n2.\tMake laws count\r\n3.\tPut more women in power\r\n4.\tSelf-defense classes for women\r\nWith the help of the UK government we can put pressure on India to take action, not just by changing the law but implementing compulsory programs that can help sustain the safety of women.\r\n",
