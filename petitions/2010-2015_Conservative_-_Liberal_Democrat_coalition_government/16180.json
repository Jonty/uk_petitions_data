After all, not everyone can afford them or necessarily wants them. My proposal is to force Sky, etc. to give up 1 English Premier League match a week during the season and for it to be then shown on normal, terrestrial tv. In my opinion, kids, even the poorest of them, need access to sport on telly in order to develop an interest in them. ",
