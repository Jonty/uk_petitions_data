        "additional_details": "As the concerned husband of a dedicated and professional Primary school teacher I am becoming increasingly concerned over the increasing amount of 'box ticking' and planning that I don't believe anyone apart politicians are benefiting. Please, please, please just let teachers teach.  For example, what possible good does 'videoing' pupils completing a task achieve??? My wife, and I believe most teachers, are at breaking point.  She is at breaking point because she cares about her pupils education and not the reputation of politicians. Please sign this petition as a concerned teacher, partner of a teacher, head teacher, parent of a pupil.  The current practice is completely unsustainable. Thank you and please help make a desperately needed difference.",
