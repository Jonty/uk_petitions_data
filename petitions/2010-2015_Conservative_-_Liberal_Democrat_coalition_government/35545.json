        "additional_details": "Every food like fruits vegetables herbs fungi chocolate etc are healthy, obviously! Some things like poo we dont eat or we dont drink bleach and that doesnt make those things criminal! So reason & logic pls.\r\n\r\nMagical mushrooms are like a piece of chocolate gives a mild happy buzz, not hallucinations like for example some mps are delusional imagining our world needs nuclear weapons, or innocent ppl to be called criminals!\r\n\r\nA long time ago when i ate some i didnt think differently but felt for example that plants and trees are alive, i felt a beauty of life. the stresses in life perhaps made a neurology of discontent which these happy little mushrooms very much helped heal :) So we encourage our mps, u can organise a happy fair productive society, not bullying innocent peace loving people who understand NATURAL medicines.\r\n\r\nLovingly and patiently.... We sign that magic mushrooms which grow in our fields are in every way innocent, mps yes u can be happy & agree :) ty xxx",
