All MPs are elected to represent their constituents and not the wishes of one man. It is immaterial whether or not that person is Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister is confident that the right course of action is to stay in the EU he should have nothing to fear from free and frank discussions of this issue in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThis petition request support for all MPs to be allowed a free vote on the EU Referendum Bill following full discussion of the facts in parliament.\r\n",
