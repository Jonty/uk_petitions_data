        "additional_details": "The government is justifying exponential increases in rail fares by stating that those people who use the railway system should be required to pay for it, and not the taxpayer.  For years people have been asking for the principle of 'high users should pay more' to the Road Fund Tax scheme.  If you drive 5000 miles a year in your car you pay the same as somebody who drives 500,000 miles a year in his car.  SCRAP THE ROAD FUND LICENCE AND ADD AN AMOUNT TO THE PRICE OF A LITRE OF FUEL.  HIGH FUEL USERS DRIVE MORE MILES AND THEREFORE WILL PAY PROPORTIONATELY MORE FOR THEIR PROPORTIONATELY MORE USE OF THE ROAD SYSTEM.",
