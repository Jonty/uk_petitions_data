        "additional_details": "Moving the clocks forward at the end of February instead of the end of March would make it feel that Spring has come a month early!  This small change would put more hours of daylight where we want them most.  Postponing dusk by an hour would make March a proper Spring month, creating enhanced health and wellbeing, with greater opportunities for after-school and after-work activities: more sports, more gardening, and a boost to the economy. There would be a huge psychological impact: who doesn't want 8 months of \u201csummer\u201d and only 4 months of \u201cwinter\u201d?\r\n\r\nThe problems associated with later sunrises, particularly felt in the North of England and Scotland - which have so far stopped the introduction of year-round British Summer Time - would be minimised by making the change in February, leaving the other winter months as they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
