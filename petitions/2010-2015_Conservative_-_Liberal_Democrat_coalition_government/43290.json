        "additional_details": "No one deserves to come home from university only to discover that they have been made unemployed. He may be lazy and not very fast, but we feel that Milan Mehta has unfairly been made redundant from his paper round. He has held this position for the previous eight years but now has been left to fend for himself. Without an internship at the Goldman Sachs, how else will he be able to continue to session? We aim to collect at least 100,000 signatures so this issue may be discussed in parliament. So please share this petition.",
