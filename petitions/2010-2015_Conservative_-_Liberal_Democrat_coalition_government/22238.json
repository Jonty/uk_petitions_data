        "additional_details": "Dangerous dogs are quite rightly destroyed if they savage, injure or kill a human being, especially a child.\r\nDangerous  dogs regularly attack, savage and kill other household pets such as cats.\r\nThere is no compensation for the cat owner. The dog is not destroyed and could go on to savage a child or other pet. This is unacceptable.\r\nThe government should tighten up the laws on dangerous dogs. These laws should automatically include the legal right to seek compensation from the owner of a dangerous dog, for any pet owner whose family pet is attacked, savaged,or  killed by a dangerous dog.\r\nThe dog that committed the attack on, or savaging of, or killing of any other pet should be automatically be seized by the police and put down. Such an animal should be legally deemed too dangerous to other animals and humans to keep as a family pet. ",
