        "additional_details": "The purpose of this e-petition is to ask for a long overview debate by Parliament on the rights of Fathers and Mothers and their children following divorce by:\r\n- Ensuring both Parents must have automatic equality of access to the children\r\n- That the children have the right of freedom of expression to see both Parents\r\n- That children are not unduely influenced or controlled by one or other Parent against access rights\r\n- That CSA or voluntary payments are allowed to take into consideration the financial position of both Parents\r\n- That CSA/Voluntary payments are made in accordance with the Parents having fair and reasonable access to those children\r\n\r\nIf it is to be believed that Children are better having a relationship with BOTH Mother and Father, then the only way to achieve this is a step change in the Law to encourage this to happen",
