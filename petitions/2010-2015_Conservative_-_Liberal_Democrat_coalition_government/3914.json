        "additional_details": "It has been called the death of the countryside. Fox Hunting is one of the greatest traditions in  the UK and is still widely practised across the countryside in which tens of thousands of people partake and enjoy. We should not just push this issue into a corner and forget about it. When fox hunting was banned 51% supported the ban. But 49% were pro hunting and should not be sidelined because of only 2%. We demand a referendum to revoke the ban on Fox Hunting.",
