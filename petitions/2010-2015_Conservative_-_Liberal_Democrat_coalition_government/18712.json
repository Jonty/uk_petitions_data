If a 1p tax was place upon each text sent, over \u00a31.5bln could be raised per annum. The onus would be placed upon the telecommunication companies as to whether they pass on the cost to consumers as well as the mechanisms as to how this would be done. This would be a high revenue raiser without large cost to each individual.",
