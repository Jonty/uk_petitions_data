We want people who can contribute to our economy not those that want to use us for extreme acts of violence its not what this country is about. These people need to apply to come into the country and obtain visa's, they should be vetted to the highest level, anyone with a criminal record in their own country should not be allowed to enter ours. This is just common sense i do not want my country to become a war zone.",
