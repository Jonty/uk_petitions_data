        "additional_details": "There is a group that claim to be a religion that call them self's scientologist's. |However they are not in fact a religion at all they use the status to get TAX BREAKS and to rip off the UK tax payers. Scientology was created by a fictional writer in 1952 called Ron hubbard that has openly admitted he did it to make his first million dollars. However it seems to have gone too far expanding to other country's. They charge a joining fee and take up to 10% of your monthly income. Which affects our economy with people having little money to start with and the fact NO religion should take money to be a part of it. Basically they a psychologists but in a bad way please watch the documentary.\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4PDZt74adg\r\nif you don't have time just read the comments.\r\nplease help the UK and ban this business,cult or supposed religion from the UK and save another couple of million pound for the cash strapped Britain\r\nThank you",
