Therefore we believe Mr Gove should aim to bring the Average UK Class Size in state schools down to be 'broadly in line' with those in the Private Sector.\r\n\r\nAs Mr Gove is so keen on Performance Related Pay could we also suggest that for every 1% reduction in the average state school class size that he achieves he should receive a 1% increase to his own salary and for every 1% increase in class size he is docked 1% of his pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
