A life for a life simple as that, currently murderers get life sentences and get looked after in prison comfortably, by bringing back the death penalty we could save a fortune on taxpayers money and rid society of these animals.Sign the petition and pass it on we need 100.000 signatures for this to be discussed in parliament, the majority of people agree with this lets make our voices heard!",
