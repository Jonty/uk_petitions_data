In these times of economic uncertainty and high unemployment, we believe that underused land should be used productively to create orchards, community and children's gardens and food growing spaces. We believe that there are a wide range of community, health and environmental benefits which can come from this.\r\n\r\nWe believe that there should be a presumption in favour of  people being able to grow things on underused land unless there are strong reasons why not.\r\n\r\n",
