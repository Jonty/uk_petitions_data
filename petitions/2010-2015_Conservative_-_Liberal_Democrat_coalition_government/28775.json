        "additional_details": "Luis Suarez was charged with racially abusing Patrice Evra with no evidence and on the basis that Evra was 'probably telling the truth', despite video evidence contradicting Evra's statement.\r\nThere is video evidence seen by millions of John Terry calling Anton Ferdinand a 'f***ing black c*nt', yet had his case postponed for 6 months because he is England captain.\r\nTherefore, the FA should be investigated for corruption, and all charges and fines against Suarez should be sricken from his record and money should be reimbursed, including being paid compensation.",
