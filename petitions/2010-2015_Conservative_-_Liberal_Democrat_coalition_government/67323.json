Moving our van seems spurious, as we can already walk to McDonald's greggs ect, so this will have no effect on stopping the few from over eating\r\n4. The vans don't just sell burgers\r\n\r\nThis is for all burger van's face in this action,\r\nplease help me save our van's, it's not up to the council what I eat as long as I am healthy . Did Prohibition worked in the USA. I am 14 years old and need all the help I can get, please help\r\n\r\n",
