        "additional_details": "The concerns of MK residents have been treated with contempt. Ever since 2005, where central government bodies have authority for planning, no grid roads have been created or extended, and existing grid roads have been downgraded. If localism means anything, then the planning powers must be returned to MK Council. These outside bodies work contrary to the wishes of MK residents, ignore local transport policies, and go directly against the Core Strategy, which was published under the previous LibDem council and is now endorsed by the current Conservative administration. Allow elected councillors decide on planning matters for Milton Keynes.\r\n\r\n",
