        "additional_details": "We are calling for radical change in a broad array of different costs associated with new drivers: A re-think into provisional license fees and testing costs. An immediate change into how younger drivers are insured on the roads with an aim to drastically reduce monthly/yearly premiums which are, more often than not, more than the car\u2019s selling price.\r\n\r\nIn particular, as mentioned above, this re-think must heavily focus on the inequality young drivers face when paying for car insurance.  It is ludicrous that new drivers, most of whom are still in full time education, are being expected to pay an ever increasing fee on top of University loans, living costs, the rises in petrol prices\u2026\r\n\r\nWe, signed within, demand that this government looks at this request for discussion and acts upon it within 12 months of receiving 100,000 names.\r\n",
