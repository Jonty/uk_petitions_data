Instead of deduct the council payment from mine, nursery got creative with their rates and revised the DAILY fee I was paying (\u00a33.50/h meals incl) to an HOURLY fee of \u00a34+meals. The regulations set by the government are open to interpretation and nurseries are using this 'loophole' to indulge themselves. \u00a320/w = \u00a3760/y the nursery is receiving \u2013 for one child! x40 children =\u00a330k/y for 1 nursery! IT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY\r\nI've contacted my local council (disinterested) and MP, who then involved MP Nicky Morgan (Sec. State for Ed.) both politely said although this 'top up fee' exploit is 'unacceptable' it's up to the local council to take action\r\nThe scheme needs readdressing to be fairer to parents and not line nursery owner\u2019s pockets!",
