Please restore the county boundaries of Lancashire for cultural and ceremonial purposes. Transport fire and policing could still be grouped together in the Manchester area and work as they currently do. The name \"Greater Manchester\" should be consigned to the history books once and for all.\r\n\r\nWhat was ever wrong with SELNEC (South East Lancashire and North East Cheshire). At least the towns could have remained in there proper counties.\r\n\r\nBolton, Rochdale, Oldham, Bury,  Ashton U Lyne and Manchester are all Lancashire towns ",
