        "additional_details": "I was horrified to hear the graphic reports in the media relating to the circumstances surrounding the death of Lee Rigby. What benefit does the general public gain to hear such details.  His parents should not have to suffer this information becoming public knowledge.  General details, yes.  This over zealousness for the media to report such graphic details is unacceptable for all such similar cases, of which there are many! I would like the government to legislate what is deemed as in the public interest and what goes beyond and is totally unnecessary.  Please support this petition - it could be your loved one.",
