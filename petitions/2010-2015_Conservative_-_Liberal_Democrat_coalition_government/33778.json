        "additional_details": "With no public consultation Pay & Display machines are appearing in car parks in the unspoilt areas of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThese have been placed by the Forestry Commision -who claim money raised will pay for \"new exciting attractions\"\r\n\r\nBen Venue and similar locations are fine as they are without \"new exciting attractions\".\r\n\r\nCharges are \u00a33 for a day. I'm expected to accept this because it represents \"good value compared to urban charges\".\r\n\r\n\r\nAbove all - this is yet another tax on the people. They will try and spin it and sugar coat it for all they are worth but please fight these charges - it is greed, it is profit grabbing, it is trying to get a return in pounds and pence from those who just want to get out there and escape the madness for a while.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Forestry Commission does some great work in its management of large chunks of our beautiful land and I support many aspects of their work. If the charges were voluntary I would actually pay !! Not as mad as it sounds.\r\n",
