        "additional_details": "After separation, only one parent can receive the Child Benefit, and all other benefits are directly tied to Child Benefit. In a case where 2 children spend 3 days a week with one parent and 4 days a week with the other, the division of care would be 43%/57%, and the division of benefits would be 0%/100%. The total annual income to support both children (assuming an earned income of \u00a30, and taking into account only Child Benefit and tax credits) would be \u00a30/\u00a35400. In addition, the parent who has the children 4 days a week can claim child maintenance of up to 8% of the other parent\u2019s income. Assuming the national average wage this would be \u00a347 per week.\r\nTotal annual difference:\r\n\u00a310,288 in favour of the parent who spends only 1 day a week more with the children.\r\nThis disparity needs to be addressed and discussed in Parliament and a solution found a simple solution is to split Child Benefit and associated benefits/credits according to the amount of care each parent provides.",
