        "additional_details": "Deportation of three Polish nationals, currently serving minimum 32 years each in the UK for the murder of Catherine Wells-Burr.\r\nCatherine Wells-Burr was murdered by three Polish Nationals, on 12th September 2012. For financial gain.\r\nThe UK Immigration Agency are considering deporting Rafal Nowak, Anna Lagwinowicz and later  Tadeusz Dymtryszyn (pending an appeal) back to Poland to serve a lower tariff than was set by our British Justice System.\r\nIn Poland, they will serve only 25 years. They do not take into consideration the planning, the disposal and burning of Catherine\u2019s body.\r\n7 years will be taken of their sentence and they will then be given a clean \u2018slate\u2019 and life can move on. By going back to Poland they get rewarded, less time served and a fresh start.\r\nWe urge our Government to act accordingly. We believe in our Laws. If the crime is committed in this country, then our rules apply.\r\n",
