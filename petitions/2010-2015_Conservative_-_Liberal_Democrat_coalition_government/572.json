        "additional_details": "The 2010 SDSR stated an intention to use 3 Commando Brigade as rapid intervention forces, but to do so only at battlegroup strength, or roughly one third of the fighting strength of the full brigade.\r\nAs a result the Navy will lose a significant proportion of the amphibious shipping that permits British forces to be inserted into a hostile theatre of operations.\r\nThe Forces are suffering from tens years of overstretch, will remain focused on Afghanistan until 2015 and on recuperation until 2020, but we must return to brigade strength amphibious capability from that point onwards.\r\nThe brigade is the Army's principle unit for combined arms manoeuvre warfare, and the basic building block of the medium scale operations we aim to be capable of.\r\nThere is also the small matter of the Falklands. 3Cdo do not defend the islands, a task accomplished by the FDF, they do act as an insurance policy that states; \u201cwe will always be able to take the islands back of you!\u201d\r\nAction - acquire amphibs.",
