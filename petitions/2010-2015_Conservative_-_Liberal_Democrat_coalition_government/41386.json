        "additional_details": "We the undersigned are appalled that in the 21st century cleaners employed on the ISS cleaning contract on London Underground continue to suffer from exploitation and are employed on far inferior basic conditions than their other London Underground colleagues. We note the ISS contract is due to expire in March 2013. We believe that the contract should be brought back in house and that not only will this lead to the more effective management and provision of cleaning services on London Underground but will ensure that cleaners have the same basic conditions as their other London Underground colleagues including decent pensions, fair sick pay and holidays and dignity and respect at work.
