Freeing the patient from a life sentence of pain and disability.\r\n\r\nMany PCT's up and down the UK are refusing to allow this keyhole surgery on the NHS and so are condemning many young people to a life that is hugely restricted by pain and disability. Sufferers are often unable to work, participate in any sport, or simply be involved in ordinary day to day life activities.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to gather enough support to oppose these PCT's rulings.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your support",
