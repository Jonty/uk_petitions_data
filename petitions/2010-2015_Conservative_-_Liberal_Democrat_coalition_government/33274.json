No one should profiteer from old age in this way.  Huge fees affect families, local councils and local tax payers.\r\n\r\nIn the voluntary sector, homes would have better investment with more money being used so staff have better training, reduce turn over of staff, have greater confidence from residents and relatives and reduce the incidents of abuse.\r\n\r\n",
