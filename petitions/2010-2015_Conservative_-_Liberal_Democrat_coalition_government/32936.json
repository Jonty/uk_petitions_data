        "additional_details": "We want the DWP to actively & fully promote the use of  the term Survivor rather than the negative derogatory term  Disabled.\r\nWhy? Because We regard ourselves as Survivors, Not victims with a Disability. We believe that the use of negative derogatory names  undermines the effective work done by Survivors, their carers & companions within society. The use of the term disabled can be seen as offensive to millions of active disabled. It infers that there is something missing from our lives, That we are not quite whole. We are Less than perfect. Survivors would prefer people to look upon them as people with abilities. We are Survivors not victims.\r\n\r\n\r\nin these days of unwanted Austerity cuts &  Benefit reforms The lives of Disabled people are increasingly being pushed to the margines of society. It is hoped that by using a more positive metafore in order to discribe a person with disabilities Society will become more tolerant & accepting of Survivors. ",
