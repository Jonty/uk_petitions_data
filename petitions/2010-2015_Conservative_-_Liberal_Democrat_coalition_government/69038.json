They were threatened with a protection order which would stop them from even seeing their child.\r\n\r\nThe international arrest warrant must be invalidated and it must be made clear to the Spanish authorities that the parents should be freed.\r\n\r\nOnce they are free and reunited with Ashya, the doctors involved must be investigated.",
