THEY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO CLAIM ASYLUM AND PUT ON REDUNDANT OIL RIGS IN THE NORTH SEA, GIVEN BREAD AND WATER ONLY, THEN THEY WILL REALISE THAT THE PROMISED LAND HAS NOT BEEN REACHED. THEY SHOULD NOT TAKE PRIORITY ON THE NHS OR HOUSING AS THIS SHOULD BE FOR UK RESIDENTS WHO PAY FOR THIS SERVICE. CHILDREN BORN HERE TO ILLEGALS SHOULD NOT GAIN UK CITIZENSHIP, JUST TO ALLOW ILLEGALS TO STAY. BRITISH PRIORITY IS TO BRITISH CITIZENS AND NOT AFGHANS, IRAQUIS, SOMALI'S ETC. THEY SHOULD NOT GET ANY BENEFIT. PLEASE SIGN AND SUPORT THIS AND HELP ME TO HELP YOU",
