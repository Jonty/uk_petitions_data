        "additional_details": "maths is one of the most important subjects across children's education. Numbers, shapes etc are some of the basics every child needs to know, but when it comes to the point when your child is seating his/her G.C.S.E maths, there is one topic that stands out - ALGEBRA. You can not call Algebra an important topic to study at G.C.S.E level because it gives you no useful information for the majority of jobs that are out there. Really, who needs to know what X4 x 3PQ is.? I think Algebra should be scraped as a topic from G.C.S.E maths and studied at A-level or Degree and should be left to the minds of the pupils if they chose to study Algebra or not. ",
