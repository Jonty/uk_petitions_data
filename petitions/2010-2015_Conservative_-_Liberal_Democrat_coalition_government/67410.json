        "additional_details": "We wish the government (of any persuasion) to immediately reject, or if already enacted, in the future to repeal the   new law announced on the 10th July 2014 which requires Internet and phone companies to retain data on British subjects.  There is no logical reason for the   government / parliament to enact this law as the powers to intercept, where the  police and security forces have reasonable suspicion, already exist.  The ability to trawl historic data can have no significant effect on the security of British citizens.",
