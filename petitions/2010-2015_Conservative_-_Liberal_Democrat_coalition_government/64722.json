        "additional_details": "We currently have over 800 of our children still unallocated a primary school in Hertfordshire, with many other families being offered school places outside their locality which is neither practical nor in our children's best interests.  As yet we have been given no clear or acceptable answers with regard to the provisions that are being implemented to provide school places for the growing population across Hertfordshire, despite further plans for housing developments.  We must protect our children's interests and futures, and demand that action be taken.",
