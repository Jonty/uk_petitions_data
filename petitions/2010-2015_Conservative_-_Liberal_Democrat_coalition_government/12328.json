        "additional_details": "Too many people in the UK are struggling and stuck in dead end jobs on minimum wage. Employees who have spent many years working for a company in the private sector feel under valued and overlooked when it comes to promotional opportunities within the workplace. Many are demoralised when companies favour academic qualifications of external candidates over experience and length of service of employees already in the business when it comes to promotion.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is legislation that give strict guidelines to businesses to ensure they are putting existing employees first in regards to management opportunities. This will also help less qualified people find work at entry level and therefor create more jobs for people who feel they have few prospects.",
