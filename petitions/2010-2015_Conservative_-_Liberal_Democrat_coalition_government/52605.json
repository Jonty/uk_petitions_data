        "additional_details": "Successive governments throw money away in reorganising the NHS without addressing the real issue that is causing it to fail. It is over stretched looking after people who should not be there, such as the elderly, infirm or mentally ill. This is due to repeated government policies which have decimated care in our society for those in need of more than basic care.\r\nThis is such a large issue it needs a central government solution eg don't build the rail link that will save business 1 hour but spend on purpose built homes and housing solution for groups in need.\r\nBenefits:\r\n-  Multi trade employment through building programs\r\n-  New jobs for care workers and related services\r\n-  Improved NHS capacity (and therefore improved care standards and lower costs)\r\n-   Improved health, therefore lower costs, in looking after these vulnerable groups\r\n-  Respect...(the government could certainly do with earning some)\r\n\r\n Win, win all round.",
