        "additional_details": "I would like to see the East Lincolnshire Railway returning some day, even though all of the route may not be able to return at least part of the route does. I think also a feasibility study should be carried out to work out the kind of figure needed for the eventual reinstatement of the Ludborough to Louth line via Fotherby Halt. Now the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway have received charitable status they can apply for funding and grants to help them to achieve their dream of returning trains back to the market town of Louth once again. Louth cannot be left without a rail connection for any longer as the last freight train pulled into Louth at the end of 1980 so that's more than 30 years ago since the town saw it's last train, something has to be done to help the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway reach their target and get to Louth!",
