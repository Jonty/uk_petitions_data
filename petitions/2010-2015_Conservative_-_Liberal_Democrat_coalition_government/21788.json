        "additional_details": "I believe that anyone who has fraudulently claimed benefits that they are not entitled to, should pay every single penny owed back to the state, or else get a prison sentence of at least 6 months - depending on how much the amount is.\r\n\r\nThe benefits are meant to be for people who really need it, and for so long fraudsters seem to be milking the system.  All fraudsters should be given the option of either allowing their assets to be seized, and all money raised is used to pay the state the money that is owed, or if they are left anything in a will, then whatever they are left, then that should be used instead - whichever option would cover the money owed.  I never thought that I would say this, but people like that make me feel ashamed of being disabled.",
