        "additional_details": "Ask the government to reverse the decision that allows Councils to  turn off our street lights between the hours of midnight and 5am. This policy will make our streets no go areas late at night for many members of the public. In Essex the savings will only be \u00a31,500,000 per annum. If the council were to increase the council tax to cover this cost it would be minimal for each household. Better safety than a small increase in tax.",
