Then they encourage you too keep rolling the debt over at \u00a385 a month, in the hope that you can't make the payment. And once you fail to pay they hound you like a dog. There are even companies out there that will charge you a fee for just redirecting you to a Payday website, this fee is sometimes as high as \u00a365 and you are not guranteed the loan. So the whole industry is corrupt and should be closed down ",
