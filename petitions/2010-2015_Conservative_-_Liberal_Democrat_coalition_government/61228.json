        "additional_details": "Moviestarplanet, is a website in which children create their character and move around a virtual world. Children sign up and play, simple. But a recent climb in pedophiles, perverts and child sex traffickers have signed up to the service, to abuse children. I believe it should be banned in the UK as it turns our children into anti-social beings with no respect, puts them at risk of pedophiles, and gives away private details.",
