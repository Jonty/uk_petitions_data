In 1944, shipping magnate and philanthropist Sir William Burrell donated almost his entire collection of art and antiquites to the city of Glasgow on the express condition that it was never loaned overseas.  Glasgow Life, on behalf of the City Council has applied to the Scottish Government to have this condition relaxed. As a mark of basic human decency, a man's last wishes should always be respected and upheld.",
