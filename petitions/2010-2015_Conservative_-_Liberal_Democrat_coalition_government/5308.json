        "additional_details": "It is about time that we introduced on-the-spot fines, and tow away zones for parking in disabled bays. With offenders published in local newspapers. Disabled people have enough problems without having to confront people who abuse bays, who often then verbally abuse those who confront them. It would generate much required income to Local Government, and change attitudes towards this disgraceful act.\r\nWe currently have disabled bays but they are rarely enforced.",
