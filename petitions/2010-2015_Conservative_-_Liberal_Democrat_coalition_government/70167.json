The list will be capped at 250 brands and reviewed every 3 years.\r\n\r\nLuxury Brands support jobs and contribute significantly to the UK economy, however in a period of prolonged austerity when the super wealthy risk evolving into a different species inhabiting a distant planet, a fairer VAT regime could help slow the alienation process and put some credibility into the \u2018We\u2019re all in it (the do-dah) together\u2019 slogan.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\nRalph Lauren\r\nPrada\r\nBurberry\r\nTiffany\r\nCartier\r\nHermes\r\nGucci\r\nLouis Vuitton\r\nBain and Company\r\nRolex\r\n\r\nThank you!",
