The main access in and out of the development would be through to of Luton's most congested roads, these being: Eaton Green Road and Luton Road/Crawley Green Road, the developers are not providing any funding to improve these roads, they will improve the roundabouts at the junction of Vauxhall wall, these is all well and good, but the traffic has to get their first.\r\n\r\n2. The extra traffic 1000+ cars will be going passed local schools and a local community centre.\r\n\r\n3. The nearest emergency services if needed would be from Luton (Bedfordshire) not Hertfordshire.\r\n\r\n4. The proposal is to built on one of the last areas of green open land available to people in the east of Luton.\r\n\r\n",
