        "additional_details": "This petition calls on the government to create a parliamentary constituency for UK overseas territories. This would include the Channel Islands, Gibraltar, the Falklands and others. Whilst these places have their own local government controlling education, transport etc, they should also have a voice in Westminster on issues such as defence and foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nRepresentation in Westminster would also reiterate that the residents of the Falklands are British citizens.",
