Why should somebody who contributes nothing to Society, but just takes, get a vote on who runs the Country?\r\nIf somebody wants the vote, then get out and start contributing to the Country and feed and clothe your own kids instead of expecting people who work to do it. I want the Government to restrict the vote to Taxpayers, Pensioners and people who have worked in the 2 years leading up to either a General election or a local election.",
