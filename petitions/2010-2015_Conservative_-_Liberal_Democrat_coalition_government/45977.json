        "additional_details": "Rescue centres all over Britain are bursting.\r\n\r\nMany more animals being advertised for sale. Many unwanted horses going for slaughter. Many animals are unnecessarily bred with bad genetics or temperaments that shouldn't be passed on through to another generation.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, A ban on breeding for a year should be enforced to give Welfare Organisations a chance to find these animals decent homes and with so many being bred its just not possible for them to keep up. Unfortunately, due to the amount of animals the rescue centres hold, they can't always monitor where these horses, dogs, cats etc end up and sometimes go to a terrible life of torture and abuse.\r\n\r\nA registration and licensing system should be put into place to stop this from happening. All animals are entitled to a good loving home and are suffering because of irresponsible breeding.\r\n\r\nSomething must be done and soon!\r\n\r\nPlease help and sign this petition for the sake of the future of our nations animals.\r\n",
