        "additional_details": "Government plans to set a minimum price per unit of alcohol sold. This will not effect the prices of drinks in Public Houses and nightclubs. However, it will effect the prices of wine, spirits and beer in the supermarkets.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind the pricing is to reduce binge drinking and alcohol related crime on our streets. However, prices in pubs and night clubs are substantially higher than supermarkets, this law would have zero effect on those committing crimes after leaving pubs and nightclubs. What evidence is there to show raising the price in supermarkets would prevent such crimes?\r\n\r\nWhat it means is those people who like a quiet drink at home, and buy their beer/wine in supermarket deals to save cash in these tight times during the recession, are being forced to pay for those that go out and break the law.\r\n\r\nI believe this is unacceptable. The government should not be interfering in the free market, and burdening the blame onto responsible drinkers.",
