        "additional_details": "Presently, the Healthy Start vouchers received by low income families can only be used for the 'step one' baby formula milk which is recommended for the first six months. After that, 'step 2' milk is available up to one year where cow's milk can be then given to the child. Healthy Start vouchers DO NOT cover 'step 2' formula milk which is as costly as 'step 1' milk. Do newborns suddenly not need sustenance or is there a perfectly reasonable explanation I'm missing? If not, then lets allow the use of the vouchers for the 6m-1 year formula milk.",
