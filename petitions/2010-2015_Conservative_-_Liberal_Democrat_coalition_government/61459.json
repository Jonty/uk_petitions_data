        "additional_details": "Poole Town FC have made plans to move into Poole Stadium, which is currently used for Speedway and Greyhound Racing. Speedway is on its knees in the UK and the last thing the sport needs is its biggest club being shut down because of Poole Town FC. Former AFC Bournemouth chairman Eddie Mitchell is behind this. He infamously told AFC Bournemouth fans to '**** off and watch Southampton' over the PA system after a supporters protest. This man cannot be trusted ",
