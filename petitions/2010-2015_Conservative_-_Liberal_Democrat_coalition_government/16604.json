We are a committed sports club that provide enjoyment to fans and players who can play to the highest amateur Rugby Union level in Manchester. We have the great fortune of 5 senior teams and junior teams of all ages. We come together to enjoy the excitement of this great game. Through out the years Broughton Park F.C. has developed, Junior and Senior international players. As all amateur clubs know, in all sports, it is extremely hard to raise funds to assist in the running of the clubs. Out with donations, sponsors and membership fees the one way a club can raise funds is from having a drinks license, through the bar, money can be raised and fed into the grass roots game. Broughton Park do not have one and have applied for one on numerous times.\r\nSupport us in allowing us to have a bar, and so raise funds to be fed back into our club.\r\nKind Regards\r\nBroughton Park Fans And Players.",
