It is not perceived as 'real illness' by the majority of people and the segregation and poor funding of mental health services compared to physical health services contributes to this situation. Please re-integrate mental health into mainstream health services and emphasise it is as valid and debilitating as any physical illness. Please also improve funding for patient care and ring fence the money allocated in mental health services to stop it being used by other departments within hospitals. And stop cutting services to the most vulnerable in our society. ",
