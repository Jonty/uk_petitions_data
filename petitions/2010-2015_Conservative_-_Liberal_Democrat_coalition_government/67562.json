School is where this needs to start, currently initial training does not specifically include autism, teachers are required to show they can seek specialist advice for concerns yet if they are not aware of the signs of autism how can they do this?so many children are given the \"bad behaviour\" label, these children are being failed. Early diagnosis means early intro of support and reduction in anxiety suffered by the child. ",
