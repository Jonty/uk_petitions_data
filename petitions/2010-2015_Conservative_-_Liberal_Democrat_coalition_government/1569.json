They always spit at us and complain about that we once enslaved them and all that politcally correct nonsense that their government has brainwashed them to believe.\r\n\r\nIts not our fault if their government cant look after its own people , Why is it always the UK that must take the brunt of everything?\r\n\r\nPersonally the HM's Government needs to look after its own people before donating another penny, Why else are a servicemen dying , why else are peopled dying due to neglect of the NHS?\r\n\r\nAt any rate , Sign this pention if you think aid to other countries should be DECREASED and aid to countries with a space program and nuclear weapons should be stopped alltogether. BRITISH people should come first, not people from other countries.",
