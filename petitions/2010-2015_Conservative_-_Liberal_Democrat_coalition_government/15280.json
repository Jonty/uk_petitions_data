        "additional_details": "Tony Cascarino used the word 'Holocaust' to explain Arsenal defender's Armand Traore performance today against Manchester United. He made his comment whilst a pundit on Sky Sports News. His comment was not only unnecessary but just made in plain ignorance. Sky Sports have apologized but more action needs to be taken. This is much worse than Andy Gray and Martin Tyler so minimum he should be sacked but also he should be taken to Yad Vashem and Auschwitz to be sown what a real Holocaust is. ",
