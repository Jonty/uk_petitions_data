Our efforts should not be devoted to ever more growth and consumption, particularly given the perilous size of the human population. Our capitalist systems are clearly out of step with what is required.\r\n\r\nHow can we migrate towards a fair society which recognises that time is the only thing we really have? A society which enables EVERY individual to contribute. A society which shares the fruits of this effort fairly and equitably. A society which conserves nature for all to enjoy, with sufficient time for everyone to enjoy it.  How do we achieve this without overzealous state control?\r\n\r\nI suspect most politicians give much thought to such issues, but feel their ideas are too big or radical to air.  I for one would like to hear some of our politician's more radical ideas. Support this e-petition if you would too.\r\n",
