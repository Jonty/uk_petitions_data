Contrary to this success, in recent times it appears that vested interests have managed to inveigle more and more smoking scenes into our TV dramas (particularly the publicly funded public-service BBC). Most if not all of these scenes are not enhanced by the smoking shown so they should be omitted altogether so as not to glamourize the unhealthy habit to the young. The usual exclamation of its necessity is 'atmosphere' but as most viewers already do not smoke what 'atmosphere' do the programme makes intend to transfer to us in our smoke-free Sitting Rooms?",
