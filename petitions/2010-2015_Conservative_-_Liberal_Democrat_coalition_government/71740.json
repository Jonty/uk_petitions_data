The public have been asked for their suggestions on how to minimise the impact of these cuts but they have not been properly consulted. We, the public in Denbighshire, would like to see all of the available options for cuts before agreeing to the cabinet recommendations. We would also like the opportunity to reconsider existing capital projects such as the proposed investment to the Nova Centre in Prestatyn and the sea front Aquatic Centre in Rhyl.",
