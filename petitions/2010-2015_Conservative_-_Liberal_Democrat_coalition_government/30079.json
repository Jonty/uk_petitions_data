        "additional_details": "\"On Feb. 27, a diplomatic process will begin in Geneva that could result in a new treaty giving the United Nations unprecedented powers over the Internet. Dozens of countries, including Russia and China, are pushing hard to reach this goal by year's end. As Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said last June, his goal and that of his allies is to establish \"international control over the Internet\" through the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a treaty-based organization under U.N. auspices.\r\n\r\nIf successful, these new regulatory proposals would upend the Internet's flourishing regime, which has been in place since 1988. The original treaty insulated the Internet from economic and technical regulation and quickly became the greatest deregulatory success story of all time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFuther reading:\r\nhttp://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204792404577229074023195322.html?mod=wsj_share_tweet",
