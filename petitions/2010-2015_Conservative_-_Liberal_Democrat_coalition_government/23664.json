        "additional_details": "The Cambridgeshire Clinical Priorities Forum has ruled that individuals first diagnosed with ADHD in adulthood will no longer receive methyphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, Equasym) on NHS prescription. This means that there will be NO front-line support given to people in these circumstances, and patients will be left to fend for themselves.\r\n\r\nAdult ADHD support group ADDventure Within are doing everything in their power to ensure this decision is reversed and much-needed secondary support is put in place by the NHS. As this GP Consortium is also a pilot programme, it may set a precedent for all medical practice in Adult ADHD across the whole of the UK.\r\n\r\nRight now, the people of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough need to speak up to ensure that Adult ADHD is taken seriously and vital support is put in place. Join this call to council members and MPs to have the Clinical Priorities Forum reverse their decision and put together a plan to address Adult ADHD needs in this region.",
