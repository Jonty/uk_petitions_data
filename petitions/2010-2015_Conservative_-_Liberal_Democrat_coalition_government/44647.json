        "additional_details": "How, in a Liberal Democracy, can it be legal for political, parliamentary parties to have an institution such as Whipping? Forcing MPs to vote along party lines contradicts the whole basis of parliaments. As such, such action should be outlawed; it will return power to the individual MPs, and so make them considerably more accountable to their constituents. Likewise, there should be protection for MPs who refuse to take the party line and vote long the lines of their principles or along the lines of their local voters. People do not vote for the party in power, they vote for their MP and yet said MP is constrained by means not directly elected.",
