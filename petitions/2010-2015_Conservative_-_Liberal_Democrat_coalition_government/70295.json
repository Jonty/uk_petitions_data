        "additional_details": "Support the return of Sunderland flying boat ML824 to her spiritual home - Pembroke Dock - and the caring hands of the Sunderland Trust.\r\nWe call on the MOD to negotiate with the RAF Museum to loan ML824 to the Sunderland Trust.\r\nIn 1961, ML824 was gifted by the French Navy to Pembroke Dock. After ten years external display she was donated to the RAF Museum Collection and fully renovated for which we are most grateful.\r\nThe Sunderland Trust has created a unique visitor attraction and wishes to explore the long term loan of this iconic aircraft and return ML824 to her \u2018spiritual home\u2019. She would \u2018star\u2019 as the centrepiece at the Pembroke Dock Heritage Centre, in a safe environment in what was the world\u2019s largest flying boat station, highlighting the unique roles of flying boats which helped win the Battle of the Atlantic. ML824 would return to the beautifully restored Royal Dockyard Chapel - a lasting memorial in Pembroke Dock, home of the Sunderland for more than 20 years.",
