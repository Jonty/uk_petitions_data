        "additional_details": "BMI takeover by BA has divided the BMI group and we as BMI BABY employees feel this takover should never have been approved. BMI employees are going to keep their jobs under new contracts with BA, however, BA have served noticed to BMI BABY staff without really offering us cabin crew jobs and are still employing new BA staff outside the takeover. The redundancy packages being offered to BMI BABY staff is poor and unfair as we are unable to seek new employment before september 10th without facing losing our redundandcy, thus missing out on other airline recruitment for this year. BA are also intending to use our aircrafts to supply their routes in London but still BMI BABY staff face job cuts. We just want to be heard and treated fairly its not just BMI BABY staff facing job losses but our ground staff face cuts as well. The Midland airports need our airline to serve lower income families the chance to go on holiday without extra travel costs to london airports. ",
