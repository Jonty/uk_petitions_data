If all organisations involved in care became social enterprises meaning that all monies and profits from this kind of care had to be re-invested in resources, training and development of staff and the environments they work in, staff would be paid well and vocationally motivated and communities would be supportive and happy to pay for services they feel are in the interests of clients. This could transform the lives of millions of people over many generations. ",
