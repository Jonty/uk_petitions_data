The contents are wholly inappropriate and the welfare of these children is being violated by these charity adverts. One does not outweigh the other. The childrens television channels should not air any such advertising at any time.\r\nIt has also taken away control from parents about how much exposure their children should get to such topics. Please sign this petition to put a stop to this violation and get charity advertising put back after the watershed and stop any charity advertising on children's channels.",
