        "additional_details": "If we give 10 million O.A.P's \u00a31 million each as a golden handshake deal to retire then that will create 10 Million new jobs for the Unenployed.\r\n\r\nThat intital investment of \u00a310 Million will then be spent by those O.A.P's on paying their mortgages and on consumerables such as TVs, Cars and other Luxury items meaning that the housing market will start moving again and demand for luxury good will increase and create new jobs.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this the economy will start moving again the deficit will shrink and people can start living their lives again rather than no one having any money to do or buy anything and being charged through the nose for necessary services.\r\n\r\nI invite the govenment to at least consider this idea and see if its actually a viable plan.",
