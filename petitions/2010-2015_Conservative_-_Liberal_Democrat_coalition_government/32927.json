        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition if it affects you. The change in child benefit will mean those who earn over 60K will lose it all whilst two people living together earning \u00a350K each will retain it. This means if you have three children earning 60K you will lose \u00a32256 per year. To make up this shortfall you would have to earn around another \u00a34950 per year. Two people earning 50K each with three children will be much better off than you. It is unjust for the Government to say that only a small number of people will be affected. The Government should set the limit at 100K per household or reduce child allowance based on total household earnings through self assessment",
