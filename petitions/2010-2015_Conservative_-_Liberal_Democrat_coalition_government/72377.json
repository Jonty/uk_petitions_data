        "additional_details": "The Campaign for the Living Wage in Care wants all direct care workers in the health and social care sector to be paid the living wage.\r\nThe level of commitment, training and responsibility would, in any other sector, be considered a professional role. Care workers are amongst the lowest paid and under-valued employees in the country.\r\nTheir crucial job demands the living wage to generate incentive; promote the best care practice and drive up the quality of employees caring for the most vulnerable in our society.\r\nWe want the government to introduce legislation ensuring that all staff delivering direct care in the United Kingdom are paid at least the living wage.",
