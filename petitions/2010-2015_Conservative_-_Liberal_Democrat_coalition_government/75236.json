        "additional_details": "The automatic inclusion of a 'service charge' in restaurants is a scam.  There is no other situation in the UK where a supplier sneaks an extra 12% onto the bill without asking!  It is a malpractice that needs to be banned.  There is nothing to stop customers voluntarily leaving a tip if they are delighted with the service, but to require customers to delete a service charge is a trick, and socially awkward.  Let's ban it now.  (Waiting staff, by the way, receive the same minimum wage as a million other service workers who have no opportunity for tips.)",
