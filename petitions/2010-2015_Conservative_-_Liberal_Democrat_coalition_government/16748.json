        "additional_details": "Bangladeshi parliament has overturned a 15-year-old requirement that general elections are overseen by non-partisan caretaker governments. The system was introduced in 1996s in an effort to end violence and fraud that often marred voting.\r\n\r\nBy abolishing the caretaker government system without consulting the opposition or without having any rationality behind it Awami League government is risking another political confrontation with the main oppositions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a partner of development we urge the Foreign & Commonwealth Office to criticise the steps taken by Awami League and stand with the people of Bangladesh to ensure a free and fair election in Bangladesh.\r\n\r\nAs a trusted friend of the people of Bangladesh UK should play its role in influencing international community to exert its diplomatic pressure and convince Awami League to refrain from igniting another political disaster that might cost hundreds of life and damage the pace of development.\r\n\r\n",
