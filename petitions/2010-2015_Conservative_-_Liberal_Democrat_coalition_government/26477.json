        "additional_details": "I would like to propose that the govt open up the childcare system to encourage people back into work by giving companies tax incentives if they set up properly controlled child nurseries for their workforces. This would also reduce the level of traffic on Britain's roads during rush hour as parents could take their children into work with them and drop them off at nursery and then collect them at the end of their shift to take them home with them. It would also go a long way to addressing the astronomical costs of putting children into private nurseries which often defeats the whole purpose of a mother returning to work after childbirth. It would also encourage long term employment with the same company, reduced staff turnaround, job security and a return to the job for life we used to enjoy in this country.\r\nThis would also create many thousands of jobs in the childcare industry as new workplace nurseries are established.",
