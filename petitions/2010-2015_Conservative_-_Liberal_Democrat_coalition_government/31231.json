        "additional_details": "To introduce a compulsory domestic abuser program to tackle abusive behaviours. There are many counselling services available for victims of abuse, but none- that I can see- that actually targets the abuser. Currently, the only way to stop an abuser is through the legal system, which is often as traumatic for the victim, as the original abuse; so many cases of domestic abuse go unreported and the perpetrator is free to go on to abuse the next victim. I propose that domestic abuse cases be heard in smaller courts, with the outcome- if found guilty- being that the abuser is forced to attend an abuser program.\r\n\r\nNot every victim wants their abuser to be sent to prison- they just want the abuse to stop!",
