        "additional_details": "Caravans turn the average family car into a heavy articulated vehicle. These vehicles damage road side furniture the road surface and course more traffic incidents than an average car but they do not have to pay any road tax.\r\nMany caravans are also not road worthy and driven by individuals with no training in driving articulated vehicles.\r\nEach year our road networks are jammed following road traffic incidents where un-roadworthy and un-trained drivers crash their vehicles. A road tax system for caravans would be a simple and quick means create funds to address this.",
