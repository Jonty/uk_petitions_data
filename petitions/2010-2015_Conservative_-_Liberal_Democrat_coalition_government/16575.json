        "additional_details": "Far too many children with autism in England are not getting the quality education they need and deserve. Too many parents have to fight the system to make it work.  Parents are saying they have waited over a year to get the right support for their child and some parents more than two years. More and more parents have had to go to tribunal to get the right support for their children. The government speaks about parental choice this is not happening in the majority of cases.\r\nParents want a real choice of educational provision.This means an education which meets their child\u2019s needs. And choice means more than one option being available for every child locally and a system that works with the parent and not work against the parent.",
