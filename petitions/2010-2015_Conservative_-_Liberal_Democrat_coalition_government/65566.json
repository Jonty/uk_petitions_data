        "additional_details": "We have all seen the BBC's recent pro-UKIP bias, with Nigel Farage invited onto Question Time and other programmes repeatedly, and mentioned endlessly by commentators like Nick Robinson.\r\n\r\nVery little coverage has been given to other legitimate parties such as The Green Party, Plaid Cymru, The Pirate Party and Mebyon Kernow.  Even when they win seats on councils, in the European Parliament or Westminster they are ignored or ridiculed.\r\n\r\nWe are fed up with complaining to the BBC only to be told \"the BBC has to appeal to a wide range of licence fee payers with a wide range of tastes\" as if that excused bias, inaccuracy and sloppy reporting.\r\n\r\nThe BBC does not take complaints from the public seriously.  It should no longer investigate itself.\r\n\r\nNeither should MPs and political appointees have any role in running or regulating the BBC.\r\n\r\nWe call for independent regulation of the BBC by a completely separate body, free from any political influence or bias whatsoever.",
