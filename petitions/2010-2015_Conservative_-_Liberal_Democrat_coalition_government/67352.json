        "additional_details": "I believe that each request for time off for family holidays in term time should be looked at individually. 10 days in term time I think is more than reasonable if your child and family fall within the following guidelines.\r\n\r\n95% or more attendance record\r\nOne or both parents work\r\nExcellent homework & achievement record\r\n\r\nAs a responsible parent you wouldn't take your child out of school during exam time. So any holidays taken in that time should be fined! But to penalise working parents that only work to provide for their family and to enjoy family time is ridiculas esp with strike days, training days & and in my case shutting the school early to \"re wire\". Besides holidays are educational esp foreign ones, different cultures, currencies and air travel. I'm sure most kids will learn more in quality family time than they do at school esp at certain times of the year. Get signing and change this stupid rule!! Decent hard working parents need to take a stand!!\r\n",
