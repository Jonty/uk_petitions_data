        "additional_details": "Capital punishment has no place in civilised society. State sanctioned murder only promotes a more violent society, does not prevent the acts it punishes for, catches innocent people in the net and doesn't deal with the root causes of the problems, only the symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe second we give up Human Rights for one sector of society is the second we give up all of our hard-fought for rights. Sign this petition if you believe the UK should remain free from capital punishment.",
