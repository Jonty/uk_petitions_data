Do you think we should send someone important to attend the 20th anniversary of the genocide?\r\nIt now alarms me that our inertia with the facts in front of us was the single biggest cause. Then I found out that on the 10th anniversary few representatives from the west attended. I'm not sure why we don't acknowledge and pay our respects. I felt ashamed then and do so now. I'm going to the 20th anniversary, if only to pay my respects to people who have suffered more than any of us could possibly imagine.\r\nIf I had a neighbour who had suffered unimaginable suffering, I'd want to be there regardless of any self interest. I accept that the situation in the Congo is still volatile, but being there for this event could well remind people of the consequences of not seeking peace.\r\nThis is an opportunity for a great leader to demonstrate, compassion, honesty and commitment to humanity.
