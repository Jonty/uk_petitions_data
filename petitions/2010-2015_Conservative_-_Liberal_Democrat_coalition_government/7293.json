        "additional_details": "Every year in the United Kingdom around 270,000 people suffer a Heart Attack and a third of them die before reaching hospital.\r\nThe portable defibrillator, which delivers a controlled electric shock to the heart and as a treatment for heart attack saves the lives of 40 per cent of under-65s it is used on. It can be stored in ambulances, ships, planes, etc, and can therefore be used with less delay and operated by amateurs. Used worldwide, it has saved thousands of lives.\r\nThis is to petition HM Government to debate the issue of making available even more defribillator's in even more public places, such as Libraries,Schools, Sports centres,Buses,Taxis and other locations and to make it more widely known through advertising and teaching in schools exactly how important these machines are and offer training classes on them.\r\n",
