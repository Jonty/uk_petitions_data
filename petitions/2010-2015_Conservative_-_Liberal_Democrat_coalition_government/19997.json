        "additional_details": "As car insurance is a legal requirement, yet is sold by unregulated, private insurance companies, we have an entire generation of drivers being priced out of driving - most drivers being quoted more than triple the value of their vehicle. This backs up the statistic that 1 in 5 young drivers would consider driving uninsured because obtaining insurance is simply too expensive.\r\n\r\nThe Government should provide flat rate car insurance where drivers - regardless of age, gender or location - pay the same small fee for basic car insurance. Anyone who wants more options with their insurance (E.G courtesy car) can choose to shop with private insurers. Not only will this make insurance more affordable for many, it would also create Government jobs and hopefully make a difference in the number of people driving without insurance.",
