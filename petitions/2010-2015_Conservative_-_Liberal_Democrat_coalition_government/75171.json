        "additional_details": "John Psaila created a dog fighting ring & used sticks, steroids etc to get these poor dogs ready to fight to the death. He thrived on this image & enjoyed it. Today in Wigan court he was sentenced to 121 DAYS in jail & a lifetime ban on having animals for his crimes. We want REAL justice for these poor dogs & for him to pay for his boastful, gloating attitude over his abuse of  these dogs. Please help us get his sentence reviewed & make the courts actually see animals as worthy of justice ",
