We believe the cranes should be preserved for future generations. They are a testament to the dock workers and important to our local and national heritage.  These are the last single-leg DD2 cranes in the UK. Truly magnificent examples of engineering and irreplaceable if lost.  Please sign the petition to show your support.       ",
