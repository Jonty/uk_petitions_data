        "additional_details": "Mars Incorporated have decided to no longer sell boxes of Trill Toppers in this country. Trill Toppers were needed to help provide a varied and healthy diet to the nations Budgerigars. The Trill brand is also universally trusted as the healthiest boxed foodstuffs for Budgies, being more widely bought than its competitors.\r\n\r\nWe would ask that the Secretary for State for Business, Innovation and Skills use his powers to negotiate with Mars Incorporated a return of Trill Toppers to the Pet Shops and Supermarket Shelves of Great Britain, before the health of the nations Budgerigars becomes greatly impaired.\r\n\r\nBackground Information - Each 170g box states it provides a \"unique daily diet for budgies\", containing 14 pieces with an essential mixture of seed and apple, herbs, nuts and egg for healthy active birds.",
