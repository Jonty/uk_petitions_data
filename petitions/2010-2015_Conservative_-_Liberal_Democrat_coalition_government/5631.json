        "additional_details": "There is often reported that there is a north-south divide in the UK. Therefore, there should be a referendum on devolution for the north of England so that the north can look after its own affairs free from London decision makers. Instead of the three northern regions suggested in the past, a devolution referendum for the north should cover an area roughly from the River Dee to the River Humber to the Scottish Border. This may be the only way that the north receives fair representation. Representation it has lacked since the end of our traditional industries.",
