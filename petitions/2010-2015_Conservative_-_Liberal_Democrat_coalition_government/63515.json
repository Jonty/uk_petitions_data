He was sentenced to death, which happened in the morning of August, 17th 1936 in A Caeira (Poio). This death sentence and the subsequent murder of Alexandre B\u00f3veda are a historical injustice that must be repaired by the institutional rehabilitation and recovery of his leading figure as well as by the disclosure of his e!normous work for the cause of freedom, democracy and progress of Galicia.",
