        "action": "Compulsory HGV/LVG driver training for non-UK drivers",
        "additional_details": "This petition is in loving memory of my brother Gavin, who was killed as a result of a foreign HGV driver travelling on the wrong side of the road.\r\nThe purpose of this petition is as follows:\r\n\r\n1.  To change the driving laws to make it compulsory for non-UK citizens to sit an HGV/LGV driving certificate of competence before being allowed to drive in the UK.\r\n\r\n2.  I propose that Fresnel lenses should be fitted as a compulsory measure to all left-hand drive HGV/LGV vehicles on UK roads.\r\n\r\n3.    Driver fatigue is a known factor in road accidents.  The new   \u201csmart tachograph\u201d will become mandatory 40 months after the technical specifications for the new tachograph have been established in 2017/18.  We are therefore looking at a timescale of 2021 or beyond before this is implemented.  I propose that this legislation be fast tracked as soon as the technical aspects have been finalised.",
