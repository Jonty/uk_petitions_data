Cannabis may be an illegal drug but in my opinion it is far safer than going to church on Sunday.\r\n\r\nIn my time I have came across hundreds of people that smoke it, many having different reasons some smoke it for the muscle relaxant benefits due to there old age, some for stress, headaches or any pain, and some because they know what is good for them.\r\n\r\nSave our planet by going green, Before it is to late.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/4-ways-hemp-can-save-the-world/\r\nhttp://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2012/07/25/cannabis-cannabinoids-and-cancer-the-evidence-so-far/",
