        "additional_details": "The percentage of children committing suicide is increasing and the age of victims is lowering, all due to bullying. Therefore, something needs to prevent innocent children taking there lives. Schools who say they have zero tolerance, have to follow procedures to issue sanctions. However, these sanctions are not preventing the bullying. In addition to this, schools do not have the power to exclude permanently, with immediate effect, and this needs to change. A clear message, needs to be made to every child, that if you choose to bully someone else, you will be excluded from the school with immediate effect. We need to protect our children, and leave them at school, knowing they will be in a safe environment. Violence should not be in schools, and morals that are taught to children should be the right ones. To hold them in good stead for their future.\r\nCHANGE THE LAW, SO THERE IS ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY FOR BULLYING. ZERO TOLERANCE SHOULD BE NONE!",
