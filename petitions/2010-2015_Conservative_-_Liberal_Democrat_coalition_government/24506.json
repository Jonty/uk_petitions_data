        "additional_details": "The current allowance for funeral payments is usually the cremation fee (anything from \u00a3400 - \u00a3800) and doctors\u2019 fees (currently \u00a3147) or equivalent burial fees and up to \u00a3700 for other expenses (church services, vicars or celebrant fees, organists, funeral director fees, hearse, limousines, coffins, collection of deceased, flowers, obituaries, memorials,  grave diggers etc.)\r\n\r\nWith the average price of a funeral being around \u00a33,000 this needs to be reviewed. Whilst this is only a contribution towards the costs of the funeral it is nowhere near adequate enough and has been set at this level for a number of years, has not been increased with inflation yet all the fees mentioned above have increased!\r\n\r\nI would like to government, on behalf of the funeral directors that ultimately end up out of pocket, and the families that claim on the allowance, to seriously review this figure, and consider ways that they can help families provide the funeral that they're loved ones deserve.\r\n",
