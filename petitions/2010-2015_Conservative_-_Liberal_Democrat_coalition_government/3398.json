        "additional_details": "You decide to buy a home, spend time getting a mortgage, spend time looking at schools, amenities,crime rate and you find the right home all is happy.  Then several months later the commercial vehicle, small and large white van man decides to bring his vehicle home and parks his van in a lovely residential area.\r\nBefore we know it several more turn up and we start to live in a lorry park. What about the pollution, safety of children and pedestrians who can't walk on pavements because of these vehicles being parked on them. We are becoming a free parking area for businesses who don,t have to fork out money to garage their vehicles.  This is encouraging thiefs into the area thinking there is some easy pickings.\r\nI want the government to\r\n1. Implement the title deeds that states only cars in residential areas\r\n2. Reduce my council tax for living in a lorry park\r\n3. Put hefty.fines on people who bring vans and commericial vehicles home.\r\n",
