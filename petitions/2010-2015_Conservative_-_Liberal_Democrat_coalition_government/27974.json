        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, demand that train operating companies be denied the right to charge penalty fares.\r\n\r\nThere are many instances where time constraints make it desirable to pay for your ticket during or at the end of the journey, whereby the threat of missing your train is eliminated. There should be no problem with paying for your ticket at the end of the journey so long as you do not leave the destination train station.\r\n\r\nDeliberate fare evasion is essentially theft and should be dealt with accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhere intention to pay exists, there should be no punishment.",
