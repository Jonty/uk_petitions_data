They themselves can be addictive and a terrible way to get into debt.\r\n\r\nEven if you default with a provider of them you are able to use another without any checks.\r\n\r\nI propose a central database, this database would house names of individuals who wish to exclude themselves from applying for payday loans.\r\n\r\nAll applications done by these lenders would need to check this database before lending to see if someone has excluded.\r\n\r\n",
