        "additional_details": "This pettion is to ban the use of the antidepressant drug venlafaxine, otherwise known as Efexor or Effexor. The reason for banning this particular antidepressant drug is .that it is one of the most dificult antidepressant drugs to withdraw from. Despite the severe withdrawal symptoms, there is no mention of this in the patient information leaflet provided with the drug. Withdrawal symptoms can be so severe that people have been hospitalised in order to discontnue the drug.\r\nIf the Government are not prepared to ban this drug altogether, then at the very least it should insist that the manufacturers, Wyeth, disclose possible withdrawal symptoms with the patient information.",
