It is not acceptable that such a disease is left unchecked in the UK due to its horrendous symptoms - it is pure torture for any rabbit infected upto 2 weeks in many cases and longer. If it infected cats and/or dogs there would be a public outrage but because it infects only rabbits and they suffer terrible symptoms mostly out of sight the disease is hardly mentioned in the public domain.\r\n\r\nI want the Government to actively discuss all the options open to it to combat/control this disease including vaccinations for the Rabbit population.
