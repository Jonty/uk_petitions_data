        "additional_details": "The current South West Herts Consortium tests are unfair. Parents are forced into forking out for private tutors; children are becoming ill over the pressure of the tests as are many parents. If the test must stay, why can\u2019t verbal reasoning be added to the curriculum, and the test take place in the familiar environment of the children's primary school? We are pushing for a fairer system to allow our children to attend their local school of choice. Either every school should become involved or every child sit a test in school (like in Bucks) or use the current SATS as schools often do for streaming.  ",
