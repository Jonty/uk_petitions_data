Isn't it about time the schools were forced to take action on this matter?  many children take their own lives year after year through bullying, and schools don't want to admit it's happening. Now it's time for the people's voices to be heard and the laws to be enforced.  If you are a parent of a child who is currently or has been bullied, like I am, or know someone who has, or has been affected yourself, please sign to help this stop now before anymore children take their lives.
