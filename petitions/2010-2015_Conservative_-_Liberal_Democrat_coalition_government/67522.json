        "additional_details": "The government should ban the practice of adding meat to water, for sale in supermarkets and other outlets.  This is a scandalous example of big companies ripping off the innocent consumer, who end up paying though the nose for what is essentially water.  Most customers are unaware of how much water is added to meat.\r\n\r\nI don't know about anyone else, but I am fed up with paying good money for meat, only to attempt to cook it and have it swimming in water.  You end up boiling the meat, resulting in a disgusting mess.  Stop this now - I want to buy meat, not water - I already pay for that through my water supplier!",
