        "additional_details": "Abolish the whole concept of parole and reduced sentences for 'good behaviour'. Criminals should have exhibited the good behaviour in the first place like the majority of us. Virtually no criminals serve the sentence handed out by the courts but are eligible to be 'let off' after a paltry period of incarceration. The justice system is dishonest by handing out apparent long sentences with one hand and letting criminals out after only serving a third of their sentence with the other. Most re-offend and the probation service is next to useless so abolish that too.",
