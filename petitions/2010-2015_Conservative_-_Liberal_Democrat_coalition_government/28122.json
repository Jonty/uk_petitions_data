        "additional_details": "Currently in the majority of countries worldwide stillbirth is recognised as any baby born from 20 weeks gestation who has died prior to birth.\r\n\r\nIn the UK only babies weighing over 400g or over 24 weeks gestation are classed as stillborn.  Despite this, a 20 week gestation baby must be delivered and the body disposed of by the parents.  In other words, the mother goes through the same process of labour and birth as any other parent and also has to arrange the burial and funeral just as any other parent that has lost a child would.\r\n\r\nWe would like the government to take the action of classifying stillbirth as being recognised as any baby born after 20 weeks gestation and stillbirth certificates being issued to both past, present and future stillbirths from 20 weeks gestation.",
