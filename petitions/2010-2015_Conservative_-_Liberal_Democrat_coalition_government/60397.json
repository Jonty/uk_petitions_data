As a British citizen l think we should support our country first and foremost before giving away monies to other countries. But the excuse will be there was a lack of communication or it was Labour's fault.\r\nThe government of the day have the responsibility that's why they were elected. Not to act like kids in the playground. Support Somerset lets get shut of the present government. The effects on people's lives who are farmer's will be costly and could end up bankrupt because of the reduced flood defence funds",
