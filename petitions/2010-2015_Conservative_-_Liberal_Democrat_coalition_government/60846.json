        "additional_details": "The Gambling Commission (sponsored by the department for Culture, Media and Sport) has failed to protect customers from the liquidation of the UK regulated sportsbook site Canbet.\r\n\r\nThe Commission have provided little to no communication and it is clear their is no support forthcoming. Their website is currently stating that they are unwilling to suspend the licence of Canbet or its directors.\r\n\r\nGiven the imminent law on PoC taxation requiring all bookmakers to have UK regulation, the way the Canbet situation has been handled raises questions about whether the Gambling Commission is fit for purpose.\r\n\r\nAt www.thegamblingtimes.com and www.sportsbookreview.com we are trying to assist customers who have lost money in receiving compensation from Canbet or the directors.\r\n\r\nPLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION IF YOU HAVE LOST MONEY IN CANBET, OR HAVE ANY DOUBTS OVER THE GAMBLING COMMISSION AND ITS ABILITY TO PROTECT UK CUSTOMERS.",
