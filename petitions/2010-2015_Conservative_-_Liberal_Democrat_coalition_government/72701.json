        "action": "Repeal the sexist and arbitrary restrictions on UK pornography",
        "additional_details": "On 2 December 2014, the British government announced that an amendment to the 2003 Communications Act means that from now on UK producers of video-on-demand online pornography will be regulated by the BBFC. As such, it is now illegal in the UK to create adult content which depicts the following behaviours:\r\n\r\nSpanking\r\n\r\nCaning\r\n\r\nAggressive whipping\r\n\r\nPenetration by any object \"associated with violence\"\r\n\r\nPhysical or verbal abuse (regardless of  if consensual)\r\n\r\nUrolagnia (known as \"water sports\")\r\n\r\nFemale ejaculation\r\n\r\nStrangulation\r\n\r\nFacesitting\r\n\r\nFisting\r\n\r\nWe believe that this is not only sexist towards women, but also undermines the principle of free expression, and is a step in the wrong direction. We are calling on the government to either remove online adult content from the regulation of the BBFC, or to revise the BBFC's restrictions on the types of behaviour which may be portrayed in adult content.",
