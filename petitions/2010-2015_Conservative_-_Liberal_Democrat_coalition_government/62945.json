It is against our rights to safe water -https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/36540/uk-position-human-right-water.pdf section 6 states - 6. When we refer to the \u201cthe human right to water\u201d or (for convenience) to \u201cthe right to water\u201d, we refer to it as an element of the right to an adequate standard of living in the ICESCR, as set out in section II. The right to water entitles everyone to sufficient, affordable, safe water for drinking, cooking and personal hygiene.\r\nYou the Dental Public Health England have given no scientific evidence that added flouride is safe and advantageous to human health.  We as the people do not give you the consent to add fluoride to our water.",
