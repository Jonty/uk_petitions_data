Making a dedicated statement recognising and commending the actions of ALL emergency service workers who collectively dealt with the August riots.\r\n\r\n2. That the statement of commendation be explicitly endorsed by all political parties, council, community and religious leaders AND be read out personally by the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n3. That some financial 'token of appreciation' be given to all emergency service workers to convey the deep thanks and gratitude of the law abiding majority.\r\n",
