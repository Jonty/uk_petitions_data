This Monopoly on \"Pay to view\" sports is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nF1 Fans understand the UK's commitment to the Olympics & 2012, but should debate the longterm future and investment in Formula 1, which promotes UK industry on a Worldwide Scale, for 9 months of the year, not just for a few weeks in 4 years.",
