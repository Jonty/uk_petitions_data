Who thinks that we should abolish the TV Licence scheme, and follow stead with other countries by allowing citizens of that country to watch TV for no charge at all only if it is a subscription service they are watching.  If you think that you would like to abolish the failing scheme.  Please sign this petition.  Thanks.",
