        "additional_details": "We face unprecedented rail fare increases, linked to the rate of inflation. Most workers have not received a pay rise in 2 years, not even to account for cost-of-living, and household budgets are under enormous pressure. It is clear that the rail industry, MPs and ministers are completely out of touch with the reality of the spiralling cost of travel on the railways. It is time to bring them back into touch.\r\n\r\nThe government must legislate or take other action to:\r\n\r\n1. Prevent Peers and MPs from claiming rail travel as part of Parliamentary expenses.\r\n\r\n2. Scrap the subsidy scheme for rail employees (Network Rail and Train Operating Companies) which can see staff - and their families -  benefiting from reductions in rail travel of up to 70%\r\n\r\nOtherwise, any notion that 'we are all in this together' is a lie.",
