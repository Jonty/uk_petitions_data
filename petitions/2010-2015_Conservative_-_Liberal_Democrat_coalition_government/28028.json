However, the current system for CRB checks is expensive and time consuming, often causing problems for employers, their clients, and successful job applicants.\r\n\r\nI am baffled as to why we need CRB checks when all of the information is held on The Police National Computer. The whole process of requesting and waiting for a CRB check seems ludicrous when all of the information could be shared by HMRC and the Police.\r\n\r\nPositions requiring a non offender could have an X added to their tax code. An offender\u2019s NI number could be added to their conviction records. When a person is offered such a position, their National Insurance number would alert HMRC of any unspent convictions. If a conviction was found, police could  inform the employer if that conviction precluded them from the job being offered.",
