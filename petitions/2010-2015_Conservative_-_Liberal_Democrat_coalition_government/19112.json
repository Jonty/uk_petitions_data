Wasting \u00a318M doesn't seem like it's proving the law works.\r\n\r\nI can't ever see this land being a lush green field again, and even before they moved in, it was a scrap yard anyway. It looks so much better now than it did then!\r\n\r\nYes, they don't pay taxes, so why waste another \u00a318M on them. Seems a complete waste of our money.",
