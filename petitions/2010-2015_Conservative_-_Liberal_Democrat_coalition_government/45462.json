This should not be the case.\r\nIf this is supposed to be a tool for democracy then there should be funds available to raise awareness via advertising or social media so that everyone in the country gets an opportunity to vote on important issues.\r\nSecondly, it is not good enough that after gaining the required votes that the subject 'may' be discussed.\r\nIf enough people of this country have an opinion on something then by right as it is our country action MUST be taken in the form of a referendum or similar.\r\nThis will reign in the politicians who build their careers in party politics and not the issues which affect the majority.\r\nPoliticians are here to serve us, and im fed up of this dictatorship which disguises itself as a democracy.\r\n\r\nCome on Fellow Brits, lets be counted and take ownership of OUR country so that we can say we are proud once more.",
