        "additional_details": "The A14 is recognised as one of the country\u2019s most unacceptably congested roads, with minor incidents causing huge delays on an almost daily basis. Larger accidents bring most of Cambridgeshire grinding to a halt. This has gone on for far too long now and investment is needed to make the A14 a road capable of coping with increasing demands and essential additional housing. We ask the government to secure funding for an essential upgrade to the A14, for the good of the county and the UK economy. ",
