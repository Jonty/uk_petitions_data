        "additional_details": "We the undersigned, call on the Government to conduct a complete review of the energy production value of the River Mersey, with specific reference to its tidal, hydro and wave generating abilities. The River Mersey has one of the highest tidal ranges in the UK and fast flowing currents, and could have extensive potential. Furthermore, the Runcorn gap provides an ideal opportunity to construct and hydroelectric dam system or power generation system where the river constricts.",
