        "additional_details": "Thousands of pounds are being diverted to build a permanent Gypsy Traveller Site in an AONB, which relies heavily on tourism. Tregantle has been occupied for several years, illegally, by a traveller who was allowed to stay with the permission of Cornwall Council, who informed Parish Councils he would be moving on \"soon\". Not only has he not moved on he is being rewarded with permanent site to include an amenity block with a fitted kitchen including a Dishwasher, Tumble Dryer, Washing Machine, Fridge etc...and a toilet suite. With the tax payer footing the bill, whilst facilities i.e. public toilet blocks are being closed in the area.\r\nLayout\r\nhttp://planning.cornwall.gov.uk:8181/rpp/showimage.asp?j=PA13/02683&index=11821529&DB=8&DT=4\r\nAmenity Block\r\nhttp://planning.cornwall.gov.uk:8181/rpp/showimage.asp?j=PA13/02683&index=11821544&DB=8&DT=4\r\nComments\r\nhttp://planning.cornwall.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=neighbourComments&keyVal=MKA3FUFG1H900",
