        "additional_details": "The aim of this E-Petition is to establish the demand for St George's Day to be adopted as a Public Bank Holiday in England, on par with St David's Day (Wales), St Andrew's Day (Scotland) and St Patrick's Day (Northern Ireland). The United Kingdom already has fewer Bank Holidays than much of Europe and there is no Bank Holiday specifically for England. The purpose is for the Government, upon successful completion of this E-Petition, to consider adopting St George's Day as the newest Public Bank Holiday.",
