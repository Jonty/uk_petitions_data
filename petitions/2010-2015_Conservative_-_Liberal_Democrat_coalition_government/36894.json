It is an idea where a government, or companies with a public mandate or those funded by the taxpayer, must publish documents and files which are in the public interest. It must also be in an accessible and convenient format such that members of the public can access it, comment on, share and debate on the issues raised in the leaked documents.\r\n\r\nThe government should open a website where users can access this information, and share/comment/debate on the issues raised.
