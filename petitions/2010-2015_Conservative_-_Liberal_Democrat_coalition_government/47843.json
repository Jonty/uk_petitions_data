        "additional_details": "The Energy Bill will set the context for energy policy for decades to come.  It must include a binding target for the proportion of electricity provided by renewables by the year 2030. Certainty is required to re-start the investment in the green economy, and to deliver the infrastructure we need for a low-carbon future.  The target can be set in line with climate change committee recommendations.  The targets set within the Renewables Obligation have worked well to deliver capacity - we should continue to use the tools that work.",
