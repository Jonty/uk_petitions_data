        "additional_details": "Despite Jeremy Clarkson's occasional stupid remarks and behaviour, the BBC Two television show Top Gear would never be the same without the presenter. As a popular viewer of the Top Gear, I feel suspending the presenter; following a so called \"Fracas\" with the shows producer, would be a catastrophic decision by the BBC. An investigation should take place, however suspension is not the answer if BBC want to retain an audience for the most popular car television show in history. ",
