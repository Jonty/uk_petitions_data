        "additional_details": "In preparation for the a new Westfield shopping centre a number of buildings, mainly dating from the 1960s, were demolished on Forster Square and major shopping street Broadway in 2005. It has now been 7 years since demolition began and there is still no Westfield shopping centre in Bradford despite the fact that other expensive ventures have taken place like the pointless city park. The people of Bradford want answers. Our once respected, busy and bustling city is now a complete eye saw with no redeeming features about it. The economic growth of the city is reducing by the day. Hurry up and build the flamin' shopping centre already! If Westfield can't do it, take back the land and get someone else to do it. Either way, sort it!",
