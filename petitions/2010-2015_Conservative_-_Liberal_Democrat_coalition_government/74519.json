They have beheaded and executed and even now burned alive their hostages- some being western citizens. But that isnt the point - the point is that ordinary people are being brutally murdered by \" Islamic State\". The red line has long been crossed and the use of RAF jets is not enough. I therefore call on the British Government and NATO to take extensive military action against 'Islamic State'.\r\nThis may include boots on the ground - but we must accept the fact that we may lose people - but we cannot standby any more and watch hundreds of people die. The attacks have mildy streched into France with the recent attacks in the capitol , Paris.\r\nNow i talk with the people - How can we all stand here and watch people get killed? Children kidnapped and Homes Destroyed? Civilisations crumbled.\r\nPeople- how would you feel if you were in the same position? United Kingdom Government - Act Now!",
