        "additional_details": "On many occasion I have heard of single parents living in 2 or 3 bedroom houses receiving loads of associated benefits whilst, in some cases, with their partners on the quiet. My solution to free up thousands of social houses is to place a mother and children for each available bedroom - so that would be 3 mothers/fathers and their children in a 3 bedroom house and they would have to share the bathroom and kitchen etc.\r\nThis may seem harsh but if they don't like it they could move back in with their parents or pay the going rate for the property. I am working 40 hours a week, pay rent for 2 of us and have a lot less income than a single mother who is not working! Not right!",
