        "action": "Abolish VAT on food for guide and other assistance dogs",
        "additional_details": "Current legislation does not recognize guide dogs as \"working dogs\" and therefore the Guide Dogs charity has to pay VAT on their food.  This costs the charity in excess of \u00a3300,000 per year.  That is enough money to train and distribute 6 new guide dogs to some of the many visually impaired people who are waiting desperately for dogs at the moment.  These dogs work 24 hrs a day and literally transform lives.  Yet the legislation classes greyhounds and sporting dogs as working dogs (thus exempt from VAT) but not guide dogs, hearing dogs for the deaf or other medical assistance dogs.  Please help us by signing this e-petition or one of the many hard copy ones at our stands and events up and down the country over the summer.",
