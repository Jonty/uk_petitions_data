        "additional_details": "Raccoon dogs are being tortured and abused horribly in China for their fur. In some cases the animals have been documented as being skinned alive and left to die on a pile of carcasses. Full details were published in the press (Daily Mail 4/10/10). Currently, there is no ban on the imports of raccoon-dog fur or products made from their pelts. The UK should not stand by and condone the cruelty of animals in this way and we should ban the import of Raccoon Dog fur ASAP.",
