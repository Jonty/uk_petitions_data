        "additional_details": "Currently the fines for public order offences are very small and do not offer a deterrent. Every town in this Land suffers from drunken behavior (violence, vandalism, anti-social behavior etc)  on a nightly basis and there is little recourse for the perpetrators, usually an \u00a380 fine, a night in the cells and a slap on the wrist.  This is not a deterrent, in fact is not much more than a taxi fayre home.   The fines should be considerably higher for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1.  A real deterrent as the fines are too low and affordable.\r\n2.The costs involved in policing the streets.\r\n3. Generate public revenue in an alternative way to increasing taxation.\r\n4. Reduce crime rates.\r\n\r\nI am proposing that public order offences should cost the perpetrator a month's wages (gross so they effectively pay tax/NI twice).\r\n\r\nFor people who are not working and commit public order offences, it's a month of Community Service full time.",
