        "additional_details": "I want to introduce legislation concerning the minimum standards and training of care staff including the development of a national register. I propose that mandatory training be given for a year to care staff prior to be given employment to cover topics such as abuse and whistle blowing, care standards Act and deprivation of liberty legislation, manual handling, health and safety, infection control, communication, nutrition and hydration, hygiene and continence, effective interactive therapies, dealing with challenging behaviours, person centred care and holistic care. Too many care staff in our country are neither trained nor suitable for the rewarding and challenging role they undertake and resources are woefully lacking leading to the incidents of abuse and neglect. We are currently failing the most vulnerable citizens in our society.",
