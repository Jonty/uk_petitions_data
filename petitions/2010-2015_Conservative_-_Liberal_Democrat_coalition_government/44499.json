        "additional_details": "This year saw the launch of Age Is Just a Number which is a Truth About Youth \u2013 North East campaign that aims to bring an end to negative stereotyping of older and younger people in the media and wider society.\r\n\r\nSince its creation during an intergenerational residential back on 9-11 March 2012, the Truth About Youth - North East team (staff and young people) have developed a pledge card and have been getting members of the public - both young and old - to pledge their support to the campaign by signing their name. So far we have got almost 1000 filled out!\r\n\r\nTo finish this campaign and bring it to a close we are hoping to take the signed pledge cards to 10 Downing Street in an attempt to change the way young and older people are portrayed - not just in the media, but in our wider society - and for the government to consider how they themselves could do more to promote intergenerational work.",
