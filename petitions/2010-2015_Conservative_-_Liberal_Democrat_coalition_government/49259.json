        "additional_details": "We could also look at introducing a volantary Maximium wage.Where a company would get a lower  corporation tax rate lets say  a quarter of the  standard rate.  If it could prove to HMRC  that no one in the company earned more than 20 times the average salary and  thier lowest paid worker.And  profits where shared between the  workers (equal divided) and the share holders  50/50  As  the  success of a business  is not  just ever  down to one  individual, This would help to spread the wealth more evenly through our society.  That is not  to say for outstanding effort an individual should not  be rewarded but rather this reward should be in the form of company shares pending shareholder approval.\r\nThis  would help out most SME as they normally fall into this  requirement  anyway.\r\nWe   could then increase the  corparation tax rate each   year until a  proper balance has been set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
