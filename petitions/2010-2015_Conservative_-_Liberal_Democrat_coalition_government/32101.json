        "additional_details": "I want politicians to intervene in islamists increase in forced influence in local government and legislature, forcing their radical beliefs on others.  Especially in the case of non-muslims, for example homophobic beatings, women being beaten for not wearing hijab even non-muslims.  No more mosques.\r\n\r\nWe need to end the establishment of islamised areas, where white people are being beaten for entering, we need to stop the spreading of sharia courts and close them down as we already have a British legal system.  We need to stop the mis-use of anti-racist legislislation and human rights legislation with qwhich muslims are running amok.",
