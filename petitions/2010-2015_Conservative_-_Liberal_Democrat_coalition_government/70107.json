        "additional_details": "I request that a more effective website is created where government offices and mp's could, and were required to poll/survey members of the electorate.   A blog would give the electorate the ability to add additional ideas that the MP had not originally considered and petitions would give the electorate the opportunity to raise their own concerns.\r\n\r\nThe e-petitions website is a one way conversation.   60 million people cannot effectively communicate with a couple of hundred using this system alone.   The Scottish referendum is a fantastic example of how asking a question brings politics to life.",
