        "additional_details": "In a similar fashion to formula one drivers who wear uniforms that display the logo's of their sponsors, of which the size of the logo will vary depending on the contribution made. Our politicians should have to wear a uniform bearing the names or logo's of all of the lobby groups and special interest donations that have been made to their party, indirectly or directly because of them They should keep the uniform on until the next general election and once the uniform has been filled up, they can receive nor organise anymore contributions. Maybe this initiative would remind the politicians the\"transparency\" they promised us.",
