The proposed merger with the National Oceanography Centre will seriously weaken Britain's scientific reputation and its ability to carry out climate research at a time when important climatic changes at the poles need to be investigated.\r\n\r\nWe urge the government to prevent the merger and keep the British Antarctic Survey intact, keep it properly funded, and ensure the UK remains at the forefront of Antarctic and Arctic research.",
