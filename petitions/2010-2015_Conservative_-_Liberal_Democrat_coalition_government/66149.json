Because each person has two kidneys, that is 800 potential life saving kidneys available every day, yet only 7 operations are carried out. If the NHS could manage 7 more operations a day then the waiting list could be eliminated within three years, but it does not happen and patients continue to languish on Dialysis, or die.\r\n",
