Wherever you go in the United Kingdom, more houses are springing up.\r\nIt would be great and beneficial to everyone's health and mental well being that action was started to stop so many houses being built so quickly. Green space is being lost due to developments and money. Green space is our future and the future of many generations to come. Great Britain is a small island and one day it will be a concrete jungle to each and everyone of us, this has to be stopped.",
