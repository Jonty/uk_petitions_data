        "additional_details": "On the 5th February 2014, Lottie Dexter appeared on Newsnight to launch the 'Year of Code' initiative. She admitted to Jeremy Paxman that she didn't know how to code and that it would only take a day for someone to learn to code well enough to teach it to someone else. She also said that within twelve months of learning to code, she could be the next [Mark] Zuckerberg.\r\n\r\nWe feel that someone in her position should have at least a basic grasp of the fundamentals before trying to encourage others to do so.\r\n\r\nWe ask that the government re-advertise the position and employ a new director based on their experience within the computer industry and not solely on their political connections.",
