        "additional_details": "I want to Government to force state funded media (BBC) to promote All e-petitions on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen, the e-petition \"Convicted London rioters should loose all benefits.\" has already received over 100,000 votes in a very short space of time. I believe this was very much due to the e-petition being shown on the BBC news during the riots.\r\n\r\nThere are many other deserving e-petitions that the British public should know about, that should also be promoted by the \"state funded\" BBC.\r\n\r\nOther important e-petitions:\r\n\r\nCHEAPER PETROL AND DIESEL, BY ROBERT HALFON MP AND FAIR FUEL UK\r\n\r\nBAN THE INTRODUCTION OF SHARIA LAW\r\n\r\nLEGALISE CANNABIS\r\n\r\nRENATIONALISE RAILWAYS\r\n\r\nMAKE ST GEORGES DAY A NATIONAL HOLIDAY\r\n\r\nETC ETC\r\n\r\nSimple messages like: \"Your chance to make you voice heard\", \"Have you say today, make it law tomorrow\"\r\n\r\nDon't just read this..... do something and \"VOTE FOR THIS\"\r\n\r\nIt just takes a moment and no (very) person details are required.",
