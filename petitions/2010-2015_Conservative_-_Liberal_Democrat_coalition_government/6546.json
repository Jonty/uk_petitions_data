        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, would like the government to reverse it's decision to cull badgers because:\r\n1) Scientific review has shown that culling can dramatically increase the rate of new infections.\r\n2) Sick badgers will go to new farms to seek food, thus spreading infection.\r\n3) Because of points 1) and 2) the rate of new infections per year, the cost to our economy (currently at around GBP 100,000,000) is estimated to blow out to two billion pounds by the decade's end.\r\n4) There is a serious risk of a new animal bloodsport being developed as a result of this cull. People will go out and torture these animals under the guise of a cull.\r\n5) The threat of becoming an endangered species. No one has set an end date for the cull, and there is no guarantee that they won't become endangered.\r\n6) Culling badgers didn't work before, in the 1970's, why would it work now?\r\n7) Farmers culling badgers will inevitably cull healthy ones.",
