        "additional_details": "I want the cervical cancer vaccination to not be given to 14-18 year old school girls. This jab has very little known about it and is causing major side effects. While the government says it could save around 400 women from dying from cervical cancer a year, there are many girls who are suffering new daily persistent headaches and other side effects like nose bleeds, fatigue, fainting, joint aches and hypersensitivity to light and noise. This is personal to me because it has affected my twin sister for the past 3 and a half years, and has ultimately changed her life and her education. My sister is not the only person suffering these symptoms as I have become aware of many girls who are in similar situations to her. I strongly believe more research needs to be done before this drug is dished out to save around 400 people but has ultimately caused unnecessary suffering to many young girls. More research needs to be done. ",
