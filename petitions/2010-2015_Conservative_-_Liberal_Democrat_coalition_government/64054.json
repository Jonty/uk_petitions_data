It needs to be reformed so that it looks, feels and is run like an ordinary workplace and would be recognised as such by members of the public.  This means regular working hours, no subsidised bars, provision for child care, better standards of behaviour by MPs in the debating chamber including during PMQs. Committees need to be given greater power and powers to compel attendance so that they closer resemble their equivalents in the US, and they should be televised or put on radio at least.",
