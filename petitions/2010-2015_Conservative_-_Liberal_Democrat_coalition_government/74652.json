        "additional_details": "Put yourself in a \u2018Post-CTS Bill\u2019 UK. You are a law-abiding citizen, yet people can suspect you of holding extremist ideas/not a holder of British values due to assumptions. Could you live in peace knowing that anyone from any field/walk of life must report you regarding any signs of perceived extremism, with no end to its interpretation?\r\nThis Bill is flawed since it has a vague definition of extremism; maintains the secrecy of evidence, incapacitating innocent people to fight the legal case; lacks proper judicial safeguards against this law abuse. Muslims are first to condemn terrorism, being the first victims of Islam\u2019s misinterpretation & misrepresentation. Every true Muslim upholds the Prophetic teaching to save humanity from harm of his/her verbal & physical actions.\r\nAll British citizens deserve a CTS law that meets human rights\u2019 obligations whilst not curtailing civil liberties; this bill does the opposite, thus we urge our distinguished Law-makers not to support this Bill.
