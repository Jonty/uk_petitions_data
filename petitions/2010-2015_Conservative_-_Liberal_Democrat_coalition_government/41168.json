        "additional_details": "The government should debate for changes to protect the mobile industries customers from phone fraud which escalates into the customers having to pay call charges for stolen/lost sim cards. At the moment the mobile industry is not being made accountable for issues arising out of this problem. All they are interested in, is the account holder is responsible no matter what circumstances have occured, which in my opinion is very unfair.",
