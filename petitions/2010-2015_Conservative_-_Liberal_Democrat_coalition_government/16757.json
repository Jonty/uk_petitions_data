Some of the money which consumers pay is used to invest in new equipment,eg wind turbines or new trains. My proposal is that where UK consumers are paying more than the European average price for services such as rail transport and utilities such as electricity the the providers of those products must but all of their equipment or make all of their equipment in this country.
