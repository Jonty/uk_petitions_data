        "additional_details": "A vast number of public services are under the control of unelected bodies such as Quangos. In what is theoretically speaking a democratic country this cannot be considered acceptable. However, due to the vast number of necessary decision-makers elections would not be appropriate.\r\n\r\nI therefore propose that these bodies be replaced by juries of between twenty and thirty members, randomly selected from the population of the United Kingdom. Jury selection, or sortition, produces a representative sample of people to decide democratically upon a certain issue. The selection can be stratified according to gender so it is guaranteed that exactly half of the representatives selected are male and half female.",
