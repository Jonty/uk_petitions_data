With the expansion of the EU, the problem is only getting worse. The word is out: squatting is OK in Britain.\r\nThe Government needs to review this as a matter of urgency. Squatting in someone's property, especially someone's home, should be made illegal. The police should be given powers to physically evict squatters immediately.",
