        "additional_details": "We the British people felt the deepest gratitude towards our American cousins for their decision to remove from the United Kingdom the toxic waste that goes by the name of Piers Morgan (aka Piers 'Morgan' Moron).\r\n\r\nRecent reports however suggest that this immense act of generosity may well be reversed, and said waste may be deported back to us. Whilst we sympathise fully with the horrendous plight of the American people, we firmly believe that such a catastrophe would do irreparable harm to both the health of British society and to the Anglo-American relationship.\r\n\r\nConsequently, we urge the government to do all that it can to protect the British people, and ensure that such a dark fate does not befall these islands.\r\n",
