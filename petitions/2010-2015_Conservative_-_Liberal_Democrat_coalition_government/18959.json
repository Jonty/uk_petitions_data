        "additional_details": "This is a petition to make it an offence for any parent to force a child in their protection overseas for the purpose of 'education' (as opposed to consensually sending to a recognised educational institution with a broad-spectrum curriculum) and/or as a form of punishment.\r\n\r\nIt is time for the government to examine the motives and consequences of parents who forcibly extradite their children overseas.\r\n\r\nFrequently, this is for the purpose of 'education' which is often in the form of religious indoctrination, or punishment (often because British legislation does not permit the sort of punishment they would wish), as a backlash against the young person's behaviour or, as is often deemed, 'over-westernisation'.\r\n\r\nParents should not be permitted to send their children abroad for these purposes as a result of their lack of parenting skills, thereby putting a child at unnecessary risk of abuse and indoctrination in another jurisdiction.",
