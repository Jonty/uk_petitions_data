        "action": "Pressure the government into reviewing the necessity of such a frantic and pressured sales event as Black Friday",
        "additional_details": "We used to look at the news coverage of Black Friday sales in America, with stampedes, violence, injuries (even death), and thought that this could never happen here. We were wrong.\r\n\r\nThis petition doesn't intend to delude anyone into thinking that we\u2019re better than those in America, where Black Friday originates from. This petition exists because there are people, here, in the UK, that don't want to see their country take yet another blow to its self-respect. It is the belief of many that we do not need another retail window, pressuring many into buying items we don\u2019t need, at prices that probably haven\u2019t been discounted as much as retailers would have us believe.\r\n\r\nBeing a consumer is absolutely fine. This petition is not anti-consumerist. But when we buy things, let\u2019s do so with dignity, decency, and respect!",
