Reduce benefits where possible to 'a living', not living more well off than those working. In calculating this all expenditures should be taken in to consideration such as free dental care, prescriptions and all other benefits available. Review the working tax credits so that they are based on one persons salary as children being in childcare is dependant on one parent not two. Basing the credit on two salaries in a household restricts the person with the childcare responsiblities (usually the mother) so having to work only if it is cost effect after the cost of childcare.",
