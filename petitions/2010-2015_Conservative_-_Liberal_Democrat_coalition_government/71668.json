The principle of 'one person, one vote' would remain unchanged, but that one vote could be used for a party, or against a party.\r\n\r\nEvery vote against, cancels out a vote for. This would allow even the most disillusioned voters to express their preferences and would give a voice to the most hardened cynics.\r\n\r\nIt's a simple idea. They're often the best ones.",
