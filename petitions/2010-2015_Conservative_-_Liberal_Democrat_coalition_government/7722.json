        "action": "Control of the United Kingdom budget and national debt",
        "additional_details": "The parliament must ensure that strict laws and regulations control income, ordinary and extraordinary expenses along economic cycles so that the national debt does not grow but decrease. This will protect the budget from political vagaries.\r\nBoom years must make provision for lean years. The ultimate goal is to reduce the national debt level near to zero so that the national income is spent for the good of the nation, not for the benefit of the lenders\r\nThis is a moral obligation. We do not have the right to offload our current burden onto future generations.\r\nFew nations have such laws and regulations. Their financial evolution shows the benefit of healthy budgetary diets. Switzerland is one of the good examples.\r\nOrdinary citizens are constrained to such budgetary rules. If they do not behave they suffer the consequences. If the government and parliament do not follow a proper budgetary diet, the nation suffers the consequences. The parliament should protect the nation.\r\n",
