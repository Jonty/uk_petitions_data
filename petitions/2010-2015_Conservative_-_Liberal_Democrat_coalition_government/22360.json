So far both have rejected full independence but under Alex Salmond, the possibility of Scotland gaining full independence in the very near future cannot be discounted. The English have never had a say whether they wish to continue in the present arrangement. It's about time the English had a referendum to leave the Union.\r\nWe'd save ourselves a fortune that could be invested rebuilding Hadrian's wall and Offa's dyke!",
