When VAT was first introduced restaurants quoted their prices ex-VAT and there were a lot of customers who found they could  not afford the presented bill due to the extra 8%.  The VAT officials should make it law that ALL prices quoted anywhere should include VAT.  We do not have an option - we have to pay the VAT. George Osbourne please take note.  Thank you.",
