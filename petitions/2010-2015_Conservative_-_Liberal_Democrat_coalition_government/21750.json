Agreement amongst the parties involved in the negotiation & arbitration stage is not recognised as court judgments but they are part of the statutory Civil Procedure. There are over 85 Islamic Sharia tribunals/courts in Britain, settling disputes according to Islamic religious principles which can be regarded as agreement in the mandatory Civil Procedure. Religious tribunals are not court of record but should be consistent in their judgements & should not approve of issues that are contrary to British law (regarding extra marital affairs, the best & paramount interest of children, duties of the wife, etc).",
