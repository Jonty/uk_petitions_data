        "additional_details": "Most ordinary homes are now worth \u00a3250,000 or more. These homes do not belong to super rich people as was the case when this tax was introduced. It now affects millions of ordinary families of modest incomes. It is about time the threshold was raised to only apply to the super rich as it was originally intended for super estates. I want the government to raise the threshold of inheritance tax on homes to apply to landed estates as it was for centuries until now.",
