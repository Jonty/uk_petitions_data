        "additional_details": "In this year of special Olympic and Royal patriotism, I believe that Arthur Conan Doyle's house, Undershaw, should be purchased from it's private owners, for a fair price, by the nation for the nation, and that funds be made available to Hindhead Council to develop Undershaw into a national Conan Doyle Museum.\r\n\r\nDoyle built Undershaw, in Hindhead, Surrey, to share with his family and invalid wife Louise.\r\nToday it is empty, in poor repair and in danger from property development.\r\nUndershaw is of unique architectural and cultural interest to this nation: There, Doyle wrote many of his best-known Sherlock Holmes stories, and many other works. From Undershaw he conducted many of his campaigns for just trial and the rights of the marginalised. Doyle was a staunch patriot.",
