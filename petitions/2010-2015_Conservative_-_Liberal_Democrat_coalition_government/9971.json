Looking back through history, if a person did not work or hunt for their food, they did not eat. Unfortunately a section of society today do not need nor wish to work as they know they will ultimately be fed by those who do. The Government are sustaining this with the current benefit system. Therefore, those who receive benefits should not expect them for free anymore. The Government should make them contribute for their money (just as the rest of society does) whether it be through community service or charity work. Job Seekers allowance should only be available for up to two years.",
