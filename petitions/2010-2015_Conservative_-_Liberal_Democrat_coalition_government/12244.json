        "additional_details": "16 countries in the EU have reduced VAT on tickets to watch sport and/or fees for playing sport. We want the UK Government to adopt the permitted 5% reduced rate. This would reduce expensive ticket prices for football fans and other sports spectators. It would also reduce some prices for playing sport. Remember that members of very smart member-owned sports clubs don't pay any VAT at all!\r\n(The reduced VAT rate is allowed in items 13 and 14 in Annex III and Article 98 of the EU VAT rules.)\r\nWe say that Parliament must debate this as there is a duty to stop distortion in VAT in sport.",
