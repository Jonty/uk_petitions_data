Why put people in prison,wasting our money,the governments money for these people to be housed,fed\r\nAnd helped! The people that have raped,murdered,done any crime that a person of normal mind could not comprehend committing,should not be allowed to live,simply placing them in a prison so they still have some sort of life is disgraceful,when the victims and victims families will live with it forever! It's disgusting that these people could or will one day be released and will most probably re-offend.this is what's wrong with the system,it is backwards! I cannot understand why it was ever abolished in the first place!\r\nBring back the death penalty ",
