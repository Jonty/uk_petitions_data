        "additional_details": "Just under 3 years ago (age 16) I recieved a fixed penelty for a missing 'L-Plate' on my moped and was given 3 points. I then passed my full driving test in 2013 and a few months on recieved a speeding notice for exceeding the speed limit by 13 MPH. With out any notice of them revoking my licence, I did what i thought was best, paid the fine and sent my licence off to be endorsed. I then recieved a further letter stating my licence has been revoked.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of already accepting the speeding fine and had my licence endorsed. there is NO APPEAL PROCCESS. I think there should be an appeal proccess against the actions of the DVLA. surely they cannot be more powerful than the law courts, however they believe they are.\r\n\r\nFor me this ment termination of my employment as i work in the travel industry and need to get around to various airports, stadiums etc.\r\n\r\nSo now I have NO LICENCE and NO JOB.\r\n",
