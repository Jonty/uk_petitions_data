In this range, the Chinese communist party (CCP) has had the united fronts to the politics, economics and entertainments in HK; Plus the more times of hardship and social unrests.\r\nOn the other hand, the declaration has just been agreed by the Marx-Lenin descendants, instead of genuine Chinese ethnic groups, has become the new suffering for the Chinese persons.\r\nThus I am highly recommending the Taiwanese government, once you came back mainland China after CCP was disintergrated, handing over HK to Britain for atonement from China.",
