It ensures that citizens maintain ties with their country of origin and boosts their feeling of belonging to a nation of which they are members regardless of geographical, economic or political circumstances.\r\nThis year we celebrate 100 years of Independence. On this Jubilee year, Albanian Diaspora wants the right to freedom of expression and vote, ensuring all citizens are equal, in line with The Albanian Constitution.\r\n",
