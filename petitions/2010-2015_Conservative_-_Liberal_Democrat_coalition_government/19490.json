        "additional_details": "In 2013 it will be 20 years since he died. In 2016 it will be 50 years since he lifted the only World Cup our nation has ever won. Sometimes you just have to do the right thing. That time is now. Look at other football Knights, and campaigns for Billy Wright and Brian Clough. Ask yourself if Sir Bobby Moore should not be up there at the top. There is precedent for a posthumous award so that point is won. Bobby Moore, the greatest Captain the England Football team has ever had. He showed great pasion for his country and the game. Had he not died so young, had he played in a different age and a different football environment it would be unquestionable. Please sign up now and tell everyone you know who loves football and England to sign up. For Bobby, for his family and for England. If you sign this petition you are taking a stand for doing the right thing. I want this Government to this one right thing and award Bobby Moore a posthumous Knighthood. ",
