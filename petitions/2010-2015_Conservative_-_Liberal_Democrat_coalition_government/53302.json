They already have by cyber stalking.\r\n\r\nThere should be more police protection on cyber stalking and more laws to prevent this from happening whether you are young or an adult person. To say to someone just report the person on Media sites and block them is simply not good enough.\r\n\r\nI have been harassed early hours of the morning and not slept hundred per cent so of course it is affecting me.  Why will the police not do anything?\r\n\r\nThere should be more laws.",
