        "additional_details": "The internet is not the government's property, it is the people's property. It is their window on the real world. Some websites may offend but that does not mean that they should not be there because the people have a right to know what is being said and done. Only then can informed debate take place, an essential element in any democracy. Blocking internet websites has a corrosive effect on this process and should therefore be abolished completely.",
