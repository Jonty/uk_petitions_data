It cannot be right that even though these human animals cannot be sent home they should be treated in our medical facilities at our expense.  They should be idenfied to our hospitals and GP surgeries and put on a  BANNED FROM TREATMENT list.  That is what the people want THAT IS WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH THEM.  Otherwise, just send them home for them to be dealt with in accordance with the laws of their own land.",
