        "additional_details": "People with more than one food-related condition (Candida, Anaphylaxis, Celiac Disease, Gout, and e.g. Diabetes), share many symptoms, so getting diagnosed / treated can take ages. Worse health (inc. anorexia / bulimia), are the result. Fatalities occur.\r\n\r\nWithout proper cataloging of symptoms, precise dietary advice, careful selection of medicine and close monitoring of side-effects, such people can\u2019t know what to safely eat / which hygiene products to use.\r\n\r\nWe ask the Health Dept to provide a Calorie Clinic, so sufferers can be assessed (without referral), put on recovery diets / treatment, and tested for other allergies and food-related conditions in that controlled environment, where symptoms / side-effects would be closely monitored and long-term diet plans put into practice. In-patient / out-patient services are essential.\r\n\r\nWith such a program, many will recover within months instead of years. It should be that simple.\r\n",
