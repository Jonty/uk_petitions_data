        "additional_details": "The commitment of marriage, whilst similar to that of a civil partnership, differs in that marriage is between a man and a woman, whereas a civil partnership endorses a union between two people of the same sex.\r\n\r\nI would like this unique difference to be formally and legally acknowledged each and every time we are obliged to fill out a form; that there would be a separate box for each, one that recognises marriage and another for civil partnerships.\r\n\r\nAlthough a person may be single, it is the definition of that singleness that is different.  This is acknowledged in forms.\r\n\r\nAlthough a person may be in a union with another person, it is the definition of that union that is different.  This is not acknowledged in forms.",
