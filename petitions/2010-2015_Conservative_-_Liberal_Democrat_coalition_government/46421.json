        "additional_details": "We call on the government to merge road tax into fuel duty with the following obvious benefits to The People:\r\n\r\nTransparency of taxation\r\nProportional taxation of the individual according to their road usage\r\nProportional taxation of the individual according to their fuel consumption\r\n\r\nAdditionally the government will be demonstrating:\r\n\r\nCommitment to fair, transparent and proportionate taxation of the individual road user\r\nCommitment to fair, transparent and proportionate taxation of fuel-based carbon emissions\r\n\r\nCommercial vehicle taxation should be retained for HGV's, buses, etc and adjusted downwards accordingly as seen fit and proportionate.\r\n\r\nIn the event the petition merits consideration we would also call on the government to openly publish their justifications for not wanting to adopt such an open and proportionate approach to this proposal, given the high likelihood that demonstrating openness, transparency and fairness in taxation runs counter to internal policy.",
