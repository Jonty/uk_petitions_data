        "additional_details": "Recent court orders have forced 6 Internet Service Providers to block certain websites alleged to facilitate the distribution of copyrighted material. This has two consequences:\r\n\r\n1. Only users of these 6 networks have websites blocked - other ISPs do not block the websites, and so these court orders discriminate against people based on their choice of ISP.\r\n\r\n2. The court orders are given on the basis of claims by music rights organisations that their business model is impacted, despite a recent European study demonstrating this is not the case.\r\n\r\nThe government must stop the courts from discriminating against certain internet users based on their choice of ISP, and discriminating in favour of the music industry against the interests of numerous legitimate uses of bittorrent services.",
