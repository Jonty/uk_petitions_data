        "additional_details": "On Sunday July 7th 2013, Andy Murray ended a 77 year wait for a British Champion at Wimbledon after Fred Perry.\r\nYou just have to look at the papers the day after to see what contribution he has made to sport and how many people he has inspired to watch sport, support Britain and more importantly start to plan tennis as part of the London 2012 Legacy.\r\nFor all the work Andy Murray has done, I believe that he deserves a knighthood to Sir Andy Murray. He is an extraordinary individual who has done extraordinary things!  ",
