Deposit \u00a310 get \u00a335 to play, with new and fantastic slots. Many of these sites are sponsoring day time and early evening television where young and impressionable children are watching.\r\n\r\nAll these are in breach of the Gambling Act 2005, where the code clearly states and I quote.\r\n\r\n\"A person commits an offence if he invites, causes or permits a child or young person to gamble.\"\r\n\r\nView for yourself at the official website in particular subsection 3b\r\n\r\nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/19/section/46\r\n\r\nAll advertisement prior to 9pm regarding gambling is in breach of this Legislation.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and add it to your Facebook page.
