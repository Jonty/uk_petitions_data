        "additional_details": "It has been announced that the sandwich franchise 'Subway' has chosen to remove bacon and ham from its menu's in the United Kingdom in order to cater to the Muslim population of this country. This is an outrage. It is an outrage because the majority of people in the UK are not part of that religion. therefore this is not justified. The aim of this petition is to reverse the decision or otherwise fine Subway for discrimination against the various faith groups that are being ignored as well as the majority of British people.",
