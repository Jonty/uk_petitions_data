Rear fog lights are a hazzard and a distraction to following vehicles unless there is very poor visibility from snow, rain or dense fog.\r\nThe department of transport should legislate that car manufacturers install fog light switches that automatically switch off the rear fog lights after five minutes, forcing the driver to re-evaluate the need for their use and avoiding them simply being left on in error.",
