        "additional_details": "We call  on the Government to encourage formation of an alternative to compulsory or coercive point-of-access payment for entry to English  cathedrals (and cathedrals of other UK countries if amenable).  Beyond their specific religious role, cathedrals are part of UK national heritage,  and a significant source of  diverse spiritual  and cultural inspiration, notably multigenerational. The general requirement to pay for one-off entry to each building, is a woeful bar to their full and proper use. It is appreciated that cathedral upkeep presents staggering costs. Not everyone  would regard this a priority for general tax-payer funding at the present time.  However there are many enthusiasts who would be willing to pay  into a  national membership scheme similar to the National Trust,  to support Cathedrals, while  securing free entry and extra benefits for members,  and facilitating donation-based basic access for  non-members  (perhaps limited to those able to prove UK nationality).",
