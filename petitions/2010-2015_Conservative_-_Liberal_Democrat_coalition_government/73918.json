        "additional_details": "Edinburgh City Council has proposed to plans to lower many of the street's speed limit from 30mph to 20mph on the grounds of \"safety\" and to \"reduce pollution\".\r\nThe speed limit will hinder travel times around the city and pollution will not be reduced either as at lower speeds, emissions from vehicles are actually worse.\r\nThe costs into the new signs and policing are not deemed to be necessary, nor as worthwhile as many of streets are well overdue for resurfacing.\r\nTo that extent, it is proposed that the council spends money on resurfacing these roads as some of them are in an embarrassing state of countless pot holes of which is damaging to vehicles regardless of speed. Resurfacing the roads will allow the streets to be safer inherently for vehicle stability and driver control.\r\nFurthermore, it has been observed that safety is also an issue with road markings not being clear due to fading over time. Hence this would be an additional proposal for alternative spending. ",
