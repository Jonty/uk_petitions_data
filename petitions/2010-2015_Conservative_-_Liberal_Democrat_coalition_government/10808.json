        "additional_details": "Many private companies outsource resources to countries abroad for cost reasons. The cost of keeping prisoners in UK prisons is high. My proposal is for the UK government to build prisons in eastern European countries (e.g. Poland, Romania) and pay respective governments to house our prison population with sentences above, say 2 years in length. Both the aforementioned countries are in the EU so are fully compliant with ECHR regulations and conditions (silencing objections from the usual suspects human rights organisations). Modern technology would allow outsourced prisoners to communicate with their families via the Internet.",
