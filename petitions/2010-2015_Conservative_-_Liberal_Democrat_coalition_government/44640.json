        "additional_details": "It is becoming obvious that more and more dual carriageways are being restricted to 30mph speed limits. Motorists are being misled by the features of the road that they would expect a 40 speed limit and being caught out.  A lighting system is no longer enough to help them recognise and stay within the limit especially when there are no houses or buildings next to the road. The 3024 Maybray Kingway in Southampton is a prime example. A main route  into the city, looks like motorway and yet is a \"restricted\" road. Only locals will recognise it as a 30.  On these dual carriageways 30 repeaters should be allowed or indeed required.",
