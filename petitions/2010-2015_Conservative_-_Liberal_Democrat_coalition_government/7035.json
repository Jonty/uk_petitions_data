        "additional_details": "Recently, peaceful protests have turned into violent riots. In order to help stop this upheaval, I believe that it should be made illegal for anybody to hide their faces with scarfs, hoodies or any other means, when they are attending a peaceful protest. The Police should have the powers to arrest anybody who attempts to hide their faces in peaceful protests. If you agree, that this action would help to stop the violence in protests, then sign this petition. ",
