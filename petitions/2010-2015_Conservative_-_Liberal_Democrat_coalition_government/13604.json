All the more with over 200,000 undergraduates not being able to get a place at university.\r\n\r\nEvery action the government takes should provide more jobs instead of sending us backwards and out of our jobs we have worked hard to sustain.\r\n\r\nI say enough is enough! The government needs to sort itself out now! This is why I plea to you to sign this petition and try to make a difference!",
