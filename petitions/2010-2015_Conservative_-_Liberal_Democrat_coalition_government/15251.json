        "action": "Ban the possession of  bladed weapons in public and private for those with convictions for violence",
        "additional_details": "Present knife legislation makes it an offence to carry a bladed of sharply pointed item in public without reasonable excuse. This does not cover the possession of items like samurai swords or lock knives in a home. Individuals who have convictions for violent crime such as assaults robberies or any crime where a weapon has been used should be banned from possessing any such items, excuse or otherwise in public and in their own home. This would allow the police to seize such items and charge those responsible. This would offer greater protection to the public, a reduction in crime involving weapons and allow more robust action to be taken by police.",
