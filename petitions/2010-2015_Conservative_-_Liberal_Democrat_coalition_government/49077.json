        "additional_details": "Our Armed Forces risk their lives on a daily basis to ensure the safety of others, they are away from family and friends for weeks, months and even years at a time all in the name of duty. They train hard in gruelling conditions, pushed to their limits, live on rations and are exposed to unimaginable sights. Our service men and women deserve a lot more respect than what they are currently receiving; the least we can do is enforce Military dicounts in many if not all supermarkets, restaurants and high street stores. it is disgraceful that student discounts come before and out number that of Military. Lets put this right.",
