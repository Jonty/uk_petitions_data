        "additional_details": "The Isle Of Wight is in desperate need of a permanent link or cheaper ferry fairs for locals and buisnesess, the cost to travel too and from the the island is extortionately to high forcing buisnesess to close and move else where it's also causing buisnesess to not even consider the island as a buisnes venture.\r\nTourism is a massive income for the island that is just not being used to its full potential,  creating a permanent link or reducing the cost would create more jobs for local businesses and help secure a much brighter future for the island as whole.\r\n Please sign this e-petition to force this issue to the house of commons all we need is 100,000 votes.",
