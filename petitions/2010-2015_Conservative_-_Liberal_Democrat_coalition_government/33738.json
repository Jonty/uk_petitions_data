        "additional_details": "Following the abolition of the problematic and ill thought out Indeterminate Sentence for Public Protection (IPP)\r\nWe the petitioners support further change within the system to effectively manage IPP prisoners.\r\nThe government confirmed this situation as unsatisfactory, yet nothing has been done to help those already serving.\r\nIPPs have no release date instead a minimum time to serve (Tariff) and a maximum of 99 years.\r\nIn Oct 2007 the number of IPPs post tariff was 400 compared to the 31st Dec 2011 - 3489 post tariff an increase of over 800%\r\nWe demand an effective system in place that works. Exercise your power to change the release test for IPP prisoners with more regular assessments on dangerousness.\r\nRelease on licence those of low or medium risk who are at or over tariff.\r\nIf it can be definitively proven that prisoners pose a high risk to the public then implement a system enabling them to satisfactorily reduce their risk for later release.\r\n",
