I am neither against the EU Referendum or for it (that's not my point) I just think that this whole epetition idea is just a cosmetic exercise designed to look like democracy when really it is a sop to it. It isn't that hard in the modern day to get 100,000 signatures but what's the point if the Government then do everything they can to deny an actual debate. A worthy idea - but pointless in practise.
