        "additional_details": "Many pets today are uninsured.\r\n\r\nAs a result many owners without pet health insurance are faced with the dilema of putting an animal down due to a lack of funds in order to treat their pet.\r\nAnimals cannot advocate for themselves, it is up to someone else to advocate on behalf of them.\r\nMandatory pet health insurance will ensure that no owner will be placed in the position of not being able to afford adequate care for their pet.\r\nPet health insurance will benefit pets, allowing them to receive veterinary care to prevent their suffereing, and thus improving their quality of life.\r\nI therefore propose that health insurance for pets should be made mandatory for pets such as; dogs, cats and horses.\r\nNot only will pets benefit, owners will too prevent excessive spending on pet health bills.\r\nI propose that the government should also place a cap on the maximum monthly fee that insurance companies can charge to prevent monopolistic practices.",
