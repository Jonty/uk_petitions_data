Last night Major General Julian Thompson, a former commander of the elite force, insisted he would not condemn the convicted man, an experienced veteran of Iraq and previous Afghan tours. Extensive inquiries carried out in the area of the murder with the help of former UK and US military translators have uncovered evidence that the victim could have been Abdullah Jan Agha (pictured), a 23-year-old Taliban commander",
