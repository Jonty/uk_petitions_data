        "additional_details": "A Payday loan is deceptive and Immoral to anyone who dares to look; these loans are targeting young, easily influenced adolescents and adults in the hour of need.\r\nProposal:\r\n\u2022Introduce a firm cost cap; if you cap the total cost of borrowing it would have a huge impact.\r\n\u2022Loans should NEVER be available instantly. When you can get \u00a31500 in your bank within 15 minutes, the loan sells itself on convenience alone.\r\n\u2022Affordability and credit checks.  Some do \u201ccredit checks\u201d however these checks are done on the current state of the individual\u2019s bank account, or their income.\r\n\u2022Ban all loan advertisement. Wonga spend a little of their current \u00a365million profit, on making funny and light hearted TV adverts, broadcasting an idea that a short term loan is the answer to all your family, working or mechanical needs.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, by targeting Payday lenders it is plausible that you could turn around the humble current climate without having to cut school budgets & armed forces resources.",
