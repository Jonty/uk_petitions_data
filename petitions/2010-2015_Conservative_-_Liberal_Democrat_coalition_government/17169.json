        "additional_details": "Single people without children require far less services than those that are in relationships and have children. By choosing not to have children they are not burdening an already over worked NHS, they are not consuming as much food or depositing as much waste so their green credentials are higher. yet taxes and national insurance rates are the same as those who use government services more regularly. I would like to propose a reduction in the amount paid out by such people who currently subsidise the choices that others make by paying the same amount of tax and as such pay more for services.\r\n\r\n e.g. a family of 4 with an income of \u00a350,000 would pay approx \u00a37010 a year in tax (before any tax credits) which equates to \u00a31752.50 per head for all the services they need. A single person currently pays double this for the same services how can this be deemed as fair? ",
