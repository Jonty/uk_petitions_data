        "additional_details": "We feel that we could have a better principal for Donaldson's than the current one in place. We feel that Donaldson's should be a school and not a business. Donaldson's is a specialist school for young people with communication difficulties and learning difficulties. This school should be run by someone who cares about these young people and understands what Donaldson's means to the young people, families and the community.\r\nWe want the current principal out of the school due to the fact that we have no confidence in her. If you care about these young people and their future please sign. Don't let her destroy everything that Donaldson's is and could be. Please help us find someone better and GET HER OUT!\r\n\r\nsend this to everyone you know and get them to sign!\r\nThis is a vote of no confidence in her.",
