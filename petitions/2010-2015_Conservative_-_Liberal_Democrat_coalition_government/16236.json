        "action": "Increase import VAT to reduce fuel duty and increase employment.",
        "additional_details": "The last fifty years has seen many technological and political advances in the world wide transportation of goods.  Larger vessels, reduction of importation taxes and more efficient container yards continue to make the transportation of goods cheaper for those who wish to import goods.\r\n\r\nThis has meant that many jobs and even whole industries have now been shipped abroad causing a huge drop in the number of people employed in the production of goods in the UK.\r\n\r\nTransportation cost has a dramatic effect on production costs. In turn those production costs have a very real effect on employment costs and as we all know total employment cost in a globalised market has a massive effect on total employment for a country.\r\n\r\nToo offset the problem of lower relative importation costs when compared to the cost of \"at home production\" I propose the rising of VAT to imported goods and at the same time for some or all of that income to be spent on keeping the fuel duty as low as possible.",
