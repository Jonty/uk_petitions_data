        "additional_details": "The government should keep the national speed limit on dual carriageways at 70mph. As 49% of drivers already exceed this limit, an increase to 80mph is likely to see a similar proportion exceed that one as well. With substantial numbers of cars being driven at 90mph or more, there will be an increase in accidents and pollution. Speed kills, keep it where it is.",
