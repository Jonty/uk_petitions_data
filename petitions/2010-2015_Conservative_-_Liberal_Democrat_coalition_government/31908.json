        "additional_details": "We the undersigned oppose the Tory-led Government\u2019s decision, announced in Budget 2012, to freeze age related allowances and restrict them to existing recipients, at the same time as cutting the 50p tax rate and giving 14,000 millionaires a tax cut of over \u00a340,000.\r\n\r\nDavid Cameron and George Osborne's Granny Tax means nearly four and a half million pensioners will lose an average of \u00a383 a year and is particularly unfair on people turning 65 next year who stand to lose up to \u00a3323 with very little warning.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Tory-led Government to think again on this unfair raid on our pensioners to fund a tax cut for the richest 1 per cent.\r\n",
