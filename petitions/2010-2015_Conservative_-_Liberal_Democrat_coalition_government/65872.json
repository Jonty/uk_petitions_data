        "additional_details": "Here's my issue, the short and sweet version. I had a cyst in my ovary the size of a plum. I went into A&E 3/4 times, turned away apart from the first time when I was kept in hospital for 4 days because I had a kidney infection (apparently) It took me to collapse in my flat, alone, needing an ambulance to be taken seriously. The pain was truly horrific, my family were terrified. How much does it cost to take a scan at the same time as a smear test? (I was told I was born with the cyst which is why it was so big) in comparison to using an ambulance, 4 days in hospital for the 'kidney infection' the 3/4 times I went into A&E the emergency surgery I had to untwist my ovary (it twisted 3 times) and take my appendix out plus recovery days and the actual surgery to get the cyst removed plus recovery? Women are suffering and the NHS is spending more money than need be. I also had 6 weeks off work. Please sign this petition to make a difference to women in the UK.",
