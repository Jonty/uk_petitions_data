        "additional_details": "According to comparison websites, in France & Belgium the average price of diesel is about 25p. per litre cheaper than it is in the UK.  HGV drivers will fill their fuel tanks before crossing to the UK. Some trucks have tanks that hold up to 2000 litres, saving them up-to \u00a3500:00 on UK prices, this will enable them to travel over 2500miles before refuelling. High UK fuel duty is destroying our own haulage industry, we still get the  trucks & pollution but don't get the tax because it\u2019s going to France & Belgium. Reducing the cost of UK fuel equal that to of our neighbours will lower transport costs to industry helping EVERYONE and the tax which now goes to France & Belgium will come here. UK hauliers have to pay a tax or toll in Europe yet foreign trucks travel the roads of Britain and pay nothing. If too expensive to create or own system, apply to join the the \u201cEuroVinyette\u201d system operated by the \u201cBeNelux\u201d countries!",
