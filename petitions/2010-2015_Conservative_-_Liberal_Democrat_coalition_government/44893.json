Expecting new mothers / heavily pregnant women to squeeze all of their work into a few days is unfair and creating stress. For the self employed a maximum of 80 hours equates to 10, 8 hour days, which then can be stretched into 2 hours today,4 hours tomorrow. Flexibility needed to help small businesses survive and new mothers gain the best for their childrens future.",
