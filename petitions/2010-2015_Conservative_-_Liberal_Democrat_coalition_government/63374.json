        "additional_details": "We all depend on our good character to be able to obtain employment and enjoy normal social interaction.\r\nNo-one wants to employ a criminal, a terrorist, a paedophile or a drug pusher or to have anything to do with such socially. At present if someone spreads these slanders it is not a criminal offence even though it is quite obvious that such rumours can destroy your life. Slander is classed as a Tort and you would need to identify the source and take out a civil action - at your own expense. To obtain the evidence needed you would also need to employ a private detective. Obviously the law as it exists provides no protection for anyone who is not enormously wealthy. Criminal defamation of character - accusing someone of being a criminal when they are not - MUST be defined as a criminal act so that the police can investigate and the slanderers be identified as the criminals they are.",
