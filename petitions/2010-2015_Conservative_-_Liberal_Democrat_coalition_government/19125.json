        "additional_details": "The 'Theory of Evolution' is not a scientific fact as it is being promoted.  Evolution is based on suppositions and speculation and like creation cannot be proven by science as nobody lived at the beginning of time.  Both creation and evolution rely on belief.  The creationist believes in the Bible and the Evolutionist believes in the writings of James Hutton's idea of 'Uniformatarianism' and Charles Darwin's 'Origin of the Species'.  Any serious student of the evolution theory will find many flaws and faults with these mens hypothosis, so it is unfair to call for the removal of creation teaching from schools on the basis of flawed evidence.",
