        "additional_details": "As motorbikes are smaller than other vehicles, they take up less room on the roads and by making journey times shorter thus easing congestion, they also do not wear out the road surface as much as other vehicles and do not pollute the air as much as other vehicles do, as other vehicles sit in jams with their engines running and motorbikes are constantly able to keep moving. We the undersigned would like the government to at least do away with the road tax for bikes with an engine size of 500cc or greater with a view to scrap road tax for ALL motorbikes in the future",
