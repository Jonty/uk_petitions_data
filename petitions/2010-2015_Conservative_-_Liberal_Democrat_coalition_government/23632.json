        "additional_details": "These proposals are wrong on many levels - suggesting taxpayers have to subsidise political parties will only add to the idea that politicians are out of touch with reality, and encourages a disconnect from political debate.\r\nWithout popular support, why should political parties survive?\r\nIf parties cannot get themselves funded and then manage their own budget then they have no business being in Westminster.\r\nCapping large donations to avoid risk of corruption or undue influence has merit but proposals do nothing to address the very real issue of political influence that is bought with union donations.\r\nA real danger also with these proposals is that it would inhibit new parties forming, for without a generous donor they would not survive for long unless they were able to quickly get members elected. \u00a310,000 per donor PA is far too small a limit.\r\nThe government should reject these proposals, raise the limit to \u00a330,000 and insist that political parties stand on their own feet.",
