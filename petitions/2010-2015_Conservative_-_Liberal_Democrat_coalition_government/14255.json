The addition of the following clauses attempts to provide a solution by leaving the existing Act untouched but provide for its operation and judgements to be contingent on recognising additional central and fundamental underlying principles.\r\n1. The rights of the innocent exceed those of an aggressor.\r\n2. The rights of the majority exceed those of a minority.\r\n3. The individual has a primary responsibility for their own actions.\r\n\r\n(End)\r\n\r\n ",
