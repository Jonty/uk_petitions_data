        "additional_details": "As a highly satisfied customer of Virgin Rail West Coast I believe the government must undertake an immediate and independent review and reverse its deeply flawed decision. Any other outcome is purely financially driven, and out of keeping with the traditions of this great country. Since 1997 Richard Branson has transformed the customer experience of rail travel. Virgin Rail defines a great British train and the difference between standard customer service (or not) and real customer delight. This excellence is too important to gamble with. Grounds for changing this decision are numerous. Importantly the insanity of replacing a great staff and management team with an established track record, with an operator with a poor track record of unsustainable promises, is not just open to ridicule, but a claim of negligence as well. There are improvements Virgin Rail can make in the future and I am confident that they will do so. They have more than earned the chance to demonstrate this.\r\n   ",
