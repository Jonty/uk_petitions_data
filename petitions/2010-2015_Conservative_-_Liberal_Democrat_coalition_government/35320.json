Young people without family support have little choice; if they chose full -time education - so that they may get a better job - they will have no financial support; their only choice is to remain within the benefits system looking for jobs that don't exist.\r\n ( see gisda.org for more information.)\r\n\r\nThe government needs to change these benefit rules to give these young people an equal chance at education.",
