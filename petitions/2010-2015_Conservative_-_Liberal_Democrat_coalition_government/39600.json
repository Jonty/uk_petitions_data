        "additional_details": "Fresh revelations have emerged concerning the abusive behaviour of the late Jimmy Savile towards young girls over many years and there will probably be more to come. The matter should be thoroughly investigated by the BBC with possible charges brought against anyone in senior positions who knew about this and did nothing. The BBC should also issue a public apology to the victims if the allegations are found to be corroborated. The waxwork of Savile in Madame Tussauds should be removed immediately. ",
