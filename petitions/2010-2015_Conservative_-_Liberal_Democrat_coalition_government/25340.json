        "additional_details": "The government need to step in and restrict businesses that feel the need to work 24/7 particularly shops, supermarkets and their production/supply chain. Do we really need to go to Tesco's at 3 in the morning? NO. But they are open with all the lights and heating blazing away and no-one in the place. We used to manage when\r\nshops shut at 5 or 6pm and were shut all day Sunday. 24/7 shift working destroys quality of life for families, wrecks marriages and lowers moral.It needs to be stopped in all but essential cases such as care work and hospitals.",
