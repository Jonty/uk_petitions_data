        "additional_details": "Teachers and students all across the UK are being negatively affected by the actions of Michael Gove.\r\nAlthough I agree that attendance is important in education, the way he proposes funding for students should not be based on this. He does not take into consideration individual differences between students.\r\nThis is just ONE of his ridiculous, impractical proposals and does not give children a fair chance to achieve.\r\nI propose that Mr Gove be removed from post and that the voice of the public and those within the education sector, including teachers and students be heard.  Education policy should be evidence based because the future of the next generation is too important to be a political football.\r\nI fear for the education of children of the future as Gove's actions could end up causing severe consequences for the current generation.\r\nMr Gove is allowing his own ideological stance to dictate education policy - regardless of whether it is backed by evidence or research findings.",
