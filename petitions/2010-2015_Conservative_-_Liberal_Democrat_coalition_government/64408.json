Edward Sobcyzk and his two colleagues saved over 100!!!\r\n\r\nA dry run for D-Day, Exercise Tiger led to over 700 American forces being killed by German Torpedo Boats.\r\n\r\nAfter being given the recommendation for the Silver Star it was quashed by Eisenhower who declared that Slapton sands never happened.\r\n\r\nTell that to the 700+ who died... 70 years is enough time to recognise the great men and women that served our nation, whether they are British, American or German.\r\n\r\nGet the British Government to say thank you before it's too late for these guys.\r\n\r\nThanks for your support.",
