        "additional_details": "Public houses are either closing down or becoming restaurants, and alcohol abuse is at an all time high. Put the responsibility of selling alcohol back into the hands of pubs and off-licences. This will deter people from stocking up at home, and also encourage social drinking as opposed to 'front loading' before venturing out of one's home. Pub prices will lower as a result and communities will benefit from such an important hub of the community.",
