Between Domestic Leagues, UEFA Champions League; UEFA Europa Cup; Euro 2012; Olympic Football and occasionally the World Cup. As a non-football fan it can get a bit tiresome.\r\n\r\nNow that the BBC is a digital network could they start their own BBC Sport Channel and move all sports coverage from BBC 1 and 2 to that channel?\r\n\r\nThis would serve to free up schedules on the mainstream channels and still satisfy the UK's insatiable appetite for Football with other events running concurrently \"available on the Red Button\".\r\n\r\nIt would also mean that I and others like me could escape from the tedium of yet another Football Tournament.",
