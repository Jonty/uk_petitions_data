        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, urge the Policing & Criminal Justice Minister, Nick Herbert MP, to use the Government\u2019s powers to compel Police Authorities not to record criminal activity related to the 2011 riots as \u2018violent disorder\u2019 (or any other terminology that falls short of \u2018rioting\u2019) in order to avoid paying out compensation under the Riot Damages Act.\r\n\r\nWhere Police Authorities have done this, we urge the Government use its powers to compel them to revisit their decision and rightfully pay out the compensation that is being underwritten by Government to riot victims.\r\n\r\nIt is unacceptable that, many months on, 9/10 victims have not received the compensation guaranteed to them under law.\r\n",
