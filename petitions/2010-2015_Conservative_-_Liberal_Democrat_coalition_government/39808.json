        "additional_details": "There is currently no appropriate jail sentence by which a  child killer can attone for his/her crime.  Instead tax payers resources are wasted protecting them, and this is no deterent. The murder of a helpless child, either through deliberate cruelty and abuse by an adult who is supposed to care for the child, or through a deliberate purely selfish act by any other adult, must result in the permenant removal of that perpitrator from society, for the protection of all of our children,because such acts of barbarity must mean that the perpitrator forfeits their own basic human rights to be allowed to live within this society, even within a secure facility. Bring back the Death Penalty for convicted child killers. ",
