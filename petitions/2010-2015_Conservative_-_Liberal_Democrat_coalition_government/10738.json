        "additional_details": "We believe that Britain, as a proudly sea-faring nation with a history built on overseas trade, should build an  official State Ship to fly the flag for British business around the world.  This would replicate the successful record of the former Royal Yacht Britannia, which undertook many trade missions during its years of service, helping generate millions for the British economy.  The new Ship could be made available to The Queen for high-profile State Visits and other national occasions, but its primary role would be promoting the UK and generating investment.",
