        "additional_details": "My child comes home from school once a week with head lice, its costing us a fotune! We check him every day, why should we suffer because other parents can't be bothered to do the same. Bringing back the nit nurse would stop all of this with regular checks. My partner owns a hair salon and is constantly worried that if she catches head lice from our son without knowing it could close her down. We want the government to place a nit nurse or person of equal stature in every junior and infant school and give back teachers the power to tell parents their child has head lice. ",
