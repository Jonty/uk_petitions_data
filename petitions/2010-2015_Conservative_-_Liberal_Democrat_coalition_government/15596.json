So much so that criminals are now encouraged to crash on purpose and normal people to get their claim in since everyone else does.\r\nCar insurance has rocketed even for safe drivers with 30 years no claims. Why do they have to suffer?\r\n'Have you had an accident' is seen and heard everywhere from TV to shopping centres. They are making money from misery and encouraging us to think only about money.\r\nHealth & Safety at work has become a nightmare and also has for schools. Everyone is frightened of doing anything; you cannot offer an aspirin or a plaster to someone who may need one unless you are a doctor! Children can\u2019t be children in case they fall and the school is sued.  It\u2019s a complete nonsense. I want the government to put a stop to this nonsense and bring awards back to sensible levels.",
