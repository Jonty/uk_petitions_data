        "additional_details": "On the 10th May 2013, Workers at R C Brewery, Liverpool were informed that they had lost their jobs, and that any debts needed to be claimed from the government. The owners of the company proudly announced to the press that they had \"stopped\" operations to concentrate on the development of the Brewery Village Project. RC Brewery went into liquidation leaving unpaid employees, unfulfilled contracts, unpaid creditors, and unpaid taxes, legally avoiding paying their debts for the second time.\r\nWe believe that it is a travesty of justice, that  the law permits this\r\nPlease support our campaign to :\r\n1) Stop Brewery Village until all creditors have been paid in full.\r\n2) Force the government need to debate whether the current insolvency laws are sufficient to protect workers and creditors in situations of insolvency.\r\n3) Give the government should have the right to sieze the assets of the associated companies of RC  Brewery in order to sell these assets and raise funds for creditors\r\n\r\n",
