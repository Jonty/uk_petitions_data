Why has the government taken no action to stop the tracking or limited the tracking of Google users. It is very dangerous for a company to collect so much information about people and the company not have any accountability to those people. The government need to discuss why Google has a free reign to do what they like and why they are ignoring our privacy laws.\r\nThe government also need to look at why there is almost a 100% biased media coverage of Google, while other search engines like Bing, Excite and British ones like Ehalos hardly get any coverage.\r\n",
