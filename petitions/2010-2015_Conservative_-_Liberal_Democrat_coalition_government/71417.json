Since dropping clause 4 the party no longer represents the thoughts and objectives of the ordinary working man in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nSince 1994 they have slowly evolved into a neo Tory party or a right wing s.d.p moving more towards privatisation and de centralisation of public owned institutions such as the nhs and police force.\r\n\r\nI strongly believe that the party's name no longer represents the ideals of the workers movement\r\n\r\n",
