I don\u2019t recall seeing one about claiming a tax rebate for washing your uniform.  Why?  This is a HMRC allowance that they seem to keep tucked away on their website and ordinary people are reliant upon tax rebate companies such as www.u-tax.net to make them aware.\r\n\r\nWhy doesn\u2019t HMRC advertise the availability of uniform tax rebates and make it simple to claim them.\r\n",
