        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, petition the UK government to repeal both the 1997 and 1988 Firearms Acts. We believe that law-abiding people should be allowed to own handguns as well as other firearms prohibited under these laws, should they wish to do so. These acts were knee-jerk reactions to tragic incidents and have done nothing to decrease violent crime. We also petition the government to amend firearms legislation so that all applicants for Firearms Certificates (FAC's) are treated in the same, fair manner. We believe that the police should have no discretion to deny an FAC to any adult unless he or she has a conviction for a serious violent crime (such as robbery, rape or murder) nor should they have the authority to revoke a FAC unless a person is convicted of a serious crime of violence resulting in a prison sentence. An appeal procedure (heard by a jury) should be introduced so that any ex-offender has the chance to obtain an FAC, regardless of what crimes he committed and when.",
