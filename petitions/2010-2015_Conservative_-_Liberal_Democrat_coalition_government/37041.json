Offering yearly televised competitions for inter school / collegiate finals and age graded competitions for ordinary people wanting to 'have a go'.\r\n\r\nCan't we get excited about seeing which school wins the 4 * 400m relay, whether our neighbour can win the over 60s 100m final or cheering the checkout girl who took up discus last year?\r\n\r\nA programme giving school children & adults access to as wide a variety of Olympic sports as possible, including facilities & coaching.  It should be targeted, requiring 90% of school children have access to 75% of Olympic sports funded via lottery, govt, corporate sponsorship & ticketing.\r\n\r\nThe Govt must support the creation of an independent body to design & deliver the above in cooperation with sports bodies with the consent of schools, colleges & ordinary people.",
