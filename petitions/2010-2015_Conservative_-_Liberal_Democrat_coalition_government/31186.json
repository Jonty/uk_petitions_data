        "additional_details": "New technology which allows paraplegics, and other people with severe, immobilising disabilities to walk again has recently entered the market in the United States. This technology, an exoskeleton, has the potential to revolutionise the lives of millions of disabled people globally, enhancing their quality of life and ensuring that they walk again - a truly tremendous achievement. The exoskeletons represent a new wave in an era of rehabilitative technology.\r\n\r\nI propose that the Department of Health invest in this new technology, making it available to all who need it, and granting the paraplegic community the chance to walk again.\r\n\r\n",
