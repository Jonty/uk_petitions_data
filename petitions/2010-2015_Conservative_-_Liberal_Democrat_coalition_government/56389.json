        "additional_details": "Under current plans, as of Jan 2014 any professional driver of PCV's or HGV's who took their test and became qualified in a Automatic vehicle will be allowed to start driving Manual vehicles without any further training or assessment as long as at a minimum they are qualified to drive a manual car.\r\nThis is a inherently dangerous situation, the public & other road users place their trust in the fact that the operator of a PCV or HGV has undergone adequate training to control that vehicle. Previously as with all classes of licence if you passed in a Manual you could drive anything, if you passed in a Automatic you were limited to driving Automatics only. This is how it should remain, driving a manual car is totally different to driving a Manual bus or lorry and as such specific training and assessment is required. To allow an under-trained individual to take control of a Manual vehicle without any further assessment is simply dangerous. ",
