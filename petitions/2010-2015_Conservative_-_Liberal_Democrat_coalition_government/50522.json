We have the ability to prove the guilt beyond any doubt.\r\nTo save our childrens future's we need to reintroduce the death sentence for terrorist and child killers with the consideration of making it a possiblity for all killers to be given the death sentence.  This will act as a deterrent and bring justice back to this country.  London is our capital and we cant even keep our innocent citizens safe.\r\nLets make our leaders and politicians listen or it will only get worse.",
