        "additional_details": "In light of the timing of the release of intelligence by the US government which firmly points to the Syrian government as being responsible for the chemical attacks, the UK parliament was not able to debate fully the issue of intervening in Syria. Further, the UN weapons inspectors can not tell any more than already known about the incident, making waiting for the UN report somewhat irrelevant. Parliament should be given another opportunity to vote on this incredibly important subject given a more informed picture.",
