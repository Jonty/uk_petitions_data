        "action": "Stop raw toilet waste being dumped at Liverpool Street Station",
        "additional_details": "Toilet waste is dropped directly onto the track from many Greater Anglia trains. Liverpool Street is a covered station and so this waste is not washed away or subject to natural weathering processes. I believe this is health hazard for passengers and rail workers. This practice should be stopped, it is not reasonable that vast numbers of people using Liverpool Street are being exposed to the risks associated with raw sewage on a daily basis. It is 2013 not 1913.  I have written to Greater Anglia trains they say \u2018We do not have any plans to change the toilet systems we currently have on board our trains.\u2019\u00a0\r\nI would like the government to legally enforce that all train companies must use trains with 'retention' toilets.",
