        "additional_details": "Building the Stubbington bypass will not solve traffic congestion, it will also help to facilitate building new homes in the strategic gap.  The money for the bypass should be invested in upgrading existing roads and providing alternate means of transport, otherwise once built it will simply become yet another congested road, it won't solve the problem in the longer term.  The strategic gap is locally used for dog walking, running, cycling and other leisure activities, also it's a lovely area of countryside, that will all disappear under the new proposals.",
