Jobs advertised in the local area present some geographic difficulties. Travelling to these places for interviews can mean changing from one bus to another and their infrequency is frustrating. Caring for people in the community, presents problems with shift start and end times not coinciding with buses or trains running at those early or late hours and many caring staff take risks walking home in darkness.\r\nElectric bikes loaned or trialled by the DWP for Jobseekers on benefits would provide a helpful  resource to those looking for work with limited means of mobilty to get from A to B.\r\nThese bikes would be handed back once their purpose is fulfilled and the employee could upgrade to a car once established in work or purchased from the DWP.\r\n",
