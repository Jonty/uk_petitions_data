        "additional_details": "I propose that the Council, Private and Housing Association Tenancy Agreements be enshrined in Criminal law thereby making it an offence for Tenant(s) or Landlords to breach said agreement.  In the case of the tenant, the breach would culminate in an three strikes out reprimand or eventual eviction depending on the severity of the crime committed.  In the case of the Landlord the breach would culminate in the sacking of the Housing Officer and/or line manager/management depending of the severity of the breach.  In the extreme case of total management breakdown and loss of control of an estate, then the tenants should have the right to vote on either:-\r\n\r\n\u2022\twho there new landlord will be.\r\nor\r\n\u2022\thave the chance to run there estate either as a Housing Co-operative or some other form of Tenant Management system.\r\n\r\n",
