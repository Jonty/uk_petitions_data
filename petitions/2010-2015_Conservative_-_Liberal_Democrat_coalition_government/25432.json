        "additional_details": "Too many of our current MP\u2019s have had limited or no experience within the economy actually working, they understand the theory however their knowledge of real life application is limited. This has led to a lack of compassion, empathy and foresight which only comes with experience and is necessary to make the best judgement.\r\n\r\nPeople should not be able to leave university and entre a career in politics. As real life experience is required to make the best choices as well as allowing an understanding of how decisions affect those people one governs.\r\n\r\nI believe there should be a law introduced requiring all new Members of Parliament to have 15 years experience before running for a seat. I believe fully in this as with experience comes maturity, wisdom and respect. (I am 24 and understand that I have a lot to learn)\r\n",
