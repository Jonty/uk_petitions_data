        "additional_details": "This petition is to stop all MP's being allowed to have a payrise in the current climate that Britain faces today\r\n\r\nWith NHS cuts, nurses are expected to work long hours and have no pay rise\r\n\r\nWith benefit reforms the disabled have their benefits cut\r\n\r\nFuel tax is always on the up that its fast becoming unaffordable\r\n\r\nWorking tax credits getting capped for low income working families\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the working class who don't get any benefits from the state but still struggle to pay the rising cost of food, council tax, car taxes, and many more expenses without wages going up\r\n\r\nSo why then should the public have the added cost of paying for the MP's pay rise after the MPs expense scandal .... Its outrageous and it wont be tolerated any more !!!",
