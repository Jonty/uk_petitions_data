Since then I have intermittently been on a potent steroid cream. I will be shortly going on an immuno-suppressant cream to stop my immune system attacking my body. I have only just been diagnosed with this allergy.  My Doctor told me to not handle any coins, or any other metal, and don't touch my face.\r\n1 in 10 people are affected by a nickel allergy, and like me has to wear gloves when touching any coins or anything metal.  I have spent the last three days trying to avoid metal or wearing gloves.\r\nIts Life Changing.\r\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2344658/Why-allergic-bra-Nickel-coins-caused-surge-eczema-But-thats-just-start-.html",
