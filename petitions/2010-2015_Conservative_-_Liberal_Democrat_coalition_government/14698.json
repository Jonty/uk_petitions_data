These workers are being forced by the current system into second and even third party sub contracts, so to distance the companies as far as possible from employer.responsibilities.\r\nThe workers are left with very little rights and subject to dismissal at a moments notice. The practice is now endemic in the construction industry in particular.\r\n",
