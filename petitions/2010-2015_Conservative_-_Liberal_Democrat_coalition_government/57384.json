        "additional_details": "The approaching 100th anniversary of the First World War is generating enormous interest. So many British people died in various conflicts in the service of their country that their remembrance is assuming ever greater significance.\r\n\r\nRecently, the observance of two minutes silence at 11am on 11th November to commemorate Armistice Day has been reintroduced & the numbers participating nationally increases each year. Furthermore, the main ceremony in Whitehall at the Cenotaph on 11 November is attracting ever greater attendance - including senior politicians and other dignitaries.\r\n\r\nI propose that the official Remembrance ceremony at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London, which currently takes place on the second Sunday each November is moved back, as it once was, to 11 November. A most suitable and poignant date for the suggested change would be 11 November 2018 which happens to fall on a Sunday. Thereafter it would occur on Armistice Day itself, regardless of the day of the week.\r\n",
