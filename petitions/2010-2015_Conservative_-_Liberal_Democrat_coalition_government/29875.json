This is in reference to the three men who were recently jailed for suggesting that homosexuals be subject to the death penalty.\r\n\r\nImmigrants who incite murder have no place in British society, and should be deported and banned from ever re-entering the UK. This would be cheaper for the taxpayer than jailing the criminals.",
