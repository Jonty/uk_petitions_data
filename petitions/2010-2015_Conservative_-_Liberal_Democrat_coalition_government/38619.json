        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call on the government to do away with GP catchment areas in England.\r\n\r\nMany people, especially those living in rural areas cannot choose their GP practice, as there may be only one GP practice close to where they live.\r\n\r\nConsequently, GP practices in rural areas, with little or no competition, often provide an inferior service to those in towns or cities where they would be subject to more competition.\r\n\r\nIn addition, many people living in town and cities, where they have to commute some distance to work, would also find if much more convenient to have a GP near to where they work. Especially as many GP practices are not open outside normal working hours.\r\n\r\nIt seems, the much hyped \u201cNHS Choices\u201d amount to no choice at all.\r\n\r\nWe urge the government to do away with GP catchment areas.",
