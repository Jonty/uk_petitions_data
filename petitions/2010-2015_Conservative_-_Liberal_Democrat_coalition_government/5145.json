        "additional_details": "Puppy Farming is intensive, cruel & therefore in breech of the Animal Welfare Act 2006. Bitches are constantly in pup. They get little to no opportunity to display or engage in \"natural behaviour\". They are frequently under nourished in these farms, not exercised or played with properly, & are used as cash generators for the owners of the farm.\r\nThe pups are often in ill health and sold in bulk orders to large pet store chains. Prospective consumers/buyers are often unaware the pup has come from a Puppy Farm & has been subjected to an often squalid environment, & parted from its mother too soon. Like their mother they are often under or poorly nourished, & many have not received initial vaccinations. Many of these puppies die several weeks or months after purchase, simply because they have been so intensively bred.\r\nIt is an afront to our supposed civilised society and \"nation of animal lovers\" that our government has not outlawed Puppy Farms yet. Right that wrong.",
