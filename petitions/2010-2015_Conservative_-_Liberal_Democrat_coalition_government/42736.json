Examples include mink and grey squirrels.\r\nThere should be a nationwide cull of all alien invasive species.\r\n\r\nGovernment funded trappers should control alien invasive species and assist landowners with control efforts.\r\n\r\nGrants should be available to control all alien invasive species, to give landowners an incentive.\r\n\r\nThere should be an awareness campaign to discourage people from interfering with cull efforts by, for example, vandalising traps and encouraging invasive species (such as by feeding them).",
