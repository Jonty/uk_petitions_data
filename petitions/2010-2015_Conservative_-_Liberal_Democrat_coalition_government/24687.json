        "additional_details": "It is a myth that anything that HMG owns do not make any money for British taxpayers & anything that private enterprises does do. Is this what is meant by the concept of the \u2018state being small & individuals big\u2019?  If it was true that whatever HMG owns do not make any money, then HMG should not nationalise banks as it will not make any money/profits for taxpayers whatsoever. If privatising HMG companies (like public utilities) or even sourcing out services (like prisons, laboratories, museums) rather than running services in-house, can be profitable for private enterprises, why not for HMG herself|? Why can't the British government invest in the space and shipping industry like the USA & South Korea respectively? Infrastructure & industries like China & India? Why can\u2019t HMG act as an imaginative entrepreneur/tycoon investing & setting up new British companies/businesses before foreign owners set them up & have the many of the available jobs effectively shipped abroad?",
