This man has had no contact with my child for 3+ years! has never sent any birthday or Christmas cards and has just started in direct contact because he was ordered to. He has done this because since 2003 when child law changed which gave fathers more rights. This needs changing again, and I believe that if a parent, mother or father, is absent from a child's life for 2 or more years, their parental responsibility should be taken away from them. It should be the choice of the child whether they want to gain access to an absent parent, not the choice of the parent and certainly not the law to force information and a decision upon a child who is too young to understand what is happening.",
