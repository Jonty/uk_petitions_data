The least they deserve is a hot meal, free of charge.\r\n\r\nNow the government have given early years and ks1 free school meals, it should be fair that their teaching staff should get it free too.\r\n\r\nSign the petition if you think you as staff should get free school meals or if you think your child's staff should get a free meal for all their hard work.\r\nSome people think working in a school is really easy and get paid fairly. It's a hard job especially TAs who don't get what they deserve.\r\n\r\nThank you ",
