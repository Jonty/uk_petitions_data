        "additional_details": "CCUK is a charity that supports sufferers of IBD and raises money for research and also raises awareness of these conditions.\r\n\r\nOne such way of support is help with a sufferers urgent need for toilet access by providing a \"Cant Wait\" card. This is an informative card asking retailers for the use of their toilet in the event that no public toilets are nearby.\r\n\r\nSufferers can experience sudden, unstoppable urges to need to use a toilet. Some cannot hold it in. Others can hold it but suffer with severe stomach cramps as a result. Some sufferers with stomas may need to empty their bag urgently.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, nearly all retailers still don't recognise the cards and are not nearly understanding enough despite the best efforts of CCUK.\r\n\r\nWe ask the goverment to discuss the possibility of making access to toilets mandatory where a Cant Wait card is shown and for car parks to allow access to disabled bays if the card is visible.
