        "additional_details": "As a Non Executive Director at CQC, Key Sheldon has repeatedly put her career and reputation on the line, fundamentally because she cared about the safety of patients and had grave concerns that the CQC were not adequately fulfilling its remit as the regulator of health and social care in the UK.\r\n\r\nThese are concerns that have now been widely accepted as being accurate and valid.\r\n\r\nKay Sheldon is now seen and widely respected as being on the side of patients and is trusted to speak with honesty and integrity. These qualities are  a considerable asset to any organisation wishing to publicly demonstrate a commitment to openness  and transparency.\r\n\r\nWe the  undersigned call upon the Secretary of State for Health to support Kay Sheldon's continued role on the CQC board and believe this is vital if the CQC are going to regain public confidence as an organisation that truly puts the interests and safety of patients first.",
