        "additional_details": "For many criminals prison is now too much of a soft touch costing tax payers on average \u00a347000 per prisoner. They simply sit out their sentence in relative comfort with access to a raft of luxury amenities, such as satellite TV and Play Stations, than most law abiding citizens can own or afford. This petition is for the introduction of forced labour within the prison system either as a way of generating money from goods manufactured or work done.",
