The idea is that the wealthy will invest more in the country and create more jobs. Sadly, this isn't always the case.\r\n\r\nMy Proposal: (Numbers not concrete, but only to highlight the principle - I'll leave the maths to Mr. George Osbourne)\r\n1./ Raise High Earnings Tax to 65%\r\n2./ Target High Earners to Employ People\r\n3./ If High Earners hit the Target they only get taxed 40%\r\n4./ If High Earners go above and beyond their target there would be a sliding scale to as low as 20% tax\r\n\r\nYou can see why it would be good for high earners to set up a payroll for:- Gardeners, Maids, Small Enterprises \u2013 they cannot lose, they would be reaping the benefit of extra services through who they employ and also a lower tax. The extra jobs created would pay for the tax cuts.",
