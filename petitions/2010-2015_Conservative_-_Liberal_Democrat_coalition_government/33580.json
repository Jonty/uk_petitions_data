        "additional_details": "The football cage on union street (Peel Avenue), Tranmere, Merseyside is a three sided football cage which needs to be made more secure to prevent access to the railway line which runs parallel.\r\nIn July 2011 Dale Lee William Fleckner lost his life at the age of 16. he was playing football in the cage, when the ball was kicked up high over the railway. Dale climbed the cage & railway wall (as he & so many other children have before) to retrieve the ball, unfortunately on this occasion dale never came back down, he lost his life.\r\nThis is why we are starting this petition, to make the cage safer for children of all age groups to play safely, especially as summer is coming.\r\nWe want the cage to be turned into a four sided cage to prevent the children of the area, to be able to climb up onto the railway wall and attempt to prevent the loss of another young persons life.",
