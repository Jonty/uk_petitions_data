        "additional_details": "Schools should stop organising/offering school trips inside and outside of school hours. Although some of these trips can appear educational it places increased pressure on already over stretched families who may have other children also being offered school trips. Most of these trips are over priced as they supplement teacher/adult supervision. The guilt factor of considering not allowing your child to go on a trip with their class mates results in most families over stretching their finances. Bring FREE schooling back.",
