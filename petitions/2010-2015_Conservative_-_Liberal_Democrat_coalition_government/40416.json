Almost all of these are being managed by firms from outside of Liverpool who are not employing, and in some cases have refused to employ, any local tradesmen or labourers. Instead they bring people from out of town, or in many cases, from outside the U.K.\r\n\r\nI think it is safe to assume that there are currently similar cases right throughout the UK at present.\r\n\r\nI feel it should be debated in parliament and by local authorities to insist that local labour is sought for ALL building projects throughout the UK as there are presently thousands upon thousands of skilled trades people out of work in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis is a fact that contradicts the governments talk of a skills deficit in the UK.
