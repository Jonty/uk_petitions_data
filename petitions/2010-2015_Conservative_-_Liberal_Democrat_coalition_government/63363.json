        "additional_details": "Due to recent changes in immigration rules, most affected businesses are licensed restaurants. We respect the policy to control the immigration but skilled workers should be allowed to come here. If needed, restrict the facility to become permanent resident. Let them work and pay taxes and ask them to leave the country after certain years. We are only asking to be able to bring skilled workers such as chefs in indian restaurant as these posts can not be filled within the country. Salary requirements should be realistic too as there are so many small businesses that they rely on migrant workers and the industry is suffering thereby loosing the huge chunks of tax.",
