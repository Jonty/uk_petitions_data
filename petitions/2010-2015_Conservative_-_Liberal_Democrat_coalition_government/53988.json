        "additional_details": "On Wednesday 14th August 2013 - Two people from Handsworth, died in a fatal car accident on Park Lane, West Bromwich. The council must implemented more strict driving restriction on this road. This road is notorious for speeding, as it has national speed limit of 70 MPH. The road also has very low visibility and very tight corners, very hilly and the road lanes are very narrow. I have looked into the history of this road and it is clear that no real measures have been taken to avoid the countless deaths and accident that have occurred on Park Lane.\r\nIt all about prevention and serious changes to the peoples perception. By introducing the abolishment of the Nation Speed Limit (70MPH), on Park Lane and replacing this with 30MPH zone, add more speed bumps, extra lighting and more speed warnings, we will reduce the carbon footprint as well as noise pollution and more importantly we will be SAVING LIVES. THIS ISSUE MUST BE ADDRESSED, WE WILL FIGHT UNTIL THE END!!!!",
