        "additional_details": "Quite simply the UK is in crisis with Mental Illness and its inefficiency to deal with the ever increasing number of people diagnosed. Effective treatment is not widely available as it should so rightly be. Hospital beds are scarce & counselling has a truly unacceptable waiting time for people who needed urgent help, not today or tomorrow but in some cases tragically yesterday. Pharmaceutical drugs are often the one and only choice. Orthomolecular medicine needs to be more widely available.\r\nThe Great British public & I are calling on the UK government to appoint a Cabinet Minister for Mental Health, to have someone responsible to end this crisis NOW.\r\nRead the report produced by the London School of Economics regarding Mental Illness in June 2012 here:\r\n\r\nhttp://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/special/cepsp26.pdf\r\n",
