With the new development at The Meadows bringing a further 100+ families to the area, together with the existing residents along Commonside East who would habitually use Beddington Lane station, it is completely unacceptable that the only access to the station is a pavement that is underlit and in places only 30 cm wide. We need a safe and well lit pedestrian access to our transport link as a matter of urgency.",
