        "additional_details": "We generally support the Prime Minister's reservations in creating a state-backed press regulator to implement Lord Justice Leveson's recommendations.\r\n\r\nSections of the press behaved abhorrently, but so have sections of the police and, seemingly, a number of politicians. The press on a whole is ethical & works in the public interest.\r\n\r\nReform is needed, but should avoid regulating how the press operate as this does indeed \"cross the Rubicon\". Options to consider:\r\n\r\n1.) Effective redress for those wronged in the press under existing laws (privacy/libel)\r\n\r\n2.) Competition amongst the press; fairness & transparency in the way public bodies deal with the press to prevent \"monopolies on information\" building around a mutual exchange of favours between press & public bodies.\r\n\r\n3.) A robust mechanism immune from collusion for investigating the press when unlawful conduct has taken place which respects the protection of journalistic sources & other necessary investigative mechanisms.",
