        "additional_details": "We demand that the BBC Trust Board reverses its decision to cut Radio Shropshire's budget by 20% and restore it to its former level. The proposed reduction of our local programmes is unacceptable to Radio Shropshire listeners. Radio Shropshire is a wonderful asset to our community. Its commitment to providing local news and national news, which affects us locally, is exemplary. It makes sure local people take part in its programmes, in which many of us have contributed. It certainly reflects the needs of our community and covers local sport very well, particularly sports not covered by national radio and local television. It gives prominence to local musicians and artists, supporting local culture. We demand that Radio Shropshire is preserved at least in its present form.\r\n",
