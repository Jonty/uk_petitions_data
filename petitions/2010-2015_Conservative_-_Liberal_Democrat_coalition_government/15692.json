        "additional_details": "Commons Health Committee chairman Stephen Dorrell advocates punishing NHS clinicians who keep silent when the interests of patients demand that they speak out. Yet the NHS notoriously scorns PIDA and victimises whistleblowers who 'fail to embrace the culture', to their professional and financial ruin. Forcing clinicians to choose between punishment or victimisation is a cruel and craven response to NHS mismanagement. Only a statute to induce some caution into NHS management's presently unimpeded, profligate and personally risk-free use of public money to crush whistleblowers, can improve patient safety, and save vast sums of money: 1] If a case is proven against a public body, and it becomes clear remedy could have been achieved prior to court or tribunal but was perversely thwarted, the irresponsible offical(s) and those who supported the misbehaviour should become personally liable for costs accrued and awarded. 2] If officials wish to appeal, they may do so, at their own expense.",
