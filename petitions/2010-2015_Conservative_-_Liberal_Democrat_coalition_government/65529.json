How can we expect them to do their jobs when they have to endure those conditions? Two opposing sides sets up an adverserial system, which does not allow reasoned debate. Not enough room to sit, in comfort, does not allow MPs to want to take part. I think we need a new space, large enough for all MPs, to be able to contribute their skills to the debate, without the crush, smells, noise and discomfort. I would like the Government to ask current MPs if they would like a modern debating chamber, with enough seats for all and if the MPs respond positively, to set up a commission to examine how that might be built and where. I think our democracy deserves a chamber where MPs are shown respect and dignity. They will then be able to conduct their work properly. Come on everyone, lets do it!",
