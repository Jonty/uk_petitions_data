        "additional_details": "English students in higher education currently leave university with up to \u00a39,400 additional debt compared to their Scottish and Welsh counterparts due to tuition fees accumulated over a 3 year period.\r\nWith the new tuition fee cap for English students having been set at \u00a39000 per year, this could rise to \u00a327000 additional debt following 3 years.\r\nDue to legislation set by the Scottish Parliament, Scottish students who attend university in Scotland recieve their higher education for free. Welsh and Scottish students studying in England and Wales will pay only \u00a33,375 for the same courses that English students may pay up to \u00a39000 for.\r\nThis prejudice and inequality has no place in modern Britain.\r\nThis petition proposes a standardisation of tuition fees for all higher education students in Britain, relieving the financial burden on English students yet maintaining any government return.",
