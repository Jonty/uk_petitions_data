        "additional_details": "I have witnessed first hand, the NHS at its worst. Nan contracted MRSA, E COLI, AND KLEBSIELLA OXYTOCA. Also grade 4 ulcers to her legs, also horrific injuries from falls and knocks at the hands of these people. The medics commenced by removing life saving drugs, water and food. They told my nan, you are dying. They said you will be dead in a couple of days. Nan said she was not in pain. They disposed of Nan's get well cards.  They were very sneaky and they placed my nan on the LCP. They did not tell us of their plans. 'KEEPING HER COMFORTABLE' = LCP.  Nan asked us to put curlers in her hair, so she looked decent on her death bed.\r\nIt is truely heart breaking, to go through what we have as a family..\r\nI see them as evil murders!\r\nTake care of your loved ones, and I hope, this message saves many lives, or at least someones precious life. Even one life is better than none. ",
