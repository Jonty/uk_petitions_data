        "additional_details": "Best Gore, for years, has been one of the most violent, blood-filled, racist websites available. At just a click of a few buttons, you can find yourself watching the decapatation of young children, the aftermath of rape, horrific injuries and various articles that include a variety of racist, hate speech.\r\n\r\nIt is important that graphic material, some of which contains highly offensive language too, is removed from Internet search engines and banned by the government for the protection of innocent people.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the ban of such a website will lead to a better, safer internet.",
