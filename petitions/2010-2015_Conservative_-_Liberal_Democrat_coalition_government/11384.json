        "additional_details": "Although it may at first seem obscure, we must adopt America's right to bear arms. If firearms are licensed and monitored, there is no reason the citizens of Britain cannot keep them for protection and as a deterrent. Also, if all guns are licensed, it would make it a lot easier to locate someone who misuses them as they will be traceable. The ignorant ones will say \"How will you stop people owning them illegally?\" but the fact is people already do own them illegally. This introduction will only help those who want them for a genuine reason; if criminals can be advantaged and have a deterrent to protect themselves, then why can't the law abiding citizens who are living in fear of the criminality that has now overtaken Britain?",
