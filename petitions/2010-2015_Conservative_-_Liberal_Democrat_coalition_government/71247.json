        "additional_details": "Government Funding Cuts for Kew Gardens are to be cut dramatically.  World leading scientific expertise will be lost and dispersed if this is allowed to happen. At a time when distruction of the environment seems common place and happening all over the world.  The work carried out at Kew Gardens is more vital than ever.  Their work is important for the continued well being and survival of all species living on earth including our own. Kew Gardens already recognised as a 'World Heritage Site' needs to be funded for the long term. Help to reverse the British Governments decision to cut funding by supporting this petition.\r\nThank you ",
