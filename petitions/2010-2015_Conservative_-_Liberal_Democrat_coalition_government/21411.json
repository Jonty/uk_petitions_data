        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition. I'm not directly affected by this situation in any way but when I watched The Gatwick Baby: Abandoned at Birth on the BBC in May 2011 I was shocked that the Metropolitan Police had destroyed files relating to their investigation into the abandoned baby at Gatwick Airport despite never tracing the parents. I believe the Government should change the law to force the police - after their investigation's been exhausted and only if they don't find the parents - to place their files with the Abandoned Children Register\r\nin the General Records Office so that they can access them in future and maybe use any information to trace their real parents. In the absence of knowing who they are this is vital information. Fortunately there aren't many each year so they wouldn't take much space or cost to store.",
