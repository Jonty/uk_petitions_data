We say slavery was over 300 yrs ago so  why are we still using terms?\r\nDID YOU KNOW Black Friday stemmed from slavery? It was the day after Thanksgiving when slave traders would sell slaves for a discount to assist plantation owners with more helpers for the upcoming winter (for cutting and stacking fire wood, winterproofing etc.), hence the name ...
