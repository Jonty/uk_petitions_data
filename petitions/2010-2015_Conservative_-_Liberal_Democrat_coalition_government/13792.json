        "additional_details": "The reason e-petitions exist is that the Government does not have a definitive mandate on the policies it wishes to pursue. Basically, it does not know what the people want. We have a coalition government because the individual main political parties do not represent a majority, or even a majority of the minority of people who vote.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to instruct Parliament to make participation in Democracy compulsory - i.e. that every registered voter must cast a vote in (at least) general elections.\r\n\r\nWe already have compulsory participation in the national Census. If we want a democratic society, in which some claim to have no voice, then a compulsory voice in who governs us negates that argument and our country will be run by majority will, which is the definition of democracy, even if that voice is \"no vote\".\r\n\r\nPlease support this petition and support your right to have your opinion recognised.",
