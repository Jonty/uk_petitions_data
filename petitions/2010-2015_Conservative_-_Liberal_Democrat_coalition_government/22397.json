        "additional_details": "The government should rethink its decision to halve the \"feed-in tariffs\" (where people are paid per kwh for renewable energy they produce/return to the Grid), which will \"force companies to cancel planned work, destroying projects and jobs.\" (CBI)\r\n\r\nAt a time when the economy should be boosted by investment in renewable energy and when there is a need for more jobs, it is absurd that the government should choose to cut such a vital boost for this sector, and is a decision that will undoubtedly be regretted.\r\n\r\nThis petition urges the government to repair its credentials on climate change and give British industry a helping hand by restoring the full feed-in tariff to its previous level.",
