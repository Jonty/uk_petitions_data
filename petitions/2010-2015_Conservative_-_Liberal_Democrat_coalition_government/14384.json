        "additional_details": "People aged 16 to 18 have an unfortunate position in the UK. They're considered adults by some factors; they have to pay full fare for buses and trains, can leave school (for now), get married and can join the army with parental consent. However, they can only pay for this with a minimum wage of \u00a33.64. They are also not allowed to go out and enjoy a beer, something that has recently become rigidly enforced.\r\n\r\nThe result are wilderness years, teenagers don't have enough support to engage in education, can't afford public transport or to buy a car (with insurance so high) with their low wages, but also don't have enough freedom to enjoy themselves, and end up necking vodka in the park rather than enjoy a pint in the local.\r\n\r\nI want the government to review support and freedoms for 16 and 17 year olds, it is paramount to increase social mobility for the future generations and also crucial now David Cameron is planning on measuring 'happiness'.",
