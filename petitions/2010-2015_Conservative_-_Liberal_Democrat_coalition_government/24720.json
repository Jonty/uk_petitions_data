Any pension that Mr Clarkson has built up should be removed.\r\n\r\nThey should also consider whether or not 'humorously' encouraging the execution of innocent people on national TV, to an audience of millions, is more or less serious than encouraging rioting on facebook, to an audience of hundreds (an 'offence' which recently resulted in a 2 year jail term). If so the case should be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service.",
