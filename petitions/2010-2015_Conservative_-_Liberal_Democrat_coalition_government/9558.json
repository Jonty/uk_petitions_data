        "additional_details": "A rationing system should be introduced to replace the current cash system.\r\nPeople who have committed serious crimes that have been sentenced at Crown Court level should lose their entitlement to all social security payments.\r\nTo ensure a \"standard\" of living they should receive the bare minimum of rations to live on. This should act as a deterrent to serious crime and empower people to improve their own lives by finding work.\r\nParents who let their children (under 16) commit serious crimes should also be moved onto the same system.\r\nIssuing rations instead of cash will insure that tax payers money is not wasted on non-essential items such as satellite television, cigarettes, alcohol and other \"luxury\" items.\r\nThis will also help fund the police to catch more criminals.\r\n",
