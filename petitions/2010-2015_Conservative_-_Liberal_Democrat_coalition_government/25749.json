        "additional_details": "The solution to stop shops remaining empty in our high streets is straightforward. The answer is forlocal authorities to double the council tax for premises which remain empty for more than a year and triple it if they remain empty for more than two years. This to encourage the owners to lease at more reasonable levels.\r\nWe are still a nation of shopkeepers (let\u2019s face it we don\u2019t produce so much nowadays) and there are masses of people out there who would love to open a business. However, the greed level of owners means the lease and rental costs being charged make it completely impossible to run a viable business, in such economic times and deters most people from even trying to start something new.\r\nStop blaming the supermarkets for everything and promote some healthy competition for them.",
