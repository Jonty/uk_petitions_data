Think ahead of the terrorists', muggers, thieves, and anti social behaviour. This is not racist but radical Islam have one aim and one aim only, That is to infiltrate Countries and enter politics and over generations make the Islamic state. GB have neglected to act on terrorism due to the cold war, but common sense should prevail.\r\nNo burkas' no hoodies,  and no motor cycle helmets. Fancy dress should not hide the face, until they reach their destination.  ",
