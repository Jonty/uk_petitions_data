        "additional_details": "If passed, the Deregulation Bill will repeal a wide range of legal safeguards and citizen's rights. Rights to consultation and enquiries will be affected, and health and safety laws will be decimated.\r\n\r\nClause 61 of the bill states that any person exercising a regulatory function must \u201chave regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth\u201d. As an example, this clause would drive Monitor to favour private providers over the NHS. Without any safeguards, this clause will force independent regulators to become the champions of big business.\r\n\r\nThe sheer scale of the bill is difficult to describe, including but not limited to employment law, company and insolvency law, the use of land, rights of way housing, transport, communications, the environment, Child Trust Funds, entertainment, journalism and criminal justice.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that we should not be losing such a wide range of safeguards without a public debate, then please sign this petition to throw out the bill. Thank you.",
