Teachers must give sensitive documents such as a birth certificate, passport, or bank statements to school secretaries for photocopying. This means any of their information could be stolen or lost.\r\nThere should be a National Teaching Database with a \u201cTeaching Identity Card.\u201d Trained professionals would set up each data base entry. Teaching police checks would be on going and made regularly by this agency. Teachers might have to travel to a centre once a year for this.  It would be a teacher\u2019s responsibility to inform this agency of a change of address or job. Refusal to do this should result in suspension.   Any school a teacher works in could access their police check, and photo  through the teacher themselves, using a set of secure security questions, or similar and their teaching  identity card number.
