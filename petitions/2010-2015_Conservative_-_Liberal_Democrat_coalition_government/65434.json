I am not talking about issues which require legal services,when their are issues of domestic concern and the safety of the child.But when after separating and for no other reason than to \"score points\" should a mother really have the right to force the loss of contact just because she is the mother.A father who is as equally capable of caring and raising his children should have the equal right to do so, but more so children who have reached an age where they are capable of saying they want contact should not have this denied by a mother. This is 2014 and children should have the right given to maintain their relationship with their father.",
