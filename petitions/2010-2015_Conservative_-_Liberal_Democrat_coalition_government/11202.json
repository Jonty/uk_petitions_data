The number of hours worked should be paid at the existing minimum wage.\r\n\r\nThe government should introduce this measure not as a means to stigmatise or to punish recipients but to help them avoid the welfare trap.\r\n\r\nSociety needs to be re-educated so that the welfare state is viewed as a necessary but temporary means in which an enlightened community offers help to those in need. At the same time it should offer recipients an opportunity to give something back to a community that is willing to support them.\r\n\r\nThis will encourage people to always seek paid employment, ensure people remain active and ready to return to the work place, allow new skills to be developed, set a good example to all family members and will wipe out fraudulent claims. In short it will end the welfare and poverty trap that has ruined the lives of so many.\r\n",
