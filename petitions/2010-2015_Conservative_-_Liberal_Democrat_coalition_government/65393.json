        "additional_details": "I would like the government to implement the new flat rate state pension on the following basis:\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, everyone with a full 35 years National Insurance record should start off on the the same full flat rate amount from 2016 and be guaranteed an annual increase in line with the triple lock guarantee.\r\n\r\nIt should not be reduced to a \" foundation amount\" to start with because you were contracted out of serps between 1978 & 1998. Furthermore any inflation rate increases on the GMP element of someones Final Salary Pension Scheme should not be stopped or reduced as this has the effect of  eroding the value of their pension that has accrued over many years. It isn't always the case that someone would be better off because they contracted out of serps and in my opinion these reductions are extremely unfair to future pensioners.\r\n\r\nI ask for your support on this petition.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank You in anticipation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
