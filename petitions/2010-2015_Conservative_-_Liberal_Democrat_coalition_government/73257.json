        "additional_details": "In 2012 I was involved in a non fault accident and I have seen quotes go up  \u00a31000 just because I have been involved in a non fault accident, there was no debate in the liability of the accident, I didn\u2019t pay my excess because the third party admitted full liability straight away.\r\nAccording to most motor insurance companies you are mathematically more likely to be involved in a fault accident claim after a non fault accident claim. Even if you wasn\u2019t even inside your vehicle these insurance firms legally steal your money for something that you could not have had any control over.\r\nThis is a lose-lose situation for thousands of innocent people.\r\nI want the government to stop motor insurance companies from increasing premiums for non fault accidents. This should also stop the need in even declaring a non fault accident on the policy.\r\nBecause companies are allowed to do this nearly all of them are.\r\n",
