This reduces quality of life, whilst out in the \"countryside\", there are miles of uninhabited land crying out for communities.\r\n\r\nLike the Milton Keynes experiment of the 80s which was a major success, build new towns between existing cities along existing infrastructure, and allow first time buyers a real chance at affordable living, without it blighting others.",
