Growth of GDP\r\n2. National Health of children\r\n3. The bankers 'Welfare System'\r\n4. Youth/Adult unemployment\r\n\r\nIf banks start to fail, then we should allow bankruptcy and Nationalise them and run them as tight ships under new regulation where all dealings in derivatives should be banned and Mortgages offered at ultra low fixed rates, which will also stimulate the Housing Market.\r\n",
