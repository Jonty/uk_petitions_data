Giving aid to these countries is insane.\r\n\r\nWe should stop international Aid to countries who have a Space Program (such as India and Nigeria), have a nuclear weapons program, harbour terrorists or terrorist groups, or have a better balance of payments situation than the UK.\r\n\r\nI beleive that this is in fact nearly all the countries we give aid to. If we are giving aid to these countries to stop them attacking us, siding against us internationally or to influence them politically then the government should call it what it is.... a bribe. Not Aid.",
