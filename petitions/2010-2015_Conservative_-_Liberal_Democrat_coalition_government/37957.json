        "additional_details": "Even if you have your telephone and/or broadband services provided by a different provider, you are still reliant on BT to manage the underlying infrastructure.\r\n\r\nIf you as an individual or a company are unfortunate enough to have to move address, all parties must wait for BT to check the existing line or install a new line at the new address.\r\n\r\nSuch circumstances may be seen to encourage self-protectionism on the part of BT, who may prefer to perform these services more quickly for BT customers than for customers of other service providers.\r\n\r\nWhere businesses are involved, this can lead to an unacceptable loss in productivity. Furthermore, BT imposes unfair stipulations on the manner in which service providers are required to communicate with BT Wholesale.\r\n\r\nThis situation is unacceptable, and I call for the system to be deregulated to allow other companies to bid for the management of the telecommunications infrastructure.",
