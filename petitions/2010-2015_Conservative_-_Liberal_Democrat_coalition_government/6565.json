        "action": "Make parking a vehicle on grass verges an offence",
        "additional_details": "Local authorities are fighting a constant battle to maintain grass verges alongside highways.\r\n\r\nVehicle drivers see grass verges as ideal off-road parking areas - particularly outside hospitals, schools, colleges and sports venues, as well as private houses.\r\n\r\nThis action results in a destruction of the green verges that local authorities have created and there is a cost to install physical barriers alongside verges to stop vehicles from gaining access to grassed areas.  These barriers may take the form of bollards, small posts and in some instances 'kick-bars'.\r\n\r\nParking on grass verges destroys the grass and in wet weather the bare earth turns into a mud bath.  Even where the local authority has planted spring bulbs in the verges to enhance the local environment, drivers will still drive through the flowering plants in order to park their vehicles.\r\n\r\nIt should be made an offence for any vehicle to park, with one or more wheels, on grass that is maintained at the public expense.",
