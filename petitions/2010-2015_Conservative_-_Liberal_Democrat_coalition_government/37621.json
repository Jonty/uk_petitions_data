        "additional_details": "Van owners who do not live within the M25 Low Emission Zone are currently faced with \u00a3100 a day charge for driving into the LEZ area when visiting as a tourist, if their van is non-compliant.  Many visitors cannot afford to purchase a compliant vehicle or filter and do not need to do so if they do not live in the LEZ area.  The \u00a3100 a day charge makes visiting London too costly in a non-compliant van - and so rather than boycott events in LOndon and other LEZ's a TOURIST CONCESSION should be introduced.  This would permit tourist van drivers with non-compliant vehicles to pre-purchase a tourist pass at a reduced cost, for a maximum of 2 weeks per annum per registration plate.\r\nScrapping road worthy vehicles is not a green option, as the production of a new vehicle has a massive carbon footprint.  Introduce the concession urgently - to encourage London tourism.  ",
