        "additional_details": "I feel that prison for convicts is becoming a life of luxury, with plasma televisions and xbox 360's to keep them entertained. Convicts have to take responsibility for their actions by doing their time fairly, and not having so many benefits that a lot of other people in the UK do not have. Money wasted on these products should be spent wisely in other areas, such as creating schemes for youths to find employment, new beds in hospitals, etc. ",
