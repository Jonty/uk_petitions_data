        "additional_details": "Hendre Fourie is a South African man who has lived in England for 8 years.  He was 6 months away from getting his British Citizenship when he had to retire from playing rugby due to a persistant shoulder injury.  This was an injury he picked up whilst playing for England.\r\n\r\nHe is in a position whereby he has fought hard for England on the rugby pitch and has been a great ambassador for our country.  Our country should be ashamed if we allow a man with so much talent to be deported when he has given us so much.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to encourage our government to act on this grossly unfair situation.\r\n\r\nFurther information can be found at: http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/20947552\r\n",
