        "additional_details": "In August 2011, across London and some major city's around the England, a large number of people have been rioting, looting, vandalising homes and businesses, an the police have been unable to cope with. With lower numbers of police officers now on our streets, and with further reductions of front line police, the government can not afford to act softly with those acting in this way. With the recent problems that have occurred the police require more help to protect the innocent to take action when required to disperse large crowns. Therefore, the introduction of Rubber Bullets and Water Cannons will help to react to these issues in the future. ",
