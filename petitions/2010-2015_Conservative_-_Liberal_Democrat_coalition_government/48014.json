        "additional_details": "A petition to create a significant and large-scale monument to conscientious objectors and pacifists throughout the UK's history.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the petition is to recognise those individuals who have not only rejected the call to war, but also those who have been imprisoned or persecuted as a result. For example, Stephen Henry Hobhouse.\r\n\r\nNo such large-scale monument currently exists in the UK, only smaller ones. A memorial of greater stature is required to honour the past and inspire future generations to also oppose killing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
