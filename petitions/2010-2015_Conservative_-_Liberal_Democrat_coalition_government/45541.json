        "additional_details": "We believe that the current system of driver training is flawed and needs to be corrected if Road Safety and standards of driving on our roads is to be improved.\r\n\r\nIn all other forms of education the tutor, or supervisor has to hold a certificate or qualification higher than the level aspired to by the learner. Just because someone holds a driving licence does not make them a good driver or able to teach good driving skills to a learner.\r\n\r\nWe believe that all supervising drivers should have passed an Advanced Driving Test recognised by the DSA such as ROSPA, IAM, DIA or ADI before they can legally supervise a learner driver. Not only would this mean that less poor driving habits be passed on to the learner but it would also encourage existing drivers to improve and provide better role models if they wish to supervise learners.\r\n\r\nWe call upon this parliament to amend the law so that  a supervising driver has to hold an advanced driving certificate before accompanying a learner.",
