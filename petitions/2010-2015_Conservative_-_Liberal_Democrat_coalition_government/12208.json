        "additional_details": "There is a constantly increasing stream of unwanted 'domestic' animals in the UK. This could be resolved to a greater extent by introducing a COMPULSORY licensing system for anyone wishing to breed any animal, whatever its size. This would need to be enforceable and stringently enforced in order to curtail the constant cruelty to animals and the massive overload on animal welfare charities, which struggle to deal fairly with genuine welfare cases in the face of unrestricted animal breeding",
