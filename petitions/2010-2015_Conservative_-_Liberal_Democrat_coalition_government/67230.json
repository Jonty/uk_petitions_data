        "additional_details": "Brent are randomly pulling up the Holy Cross and religious memorials from our graves, dehumanising them with a concrete paving slab showing only the grave number in yellow paint, then sowing grass seed over our loved ones final resting place.  You can't see where one grave ends and another starts, or identify who rests there.  We need 2000 plus signatures to ask Brent Council to reverse this decision, having already given 2,258 signatures on a petition to Harrow Council.  We want to honour our dead in accordance with our Catholic/Christian religious beliefs, a consideration Brent already extend to the Muslim Community but not to our community.  We applaud our Muslim friends for supporting our campaign, to honour our dead with the Holy Cross, a symbol of our Faith recognised throughout the world.  ",
