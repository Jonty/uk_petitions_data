We demand that Local Councils either restore the services we are paying for, or cut our council tax in half. We should not have to pay the same amount for services we are not getting.\r\nIt is NOT the taxpayers fault that the government and the central banks mismanaged public funds, so the public should not be the ones to suffer for it.\r\nWe demand you cut the wages of the top government officials, top bankers, and top lawyers in half, and bring their salaries into line with the mismanagement of the public funds.",
