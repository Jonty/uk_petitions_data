        "additional_details": "Engineering suffers from an image problem. People believe that engineers simply fix things, but we don't: we invent things.\r\nUnfortunately the false image is propagated by hundreds of companies out there who term repair-persons and equipment installers 'Engineers'.\r\nEngineering suffers from a lack of graduates, and at a time people are looking to manufacturing to fix the economy we need all the graduates we can get. Sadly they are put off by the false image of engineering.\r\nIt is thus proposed that the title 'Engineer' is protected legally, like 'Doctor' or 'Architect'. It would be restricted to those who are professional engineers or product designers, or those who have retired from the industry.",
