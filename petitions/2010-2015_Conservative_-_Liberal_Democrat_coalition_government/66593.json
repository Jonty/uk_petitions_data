Before routine screening for \"female cancers\" breast/cervical cancer there where huge numbers of females dying who could've been saved through screening. Male cancers before female screening for some reason were slightly higher and continue to kill huge numbers every year. Before testicular/prostate cancers show symptoms its already to late with 90%+ of males dying. In 2014 this is unacceptable male prevention needs to be equalized to female levels.",
