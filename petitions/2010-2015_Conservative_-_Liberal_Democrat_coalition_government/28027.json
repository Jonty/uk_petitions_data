        "additional_details": "There are certain conditions where it can be said with some degree of certainty that they will not improve and assuming the initial assessment was fair and accurate, to subject what may be severely disabled people to uncertainty and stress is cruel and unnecessary. Many conditions will and do improve over time but with many the chances of improvement are near to zero and the cost of repreated examination is unjustified. These conditions can be identified and should result in exclusion from repeated reassessment. The disabled person will and currently does jhave a absolute obligation to inform if there is a significant change in their condition. I propose in the interests of humanity and effeciency a selective programme of reassessment based on any chance of significant improvement or uncertainty regarding the prognosis, which can be determined by the accurate diagnosis of the nature and cause of the disability.
