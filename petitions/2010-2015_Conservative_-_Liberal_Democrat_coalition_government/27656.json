        "additional_details": "The recent announcement of the govt giving the green light to HS2 is a complete waste of public funds. The benefits of high speed rail in a small country is limited. The money should be invest in more future proof technology such as high speed fibre optic broadband to the home. This would give our digital-economy a massive boost even greater from the jump of dial-up to broadband. Use the money of HS2 to roll out fibre optic to every home in the UK. ",
