        "additional_details": "Joining the Armed Forces does not, & should not, in itself guarantee the award of a medal. Any medal should be earned & not expected. The Armed Forces Veterans badge is visible & suitable recognition for service. Many professional men & women perform selfless acts on a daily basis, yet they do not seek medallic recognition for their actions. Doctors, Nurses, Police Officers, Fire-fighters & many other people save lives & defend our wellbeing & Nation in different ways on a daily basis & often more directly that the Armed Forces. So why shouldn\u2019t their actions all get recognised with a medal? The answer is they don\u2019t as they do it as it is their career & they have professional pride. A select few former members of the Armed Forces believe their Service & 'allegiance to the Queen' should be treated differently, & these people have no respect for those service personnel who actually earn a medal. A medal for all would be worthless, pointless & undermine & devalue all other medals.",
