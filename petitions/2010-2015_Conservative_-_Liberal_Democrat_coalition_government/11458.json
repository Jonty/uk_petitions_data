        "additional_details": "The Coast Guard Station, based at Mumbles, Swansea, is scheduled to close in the near future in order to save money. This is despite it being the busiest coast guard station in Wales, if not the UK. All coast guard duties will be passed to Milford Haven or elsewhere, where they do not have the local knowlege of Swansea, Gower Penninsular or the North Devon Coast.\r\n   Lives of all who swim or sail in these waters will be put at risk in order to save money.\r\nI would like the government to save the coast guard station and keep it open.\r\nRemember....It may be you or your loved one who may need their expertise one day. Mumbles coast guard are local and have local knowledge.\r\nPLEASE SAVE IT.",
