This is clearly unfair.\r\n\r\nThe government should change the law so that if no explicit will exists then a standard will which covers all normal situations will take effect. Common law spouses should treated as other laws now treat them. Contribution made to mortgages should be taken into account. Ex-wives or husbands should have no claims, as a divorce should have settled any such claim.\r\n\r\nLast year the Treasury gained \u00a353m from people who died intestate - without a will. The year before it was \u00a376m. If there is no surviving relative surely this money should go to a suitable charity, such as NSPCC, Bernardos etc. This money has already been taxed and should not go to the government.\r\n",
