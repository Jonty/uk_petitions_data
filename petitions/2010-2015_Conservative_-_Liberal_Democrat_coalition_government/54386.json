        "additional_details": "I submitted this petition as I am of the opinion the practice of giving these free bus passes is unfair to the travelling public as their conduct on most buses causes distress to children and adults alike. They frequently disrupt the journey and abuse the privilege afforded to them.\r\nAs the above conditions are self inflicted and not an illness or disability I feel these bus passes should be withdrawn saving the tax payer a more than considerable amount of money.",
