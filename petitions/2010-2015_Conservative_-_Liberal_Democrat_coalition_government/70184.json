If half the animals died in London zoo next week it would be front page news.\r\n\r\nIt's time for Government and the International Community to put a real, robust plan of action forward and set the trend for change.\r\n\r\nPlanet Earth is not for Human Consumption. All creatures were created equal. It's time to stop shirking, brushing under the carpet and ignoring the intense strain we put on this planet and it's inhabitants.\r\n\r\nSign now for change. ",
