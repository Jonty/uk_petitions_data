It is also a vote of no confidence for the trade union bosses who appear to be increasingly out of touch with the real world.\r\n    The government should consider introducing legislation prohibiting strike action to take place on special occasions such as the olympics or public holidays.\r\n    Many people will disagree with the planned government reforms but there are much more constructive ways of reaching a compromise than planning strikes to deliberately and specifically cause disruption for as many people as possible.
