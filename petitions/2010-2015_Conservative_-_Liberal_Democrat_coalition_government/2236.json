        "additional_details": "Abolish paper-based vehicle licence / tax disc and the need to display on a vehicle window.\r\n\r\nThis will save costs of paper, printing and distributing the discs.\r\n\r\nWithout a physical disc, there will be no need to keep to a 6-month or annual payment period.\r\n\r\nA monthly payment period could assist household budgets and potentially improve VED compliance.\r\n\r\nAutomated renewals could continue until a car is sold or SORN declared without need for renewal letters.\r\n\r\nA question to DoT is whether the additional VED revenue gained through the use/enforcement of paper discs justifies the costs.\r\n\r\nAs the discs were first introduced in the 1920s, it seems appropriate to revisit whether they are still required.\r\n\r\nWith online checks available of VED alongside MOT and insurance, this would suggest the paper-disc is now redundant.",
