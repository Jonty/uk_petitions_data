        "additional_details": "The Department of Energy & Climate Change produced a paper in July 2010 showing that electricity and gas customers will be charged more over the coming years to cover the costs of the government's Energy & Climate Change policies. The document shows that, in real terms, electicity was 14% dearer in 2010 and will rise to 33% dearer in 2020. Gas was 4% dearer in 2010 and will rise to 18% dearer in 2020. Many customers are unaware of how much they are paying for these \"green\" policies. I ask the government to legislate for the utility companies to show on the front of each customer bill the total additional amount charged and included in their bill in respect of Energy & Climate Change policies. The figure must be individual to each customer and not an industry average. ",
