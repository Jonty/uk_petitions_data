        "additional_details": "Student loans, grants, bursaries, etc are currently considered to be income by the DWP; which renders full time students unable to claim any state benefits, even though at least half the money we receive is a loan and therefore repayable! HM customs and Revenue do not count student finance as a form of income, so why does the DWP continue to do so? Most students receive between 3 and 8k/year of study which is below the gorvernment's own definition of the poverty line and yet they still refuse to give us a break...this needs to change!!!!  ",
