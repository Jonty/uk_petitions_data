        "action": "Create an offshore prison service for habitual criminals",
        "additional_details": "There are many habitual criminals for whom prison is clearly not an affective deterrent.\r\nIt is not currently possible award longer sentences in these cases as the cost is too high & so they remain in a loop of  prison \u2013 release \u2013 conviction \u2013 prison.\r\nThis is very detrimental to society as the actions of a very small minority (less that 2%) create fear, high insurance costs, increased security requirements etc, to the remaining 98%.\r\n\r\nThis petition proposes that offshore prisons are setup in countries that are able to provide these services at a greatly reduced cost. e.g. China,Thailand,Syria,Turkey.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has three or more criminal convictions can then be sent for a much longer time, to a prison which has a much hasher regime.\r\n\r\nThis has the twin benefits of taking habitual criminals out of circulation for a much longer period & providing the criminal with a more powerful incentive to refrain from committing further crimes after release. All at less cost to the taxpayer.  ",
