The referendum will extend only to those people who live in Scotland and will exclude those Scots nationals who live in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, thereby arguably disenfranchising them from having any say in the matter.\r\nSurely, if the referendum is to be a process of consultation with the Scottish people, then it should include all Scots residing within the UK and not just those currently living in Scotland.\r\nExtend the referendum to all Scots nationals.",
