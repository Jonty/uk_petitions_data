        "additional_details": "Governmental funding should be available to all British citizen's who want to study at an EHEA University, without discrimination against prior education, such as a previous University degree or subject being studied. EHEA stands for European Higher Education Area, formed in 2010 after the UK signed the Bologna Accord, an agreement between European countries to ensure comparability in standard & quality of higher education qualifications. The UK is one of few countries in the EU that will not provide finance to citizens who are at University within the EHEA. Coupled with the recent withdrawal of Professional and Career Development Loans from the UK Banks, this makes the UK one of the hardest places to get educational funding in Europe if you are studying abroad, when compared to other EU countries. The result is that selection through ability to pay, rather than academic excellence, is occurring.",
