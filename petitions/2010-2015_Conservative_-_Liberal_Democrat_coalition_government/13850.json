This leads to insanitary conditions, and a risk to human health; furthermore there are associated environmental concerns with pollution to the local watercourses through people being forced to urinate in non designated areas.\r\n\r\nWe are launching this petition to lobby parliament to review the current legislation regarding the organisers requirements for provision of public toilets.",
