        "additional_details": "\r\nThis petition is to persuade the government to lower the age of cholesterol testing.\r\nMy husband died suddenly of undiagnosed Familial Hypercholesterolemia at the age of 39.  He had no signs of illness.\r\nFH is an inherited condition, which leads to exceptionally high cholesterol levels. FH is not caused by an unhealthy lifestyle but through a \u201cfaulty\u201d gene. This means that siblings or children of someone with FH have 50% chance of having the condition.\r\nEarly diagnosis through cholesterol testing and effective treatment reduces the risk of heart disease and can help ensure people with FH have a normal life expectancy.\r\n1 in 500 people are believed to have FH but only 15% know they have the condition.\r\nCurrently Cholesterol testing is not offered to people until the age of 40-45. For many like my husband this is too late!\r\nLowering the age of cholesterol testing WILL save lives!\r\n\r\n",
