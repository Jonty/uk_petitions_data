The Government should not end the current protection granted to stray domestic animals, such as cats and dogs, when it integrates the new EU Directive on animal experiments into UK legislation.  Existing restrictions should be maintained.  Introducing such a directive would be opening the doors to stray or abandoned pet cats and dogs ending up in UK Laboratories.",
