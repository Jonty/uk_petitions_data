All these fees are a broad daylight exploitation of everyone who uses the private housing sector, including many vulnerable people.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish government is set to clarify existing legislation making all these additional fees unlawful.  This has been welcomed by the charity Shelter Scotland.\r\n\r\nLetting agents should earn their income from landlords.  Sign the petition to prevent the future exploitation of millions.",
