In a world of increasingly violent and sexual children's television this contribution deserves to be formally recognised and promoted by the State. If Knighthoods can be awarded to those who get paid millions of pounds a year for kicking a ball then Brothers Chuckle deserve to at least be considered for an Honour in the upcoming New Year's Honour List",
