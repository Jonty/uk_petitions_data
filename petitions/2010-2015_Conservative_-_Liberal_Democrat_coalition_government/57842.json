This chance may never come again in your lifetime. Therefore every person born in Scotland in the UK should have a vote. Anyone who has lived in Scotland for only a year has a vote.  Why should they have a vote when you are denied a voice to speak for your own countries destiny. All Scottish born people should be treated equally for this very imposrtant vote. Remember the abuse your country has suffered for centuries and do your duty to your country and free it from these chains forever.",
