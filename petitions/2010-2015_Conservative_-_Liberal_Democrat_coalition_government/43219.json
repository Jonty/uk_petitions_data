        "additional_details": "Legalization of cannabis to be grown, harvested and smoked in your own home. Limits should be made to either the number of plants and/or the growing apparatus to do so.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of positives to come out of forwarding such legislation. For example, the police having more time to concentrate on hardened criminals such as murderers and rapists.\r\n\r\nThis also makes the need for street cannabis dealing redundant; I believe this would cut down cannabis on the streets considerably. Also this would mean that far more under 18/21 year olds would be able to get hold of such substances, as it would be regulated by the home owner and not a street drug dealer.\r\n\r\nPeople who want to smoke cannabis are not trying to harm anyone. It is a recreational drug that does substantially less damage to your body than alcohol. It should be a choice of the individual whether or not he/she takes such drug.\r\n",
