        "additional_details": "With over two centuries of changes in the electoral process and the representation of peoples' law since 1800, none of which has taken into consideration the right of the people who are disenchanted with politicians; as such fail to cast their votes because they do not believe in politicians on the ballot papers or the political party they represent.\r\nThis petition is to call for a process that allows the voice of the disenchanted voters who don't exercise their political civil right to be heard. This will give them the right to soil their ballot paper to indicate their rebellion against political parties and their policies.\r\nWe desire to see the government change the electoral process by way of  amending the 2000 Representation of Peoples Act to allow the rights of disenchanted voters be recognised and counted within our electoral process.",
