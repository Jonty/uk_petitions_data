        "additional_details": "Proposal by Bury Council to make cuts which will close several childrens centres in Bury. Prestwich mums group says no to the proposed closure of Toodle Hill and Butterstile childrens centre. Both of these centres sit in deprived areas. Childrens centres are a lifeline for lots of families, new mums, and under 5's. In an era of developing Family Intervention Projects for struggling families, these closures are wrong.The proposal states redirecting families to sedgley childrens centre;  not a walkable distance away. Families will be cut off from vital services, breastfeeding support, advice and support for those with children with downs syndrome, beahaviour problems and lots more, opportunities to meet other mums and dads",
