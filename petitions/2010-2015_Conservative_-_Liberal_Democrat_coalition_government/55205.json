        "additional_details": "All native UK bats are currently protected by law, yet it is currently legal to sell and keep non-native fruit bats. However, these creatures DO NOT make suitable pets, they need huge areas to fly as a bat can cover several miles in a single night and they are often left to be rescued after their owners realise they cannot provide their needs anymore. Re-homing such a creature is rarely successful and they usually need to be put down.\r\nThis trade needs to be stopped to prevent anymore cruelty to these poor creatures.",
