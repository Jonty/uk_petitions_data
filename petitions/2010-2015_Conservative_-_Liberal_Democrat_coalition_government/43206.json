        "additional_details": "Pasta Bake Day is not internationally recognised - yet Pancake Day is? Pasta Bakes promote healthy living through the combination of vegetables, egg-based products and it provides a high level of fibre - as opposed to Pancake Day which provide none of these (except for being partly egg-based). Pasta itself is low in fat and is one of the most calorie-dense products available - despite this it remains rich in Carbohydrates, Vitamin A, Folic Acid and Pottasium.\r\n\r\nPancakes generally promote unhealthy eating via the toppings that are generally applied - from Maple Syrup to Molasses whereas Pasta (and in particular Pasta Bake) is generally twinned with tomatos and cheese.\r\n\r\nPasta is loved universally and the government could also benefit economically from commercialising the event much like it has done to Christmas and Valentine's Day.",
