By allowing a \"race\" category on the census, governments are agreeing that people, whatever their current situation and culture and beliefs, can be judged and categorised according to their skin colour.\r\n\r\nIf the govt wants to know where people are coming from, then ask their ancestrial national heritage.\r\nThe numerous additions to the race and ethnicity category of black british, asian british, black caribbean, black africa,, west indies, etc...says nothing of their culture or heritage, just as much as \"white other\" does as well. It only displays that the UK government is also struggling to categorise these people properly as well.\r\n\r\nPlease think about the ridiculousness of attemting to still categorise people according to race. It doesnt work, and it doesnt exist. We are all one: human.  ",
