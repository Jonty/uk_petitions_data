        "additional_details": "We want the Government to put pressure on Anthony Nolan to raise the cut off for Saliva Samples. At present that cut off has been dropped to 16-30 however this wastes precious time and means that those willing to help who are over 30 must make a blood appointment via the National Blood Service and go and give blood at another time and then be added to the register, instead of being able to give a saliva sample at a Donor Event which could be tested within a few days and automatically added to the register. This means that many then forget to go and give blood ultimately meaning they do not make it onto the Anthony Nolan Bone Marrow Register. ",
