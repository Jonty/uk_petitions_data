        "action": "Change the law to make carbon monoxide alarms mandatory where carbon burning appliances are installed in English and Welsh homes.",
        "additional_details": "Carbon monoxide (CO) is a silent killer. You can\u2019t see, taste or smell it, and symptoms like headaches, nausea and dizziness can easily be confused with flu.\r\n\r\nEvery year over 4,000 people are admitted to hospital with CO poisoning that could lead to brain damage and strokes - with 40 fatalities recorded in England and Wales.\r\n\r\n84% of UK homes have smoke detectors but only around 15% have CO alarms. This puts countless families in danger. Whilst there is no substitute for annual servicing and maintenance of appliances, a professionally installed CO alarm could save your life.\r\n\r\nTo force a debate in the House of Commons on this issue 100,000 signatures are required. Leading industry organisations are backing this campaign with the ultimate aim of saving lives. We urge you to do the same by pledging your support today.",
