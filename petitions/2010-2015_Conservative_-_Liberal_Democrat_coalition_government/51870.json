        "additional_details": "With current estimates suggesting that somewhere between 60%-80% of property in Central London is purchased by foreign investors, this is putting so much pressure on the property market in the UK, it is time to question who exactly this is benefitting.\r\nThe net result is that home ownership is now all but a distant dream for many middle class families - in any part of London. And, additionally, rents have increased so much that it is not uncommon that rent can account for 40% of income for a single white collar worker in London on a median income.\r\nWhilst Central London property values increase massively, often these properties sit empty and, when sold, this money is taken out of this country.\r\nIt is time for the Government to think very seriously about how to put a stop to this.
