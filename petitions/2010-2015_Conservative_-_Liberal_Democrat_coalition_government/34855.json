        "additional_details": "The town of Neath, South Wales is fast becoming a town which is overrun by housing development companies demolishing iconic buildings within the town and turning them into flats. This \"development\", as it's called is demoralising the local population and bringing the town a bad name. Even the \"Great Neath Fair\" dating back to 1280 is under threat. I am urging people not only of this once great town, but of towns suffering the same fate, to raise voices and end this madness before the history of small towns dies out and is retired to the history books.",
