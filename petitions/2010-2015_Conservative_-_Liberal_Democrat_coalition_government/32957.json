        "additional_details": "There is an overwhelming sentiment in Britain that horse racing needs to be made safer in the aftermath of the 3 (7.5% of entered horses) Grand National deaths.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to conduct a review into the following areas:\r\n\r\nUse of whips- Horses are regularly abused as jockeys disregard rules on whipping and take a small ban for their offence. Punishment should be heavier to deter jockeys, and thus protect horses.\r\n\r\nNumber of jumps per race- Surely fewer jumps would give horses fewer opportunities to sustain an injury, thus protecting them. Even a 20% reduction should save horses while not affecting the wonder of the sport.\r\n\r\nSize (height and width) of jumps- Horses are more likely to fall and sustain an injury over larger jumps. You may find that a reduction in the jumps' size will result in fewer injuries but still create a grand spectacle.",
