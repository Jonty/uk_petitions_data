To pull it now would fracture the Network, undermine years of investment and leave the most vulnerable in rural areas with nowhere to go.\r\n",

That is why Defra has recently confirmed it will receive over \u00a32 million worth of funding in the coming year.\r\n\r\nOver the last four years Defra has provided over \u00a310 million in grant funding for the Network, with support to find alternative sources of income and lessen reliance on central Government funding. Reducing the deficit remains a key priority and all Departments are looking carefully at their budgets to ensure this work stays on track.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Government continues to support and invest in rural communities. Through the Rural Development Programme we will be investing \u00a33.5 billion over the next seven years, including \u00a3177 million to support rural growth and \u00a3138 million through the new LEADER programme, with which many members of the ACRE Network are actively involved.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.",
