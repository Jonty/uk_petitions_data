        "additional_details": " NHS patients have no legal right to sue for Defamation for proven false statements in their medical records.  The Access to Medical Records Act 1990 denies access to their records under S.5.1 of that Act.  If access by a High Court Order  is obtained and the records contain proven false statements there is no right of legal redress.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of such false statements (in civil and criminal legal cases) over a period of time are not subject to justice under the Law and Article 10 Para.2 of The Human Rights Act puts the rights of the medical profession before the rights of the individual patient.\r\n\r\nThe Government should repeal this Defence of Privilege and allow patients to have legal redress for proven false statements in their medical records, whenever these statements were made.",
