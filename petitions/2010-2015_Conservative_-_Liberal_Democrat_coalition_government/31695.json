All MPs should have to tender annually to ensure that a private provider could not provide both their constituents and the monarch with a better, more efficient service. Lords should have to compete on the basis of cost to retain their position in Parliament. It is simply unacceptable that the state should have a monopoly in governance, and it is time to open the field to competitive bids.",
