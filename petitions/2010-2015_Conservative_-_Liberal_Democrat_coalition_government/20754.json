        "additional_details": "Throw out the entire tax system and replacing it with a consumption tax. .Let's call it Ceetax  It is the fairest way to tax a society. The wealthy spend more and pay more taxes. It simplifies everything. Do away with income tax, corporation tax, national insurance tax, property tax, capital gains tax, dividend taxes and VAT. It taxes only new goods and services. Given a zero corporate tax environment, hundreds of businesses would start up, employ thousands of people and grow and grow. It will promote savings and the more money you save, the more you\u2019re going to eventually spend and the more tax you\u2019re going to pay. Everyone in the country would get a prescribed up front rebate that would pay all Ceetax up to a living level. The new single collection system is already partially in place, we call it VAT. Council tax would remain a localized tax. This could make the British economy grow like it did in great past times.",
