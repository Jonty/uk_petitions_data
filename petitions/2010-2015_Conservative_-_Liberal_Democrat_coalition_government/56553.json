        "additional_details": "This petition is requesting that the Government may amend the Postal Services Act 2011 so the traditional design of red postboxes is kept under private ownership. As the Queen was kept on the stamp, this petition requests that the postboxes of Britain could be protected under the Act. The design is iconic and part of British culture. It would be tragic to see this design lost. I hope that the Government will do this so that this icon will not be lost due to the privatisation of Royal Mail.",
