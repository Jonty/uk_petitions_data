For example, assuming that being an MP is a 24 hour a day job:\r\n\r\n24hrs x 365.25days x \u00a35.93 = \u00a351982.38.\r\n\r\nThis should be the only income received for being an MP. No expenses.\r\n\r\nThis would then force MPs to consider the cost of living i.e. utility bills, train fares, rent and the minimum wage itself.\r\n",
