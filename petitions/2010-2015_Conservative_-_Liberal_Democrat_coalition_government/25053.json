        "action": "Raise the export tariff to promote energy saving and pay more to homeowners, schools and charities who generate solar electricity",
        "additional_details": "The minimum export tariff has been set by the Government at just 3.1p per KW per hour. Yet energy companies charge consumers up to 15p for the same electricity.\r\nWe petition the Government to raise the export tariff to 9p. An average house would gain an additional \u00a3100 per annum.\r\nThis would offset some of the loss of FiT and provide real cash benefits for new adopters and the existing 100,000 householders, schools, churches, charities and companies that have solar power installed.\r\n",
