        "additional_details": "Most people I know are into their Wildlife, Diving and Water Sports or the Countryside in one way or another. I want to petition the Government to \"Ban the use and sale of Chinese Lanterns in the UK\".\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nBecause -\r\n\r\nWildlife, farm animals, domestic pets, aircraft and coastguard services are affected by the use of these non essential, air born, menaces.\r\n\r\nFARMING:- Chinese lanterns released into the air at outdoor events such as weddings are killing livestock, and setting fire to fields.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY SERVICES:- The UK Coastguard says it has seen a large increase in the number of rescue teams and lifeboats being called out to false alarms, because decorative Chinese lanterns are being mistaken for distress flares.\r\n\r\nThe Government needs to take action now to ban the use and sale of Chinese Lanterns.\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition by following the link below.\r\n100,000 signatures needed.\r\n\r\nForward on this link in your Social Network.\r\n\r\nMark Vinall\r\n(Natural History Cameraman)",
