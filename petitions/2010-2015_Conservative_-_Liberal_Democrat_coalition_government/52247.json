        "additional_details": "We @ notodogmeat need 100,000 signatures to impress on the UK government to speak up in the strongest terms, against the barbaric cruelty imposed on hundreds of thousands of dogs and cats, often stolen family pets, in China and other parts of SE Asia. These inherently trusting companions of man, no different from our own beloved furry friends, are ritually hung, bludgeoned, skinned and boiled alive, having been transported often thousands of miles, crushed into chicken crates. Please help by signing this e-petition. Thank you.",
