They should be deported back to live in the caliphate they are fighting to establish, irrespective of their previous UK nationality, and be stripped of all rights and protections offered to UK citizens.\r\nFurthermore; we call upon the Home Secretary to instigate emergency legislation to counter the existing law that prevents individuals being made \"stateless\" in order to facilitate the absolute and expedient expulsion of these undesirables and potential terrorists.",
