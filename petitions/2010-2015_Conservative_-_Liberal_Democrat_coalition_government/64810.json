        "additional_details": "After revelations that supermarkets and restaurants have sold Halal meat to the public without giving a free choice, I would like that all food stuffs containing Halal meat and fresh / frozen meat be clearly labeled.\r\nThat this labeling states Halal and whether the animal was stunned prior to slaughter.\r\nMost Halal meat is not stunned so that the animal feels fear and stress.\r\nEveryone should have the right to choose & not have this unknowingly forced upon them.\r\nI\u2019m not racist but can you imagine the outcry from the Muslim community if we Christians gave them meat slaughtered in a non Halal manner or if there was such a thing under a Christian ritual method.\r\nThis is just not right, greedy supermarkets strike again \u201cIt\u2019s all about profit\u201d.\r\n",
