        "additional_details": "Birkenhead Park would be an excellent venue to stage a \"world class\" music festival.  Birkenhead Park was opened on Easter Monday 5 April 1847 by Lord Morpeth and is regarded by some historians as the world's first public park, and was also one of the UK's first municipal green spaces. I feel that this venue would be ideal for the area and would bring a boost for the region and establish Birkenhead as a front-runner  for pop concerts.",
