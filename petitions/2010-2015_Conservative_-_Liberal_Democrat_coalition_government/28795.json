        "additional_details": "As tax payers we should have a say in HOW our taxes are allocated to reflect the wishes of the electorate.\r\n50% of all taxes raised go into a public pot for the Governement to use as they see fit, however the other 50% should be allocated by the Goverment according to the specific wishes of the Payee.\r\n20% - 1st choice (E.g. Education etc).\r\n10% - 2nd choice (E.g. NHS).\r\n10% - 3rd choice.\r\n10% - 4th choice.\r\n\r\nAmounts may be adjusted according to public need, but at least 50% of the taxes raised in total should be for the electorate to decide the areas in which they are re-invested or employed.\r\n\r\nPlease Sign this petition and spread it your friends over the social networks. This is apolitical, it benefits ALL tax payers and non-tax payers too regardless of their political stance. If you believe that 50% of the taxes raised in this country should be reinvested in this country and its infrastructure then PLEASE sign.\r\n\r\nMake A difference - make THE difference - make YOUR difference!",
