        "additional_details": "The current immigration system actively discriminates against British citizens who wish to sponsor visits by or settlement of visa-national family, partners or friends.\r\n\r\nWhilst net immigration almost certainly needs to be reduced, most measures to reduce it inadvertently make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for British people to sponsor visitors.  In effect, even if a British citizen is able to accommodate, feed, finance and support a visitor, they are not trusted to do so.  Meanwhile, citizens of other EU countries are granted automatic rights to sponsorship of virtually whomever they like.\r\n\r\nMotion - that British citizens, who can demonstrate they have the resources to accommodate, feed, finance and fully support a visitor (be it a family member, partner, friend or any other person) should be permitted, without interference by the Home Office, to do so.
