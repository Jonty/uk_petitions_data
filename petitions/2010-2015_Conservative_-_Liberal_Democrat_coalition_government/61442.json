The city is one full of culture, commerce, diversity, great sporting achievements and much more, this series is one which will show Liverpool to be cheap, tacky and uneducated. We are calling for everyone to put an end to this before it is too late, letting the rest of the country continue in their false stereotypes of the \"Scouser\".",
