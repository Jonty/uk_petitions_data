        "additional_details": "The Queen is the world's biggest landowner - and by a significant margin. A conservative estimate of the value of all of her land assets is over 17 Trillion pounds (source http://www.whoownstheworld.com/about-the-book/largest-landowner/).\r\nThe UK National Debt is crippling the economy and increasing exponentially with little to no hope of ever been paid off. This is having a very real effect on people lives and the prosperity of the nation. Estimates for the National Debt range between 0.9 and 4.8 Trillion Pounds depending on who is doing the counting.\r\nGiven that British taxpayers continue to fund the Queen despite these current economic circumstances, the Government must ask The Queen to protect the interests of her subjects, and sell some of her private land assets (e.g. most of Canada) to pay off this odious debt and return her country to prosperity.\r\n",
