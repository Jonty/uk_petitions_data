Being fat is NOT an illness and therefore should NOT qualify any body for the use of funds taken from taxpayers (under threat of criminalisation if we do not pay them) and used to keep them in comfort while many are dying because they can't get cancer or other debilitating disease treatments.  There is no morality amongst our electeds nor our health managers if they cannot see the appalling contradiction of spending money on overeaters while denying cancer and other diseases sufferers who can't eat at all.",
