        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that Mr Gove  is unfit to lead the education department and should be removed from this post immediately and replaced with a more suitable person who is willing to recognise and respect the teaching profession, instead of undermining and demoralising the thousands of staff that work in the education sector on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nThe motion for academies to employ unqualified staff as teachers is more evidence of Mr Gove's  unsuitable decision making and we believe it should be thrown out of parliament. All evidence suggests that if adopted it will have a  detrimental effect on the national education system and the teaching profession..",
