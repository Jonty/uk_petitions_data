        "additional_details": "Due to the increase of Equine abuse, there are many horses whos suffering is continued as many Equine charities do not have the legal power to remove such animals from the land/premises where they are neglected.\r\nThe time it takes to get police involved, then make arrangements by staying within the law, many of these poor animals have already lost their lives through suffering, or worse been killed and dumped by such owners. We ask for a change in the law to give such charities more power to seize an animal should its suffering be apparent",
