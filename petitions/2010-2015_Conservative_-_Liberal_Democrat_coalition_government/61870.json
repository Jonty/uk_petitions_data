I deem it holy unruly that our nation can be violated in such a disgraceful manner and those who have commited the crime not to be tried and have the possibility of capital punishment.\r\n\r\nI feel that if one person whever they hold British citizenship or not commit high treason then they should be sentenced to death.\r\nTherefore if you are a proud patriot and are proud of The United Kingdom then I call upon you stand up for The Queen and Country and sign this pettition so that our monarchy cannot be interfered with and minipulated.",
