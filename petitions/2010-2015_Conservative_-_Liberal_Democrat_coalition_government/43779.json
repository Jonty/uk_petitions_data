It is usually required in order to rent a car and is easily lost or forgotten.\r\n\r\nThis is eccentric in 2013. Other countries just have the card that details entitlements and store the convictions in a database.\r\n\r\nI propose the counterpart licence is phased out so we all have one less thing to forget.\r\n\r\n",
