When Judges undermine other Judges how can we trust in this broken system?\r\nThe law as it stands allows the victim no recourse other than to ask the Attorney General to look at the sentence - if one is passed and ask him to appeal an unduly lenient sentence. If you buy a pair of shoes and they are faulty you have more legal rights than you do if your loved one is brutally murdered, in 2012 this cannot be a fair and just system.\r\n",
