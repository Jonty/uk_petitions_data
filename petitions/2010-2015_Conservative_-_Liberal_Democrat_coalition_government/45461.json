        "additional_details": "Wakefield & District Housing have introduced a new policy where they will annually inspect the interiors of tenants' homes, not to check if essential work needs doing, but to inspect the cleanliness and decorating standards of the bedrooms, etc. Surely this is an invasion not just of tenants' privacy, by having strangers roam around their house at will, but also of their basic human rights? herefore this scheme should be outlawed, and inspections carried out only where tenants have a record for not being good tenants, and not those who pay full rent and Council Tax.",
