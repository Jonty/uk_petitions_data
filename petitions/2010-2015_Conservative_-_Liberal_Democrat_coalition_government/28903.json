More than 40 governments and organisations have been invited to the conference, which will discuss a number of strategies to deal with the 'problem' of Somalia, potentially including military intervention.\r\n\r\nNo \"intervention\"!\r\n\r\nFrom Afghanistan to Iraq, Kosovo to Libya, we have seen what imperialist \"intervention\" really means \u2013 bombings, proxy wars and invasions for the sake of natural resources, strategic maneuvers and profit. We won't stand by while another \"intervention\" is planned right under our noses.\r\n\r\nSign this petition if you are against planned military \"intervention\" in Somalia. Show your support and #HandsOffSomalia",
