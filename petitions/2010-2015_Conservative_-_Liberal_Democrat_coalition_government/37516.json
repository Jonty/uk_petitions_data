        "additional_details": "It is possible for employers under current statutory provisions to make deductions from your SSP leaving you with a net monthly salary of \u00a3O and that you can still, when applying for other benefits as a result, be classed as in receipt of SSP as a monetary value and thus ineligible for such benefits,\r\n\r\nEmployers are not bound to apply due diligence when calculating pay and are not statutorily obliged to notify employees or stagger any reclaiming of overpayment of salary - leading to the above scenario.\r\n\r\nThe government is called upon to statutorily limit such reclaiming of overpayment in percentage terms per pay period, set a minimum amount of SSP below which deductions cannot be made and make employers  apply due diligence in administering payrolls so that overpayments are limited to a threshold as a proportion of monthly salary, above which such overpayments are written off.",
