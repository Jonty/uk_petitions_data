Despite cherishing the victim, it\u2019s usually hell.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s it like living/working/socialising with a smoker - what does it do to others? Not much.\r\n\r\nThe perpetual attack at tobacco is curious.  Why not apply similar impositions on alcohol?\r\n\r\nAlcohol can extensively harm the victim, society, destruct families, monopolise A&E, interrupt law enforcement, etc.\r\n\r\nAn Alcoholic needs booze regularly. It can manifest itself from a happy person to a desperate individual.\r\n\r\nRaising the price won\u2019t deter - if it's wanted, people will pay for it (look at road fuel prices).  Alcoholics will steal if necessary - price is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nTobacco kills, so does alcohol and it harms many more.\r\n\r\nMake alcohol as unacceptable as tobacco - apply the same restrictions.\r\n",
