        "additional_details": "This petition calls on the Government to say no to the Okehampton - Tavistock reopening as a solution to the vulnerabilities of the Dawlish sea wall.\r\n\r\nInstead it calls on the Government to consider the options for a new mainline between Exeter and Newton Abbot  which could improve journey times to the South West, and that a slower diversionary route Okehampton is not a satisfactory solution which is motivated mainly by the desire of some campaigners to see a train service restored to Okehampton and Tavistock.",
