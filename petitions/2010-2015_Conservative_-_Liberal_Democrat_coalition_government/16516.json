        "action": "Increase The Council tax rebate for essential 2nd homes",
        "additional_details": "The government has made a sweeping change, allowing the local councils to charge 90% of the council tax on second homes. This disregards the possibility that some of these homes are not empty and are not holiday homes, some of these homes house remote workers. A single permanent resident is allowed a rebate of 25%. A single remote worker is only allowed a rebate of 10%. Since remote workers are not there permanently and therefore use a smaller proportion of council amenities they should be allowed a rebate which is at least fair and arguably greater than a single permanent resident.",
