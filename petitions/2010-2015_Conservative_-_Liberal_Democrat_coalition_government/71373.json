        "additional_details": " It depends on each individuals state of mind and motivation to live as well as physical and spiritual well being. Doctors can not predict how well a patient will respond to treatment. This is why the lovely and much respected Jane Thomlinson (told she had 12 months to live) lived for many years and acheived so much.\r\nSome people are terribly self destructive when they hear they have only days or weeks or years to live. This extends to their loved ones too.\r\nLife threatening illnesses do NOT have use by dates linked to them. Doctors are not able to predict the future of people's health to the extent that they know when someone can expect to die.\r\nWe want the government to outlaw the prediction of life expectancy. Simply tell us if we have life threatening illnesses and give guidance on how to improve health and lead healthier lives. ",
