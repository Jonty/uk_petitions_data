        "additional_details": "All businesses in the UK with a turnover in excess of \u00a373,000 are required to register for Value Added Tax (VAT). The current rate of VAT is 20%. This means that their prices are 20% higher than non-VAT-registered businesses. This puts unfair competition between Vat registered and non-Vat registered businesses and tradesmen.\r\nI would like to see all businesses register for VAT irrespective of their turnover, and for the rate of VAT to be reduced to 10%. This would inevitably mean that the government would make more money, and you and I would only be paying 10% instead of 20% VAT.",
