        "additional_details": "In recent times the NHS has adopted an ill thought out policy of closing Daycare Centres for the Dementia Sufferers.  These provided assessment, respite, therapies and many aspects of care for Dementia Sufferers and their carers.  Despite a growing need the NHS has chosen Nationally to pursue a closure policy against advice from many health professionals and service users.  In some NHS trusts contra opinion has been stifled and no viable alternative thought through.  Simply the cessation of a much needed and valued service.  This is cruel to vulnerable mainly elderly sections of the community.\r\n\r\nHow can a caring NHS justify this policy.  It will not save money but instead create personal crisis issues needing more expensive and less humane care.  They truly know not what they are doing.\r\n\r\nMy partner is one of many caring staff who is worried that by voicing dissent she may be victimised.  This is my voice expressed by me and not her.  ",
