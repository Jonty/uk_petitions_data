        "additional_details": "Football clubs have recently adopted StubHub over face-value ticket exchanges. Individuals are now selling Premier League tickets to fans for as much as \u00a31000 each.\r\n\r\nThe resale of football tickets is illegal under section 166 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.\r\n\r\nIt seems ludicrous that StubHub, an eBay company, are allowed to operate a company that seemingly contravenes UK law. Not only that, but they are making a huge cut from this practise - 15% from buyer and 12% from seller. That is a whopping 27%!\r\n\r\nIt is hard enough for fans to support their teams these days. This needs to end.\r\n\r\nPlease sign; give football back to the fans, rather than the continued exploitation of our beautiful game by corporations.\r\n\r\n@SamuelCChristo\r\n\r\n",
