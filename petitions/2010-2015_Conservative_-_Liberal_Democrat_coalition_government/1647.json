This leads to animals being killed without being stunned first.\r\n\r\nAnimal rights organisations such as the RSPCA believe this causes unnecessary suffering. A factsheet with a full explanation can be found by searching online for \"RSPCA Religious Slaughter\".\r\n\r\nWe want the government to change the law, so that all animals are slaughtered to the same high standards.",
