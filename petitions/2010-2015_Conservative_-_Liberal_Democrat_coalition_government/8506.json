        "additional_details": "With the civil unrest that has been happening in several parts of the UK, the powers that police have to deal with the situation has been shown to be in-effectual due to the policy that they are not able to take action until they are themselves attacked.  Those involved in looting and destruction of property know that they claim 'Human Rights' as a defence against the police if any force is used against them.\r\n\r\nIt is time that the government allow the police to use any powers necessary to deal with civil unrest, which should include the use of non-lethal force such as tear gas, water cannon etc...  and the courts should be given powers to confiscate property and money from those who are convicted of taking part in any form of civil unrest.",
