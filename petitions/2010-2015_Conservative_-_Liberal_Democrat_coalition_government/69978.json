        "additional_details": "The Government should enforce laws which allow girls who are visibly alone after 11:00 pm, and who's oyster cards are not topped up on London buses for free, with a receipt payable at oyster top up machines.\r\n\r\nThis year, there has been a 31.9% percent increase in the number of incidents of rape in London alone. Help to lower this figure and to protect women against Harassment, sexual assault on the streets of London at night time.\r\n\r\nThis petition is targeting the lowering of fairs of women especially, due to the higher statistical chances of women being the victim of sexual assault (69,000 female as opposed 9,000 male rape victims per year in England and Wales).\r\n\r\nThis legislation could drastically improve the well-being of many girls who find themselves unable to get home at night, so please sign and share this e-petition, and hopefully lead the government to start new initiatives to lower sexual assault and violence on the streets of London.\r\n\r\n",
