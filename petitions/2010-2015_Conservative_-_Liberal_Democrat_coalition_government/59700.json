        "additional_details": "I believe that Care Leavers should have full fundings for universities as they do not have parents that can support them. This is a real issue for people at this young age who are a care leaver and have to be on Income Support while in Full Time Education. People like me and other students are suffering and finding it extremely difficult to even live on Income Support. Next year I will be going to university to take out several maintenance loans would just cause me to be in financial difficulties and in debt without the support of my own parents. I would like the government to provide care leavers a free accommodation in whichever university they choose to go to. ",
