        "additional_details": "this petition is adressing the BTEC changes to be made on the 1st of september 2014. for those unaware these changes will include\r\n- restricted if any feeback from teachers on coursework\r\n- no resubs on merit or distinction work\r\n- one resub on pass work on a new task with 10 college days to complete\r\n- If you miss a deadline you are withdrawn from the actual course\r\nThese changes although will not pose problem to new starting student will cause an issue for us students half way through our 2 year course. the change means we will have a massive adjustment to make at the start of our second year that can potentially have a massive effect on our overall grade this will inturn affect university applications, UCAS points and employment. I feel that the Department for Education should apply these changes only to first year students, those currently under assesment rules for standing BTEC's should be allowed to contiue on current rules until their course is complete.",
