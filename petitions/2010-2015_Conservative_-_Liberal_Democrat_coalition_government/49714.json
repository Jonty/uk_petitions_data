The UK should be able to do what is in the best interests of the UK not have to do what France and Germany want.\r\n2) Each day we give 45 million pounds to europe- the money would be better spent in the UK! eg NHS, creating jobs here, education. We will never get the economy back on track if we keep giving ridiculous amounts of money to Europe.\r\n3) The EU agricultural policy means food in the UK costs each family an extra \u00a31200 a year! In times of hardship I am sure we could all do with the \u00a31200 in our pockets, not in those of European bureaucrats.\r\n4) 84% of all laws are now decided by the EU, give us our decision making power back.\r\n",
