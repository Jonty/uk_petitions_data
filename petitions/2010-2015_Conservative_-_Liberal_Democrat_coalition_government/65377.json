        "additional_details": "The child support agency are going to start charging. The fee of 20% is applicable to the paying parent and a further 4% from the primary carer. The reason I use the CSA is because without doing so their father does not provide financial support for his children.  Why should our children be charged hundreds of pounds per annum or face no support.  This is a service that we pay tax to fund. Please share to raise awareness as single parents will be picking up the tab and the children are the ones who will be paying. This is simply unacceptable.  Say no to charging those who are forced to use the CSA. Say no to child poverty #foodfromourchildrensmouths",
