It is crazy that a person just passing their test can then drive on a motor way where they have had no instruction on how to drive on a motorway is insane. If caught on the motorway when they have not completed these lessons they will be instantly fined \u00a31000 and if the select to go to court the minimum fine would be \u00a31000 plus 15% of their annual income if they lose their case.",
