        "additional_details": "This petition is intended as a request the British government to host a referendum on what the legal state of cannabis should be. This is due to recent polls suggesting that the current laws set in place over the legal state of cannabis are outdated in terms of public opinion. If this where to get noticeable, it is my hope that the powers that be in the British government will recognise that to deny the public the right to decide for themselves weather to legalize marijuana or not, is in direct violation of the democratic ideology this country upholds.
