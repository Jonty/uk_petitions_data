My family nearly lost our lives at the hands of a dangerous criminal who did not disclose  serious offences. The Home Office let him into the UK in 'good faith'.  This measure would save millions in police work, court cases, legal aid, incarceration and human suffering.  It is the applicant and their country that bears the cost of the police check so there would be no additional costs to the UK.  We must not become a haven for dangerous foreign criminals.",
