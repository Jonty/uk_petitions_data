        "additional_details": "The once proud town of Rochdale has become the butt of every newspaper hack in Britain.. In January this year The Sun named Rochdale \"The UK's worst welfare ghetto\".\r\n\r\nRochdalians have suffered over three decades of financial mismanagement and failed regeneration projects. Rochdale is not run by those elected by its good people but by a succession of idiotic CEO's employed to sit picking their noses whilst the TV crews parade around the town ripping it to pieces.\r\n\r\nJim Taylor, Rochdale Council CEO has been given a 32% pay increase this year to \u00a3170,000pa. This is a disgrace in a town hit by mass unemployment, where child abuse has become the norm and is fuelled by drug addiction and crime. On top of this the council is complicit in spin, corruption and cover-up time and again. Once he has proved his worth...THEN ASK for a pay rise. Stop this lunacy RIGHT NOW !!",
