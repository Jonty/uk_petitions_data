As such the grave for our daughter has been placed in an area where we can not construct the curb set that we want.\r\n\r\nWhilst the issue itself is distressing, the way that we are being dealt with is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to get Erewash Council and the Dept for Local Government to appreciate that bereaved parents need greater support, compassion and information to be able to make an informed choice about where their children are laid to rest.",
