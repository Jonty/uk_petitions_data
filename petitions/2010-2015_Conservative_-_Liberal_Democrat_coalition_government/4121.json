        "additional_details": "Cancer is used as a political football because it has a particular resonance. This is further multiplied by newspaper headlines which principally focus on cancer.\r\n When you die from cancer you are just as dead as when you die from any other cause. When you survive cancer you are just as alive as when you survive any other disease.\r\nCancer receives disproportionate funding and legislation, e.g., through the cancer drugs fund. This imbalances the systems which try to achieve the best health care outcomes within a constrained budget.\r\n We call on the government to acknowledge that cancer is not intrinsically different to other diseases, and to wind down current provisions for cancer care outside NICE.\r\n We call on all politicians to stop using cancer as a political football.",
