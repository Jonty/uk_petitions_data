        "additional_details": "Overview:\r\nThe wish is that Cannabis use for both medicinal and recreational use will be made legal.\r\n\r\nThe Rules:\r\n1. 3 Oz limit\r\n2. Legal age for purchase is 18\r\n3. The same rules that apply for alcohol apply for cannabis\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nThere have been no deaths directly from using cannabis. This compares to 8,748 deaths from alcohol in 2011 alone. Therefore alcohol clearly holds bigger dangers to health than cannabis. If alcohol is legal then surely cannabis should also be.\r\n\r\nAnother point is that there are medicinal uses for the herb and it can be used for pain relief. In addition, there are many people who wish to use cannabis for recreational purposes.\r\n\r\nFinally it would benefit the economy. Partly due to the fact that it cold be taxed and partly due to the fact that, were it legal, there would be no need to waste tax payers money on looking after people who use cannabis illegally as it would no longer be illegal.",
