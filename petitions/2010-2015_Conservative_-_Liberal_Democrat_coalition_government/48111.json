        "additional_details": "Iain Duncan Smith must either resign or be sacked from his position as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. This has become necessary as he is refusing to accept the result of the public's Change.org petition challenge (which has at the time of creating this petition 379,000+ signatures) to live on \u00a353 a week as he claimed that he could, for one year.\r\n\r\nFor a government Minister to ignore such a large public response to a petition, and to attempt to pass it off as \"a complete stunt\" is unacceptable. It has become apparent that he has deliberately lied to us, his employers, so he must now be penalised in one of the ways stated for this gross misconduct",
