        "additional_details": "Currently thousands of home owners are regulary being left with unsafe houses which puts the general public at risk.\r\nBring an end to the cowboy builders by bringing in licenses to the building trade. Permit only licensed, qualified builders to work within the UK. Failure to work to the standard as set by building control should automaticly remove the builders license.\r\n\r\nWe already operate business licenses to Transport by way of Operator licenses and those transport firms that do not work to the rules are prevented from operating. We now need to do the same manner of licensing with the building trade, this will reduce the cost of policing the building trade and the licensed builders can ensure only work with planning permission is completed, thus also eliminating building work without building consent",
