        "additional_details": "West Kirby and Upton are set to be merged to a new station in Greasby.\r\n\r\nThis means that the services will be less readily available to residents of West Kirby and Upton.\r\n\r\nHaving been involved in a West Kirby house fire last month, the fire brigade arrived quickly and stopped the blaze. Had this been delayed, the structural damage would have been much worse and it could easily have resulted in a fatality.\r\n\r\nPlease reconsider merging the fire stations just to cut costs - you can't put a price on a person's life!",
