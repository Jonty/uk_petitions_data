Drivers who are convicted for driving over the legal limit for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th or even the 6th time only face a possible 6 month prison sentence. This is ludicrous they should be sent to prison for at least 2 years for a repeat offence which is increased for each subsequent offence. The government needs to amend the law and the sentencing guidelines. The driver should also face a lifetime driving ban.",
