        "additional_details": "Ask.fm is a site which is responsible for many teenage suicides. Before when I once used it, I was bullied on it and someone created a fraud account pretending to be me and decided to troll my friends pretending to be me.\r\nThis site gives people, mainly teenagers, a chance to remain anonymous and ask questions or make a statement.\r\nThis is a site built for perverts!\r\nThrough other e-petitions the government has gotten the site ask.fm to change its site so that you now need an account to ask questions, however an account could be created within seconds and a question simply posted.\r\nLets get this site shut down, or at least to be blocked by UK ISP's. We cannot have this site up.\r\nIf you cannot say something face to face then you should not be allowed to ask it anonymously online.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and get this site shut down!\r\n",
