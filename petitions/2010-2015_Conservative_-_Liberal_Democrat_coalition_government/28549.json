        "additional_details": "In the light of the recent Panorama report by Vivian White on BBC1, I urge parliament to debate dismantling Network Rail and handing back infrastructure responsibilities to the train companies; including ownership of carriages. The report identified wastage through the ridiculous current system which has led to fares being 30% higher than they should be. Chiltern Railways should be the exemplar for the entire industry; fares could be cut by the saved 30% across the board.",
