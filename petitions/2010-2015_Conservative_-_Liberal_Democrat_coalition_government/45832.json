        "additional_details": "As British citizens and tax payers it effects u all. Immigrants gain entry into the UK and as a last resort when the visa they entered on is running out they marry someone in order to apply for further leave to remain in the UK as a Spouse/Partner of a British Citizen.\r\n\r\nSeemingly the relationship is genuine until Indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK is granted. It is at this point when the person reveals their true intentions and leaves the relationship.\r\n\r\nThese people go on to claim benefits, social housing, NHS treatment, education and so on. This is a very large loop hole that immigrants are using as a means to stay in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to change its policies and introduce new measures to help safeguard British Citizens that can often be manipulated into these circumstances. The government should make the spouse/partner visa route more lengthy and in the case of divorce the person should be removed from the country.",
