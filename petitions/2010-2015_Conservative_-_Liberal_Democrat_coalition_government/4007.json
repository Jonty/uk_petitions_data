        "additional_details": "I propose to introduce chain gangs for prisoners & offenders. Community service isn't working. It's a joke. Criminals should be expected to serve time which includes hard labour. Cash strapped local authorities no longer have money or resource to cut grass verges, clear ditches, pick up rubbish, remove graffiti, sweep roads etc. The taxpayer is paying twice to lock up people to do nothing and to contract out to get this work done. Hard labour and public humiliation in the community might just dissuade someone from a life of crime. ",
