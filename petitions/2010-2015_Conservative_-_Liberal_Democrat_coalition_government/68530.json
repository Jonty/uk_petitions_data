        "additional_details": "\r\nThis E-Petition demands Parliament is recalled, to discuss failure of the UK government to offer military assistance in the genocide we are witnessing playing out in Iraq, across global news channels.\r\n\r\nHow long can we sit in glass houses and ignore hundreds of people being buried alive in mass graves simply because they believe something different to men armed with guns.  Seeing pictures of people crucified in town centres.  Men, women, children killed or sold into politicianry.\r\n\r\nHow must our government holiday, and refuse to reconvene parliament, while thousands are slaughtered.  How long can we recognise our government as being effective while we watch the mounting death toll of people who\u2019s choice of religion we take for granted.\r\n\r\nWe the British people, demand the government addresses immediately the genocide in Iraq and offers our military support to the Iraq government, against those who would bury people alive in mass graves as they advance across cities\r\n",
