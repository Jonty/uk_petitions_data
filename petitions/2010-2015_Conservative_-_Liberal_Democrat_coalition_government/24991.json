        "additional_details": "I am campaigning to lower the rates of abortion as much as possible. Abortion is like killing a baby whether it is in the real life or not and that can be seen as a crime. To reduce the rates of abortion, the government should reduce the time limit for an abortion from 24 weeks to 8 weeks, where the foetus is still a clot of blood and can feel no pain.",
