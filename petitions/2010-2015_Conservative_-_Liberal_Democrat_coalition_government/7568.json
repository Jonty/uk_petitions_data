We need discipline and respect back in schools so that the children who aren't being parented properly can get the discipline and structure they need from school as this is the only place we can instil something at an early age.\r\nTrain all teachers on how to handle disruptive children effectively and also designate/train someone within each school as the 'school bouncer/social worker' per se, to deal with problem children and let the children who want to learn get on with it. Combine discipline with social work, as many children are disruptive for attention they don't get at home or other reasons. Set the boundaries for them now while they are young and some of it has got to stick!",
