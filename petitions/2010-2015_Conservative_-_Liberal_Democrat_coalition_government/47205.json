There is currently no concrete plan to show this glorious film in the UK.\r\n\r\nThere are people alive in the United Kingdom right now who have not had the pleasure of watching this defining moment in 80's film history. What greater way to introduce them to double backward high fives, whooping and shouting of 'JESTER'S DEAD!' than in glorious 3D on a face meltingly large screen.\r\n\r\nI implore you to sign this petition and show that, even in this double (triple?) dip recession the British public can still show their love of half naked men who are pretty awesome at flying massive jet aircraft and shooting down those generic communist types.\r\n\r\nWe need this.",
