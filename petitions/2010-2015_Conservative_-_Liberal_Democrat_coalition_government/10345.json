The reason given was that similar petitions already existed. You decision is perfectly fair and I thank you for moderating, However I can't help noticing how many live e-petitions there were suggesting the reintroduction of Hanging.\r\n\r\nI can only assume that by having several live petitions on this subject you are hoping the voting to be spread amongst their number and therefore avoid the need for this antiquated motion to ever arise as a debate in parliament.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case then I must applaud you.",
