        "additional_details": "Thousands of children are born prematurely every year and the number is increasing.  Research shows that summer born, premature children are particularly vulnerable at school.  Each LEA up and down the country takes a different view on whether a child can enter school based on their actual or corrected birthdate.  In some instances, these children should have been born much later which would have naturally put them in the following years school intake.  This petition asks each LEA and the government to give parents of premature children the choice of when to send them to school and take their degree of prematurity into account.",
