ITS TIME THEY TOOK SALARY CUT AND PAY FREEZE!!\r\nHere are fact the facts and figures of an MP's salary: The current basic annual salary for an MP in the United Kingdom is \u00a365,738. In addition, MPs are able claim allowances to cover the costs of running an office and employing staff, and maintaining a constituency residence and a residence in London. Additional salary is paid for appointments or additional duties - such as the chairing of select committees.\r\nDue to additional allowances it is difficult to calculate the annual basic salary of an MP, but for an MP with no additional responsibilities, who stays for a single term of 5 years, the MP's severance package will raise the taxable salary by over \u00a312,000 per annum  giving an effective annual salary of \u00a377,738.",
