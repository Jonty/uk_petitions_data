        "additional_details": "Tony Blair was elected to a Member of Parliament to look after the people of this country, not his own interests.\r\nMr Blair took it on himself to start an illegal war which has cost the lives of thousands of innocent service personnel, men women and children. This is a crime in itself.\r\nHe took that a step further by abusing his position and lying to his own people about weapons of mass destruction and then laughing at the inhumanity of it all by saying that he would do it again.\r\nPlease sign this e-petition to show ALL MPs, past and present, that they have a duty of care to their own people and to all of humankind.\r\nThe government must arrest and prosecute him!",
