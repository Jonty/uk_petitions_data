        "additional_details": "A petition to have the remains of Richard III buried at Westminster Abbey or York minster.\r\n\r\nThe remains of Richard III the last Plantagenet King of England, vilified without any proof since his death on the 22 August 1485 were in the summer of 2012 found underneath a car park in Leicester.\r\nNow although I understand the issues surrounding this as Leicester was given rights to the bones after the archaeological dig, the fact to me remains clear.\r\n\r\nAs a Son of York and a King of England surely we owe him the sanctity of a resting place fit for a king? If not Westminster the place of Monarchs then York where his family was based.\r\nAfter such scandalous mistreatment for hundreds of years we owe him this last respect and I hope you shall join me on this.\r\n\r\nThis is a matter of National importance, it is not something to be ignored. This will change history and finally give some decency to the many indecencies Richard III suffered in life and in death.",
