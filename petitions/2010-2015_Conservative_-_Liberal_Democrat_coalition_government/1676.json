The lock mechanism on a penknife is there as a safety feature to prevent a blade flicking back and cutting the user when in use.\r\n\r\nThe law needs to be changed to allow people to have a locking penknife in their pocket, with a blade of less than 4 inches (10cm).\r\n\r\nThere is law in place to deal with those who use such knives as a weapon and innocent use should not be penalised unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nA penknife is a useful tool and I use mine daily.
