        "additional_details": "In YouTube the film \u201cInnocence of Muslims\" has been launched recently against Islam .We condemn the loss of innocent lives during the protests against this film. Muslims respect all the religions and Holy Prophets. We have seen in the past that sometimes, cartoons of Holy Prophet Muhammad (May peace and blessings of Almighty Allah be upon Him) have been made which has hurt the feelings of millions of Muslims as well as other people all over the world. We strongly condemn the making of such cartoons and films and demand that appropriate laws should be made by the international community to stop this happening again in the future.\r\n\r\nWe therefore call on UK Government to Ask Google to remove and Ban this movie from those site ASAP.\r\n",

ISPs have contracts with their customers called good practice Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs), which they have recently strengthened, about what may be hosted on their servers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, complaints about a particular website\u2019s content should first be directed to the site\u2019s manager. Most AUPs already contain a general clause which allows ISPs to remove sites or content which contain offensive or objectionable material, even if it is not illegal."
