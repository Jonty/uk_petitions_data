        "additional_details": "I am creating this e-petition, because recently the figures of match day tickets and prices around football grounds have been published by BBC sport and with football tickets increasing by over 4.4% which is 3 times faster than inflation. This is making it a lot harder for families to go watch the teams they support. On the recent survey released by BBC it will cost a family of 4 over \u00a3100 just to watch a premiership match which will become very expensive if they do it on more than once. Football seems to becoming a business for owners to rip of the fans of the game! And I for one are getting frustrated by the rise in ticket prices over the last 5 years in all clubs. I would like a fairer cap on ticket prices around the football leagues and the premiership to make football a family sport again where you can take your family to a game and not to worry how much of a dent it has taken out of your wallet!   FOOTBALL IS NOTHING WITHOUT THE FANS! ",
