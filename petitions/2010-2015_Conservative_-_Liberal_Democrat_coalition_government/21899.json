        "additional_details": "Science, Medicine and math courses are  feeling diminishing attendance, the new fee system will make this even worse as rising fees put most pressure on longer courses. Maths and Science courses are about 5 years (\u00a345000 in tuition) and medicine courses are roughly 7 years in length (\u00a363000 in tuition)\r\n\r\nLowering fees for these courses would increase pull and attendance, making a higher quality and quantity of graduates which will have a drastic effect on the economy long term. Quality graduates will pull new companies, increase british industry, fuel growth and replace the need for foreign doctors and consultants.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to reduce tuition fees to original fees for the most important and long courses so that no student will be denied striving for excellence by the prospect of fees.",
