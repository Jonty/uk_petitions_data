        "additional_details": "The UK foreign office should press for a US Presidential Pardon for Edward Snowden in recognition of his services to Democracy and the freedom of individuals, values central to our culture and proud history.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the UK government should call for a Royal Commission to investigate MOD complicity in the affair. The Royal Commission should be used in place of a Public Inquiry to balance the need for us to be protected from foreign threats whilst at the same time protecting us from the threat of an abuse of UK government powers against UK Citizens.\r\n\r\nThe key findings of the Royal Commission should be made public and should only indicate if the MOD collaborated in any way. Any MOD employees or UK contractors found to be complicit in the affair should be punished through the usual UK and European legal channels and not by military tribunal, assuming such offences were conducted whilst on UK or EU soil.",
