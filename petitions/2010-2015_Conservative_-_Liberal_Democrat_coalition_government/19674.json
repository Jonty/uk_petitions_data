        "additional_details": "This petition is to put pressure on the Bank of England to abide by the decision that was made, that inflation would be kept to 2.2.  The government should hold the Bank of England accountable for following this directive.  The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee is failing to deal with the issue of inflation, which was why it was set up and is therefore, not representing the public\u2019s best interest.   This petition should pressure the Bank into dealing with inflation now not other issues.  ",
