        "action": "Stop racist political debates around Bulgarian and Romanian rights",
        "additional_details": "There is a massive media campaign around whether or not Bulgarians and Romanians should be allowed to work freely in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis campaign is based on fear and has racial proclamations. There cannot be a debate around which nations to be chosen for restrictions. All nations should have equal rights and responsibilities.\r\n\r\nIf not, then the UK should seek change in the agreement with EU for all of its member States and not only for specific country. The later is a discrimination and is illegal and more important - immoral.\r\n\r\nThis petition stands for equality of people, regardless of their nationality, as all are EU citizens.\r\n\r\nThis petition stands against double standards and rules applied to certain nations. There cannot be an excuse to deprive some people of basic freedoms, since otherwise all 27 States should do the same to the other members in EU. Therefore EU should cease its existence.  ",
