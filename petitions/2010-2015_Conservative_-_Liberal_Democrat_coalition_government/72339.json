        "additional_details": "Immigration restrictions on non-EEA elderly dependent relatives of a British Citizen require that \"the relative must need long-term personal care to perform every day tasks, such as washing and cooking and that such care should not be available in the country where they are living\" before they are allowed into the UK.  This rule is harsh both in its wording and intent.\r\n\r\nWe request that requirements to be relaxed for a British Citizen's parents/grandparents. They should be allowed to join children even though they not excessively ill or in need of continuous care to come to the UK and live together as a family.\r\n\r\nGovernment can take necessary steps to prevent misuse by ensuring that the citizens who intent to get non-EU parents/grandparents to UK have contributed to economic success through payment of taxes.\r\n\r\nAfterall, why should children of hardworking, taxpaying british citizens be deprived of learing from wisdom and experience of their grandparents?",
