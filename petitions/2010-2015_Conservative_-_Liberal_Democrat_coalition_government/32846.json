        "additional_details": "The Government proposes to make amendments to 'no win - no fee' agreements so that Solicitors take a 25% cut of claimants' compensation. Whilst we should support the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill to prevent fraudulent and exaggerated RTA & PI claims, the Bill ignores the plea's of innocent victims of occupational diseases such as bladder cancer, mesothelioma, asbestosis, occupational asthma, vibration white finger, dermatitis and noise induced hearing loss.\r\n\r\nThe Lords recently voted to amend the LASPO Bill so that industrial disease claims are exempt from the reforms. This is next due to be debated in the Commons on 17th April - please sign this petition to show your support of the Lords' amendments and to prevent a gross injustice to the sufferers and the families of such horrendous and life changing diseases.\r\n",
