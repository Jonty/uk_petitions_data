        "additional_details": "Spray rioters with a highly absorbent bright coloured indelible dye, this would mean that the police would not have to arrest rioters immediately if resources did not allow. They could be rounded up later, or of course they could be left free to go about there lives covered in bright dye.\r\n\r\nI believe this could be a cheap alternative to court and prison and also a strong deterrent; who wants to walk around in public covered in dye.\r\n\r\nThe dye works very well for security companies who place it in money containers when it is in transit and explodes covering anyone tampering with it.\r\n\r\nWhat deterrent is court when they get released with a suspended sentence?\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t want to get sprayed stay home and don\u2019t riot!!!!!\r\n",
