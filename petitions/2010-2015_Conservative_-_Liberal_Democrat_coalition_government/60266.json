However any of these tradesman or the public can carry out any repairs/modifications to brakes, steering suspension etc. to their vehicles e.g. supercars, superbikes and travel on the public highways at speed. What is to say that this work has been carried out safe? If people want to repair/ modify their vehicles it must be inspected /signed off at approved garages. There must be more legislation/ action on people opening garages/workshops that have no formal qualifications to carry out this kind of work.",
