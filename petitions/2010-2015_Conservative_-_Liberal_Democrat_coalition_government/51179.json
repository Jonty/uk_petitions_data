        "additional_details": "\r\nIt is difficult to protect children from being abused, raped and murdered (and to identify likely suspects) unless the information on people searching for child porn through the search engines is captured and the person searching can be identified.\r\nWe must stop the needless suffering and murder of innocent children like April Jones. Both the UK ISP's and the search engine providers must be compelled to take action on this.\r\nEven if they will lose revenue, the protection of UK's babies and children must take priority over profit.\r\nIf you want to do something about the abuse and murder of innocent children in the UK, please sign this petition. And by signing it, make a commitment to only vote in the next general election for the government that has introduced these measures to protect our children.\r\nPolitical parties may not always act on the things that are important to us but, they do need our votes at election time.",
