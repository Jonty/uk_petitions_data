See Telegraph online 13 Aug 2011.\r\n\r\nIt is the police when 12 or more persons must be present together and use and threaten unlawful violence for a common purpose - the Public Order Act of 1986.\r\n\r\nThis provision presses  the police to protect the public when the need arises. On the other hand, that highlights the need for the police to be funded properly and the present round of cutbacks may be undermining this. For, as the Telegraph says, \"That's not to say that Britain's police authorities are going to make it easy.\"\r\n\r\nI would like to see a similar legal duty of care for other kinds of problem where the police are required to intervene but all too often fail to do so.\r\n\r\nIf that had been in place, that recent case where a mother took her own life and that of her disabled daughter because the police failed to protect them from over thirty cases of threatening behaviour from members of the public might not have occurred.\r\n",
