        "additional_details": "Negative media coverage can hinder a person's reputation and with online searches bringing details of something that may have happened years ago, this can prevent a person living a normal life.\r\n\r\nI suggest that people with a negative online presence be given the chance to move on from past mistakes. I feel after 3 to 5 years these people should be able to request online media articles be removed allowing them to move on with their lives.\r\n\r\nNewspaper articles that report crimes, negative media, or anything else that may prevent people moving on should stop these results appearing in search results of Internet Search Engines.",
