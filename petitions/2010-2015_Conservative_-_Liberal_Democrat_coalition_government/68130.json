        "additional_details": "My child keeps climbing out of an Aldi Supermarket Trolley, due to the fact they have no child strap/safety harness attached to the trolley, unlike most other retailers. It is dangerous if the parent is distracted whilst trying to shop for products while trying  keep an eye on the child. I am asking for all retailers to be forced to attach child safety straps/harness so as to make the child secure and safe for parents to shop.",
