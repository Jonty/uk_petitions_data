        "additional_details": "In August 2012, my four-year-old son was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer. Since then, we were determined to learn as much as we could about childhood cancer and were shocked at what we discovered. Visit ChildhoodCancerPetition.org for more information.\r\n\r\nI urge the Prime Minister and Government to take leadership roles by making childhood cancer research a national priority in the budget. In addition, I ask the Prime Minister to require the Secretary of State for Health to develop and implement a national plan for the advancement of childhood cancer research across all appropriate functions of the Department. I also want priority given to those cancer types which have poor survival rates and least amount of progress made over the last 20 years. I also want the government to work with charities to run public awareness campaigns for all cancer types starting by the inclusion into the National Awareness & Early Diagnosis Initiative (NAEDI) Public Symptoms Awareness Campaign.",
