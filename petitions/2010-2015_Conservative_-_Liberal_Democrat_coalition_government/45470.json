        "action": "Introduce new vehicle categories of performance car and super car",
        "additional_details": "At present, once a person has obtained a full driving license, the restriction on the class of vehicle that they can drive without an instructor present is set by weight, number of seats and the presence of a trailer. There is nothing to stop a person driving a high or super performance vehicle on the UK road network, even though these vehicles require an enhanced set of driving skills. I therefore petition the government to introduce two new vehicle classes, those of performance car and super car, designated as vehicles able to accelerate from 0-60 in under 8 seconds and under 4 seconds respectively.\r\nFurther, I petition the government to make the performance and super car endorsements re-testable after 5 years and 2 years respectively.",
