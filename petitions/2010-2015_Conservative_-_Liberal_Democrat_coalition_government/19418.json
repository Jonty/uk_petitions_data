        "additional_details": "The Ethiopian government has been carrying out systematic genocide against the people in Ogaden that has resulted in murders, rape, imprisonment and livelihoods being destroyed. Consequently, the Ogaden is underdeveloped lacking very basic provisions such as clean running water, sewage and education. Many are starving and countless have already been killed. The government should take the following action. Thoroughly debate the genocide and political oppression that is being carried out by the Ethiopian government, with the use of British aid. Immediately cease all aid being given to Ethiopia. Put direct pressure on the Ethiopian government to halt this genocide. Push for international inspectors to visit the Ogaden. Based on the findings of the international inspectors report, propose U.N sanctions against Ethiopia. Establish direct diplomatic relations with opposition political members in the Ogaden in order to help assess the genocide.",
