        "additional_details": "Well here it is, the Governments next bid to raise costs for motorists. Privatising roads is not just a an added cost to drivers, its an invoncenience. What I don't think the government realise it that once they introduce road charges to some of the most heavily congested roads, drivers will be unwilling to pay, therefore, shifting to an alternative route that does not incur charges which, in the long run, will then just make other roads heavily congested. A plan that will not work. While the government are cutting their spending, the general publics spending is only increasing further. This is not fair.",
