However, this petition is in response to deteriorating law and order situation in India a lot of which has worsened under the last ten years due to on-going corruption and ignorance by successive governments and specially the current Indian Government.\r\nThe situation is not as bad as in Burma or other dictatorships but there is little regard for human rights and well being of general population.\r\nAs a nation which values Human Rights, and well being of Global society, UK Government must reduce diplomatic ties with current Indian Government, and thereby express their concern on the inabilities of Indian government. While India as a country is a great partner and an ally but the current Indian Government is not worthy of British friendship. ",
