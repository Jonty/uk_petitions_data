        "additional_details": "The so-called \"British\" Airways has, over the last decade or so, reduced its services from all airports throughout Great Britain such that it now only operates \"feeder\" services into Heathrow (plus a few into Gatwick).  It is NOT a national airline any more, merely a London-based carrier that complains when any other (more commercially astute) airline dares to point out that it has a monopoly of Heathrow take-off and landing slots. The airline is arrogant, uncaring and should noy be allowed to use its (self-appended) strapline of \"To Fly. To Serve\" nor claim to be the national carrier by using the name \"British\" Airways.  \"London Airways\" would be far more appropriate.",
