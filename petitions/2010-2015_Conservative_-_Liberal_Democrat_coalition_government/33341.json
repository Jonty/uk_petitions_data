Just one little lead on a dog is the difference between a child or adult being attact or not.\r\nIt's becoming a regular occurance and needs to be prevented just by telling owners to put their dogs on leads where there are alot of children running around in public, it's common sence,but some people think their dogs wouldn't hurt a fly untill its too late and there's no justice so lets try and prevent it so it never goes that far! It needs to be enforced at every public play area!",
