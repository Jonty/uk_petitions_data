        "additional_details": "Those who say people should be given the death penalty are wrong. that is just an easy way to get rid of them but not to PUNISH. If you commit:\r\n-Rape -Child abuse -Murder You should be put in prison for life, and i mean a true life sentence as in they spend the rest of their life in prison. They will never get out and will never have freedom. Put in a room with a toilet and a bed (by this i mean a bed sheet on their cold concrete floor) no book's, TV or visitor's or socialising with other prisoner\u2019s, just let them die alone in a cell after years of misery. That is punishment, not the death penalty which will have to be done painlessly according to human right's law so no punishment there. This will help there victim\u2019s know they will not be attacked by their assailant again but at the same time knowing that they are in misery like they were. Plus if they are later found to be not guilty then they can be released but this cannot be done with capital punishment.",
