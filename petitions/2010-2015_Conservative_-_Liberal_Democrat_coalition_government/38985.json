Ken Bates has taken millions of pounds of player sales and transfered them to loss making organisations and costly infastructure with years to make back any sort of return against the wishes of the fans.\r\nLatest reports show that a return to administration is on the cards which will cause a further loss to both the taxpayer and local businesses.\r\n\r\nI call on the government to fully investigate Ken Bates and other football owners and to introduce better regulations regarding football owners to prevent more administrations and liquidations like we have seen at Portsmouth and Rangers in recent months at the expense of the average fan.
