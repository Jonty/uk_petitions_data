        "action": "Reduce NHS bureaucracy by turning the clock back to pre-trust times.",
        "additional_details": "Since the advent of NHS Trusts, bureaucracy has escalated. Pre-trust we had District and Regional Health Authorities that understood the needs of their Hospitals and the local population. Management within each Hospital was small.\r\n\r\nWith the formation of NHS Trusts each Hospital has been run like a business with a large management structure duplicated at each Trust. Further, this has led to a fragmented NHS whereby the type of care received is dependant on the postcode of the patient.\r\n\r\nI call on this Government to:\r\n\r\n1) Undertake a study of the true cost of Bureaucracy today compared to pre-trust times, and to publicly publish the results.\r\n\r\n2) If the results show that the old system was less costly in Bureaucratic terms, to form a focus group made up of Politicians and Health professionals to re-design the NHS based on the old system with the aim of reducing bureaucracy and providing a truly integrated NHS.",
