        "additional_details": "The government should recognise every single NHI contribution made by women under the married stamp scheme. To deprive women of a state pensions even though they have made  contributions via their employers is not only immoral but scandalous, and is a cop out by the government. Every single contribution paid regardless of when and how, should count as a full stamp thus giving many hundreds of thousands of hard working women a decent pension for which they have contributed.\r\n\r\nIf necessary the government should allow women in this predicament to upgrade these contributions by backdating over the complete period of employment. It is a disgrace this scandal has been deliberately ignored and urgently needs parliament attention. Remember it could be your mother or sister who despite working is not entitled to a full state pension. ",
