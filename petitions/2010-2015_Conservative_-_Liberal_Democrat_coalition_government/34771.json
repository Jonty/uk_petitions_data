        "additional_details": "That this government reconsiders it's position regarding the appointment of the next Chief Inspector of Constabulary.  This post has always previously been filled by Senior Officers with past experience as a Chief officer or Deputy Chief officer in a UK constabulary. The appointment of a Chief Inspector of Constabulary from outside the service, would be ill advised & may lead to a lowering of standards within the Police Service.   I call upon the government to invite candidates with the appropriate Police Service experience to apply. ",
