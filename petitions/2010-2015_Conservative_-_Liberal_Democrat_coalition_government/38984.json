        "additional_details": "The TV Licence should be abolished as it gives the BBC an unfair advantage over other broadcasters. In the UK we don't have state television broadcasting government censored news so why do we need a TV company which generates its revenue by collecting a tax?\r\n\r\nAs the BBC is sure of its revenue it makes too many daft decisions such as the abolishment of the Chris Moyles Show. Due it's popularity its demise made no business sense, but the BBC doesn't have to worry in plummeting viewing figures as it has no advertising revenue.\r\n\r\nAbolishing TV Licence would allow free choice and put pressure on the BBC to make good business decisions.
