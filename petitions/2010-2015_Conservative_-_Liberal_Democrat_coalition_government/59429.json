Children and animals cant defend themselves, The abusers that beat, kill, torture these defenseless beings are HEARTLESS, EVIL.\r\n\r\nChildren LIFE should be LIFE whether the criminal is dying or being good cause he will just reoffend. They should be put in normal prison where they belong. Actually let them face their crimes. Children go through hell.\r\n\r\nFor animals, a larger fine for death maybe \u00a3100,000 not \u00a310 espescially if they are tortures and killed. for when charities take the animal away (what ever they spend on getting the animal well and for the whole time that animal is in rescue home, the owner should be made to pay for everything) all this should come with a decent jail time 6 months is NOT enough.\r\n\r\nWhat if you were this child or animal, what would you want? Longer Stricter Punishment. Animals/children are the same as us (adults) the ones who are meant to protect them.",
