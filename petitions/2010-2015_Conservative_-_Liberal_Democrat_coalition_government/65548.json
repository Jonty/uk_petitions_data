No more icy roads, no need to grit.\r\nA clean, potentially nationwide, power grid road system that could initially be established in school and hospital car parks, or in private garden patios.\r\n\r\nI ask that the government consider the work-ability and usefulness of bringing solar road systems to our infrastructure, as part of the wider policy on green energy.\r\n\r\n",
