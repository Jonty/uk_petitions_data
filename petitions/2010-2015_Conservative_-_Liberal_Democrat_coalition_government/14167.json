        "additional_details": "Train companies like First Capital Connect are making millions using prosecution threats and criminal record to get paying passengers to pay up to avoid criminal records. Recent months have seen an increase of FCC sending out notice of intention to prosecute to fare paying passengers who inadvertently had 'invalid tickets' or had good reason why they were not able to buy a ticket and have every intention to pay for a ticket. These FCC Revenue Protection Inspectors are threating paying passengers with threat of prosecution and not targeting the real fare evaders. We need our government to protect fare paying passengers from FCC RPI bullies and stop them from ripping off honest working people.Join me to get FCC franchise revoke, fined for illegal activities and refund all monies plus interest to affected passengers and charge these bullies with a criminal record.",
