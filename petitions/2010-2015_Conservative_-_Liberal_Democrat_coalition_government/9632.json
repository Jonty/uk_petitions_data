        "additional_details": "Many people would prefer to use efficient public transport, rather than be forced to fill up the family car.\r\n\r\nIt would be better for businesses to transport freight by SEA or on RAIL. This would reduce the number of lorries on the road.\r\n\r\nThe UK should be preparing for electric cars that will drive innovation, create jobs, and enable the UK to lead the world.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this petition calls on the Government to:\r\n1) KEEP the planned 4p fuel duty increases, scheduled for Jan / Aug 2012.\r\n2) Invest in widespread infrastructure to enable rail and sea transportation of goods, plus widespread and long-distance use of cheaper to run electric cars.\r\n3) Pressure big oil companies to invest more in renewable energy (to power the electric cars and trains).\r\n4) Use existing fuel tax revenues to radically improve public transport in both rural and urban areas.",
