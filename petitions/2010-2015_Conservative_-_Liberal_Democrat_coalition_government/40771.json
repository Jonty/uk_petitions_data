        "additional_details": "The East Midlands Ambulance Service is planning to close the New Mills and Buxton Ambulance Stations and create a new ambulance 'Hub' on the other side of Chesterfield which would mean that the ambulance staff, who work in the New Mills area, would have to travel to Chesterfield, in their own time and vehicles, to collect their ambulance and then drive back to the New Mills area to start work BUT if there is a 999 call on the way back they could be diverted anywhere to deal with it and they might never actually get back to the New Mills, Hayworth and Rowarth areas.\r\nWe, the undersigned, call upon the Government to direct the East Midlands  Ambulance Service to retain the New Mills and Buxton ambulance stations and create a new 'hub' in the High Peak.",
