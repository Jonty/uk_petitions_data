        "additional_details": "Train companies charge significant fares for standard class journeys, but often fail to provide adequate standard class seating.\r\nThis petition is to request that the Government make it illegal for train operators to fine, prosecute or charge excess fares for travellers holding standard class tickets who choose to sit in empty first class seats when no standard class seats are available.\r\nIf standard class seats are available, or if a first class ticket-holder is unable to sit, then train companies should continue have the right to ask standard class passengers to vacate a first class seat - and to take measures to fine, charge or prosecute those who refuse.\r\nThis petition is designed to encourage train operators to provide adequate seating for all passengers.",
