        "additional_details": "Pharmaceutical firms apply for licences for drug use. But as drugs age and patents expire, drugs are often found to have new uses. Pharma may refuse to apply for licences for these new uses, and benefits thus lost.\r\n\r\nTamoxifen is one such drug. It is currently used to treat breast cancer. It is now out of patent and has a potential use protecting women at high risk from developing this killer disease.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Health needs to take over the licencing of out-of-patent drugs so that they can be used without hindrance for novel use and public benefit.",
