Sometimes this is through negligent behaviours and ignorance of the animal\u2019s needs.  A registration and licensing programme will help discouraged people from buying and keeping pets if there is a legislate aspect to owning exotic animals.\r\nA licence will help encourage education of prospective owners as a small easy test to into aspects of responsibility to animals could be included in the application.  Any steps the discourage the view that exotic pets are an easier option to a cat or dog should be promoted is it is often the case there is more expense and personal input needed to care for these animals as well as some inherent dangers with some that need specialist knowledge and care\r\n",
