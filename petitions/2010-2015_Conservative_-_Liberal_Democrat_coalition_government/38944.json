Bankers, on the other hand, are representable as the greedy and loathsome Toad of Toad Hall (see also Wind in the Willows, 1908) and are worthy of a cull to protect the Great British nation from further economic and social catastrophe. Please do not spoil this worthwhile life fable. Save the badgers! ",
