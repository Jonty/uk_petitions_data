        "additional_details": "Tracey Connelly was jailed indefinately with a minimum of 5 years in 2009 for allowing her baby son to be tortured to death by her boyfriend.\r\n\r\nBaby 'P' was let down by so many people - those who came in contact with him but missed all the signs - and by those who should've cared for him, loved him, nurtured him and protected him - his 'mother' and her boyfriend.\r\n\r\nDon't let him down further by releasing the person who let him down the most! This 'woman' should serve her indefinite sentence and NEVER be released! The decision to release her is a disgrace to the British Justice System! Someone responsible for ensuring our justice system works needs to stop in and stop this! ",
