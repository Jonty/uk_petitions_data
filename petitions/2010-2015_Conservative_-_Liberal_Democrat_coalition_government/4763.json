        "additional_details": "With all the current coverage of binge drinking and with many local pubs closing or on the verge of closing. My suggestion is to lower the alcohol tax paid by licenced bars, pubs and clubs to keep prices as low as possible. Raise the alcohol tax for supermarkets, off licences etc. This will allow the police and local authority to supervise any establishments selling alcohol irresponsibly, many under 18 year olds are able to buy alcohol from small shops etc. Alcohol consumption will be able to be monitored by licenced staff, if there is a problem it can be dealt with accordingly. Also, it will allow many pubs to remain trading, helping small businesses and keeping a local pub in small communities.",
