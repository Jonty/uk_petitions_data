Its not uncommon for myself (also a newly passed, 22 year old) to get quotes in the region \u00a38000!\r\nI'm finding it difficult to find work in my hometown, so I have no choice but to look further afield. But I physically can't get to work bcause I can't afford to insure my car. I'm sure there's many in my situation.\r\n\r\nThe government talk big on getting people back into work and off benefits. Well, stop letting the insurance companies exploit the unemployed and help people like me get back into work by capping insurance. Stop these companies from charging astronomical ammounts for this demographic. Stop allowing them to discriminate based on unemployed status. ",
