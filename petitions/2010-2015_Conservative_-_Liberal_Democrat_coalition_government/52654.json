Not to mention children who genuinely do not like some the food which is served by schools.\r\n\r\nA stop needs to be put to the government thinking they know what\u2019s best for our children and let the parents and carers decide.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you think packed lunches have just as much place in schools as school dinners.\r\n\r\nLets not let the government take away more of our choices as parents and carers\r\n\r\n",
