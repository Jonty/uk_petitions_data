There are currently 60 Million people within great Britain - if every member of our great nation paid \u00a32 each a year not a month or day but per year such an insignificant amount could make such a big difference not to the government as a whole but to all of our 'middle' or 'lower' class lives! If we can afford it twice a year? I know nobody likes the idea of a 'TAX' but let\u2019s face it, this country needs saving and were the ones who need it saving. We can't keep blaming the past we need to resource for our future. ",
