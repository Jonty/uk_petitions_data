Seven years later he is still in jail as the judge added the ipp which has no date of release and no light at the end of the tunnel. It is a babaric and inhumane sentence. The ipp is now abolished but not for those serving it. We the public demand that this young man and all ipps on or post tariff be released imediately and for the life licence to be abolished and replaced with a more reasonable licence more suited to the tariff given by the sentencing judge.",
