        "action": "Abolish bus fares for post-16 education",
        "additional_details": "It is now Government policy that all young people are expected to stay in some form of learning or training until they are 17. This will increase to 18 from summer 2015. There is however no entitlement to free home-to-school transport from the age of 16, and the Government has not provided any further funding to support transport for those who reach this age. When a child is in post-16 education, the cost of bus fares should be significantly reduced or scrapped altogether, particularly if they are going to the relevant catchment sixth form or college. I strongly believe that having access to the facility in which you are being educated should be government funded as it is now compulsory.\r\n\r\nToby Jeffery MYP/Dani Bonnelykke DMYP, Bury St Edmunds",
