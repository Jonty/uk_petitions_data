        "additional_details": "PIP is a disabled living benefit intended to make life for those living through the hardships of disability that touch easier. This was, of course, designed to replace the \"Old\" and \"Not working\" system of DLA (actual quote from Jessica Lee MP in a letter to me). Most would argue that change was needed from the old system, with too many people claiming fraudulently. This change, however, should have came in the form of one on one interviews and though medical check ups on claimants. Instead we end up with a system that cuts the amount of claimants by 66% and says that because you live independently you can live without support. People who have been targeted include Schizophrenic people,recent surgery patients, epileptics and even autistic people. I propose that change be made in the form of the PIP system being reverted to a more though DLA system, with more of a focus being on who can cop, not who can live.",
