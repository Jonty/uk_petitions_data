        "additional_details": "We believe the recent & disaterous decision taken by councillors in Belfast City Council to restrict the flying of the union flag to 15-17 designated days to be the wrong and most careless decision and believe the result of which will cause deeper and bigger divides between the two main communities in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Unionist community feel let down, betrayed and ignored and that our culture and identity is under attack.\r\n\r\nWe ask that the flag of our nation is reinstated to fly 365 days a year. The removal of which is doing more harm than good. Bring us in line with the rest of the UK. Don't impose negative 'special' treatment. Don't deny us our right.",
