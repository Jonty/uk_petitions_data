        "additional_details": "We, the people, want a law to prevent unwanted litters of domestic pets. A law that calls for all pet owners to have their pets neutered, unless they are a licenced breeder who is also conscious of the lack of homes & money for domestic pets in the current economic climate..so wont over breed. Many do not think of the consequences of these pets as 1000's are posted as free to anyone & end up in dire situations or worse as dog bait/target practice or just to satisfy psychopathic acts of torture.\r\nWE NEED LAWS TO STOP THIS NOW! MAKE NEUTERING A PET MANDATORY PLEASE! RESCUES ARE OVERFULL AND ANIMALS ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE OF HUMAN IGNORANCE AND A LACK OF LAWS TO PROTECT ANIMALS.",
