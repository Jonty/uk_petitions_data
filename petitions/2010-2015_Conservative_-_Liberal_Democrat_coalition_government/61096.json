        "additional_details": "1. We propose that farm subsidies that lead to land use in a way to increase risk of flooding be stopped, even if a change of legislation is required.\r\n\r\n2. soil protection rules should be mandatory and enforced for both farmers and builders - no farming practices or building which may impact on flooding should be allowed to occur.\r\n\r\nA direct quote from George Monbiot in the Guardian on January 18th: \"We pay \u00a33.6bn a year for the privilege of having our wildlife exterminated, our hills grazed bare, our rivers polluted and our sitting rooms flooded.\"\r\n\r\nWhy should we the general public pay for these 'privileges' as well the clean up and emergency aid, when we receive no benefit from this - unlike farmers, builders and the government.\r\n\r\n3. We do not believe in dredging rivers - this has NO benefit; even Owen Patterson admits this.\r\n\r\n",
