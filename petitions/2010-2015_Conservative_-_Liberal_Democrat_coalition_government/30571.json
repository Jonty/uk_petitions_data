        "additional_details": "We want the government to debate, in full, the need for a bypass for the villages of Llanymynech and Pant. We want them to debate the effect the road has on the quality of life for residents along the road and the effect increased traffic from the wind farms will have on the villages. We want the government to build a bypass for the two villages so that we may live safely along its route, that we may be able to walk our children to school, and so we can walk to the shops. We want them to overturn the decision to stop the plans for the bypass, when we had been promised one and were next in line for one. We call on the government to help us and build a bypass for the villages. The money is not a huge amount, considering the positive effect it will have on the villagers. This is the MAIN road into Mid-Wales, is the Manchester/Swansea main trunk road, and it is not fit for purpose.",
