CM 8671 refers to making 130 aspects of our policing and criminal justice system \u201csubject to the full jurisdiction of CJEU and the enforcement powers of the European Commission on 1-12-2014.\u201d CM 8671 also states, \u201cArticle 10 of Protocol 36 enables the government to decide at the latest by 31-5-2014 whether or not the UK should continue to be bound by the approximately 130 police and criminal justice measures that were adopted before the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force or whether it should exercise its right to opt out of them all.\u201d The post of European Public Prosecutor is being established; he will have right to use the European Arrest Warrant to order the arrest of any of us. Our right of appeal under habeas corpus? Gone. Do you think we want to be ruled by unelected overpaid jobsworths in EU? Same new EU laws will apply to you as well. ",
