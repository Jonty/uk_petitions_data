Its enough for a new squadron by itself. If the government did not want the Nimrod it should come clean instead of lie. Since it got rid of them the UK has been having to rely on the USA to defends its home waters. Most recently when an incursion by Russian subs could not stopped because we did have the capability the Nimrod would of given the UK.",
