        "additional_details": "I believe that the current system for punishing teenagers that break the law in the UK is not working. With more and more young people (men particularly) having no work ethic and feeling no respect for their fellow citizens or authority, our society is being continually undermined. With many of these youngsters coming from a broken family background with no strong positive role models (often male role models), the levels of discipline, respect and self-respect have fallen to shockingly low levels. I believe that a military-based penal scheme (national service style if you like) is a great tool that could be used by the courts to (a) punish these people and get them off the street to protect the law abiding, for say 1 or 2 years when they have broken the law, and (b) teach them some life skills like self-discipline, self-respect and respect for others as well as technical skills that may help them with future careers.",
