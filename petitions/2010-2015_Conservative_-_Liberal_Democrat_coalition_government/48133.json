Poor people are being forced into paying 'bedroom tax', having benefits either reduced or removed completely and are being forced into using food-banks to survive.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned petition the government to recover this \u00a36m and use it to assist the poorer element that are at present being forced out of their homes and onto the street through no fault of their own.",
