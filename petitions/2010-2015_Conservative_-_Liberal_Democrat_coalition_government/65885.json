        "additional_details": "Scanning in the third trimester of pregnancy should be procedure as in that period is when it's more likely to detect serious problems which result in premature Labour and even loss and many more altercations, it could save so many lives and the mental and physical health of the parents, it's more detectable in later stages as to the development and movements of the baby e.g if there are any problems it will be visible in the actions of the baby as the baby is more developed at this time, the NHS say it is not beneficial to them but it is to the lives of the babies and parents so many lives could be saved by just being scanned at this stage, this could reduce so many problems and help so many, alot of things like placenta and oxygen can go undetected by the midwives and this needs to be made an option for the parents!
