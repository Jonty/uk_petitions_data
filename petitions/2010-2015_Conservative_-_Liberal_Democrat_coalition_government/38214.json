If they were phone tapping then we all know what the consequences would be, but it is no different.\r\n\r\nMuch of this already contravenes the UK Data Protection Act 1998 and also our right to privacy under the European Convention on Human Rights which the UK government have signed up to and yet we live in a country where an ISP like o2 is ordered to hand-over personal subscriber information under duress as a result of mass unregulated and legally unsanctioned internet tapping.",
