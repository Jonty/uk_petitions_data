This is the best drug to treat advanced forms of cancer but Jeremy Hunt the Health Secretary wants to remove it from the list  as soon as possible due to cost! This drug gives men quality of life, if removed men will have to revert to 'stilboestrol' which have been around since the 1950's\r\nand is know to cause side effects / problems and can be toxic. Help us fight to keep their quality of life, remember prostrate cancer attacks men of all ages. Thank You.",
