        "additional_details": "The current law relating to landlords and tenants is too biased towards the tenants.  Currently if a landlord wants to evict a tenant because of not abiding by the terms of the tenancy i.e. not paying rent and/or illegal occupaction of a premises, the landlord has to apply for an eviction order from the court.  This takes around 6 months to obtain and incurs legal costs whilst also losing rental income on the property.  Even once the eviction notice has been issued and the tenant still has not left, the landlord then has to apply for court appointed baliffs which can take a further month.  In the meantime the tenant who already has been told to vacate the property by the court is allowed to appeal which puts a stay on all proceedings, even if the landlord has a clean and cut case.  The law is completely out of date and must be updated so it is fair to both parties.",
