        "additional_details": "Dylan and Daniel both died on the 11th November 2011. They died between Rainham and Dagenham Dock station. That night they made a bad decision to walk home on the track after just missing their last train. Unfortunately they died in a tragic accident but an accident that could have been prevented.\r\nThe stations are not manned, the CCTV is not monitored, there is no security in place at stations, level crossings or on the track.\r\nFrequently more lives are unnecessarily being taken.\r\nThe government needs to take action. They need to demand that the private rail companies are implementing safety precautions for all passengers.For the safety of the public, CCTV should be monitored 24 hours a day. Security gates should be fitted to stop passengers being able to walk from the platform on to the track. Stations should be closed when the trains are not in service. Something needs to change to prevent this from reoccurring. ",
