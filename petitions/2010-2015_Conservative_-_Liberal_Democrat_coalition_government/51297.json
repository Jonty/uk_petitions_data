        "additional_details": "This government should do all it can to keep the National Media Museum open. The museum provides vital education, training, and skills in the world's first UNESCO City of Film, Bradford, which is also one of the UK's most deprived cities. The museum raises aspirations, educates the country's future creative workers, and boosts the local economy. Its closure would be a great loss to the city and to the country.",
