        "additional_details": "Recently Louise Mensch MP confessed to past drug-taking. No punishment has befallen her, despite 1,400 people being imprisoned in 2010 for possession of drugs.\r\n\r\nShe is part of a long-list of MPs who have admitted committing former imprisonable offences that have not been punished. The list includes at least one former Home Secretary (Charles Clarke's admittance of former cannabis smoking).\r\n\r\nThe petition calls for all MPs to swear under oath and previous offence they have committed at any time in their life. This should be done when they take office. Constituents have a right to know the criminal character of their representatives.",
