It took until May 2014 for the case to be dropped without charge.\r\nIn Feb 2014 he had another allegation made against him. He has twice been pit into a high security prison with dangerous criminals . They live in filthy conditions with food that is unfit for consumption and disgusting sanitary provision. He sleeps on a concrete floor with 70 others.\r\nThe charges...having no visa. The court held his passport so he couldn't apply for a visa.\r\nWorking without a permit....he was set up to meet potential UNICEF clients by immigration. It is allowed to have meetings\r\n in readiness for starting a business.\r\nThe business? Fire safety! Making Kenyan schools safe....helping the children of Kenya.he should be a hero not a criminal.\r\n",
