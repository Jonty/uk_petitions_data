However, recent changes are asking them to secure earning and score point which is contrary to Home office instructions set forth in initial approval of the visa.\r\n\r\nOn 6th April 2011 Settlement Rules for Tier 1 and HSMP Migrants were amended retrospectively.\r\n1. Tier 1 Applicants are required to score points again in the last year when they apply for Settlement\r\nApplicant needs to be free of unspent convictions (including traffic offence)\r\n2. A person could be in a job for 4 and a half years and then loose his job because the economic scenario or get a driving fine and as a result won't be eligible for ILR.\r\n\r\nIn the past, immigration ministers have consistently opposed the retrospective elements of the changes. Hence, I would urge the government to overturn the retrospective rules.\r\n\r\n",
