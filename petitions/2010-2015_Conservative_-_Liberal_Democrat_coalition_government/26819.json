        "additional_details": "It is a long time coming. We need a new river crossing between Essex and Kent (preferably a tunnel) that is Toll Free. The congestion at Dartford Crossing caused by the tolls is totally unacceptable. A clear example is the QE2 brige being closed due to high winds and the tolls instead of easing congestion by opening the gates continue to collect the toll charges. It is disgusting that the Government promise of using the money collated from the tolls to build another river crossing is an empty promise. How long do we have to wait?",
