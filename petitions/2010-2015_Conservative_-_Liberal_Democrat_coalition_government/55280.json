To allow these people to continue breeding means that our taxpayer pounds will be ENTIRELY wasted because allowing them to continue breeding will merely increase the size of the cohort and the amount of taxpayer pounds to be spent on trying to sort them out - which is NEVER going to work if they keep on breeding.",
