        "additional_details": "Michael Gove has recognised that RE has 'suffered' due to recent government innovations. He has expressed a desire to 'work with faith groups to improve RE teaching' - hopefully, he will also consult with RE teachers and with pupils.\r\nImproving RE involves inspiring teachers; supporting and funding research and training in schools and universities; encouraging collaborative work by teachers; ensuring RE in schools has both curriculum time and financial support; and valuing outcomes including both qualifications and spiritual development. Supporting (and funding) SACREs at local and national level is also important.\r\nRE promotes the development of a wide range of skills and attitudes, including spiritual, moral, social and cultural development, tolerance, positive citizenship, community cohesion, communication, self-confidence and independent thought.\r\nRE deserves and needs government support.
