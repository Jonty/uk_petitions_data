        "additional_details": "Psoriasis and its debilitating psychological, emotional, physical, social effects should be considered as a disability as this illness causes tremendous physical impairment: not only its difficult for individuals with chronic psoriasis to work and take part in any social event/gathering as self-esteem is severely affected, but also the bleeding, cracking and painful skin does not make it easy for individuals to be considered 'equal' and be able to carry out roles of high calibre easily. Please consider it as a disability and invest more money in finding potential causes and a cure. In the meantime, support the sufferers that eventuallky are hit with crippling psoriatic arthritis also. Thank you for joining me in this campaign to raise awareness and more support.",
