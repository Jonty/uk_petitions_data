At least by using the foreign aid budget to pay this fine will prevent our taxpayer funding of the purchase of bombs and bullets for African despots to reign mayhem, terror and murder upon innocent civilians who do not agree with them.  IT DOES NOT SIT EASY WITH ME THAT MY MONEY IS BEING TAKEN OFF ME TO FACILITATE GENOCIDE IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  JUST HOW MANY OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY AGREE WITH ME?  Vote here if you do.  (PS - one day in the not too distant future David Cameron is going to be up in front of the European Courts on a charge of genocide - it is his decision - ALONE - that allows our money to be used to pay for the killings going on in Africa, AS YOU READ THIS).",
