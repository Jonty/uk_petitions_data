        "additional_details": "On 29th July 2011 the Daily Mail online ran a story accompanied by video footage which detailed deliberate acts of cruelty to pigs being processed for slaughter at Cheale Meats abbatoir in Essex. The animals were seen to be beaten, punched in the face, kicked and hit with implements. The stunning process was ineffective and caused unnecessary suffering. The footage was taken by Animal Aid and DEFRA were made aware of it but have refused to take action as the surveillance was undertaken without the knowledge of Cheale Meats.\r\nWe demand that DEFRA fully investigate Cheale Meats practices and that the individuals (workers and slaughtermen) seen maltreating the animals in the video should be sacked and made subject to the full force of the law",
