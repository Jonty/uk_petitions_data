When they go off they cause significant stress and inconvenience to neighbours. And they do go off often. Whatever their effectiveness at preventing crime, the brunt of the cost is borne by neighbours. Alternative solutions to preventing robbery ought to be found which don't affect neighbours so detrimentally. ",
