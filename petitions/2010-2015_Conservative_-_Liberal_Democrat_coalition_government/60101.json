        "additional_details": "People viewing cannabis as an illegal drug only furthers the misconception that it is dangerous, addictive and unhealthy. THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE.\r\nNobody has died from cannabis. Aside from its recreational uses (which is the only focus of the government) it has 1000+ other uses that I can't even fit into this petition. It has been proven to help with the treatment of diabetes, cancer, MS, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and more.\r\nIn the UK, alcohol is at the heart of a way to blow off steam and go crazy every weekend. The only reason this is so, is due to alcohol being the only legal and easy to get hold of drug out there. PEOPLE NEED TO BE EDUCATED - THEY ASSUME IF ITS LEGAL ITS SAFE AND VICE-VERSA. Alcohol is solely responsible for most divorces, car accidents, violence, vandalism, social fear, and medical issues right through to death. It is a poison, that enpoliticians millions a year with its addiction and influence.\r\nCannabis should be legal and promoted.\r\nWhy not?\r\n",
