        "additional_details": "We feel that members of the Armed Forces put their lives on the line for this country and rightfully earn a military pension.\r\nThroughout their service they pay income tax on their monthly wage. Once they leave the services and gain employment in civvy street their military pension is classed as a second income and therefore their monthly salary is taxed at a higher rate whilst their pension is taxed at base rate.\r\nSo after a full service to Queen and country they are then penalised for the remainder of their working career.\r\nI would like to petition that Forces Pensions are made free from income income tax.",
