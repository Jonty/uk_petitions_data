        "additional_details": "- The Awami League [AL] led government organised the January 5th 2014 Parliamentary Elections in Bangladesh.\r\n\r\n- The opposition Bangladeshi Nationalist Party boycotted the polls.\r\n\r\n- 153 MPs from the Awami League & their affiliated parties, won their elections without any opposition.\r\n\r\n- Voter turnout was at an all time low, which was estimated to be 22%.\r\n\r\n- The AL acted against the spirit of democracy in unilaterally organising the Jan 5th polls.\r\n\r\n- The AL rigged the electoral process to engineer an overwhelming victory for them.\r\n\r\n- The newly 'elected' AL led government lacks the popular mandate to govern Bangladesh.\r\n\r\n- Therefore, the newly 'elected' government is illegitimate.\r\n\r\nThe Signatories Resolve:\r\n\r\n- The UK government [UKG] is to not recognise the results of the Jan 5th polls.\r\n\r\n- UKG is to demand fresh, free and fair elections in Bangladesh.\r\n\r\n- UKG is to suspend all unessential ties to the AL led government, until democracy is restored in Bangladesh.\r\n",
