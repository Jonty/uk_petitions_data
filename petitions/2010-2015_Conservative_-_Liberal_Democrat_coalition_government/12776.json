        "additional_details": "Prime Minister and Home Secretary - Please review the spending cuts you have inflicted on the police, the last few days have proven that by reducing police numbers and budgets it has brought terror and criminality to our streets and our country. Law abiding citizens have had their homes broken into and terrorised by masked raiders, businesses have been decimated & society disrupted! Rethink the cuts you have put in place, make more money available to protect the british people and help to fix a broken britain. It is clear there are not suffcient police as numerous forces have provided mutual aid to support London, leaving other ares of the country vulnerable. If the cuts go ahead this will leave law abiding citizens without police when they require them\r\n\r\n",
