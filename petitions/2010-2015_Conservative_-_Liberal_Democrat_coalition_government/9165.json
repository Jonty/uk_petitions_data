        "additional_details": "Currently, our forces are losing front-line soldiers, we have over-crowded prisons and empty barracks across the UK. I propose a form of \"national service\" for those involved in the riots, taking them to previously abandoned barracks, training them with some of the toughest army units in the UK, and then sending them off in small units to support in our current deployments. This can be either combat support or relief activites world-wide This will:\r\n\r\na) Prevent over-crowding in our prisons, and criminals learning from more experienced in-mates whilst there\r\n\r\nb) Give the army more manpower to assist in its current engagements\r\n\r\nc) Change the character of the rioters into something that society can find altogether more useful.\r\n\r\nd) Provide relief work around the world\r\n\r\nIt is simply a much stricter form of rehabilitation, one which they will no be able to ignore or run away from.
