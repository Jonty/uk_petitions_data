No - This is oppression; this is deprivation; this is injustice. But they live like this every day and they have done for as long as they can remember. We can stop it; by helping the Palestinians to share their story with the world; by signing this petition to end all censorship of the Palestinian situation in mass media throughout the UK. Ignoring them won't take away their pain. We can change that. So lets change it now.",
