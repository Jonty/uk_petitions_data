This is a total disregard for the hra 1998 even criminals have more right than someone who is diagnosed with an acute mental illness such as depression if treated in hospital.\r\nThe mental health act also disregards a professional duty of care which puts the vunerable person at risk within the hospital.\r\nI think the act needs to do more to protect and help rather than drug and abuse the vunerable people.\r\n\r\nSay no to the barbaric mental health act and protect human rights!",
