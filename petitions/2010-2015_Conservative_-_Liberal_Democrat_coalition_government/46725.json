If Mp's then wish to use their own furnishings and keep or let out their constituency home and pay tax on the income, that is their choice.  If this could be done in connection with the armed forces on MoD ground this would also help in reducing  security costs. Then give travel warrants the same as services personel  for any necessary travel costs",
