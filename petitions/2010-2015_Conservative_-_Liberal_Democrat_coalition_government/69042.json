        "additional_details": "We are campaigning to have a more effective, standardised and updated sexual health education in all schools across the country. Currently when it comes to sexual health education schools choose their own curriculum, sometimes influencing teenagers minds and making a mockery of a serious issue. The United Kingdom is the laughing stock of Europe when it comes to sexual health. This needs to change starting with serious, inclusive and indiscriminate sexual health education in all secondary schools.",
