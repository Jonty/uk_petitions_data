If implemented, the pedestrian gates of those parks that have always been locked would be left open all night.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis decision has caused alarm amongst local Friends of Parks groups and concern to residents, especially those with homes that back on to parks, who fear they will be exposed to intruders at night.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned insist that Enfield Council thinks again, gives proper regard to the safety of persons and valuable community assets, and drops the blanket proposal to stop locking parks at night.\r\n",
