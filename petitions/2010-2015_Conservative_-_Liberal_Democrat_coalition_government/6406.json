There was no good reason for this, since both coalition partners agreed on this prior to the election.  Then there was the promise of a referendum on the EU treaty.  The name of which was changed to avoid just such a referendum.  If manifesto promises are meaningless, and they are, then so is the vote of the elector.  This is not democracy.",
