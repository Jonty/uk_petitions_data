        "additional_details": "We need to put a STOP to employers taking apprentices only half-way through their apprenticeships for cheap labour. Many apprentices start with their level 2 qualification  at a ridiculously cheap rate of \u00a32.73 per hour (current rate).\r\n\r\nLevel 2 qualifications tend to last 12 to 18 months. After completing level 2, the employer must ensure that the apprentice is paid the minimum wage (depending on their age) which is a bit more than \u00a32.73 which employers are not willing to pay.\r\n\r\nEmployers should legally take apprentices through their full training (level 3 minimum) and more funding should be provided to help employers towards the costs.\r\n\r\nThe majority of employers require candidates to have a level 3 qualification for them to be considered for the position.\r\n\r\nLet's get the Apprenticeships Policy changed for the sake of young people and give them careers that they are willing to work hard for!",
