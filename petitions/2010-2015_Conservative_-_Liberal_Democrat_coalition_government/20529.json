        "action": "Eliminate The Unfair BBC License Fee",
        "additional_details": "The BBC is funded by public money and given a semi-monopoly of broadcast news coverage. The BBC is by charter expected to reflect the British values of fair-mindedness, decency and tolerance.The BBC is doctrinally pro-European. During the 1975 referendum campaign, it was the propaganda wing of the pro-Brussels machine, and this attitude has not changed since.The opinions of the very significant and growing majority of the British people who want us out of Europe are mostly ignored This problem is made much worse by the fact that bias is not the only problem. A further difficulty is lack of standards. It is not simply the opinions of BBC producers and reporters that are suspect. So are the facts they put in front of the public.                                                               So we therefore ask that the Government Abolish the license fee and the  BBC become self funding as the BBC have failed the British people",
