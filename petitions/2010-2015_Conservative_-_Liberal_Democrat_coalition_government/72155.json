        "additional_details": "In a world where we are fined for taking our children away in school time, holiday companies have took advantage of this and pushed up the prices in the school holidays.  They seem to be making a lot of money out of the fact that we do not have much choice.  This has to change.  I would propose a cap of 20%.  This would make it illegal to raise any holiday price by more than 20% during the summer holidays.  This would allow more families to take their children away.",
