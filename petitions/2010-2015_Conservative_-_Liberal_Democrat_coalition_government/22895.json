Further more, every manifesto should include bullet points to cover all the main areas of government.\r\n\r\nI want a separate section of e-petitions should be devoted to party manifestoes and the public should have the opportunity to say what they want included in the manifestoes of ALL major parties so that a distinction can be drawn. E.g. we want to know your parties attitude to increasing tuition fees, or the UK\u2019s future in the EU, or what will your party do to fuel prices in the next parliament, this SINGLE document should then be published by an independent analyst, having explained the implications of each stand point.\r\n\r\n",
