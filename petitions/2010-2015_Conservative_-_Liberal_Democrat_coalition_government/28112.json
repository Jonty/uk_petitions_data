        "additional_details": "Car insurance costs in our country are getting out of hand. Some young drivers are being quoted over \u00a320,000 for their first car, as a young driver myself I find it silly that the government allows insurance companies to charge such high sums to first time drivers. On top of that, the government has raised university fees for students, this is going to leave people of my generation and future generations with even high debts. When responsible drivers are being forced off the road by the cost of insuring their cars, the Government has to act. Add your name to this petition to help me fight for affordable insurance for young drivers,\r\n\r\n Thank you, Liam Nunn",
