        "additional_details": "Demanding the rights for parents to temporarily remove children from schools to provide educational and experiential visits and events. This may be by taking trips, travelling, visiting events and attending external classes or sessions. It is NOT demanding to take children on holidays or leisure holidays/breaks but to allow parents to choose and provide life experiences and education that can not be provided within the school environment. We accept information and aims and objectives/schemes of work should be provided by parents to the relevant school to ensure education takes place. This petition is to ask the government to enable parents to take an active role in the way a child experiences their childhood and learns from it during term time without fines or court action. We demand educational welfare organisations grant permission to parents considered on each individual case and not using 'blanket rules' or guidelines.",
