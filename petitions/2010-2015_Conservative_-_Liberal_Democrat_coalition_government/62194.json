Surely it won't be such a big problem for the rider of the horse to carry around a bucket and spade to clear this mess up. Please sign my petition so councils can implement some law which states that it should be cleaned up. Why should we have to put up with this constant excretion abuse which is currently plaguing our UK streets.   ",
