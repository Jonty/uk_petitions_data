At present we're lucky if we can get 0.3-0.5Mb/s yet we pay for a much faster service.  We are unable to change provider as the broadband speeds are too slow to get the best deals, we end up paying up to three times more for broadband in this area.\r\nOther areas are having their broadband upgraded yet this area seems to be getting left behind.
