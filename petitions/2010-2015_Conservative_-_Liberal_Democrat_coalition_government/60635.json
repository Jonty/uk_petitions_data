            "details": "As this e-petition has received more than 10 000 signatures, the relevant Government department have provided the following response:\r\n\r\nThe Government believes that as part of a broad and balanced curriculum, pupils should learn about different cultures, and about how different groups have contributed to the development of Britain. The content and structure of the new history curriculum provides plenty of scope for black history to be covered. However, this is not prescribed in detail within the statutory programmes of study.  Instead schools have the flexibility to deal with these topics in ways that are appropriate and sensitive to the needs of their pupils.\r\n\r\nSpecifically in the history programmes of study, in primary, Rosa Parks and Mary Seacole are listed at key stage 1 as examples of significant individuals in the past that pupils could be taught about, who have contributed to national and international achievements.  At key stage 2, pupils should be taught about a non-European society that provides contrasts with British history  - one study chosen from: early Islamic civilization, including a study of Baghdad c. AD900; Mayan civilization c. AD900; Benin (West Africa) c. AD900 -1300.\r\n\r\nPupils can develop these opportunities further at secondary school level.  Key stage 3 includes the example of the impact through time of the migration of people to, from and within the British Isles, as well as Indian independence and end of Empire.  In addition, in Citizenship at key stage 4, pupils should be taught about the diverse national, regional, religious and ethnic identities in the United Kingdom and the need for mutual respect and understanding. The new national curriculum, including the programmes of study for history, can be found at the following site: http://tinyurl.com/oh9swhp\r\n\r\nIt is important that pupils develop an understanding of the key events that have shaped the history of Britain.  Teachers do however have the freedom to teach aspects of the history of other cultures, in addition to the core content, to meet the needs of their pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.",
