        "additional_details": "This petition is for the government to close down and ban Rodent Farms and the improper breeding of Rodents in the United Kingdom!\r\n\r\nBig Chain Pet Stores, such as Pets at Home, stock their rodents, from rodent farms. These evil places, created only to make money need to be shut down. They would be shut down if they did not have the funding from stores such as Pets at Home!\r\nAnimals have a life, which often starts out in a tiny crammed cage. Which as a result, is affecting the mental state of these innocent pets. So as a result, the temperament of these rodents, make them more inclined to bite their owner. As a result of this horrific breeding, people who buy pets from shops that stock their rodents from these farms are starting to neglect their pets due to the fact that they are more likely to bite, which is the fault of the careless breeding from Rodent Farms.\r\n\r\nThank You ",
