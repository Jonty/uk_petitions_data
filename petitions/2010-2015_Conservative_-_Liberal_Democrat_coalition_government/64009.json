        "action": "Ban The UK \"Health Lottery\" From Operating",
        "additional_details": "The Health Lottery is causing real damage to charities, good causes and the credibility of the lottery industry. It is estimated that this organisation is claiming 50p from every \u00a31 in expenses, donating the bare minimum required by law of 20% towards health causes whilst removing funds from the National Lottery. The government needs to implement legislation that prevents organisations from creating a lottery that can compete with the National Lottery. The Health Lottery have also launched other gambling ventures such as a for-profit bingo website which uses similar branding to the Health Lottery. There needs to be a limit on the amount of expenses claimed by a managing body of society lotteries along with the amount of society lotteries managed by one body.  A full review is required of the lottery industry to ensure it serves its purpose of raising funds for charity and not profits.",
