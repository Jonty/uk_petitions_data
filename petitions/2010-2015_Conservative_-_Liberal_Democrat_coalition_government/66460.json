We also call on this Government not to give support to airstrikes carried out by any of our allies.  In place of military intervention we call on the British Government to provide humanitarian aid for those Iraqi civilians caught up in this conflict.\r\nThe situation in Iraq is very serious, but our intervention will only inflame the situation further.   Not every situation can be solved through military means.  The UK should use it's influence to bring about a just peace and provide help for the civilians of Iraq so that they can survive this awful conflict.\r\n",
