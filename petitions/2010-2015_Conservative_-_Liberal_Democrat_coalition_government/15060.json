        "additional_details": "The government should withdraw its recently allocated \u00a360 million funding for gipsy & traveller sites in England.\r\nIn part, these are intended to reduce the considerable cost that councils bear dealing with illegal sites.\r\nHowever, the proposed sites, whose rent is funded mainly through housing allowance, will simply create demand.\r\nIllegal sites will persist and councils will then be faced with this, plus the cost of maintaining new sites.\r\nThis money should be used to support the elderly, the disabled and young people, for whom budgets have been substantially cut.",
