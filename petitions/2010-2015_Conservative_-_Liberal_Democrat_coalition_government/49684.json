        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call for a ban on the development of 3D printers for private use.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen in the news recently 3D printers can be used to build weaponry, including handguns and other devices, without need for a gun license. Indeed, as films and songs are pirated illegally so can be blueprints for 3D printers.\r\n\r\nWe believe this to be a dangerous development. Not only will some of the most dangerous people in society be able to build their own weapons caches but terrorist organisations will be able to bypass security with plastic weaponry and explosive devices, potentially putting everyone in our society at risk. Due to the often irrationality of human nature and instability of the world today, we simply cannot trust people with such potentially ruthless devices.\r\n\r\nAction needs to be taken now before 3D printers become more widely used and cost-effective.",
