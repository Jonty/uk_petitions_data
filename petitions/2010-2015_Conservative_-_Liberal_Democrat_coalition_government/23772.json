In my youth, interest rates in excess of 49% were considered to be harsh and luxurious, and illegal. We should revert to what worked well then. I would suggest that severe penalties are imposed if exceeded including financial penalties and terms of imprisonment for directors of the business. This should also cover doorstep lenders.",
