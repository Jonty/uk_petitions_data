        "additional_details": "I would like the government to make it mandatory for all Pubs and Bars in the UK to provide a wide range of non-alcoholic drinks.\r\nThe current selection of non-alcholic drinks in pubs tends to rarely be more than a couple of non-alcoholic/low-alcohol beers and wines, cola or lemonade, and fruit juices. These drinks are all just drinks one would have to 'settle' for because nothing else is available.\r\nI would like to see more sociable non-alcholic drinks being provided in all bars and pubs around the UK so non-drinkers don't have to feel as if they are just left with common drinks you can get anywhere. Examples include bottles of ginger ale (not the small mixer bottles that are already available), root beer, and iced tea.\r\nI for one, would be happy paying a similar price to a alcoholic drink for a non-alcholic drink of this nature.",
