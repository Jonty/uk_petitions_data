        "additional_details": "Employees / Contributors to organisations / businesses need to be vetted for criminal convictions etc. There are services such as Disclosure Scotland / Criminal Record Bureau that deal with applications .\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the time for a application to be processed and to receive information can take up to two weeks. This causes problems when needing to find out information on someone quickly and efficiently.\r\n\r\nFor example, a ad hoc employment of a person to work with children might have to happen quickly. Therefore, an application to disclosure any convictions etc to see fit whether they can work for the organisation can take longer to process than the employment. This needs to happen quicker.\r\n\r\nI propose that a fast track service is offered to ensure that checks can take place as quickly as possible. ",
