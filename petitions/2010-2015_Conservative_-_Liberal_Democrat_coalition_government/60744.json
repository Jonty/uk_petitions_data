Over 90% of scientsts say this is caused by Climate Change, which in itself is caused by human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nSo David Cameron is advocating burning of more fossil fuels which will make Climate Change even worse than it is already?\r\n\r\nSurely the Government should not be \"getting behind fracking\", but investing in more green energy schemes?",
