It is completely wrong and immoral that the Government should use our money in this way particularly when so much is being cut at home.\r\n\r\nWe are forced to pay taxes by the Government, they then give a generous portion of this money away. It should be illegal for the Government to do this and a bill should be passed to stop it.\r\n",
