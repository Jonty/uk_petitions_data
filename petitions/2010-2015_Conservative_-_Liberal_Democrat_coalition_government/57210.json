We also expect that our police will aim to catch and stop criminals.\r\nHowever, currently no exemptions exist for driving offences which can be committed during these calls to protect and serve the public and staff can find themselves being investigated and in some cases charged and convicted of offences such as Dangerous driving, careless driving and other offences, when trying to save lives, arrest criminals and do their role.\r\n\r\nWe need to change the law to incorporate an exemption for emergancy services when acting in their role, in all but the most exceptional of circumstances and then for a specific offence to be created for to encompase where the behaviour falls way below that expected of their role\r\n",
