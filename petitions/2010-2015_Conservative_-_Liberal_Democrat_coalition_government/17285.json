        "additional_details": "There is a overriding feeling that if Capital Punishment is re-introduced into the Law, then other forms of physical punishment will become legal as well, in particular corporal punishment within schools. In our modern society, this would not bode well at all. It would only increase the temptation for youths to fight back or retaliate, or, in worst case scanario  try and deliberately harm someone.\r\n\r\nHowever if we work with our youths and simply try to understand their point of view, there is no need to even consider physical punishment. Issues can always be discussed, and in my opinion, the need to physically harm a child shows lack of self-control and an inability to communicate. Should you really be in teaching then?",
