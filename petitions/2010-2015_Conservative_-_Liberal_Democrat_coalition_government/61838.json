        "additional_details": "This petition has been set up to highlight the proposed closure of ward 24 Dermatology at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee. This being the only in-patient treatment facility in the whole of Scotland, with access to specialist equipment and dedicated trained staff. People come from far and wide, for example from the Borders to the Outer Hebrides to receive treatment and the proposed closure of the ward would have a devastating impact on the lives of all patients requiring the use of this facility. So, please, help us \"SAVE OUR SKIN\"",
