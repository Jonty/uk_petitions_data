        "additional_details": "TV on the Radio (TVOTR) are a fantastic band. The theme from 'Ghostbusters', by Ray Parker Jr., is similarly awe-inspiring.\r\n\r\nOccasionally these two phenomena have combined; Glastonbury 2011 saw TVOTR cover the 80s film-classic in magnificent fashion.\r\n\r\nHowever, attendees of TVOTR gigs aren't *always* treated to this performance. A travesty of monumental proportions. No one should be forced to endure such disappointment.\r\n\r\nPlease, for the love of music, sign this petition to help ensure that TVOTR once again cover 'Ghostbusters' during their scheduled gig at London's Roundhouse on February 21st 2015.",
