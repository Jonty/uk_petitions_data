        "additional_details": "Family Allowance Payments should be paid for the first two children only to all families regardless of income, that way those who pay tax benefit and those who don't pay tax benefit.  If a couple choose to have more than two children they would be expected to make provision for them themselves.  This would be fairer and would not encourage resentment against larger families and save the government billions off the national debt, and make people think about the over population and the overstreched services ie schools, health, infrastructure etc that are now not able to cope with the demand of larger families  ",
