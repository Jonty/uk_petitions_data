Why is the judiciary not subjected under the the same level of public accountability as the executive and legislature arms of government?  Judges and tribunal chairmen make wide range of decisions that affect the lives of organisations and individuals and yet little is known about them and their interests by the public.  In order for us to be able to seek accounts from the Judiciary, the judges and trbunal chairmen must disclose online the following: Shares, other employments or sources of income, membership of organisations, interest in politics. This will enable litigants and defendants check for conflicts of interests before presenting their cases before a judge/tribunal",
