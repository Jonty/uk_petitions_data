        "additional_details": "The sentences passed on sexual crimes against children are often no where near the maximum sentence that can be passed, meaning that in thousands of cases pedophiles are getting off quite lightly considering their crimes. And with SOPO (sexual offences prevention order) checks after release not being thorough enough many convicted pedophiles are either getting up-to no good upon release, or simply their where abouts is not known, thus breaking the order. This petition after reaching a minimum of 10,000 signatures will be presented to parliament in hope that they will discuss the issue and perhaps act upon it. All support is greatly appreciated.",
