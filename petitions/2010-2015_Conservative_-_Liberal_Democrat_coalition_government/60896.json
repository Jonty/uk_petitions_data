There may be a place for them, however, I think in times of need, why not place starving, raggedly dressed children around the base of these statues, and see where the real assistance is required.\r\n\r\nSTOP local governments spending on unnecessary projects until poverty in the united kingdom has been abolished.  I pay my taxes for the benefit of my fellow countrymen and the human race beyond them.",
