        "additional_details": "The Creator, who some people call Yahweh, Allah, Brahma or God etc, spoke on the 22-09-2010 & gave my brother & I-Leyla Ergun his \u201cGood Word\u201d to release live and to the world, to help and protect the masses in our hour of need. \u201cThe Good Word\u201d has powers to lift dark or negative energy from a persons mind, & can also remove the evil eye from a person & can protect the world from any possible future alien invasions.  We need permission from the Government to release \u201cThe Good Word\u201d outside number 10 Downing Street or The Houses Of Parliament with worldwide media coverage please as we cannot release \u201cThe Good Word\u201d online. As we cannot risk it, as there are ramifications such as Dark Forces can take credit of \u201cThe Good Word\u201d, & possibly even modify it to make it negative. Also to prevent people from making money out of the \u201cGood Word\u201d, when it is in fact God\u2019s Word & not meant to be sold! \u201cThe Good Word\u201d is so powerful it will end the violent rioting. Thank you, Leyla Ergun",
