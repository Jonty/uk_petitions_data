        "additional_details": "The current job situation in the UK is varied with many graduates being unable to find work at a graduate level. Many employers wish to hire only staff with experience and those that do not hire based on an apprenticeship scheme of a very low wage - how can someone survive on this ?\r\n\r\nWhat is proposed is that the Government create a scheme whereby a national Graduate database is created and instead of employers choosing what grades are suitable (based on just results) the government could make them use more than that.\r\n\r\nThe database would be full of graduate profiles including CVs, a person based profile etc so would allow the employers and potential employees find their perfect match and thus remove the grading entry boundings such as 'only graduates with 2:1 or higher may apply'\r\n\r\nSay YES if you want less unemployment, more chances and a better way of life for our future generation.",
