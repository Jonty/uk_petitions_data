To add to this, the eu are proposing we open our welfare system to turkey!\r\nIf this is passed and agreed it will open the door to yet more immigration and more money in handouts coming out of British taxpayers pockets.\r\nAlso England will be open to other non eu countries having access to our welfare system should Brussels decide so,\r\n\r\nStop being victims of eu decisions, keep Britain from handing out taxpayer money hand over fist, put Britain first.",
