        "additional_details": "Prescribe heroin to addicts instead of criminalising them. This takes away the need for the user to commit crime. Saves the government the cost of cleaning up after crime. Makes the public feel safe as the user doesn't need to turn to crime. Stops young women becoming sex workers to feed addiction.. Puts addicts in the hands of the health service who can help them. Buy the heroin from Afghan farmers who can then be reitroduced to alternative food crops. The government is then the dealer which gets the scum dealers off the streets and saves on border control.",
