We want government intervention to bring this figure down to 55% or less, as well as policies to review ways of preserving the british way of life. Also immediate action on the deportation of all illegal immigrants and a lower cap on immigration. The british public public have been feeling the adverse effects of over immigration for some time now  and something needs to be done.",
