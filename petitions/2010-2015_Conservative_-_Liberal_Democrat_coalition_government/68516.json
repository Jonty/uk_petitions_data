I call on the British government to make an official announcement regarding which girl they see as the greatest, such a statement perhaps would allow many around the world to finally reach a decision on which Evangelion is best thanks to the informed opinion of the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this reason we hope that the Leader of the House of Commons can make such a statement on the behalf of the incumbent British government.",
