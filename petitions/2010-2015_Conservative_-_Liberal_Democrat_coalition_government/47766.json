My second child is allergic to cow's milk and eggs, and so his food costs a lot more. He has to have soya milk, and now that he is one, he does not have baby formula. He still needs soya milk, but Healthy Start Vouchers can only be used for formula or cow's milk.\r\n\r\nI think there should be more help for children with allergies, not less!\r\n\r\nI would like to see Healthy Start Vouchers change to be able to use them for alternative produce, or to have another voucher scheme for parents on low income whose children have allergies.
