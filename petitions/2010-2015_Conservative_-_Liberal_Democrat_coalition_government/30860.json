        "additional_details": "Details of the cuts to child benefit depending on the income of the parents has been on the news. I believe this is wrong and only going to cause problems and arguments between the earning classes.\r\n\r\nInstead of making cuts to people above a certain income simply make the  Child Benefit payments in the form of tokens, much like the milk tokens currently payed to those on qualifying benefits. These could be exchanged for groceries (milk, fruit and vegetables like the milk tokens) and clothes for children at qualifying shops (say the basic Asda, Tesco, Sainsburys, Primark, etc). This would allow the people who need the money to use it, create revenue for companies, jobs created due to the work increase, taxes for the government from the business generated.\r\n\r\nBy restricting the use of the tokens to fruit, veg, milk, baby goods/clothes it means the money will actually be spent on the child for the childs needs.\r\n\r\n",
