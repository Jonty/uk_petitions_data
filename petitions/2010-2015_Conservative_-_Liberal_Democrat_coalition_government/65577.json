        "additional_details": "Great literature in the English language is still great wherever it is written and wherever it is set. It still contains life's lessons whether the character learns it in the Deep South of America or the South East of England. The Department For Education is instructing examination boards to drop classic texts such as \"To Kill A Mockingbird\", \"Of Mice And Men\" and \"The Crucible\" in favour of purely British literature. We should not allow our children to miss these lessons and the beauty of the texts because they happen to be described by someone who is not \"from\" here or \"about\" here. My children should be allowed to, not only read, but study these texts.",
