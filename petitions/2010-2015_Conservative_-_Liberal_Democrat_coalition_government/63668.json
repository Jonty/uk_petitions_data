        "additional_details": "The Lendal Bridge Closure and Coppergate restrictions in York were declared unlawful and unenforceable by the Government's Adjudicator (Decision YR 05035C).\r\n\r\nThe Labour lead Council hold responsibility for the City of York Council, the enforcing authority. Throughout the trial and more importantly in days after the Adjudicator's binding decision, the Council's behaviour has been dismissive of constituents' critical opinion and ignored the rightful claims of tens of thousands of visitors to the city, furthermore it has been contemptuous of the Adjudicator's Office and decision.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour has brought the city into disrepute.\r\n\r\nAn effective governance policy, correctly adhered to could have prevented this embarrassing fiasco.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned constituents of York wish to register our disapproval of the council and its leadership.\r\n\r\nWe petition Government to direct an investigation into governance at the City of York Council.\r\n",
