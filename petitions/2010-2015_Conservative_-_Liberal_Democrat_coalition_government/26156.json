They are no longer fit for purpose.\r\nRedevelopment in these facilities should turn them into public community and leisure centres with more than just sports but developed with bright open spaces / public squares that can act as a central location for community events and gatherings and should establish the identity of the community and the area to install a sense of pride in that community.",
