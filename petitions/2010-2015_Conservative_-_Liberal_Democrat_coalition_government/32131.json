        "additional_details": "We the undersigned note reports that the government is in negotiations to sell a proportion of its shares in the Royal Bank of Scotland.\r\n\r\nWe note that the reported proposed price of sale is nearly half of the original price of purchase. This is utterly unacceptable and we therefore call for an immediate halt to these negotiations.\r\n\r\nWe demand that no sale be made until at least a full return on our investment can be guranteed. Furthermore, we note that the government holds these shares on the taxpayers behalf and feel that if the government will not act in the best interests of the taxpayer then it should immediately issue shares in RBS and all other taxpayer-funded banks to individual taxpayers. Sale of these shares should then be subject to approval by a simple majority vote of shareholders. ",
