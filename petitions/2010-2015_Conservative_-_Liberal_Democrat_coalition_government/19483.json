Delays in diagnosis can lead to an increase in the cost of treatments and a decrease in patients\u2019 contribution to society.  Therefore early diagnosis makes better economic and social sense.\r\n\r\nWe therefore urge the Government to ensure that necessary diagnostic tools and improved education to enable early diagnosis in ALL disease areas are at the forefront of NHS care.\r\n",
