There is no reason, barring 'tradition' and other irrational excuses, why marriage - or at least civil unions - cannot consist of more than two partners.  This is a matter of civil liberty; I wish to be free to engage in consensual relationships, should I wish, that be legally recognised, with more than one other partner.  Marriage, or at least civil partnership, is not much more than a contract, and I see no reason not to allow contracts of that nature to occur between more than two persons.",
