Anyone who works in a shop or whose family member does, already suffers from low wages and disruption to family life.\r\n\r\nEspecially at this time of economic recession people will not spend more money just because the shops are open for longer.  Extending the opening hours will increase the costs for the retailers and lower their profits not increase them.\r\n\r\nEven extending the opening hours for the Olympic period will deprive shop workers of the ability to enjoy the spectacle on their own doorstep as they will be too busy working.\r\n\r\nStop the government from extending the Sunday trading laws.
