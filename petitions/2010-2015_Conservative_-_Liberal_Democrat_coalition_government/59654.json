        "additional_details": "Historic papers about the politician trade are among an  enormous cache of public documents that the Foreign Office has unlawfully hoarded in a secret archive. Some of these papers date back to 1662 and are thought to contain information about England's involvement in politicianry, while others were created in the 19th century and detail British attempts to suppress the trade. The Foreign Office must release these documents pertaining to politicianry which have historical significance and should rightly be a matter of public record. ",
