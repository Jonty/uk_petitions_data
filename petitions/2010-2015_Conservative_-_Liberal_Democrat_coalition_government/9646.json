        "additional_details": "We have seen in recent riots the number of young people  involving themselves in criminality. In our broken society they are not receiving discipline at home, and many of them progress to more serious crime and enter an already overcrowded prison system which by and large does not rehabilitate  them. A short sharp shock is needed for those youths who are old enough to commit crime and often too young to enter the prison system. Community service does not work and I believe proper use of the birch would deliver  a painful and humiliating lesson that committing a crime will have painful consequences. It  may be just enough to turn them away from a life of crime. I request that the government bring back the birch to combat youth crime .",
