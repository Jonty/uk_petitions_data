        "additional_details": "The class size limit of 30 is a legal limit for the class size for 5,6, and 7 year olds.\r\n\r\nThis limit is now causing serious problems. Due to the increased birth rate, in many areas nearly all primary schools are full. As a result, families have children at schools many miles away from their home, and at different schools to siblings. Parents need to make the journey to school 4 times a day which is incompatible with working, or taking other children to different schools.\r\n\r\nThis is particulary a problem for families moving into an area where they are not able to find a school place and have to travel many miles or pay for private education. This policy leaves school provision mirroring that of NHS dentistry.\r\n\r\nI propose that the limit of 30, should be a guideline rather than a hard limit.\r\n\r\nThis would allow good schools to grow - they cannot justify an extra teacher for 1 pupil, but removing the limit may mean that many extra children can attend the school warranting a new class.",
