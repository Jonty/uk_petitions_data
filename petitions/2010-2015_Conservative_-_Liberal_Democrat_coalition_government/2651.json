In these days where all sorts of services are being cut to the bone, and we are told we \"all in it together\" there can be no possible justification for paying mortgages for people who are already much wealthier than the average hard pressed Briton. If MPs need accomodation when in London on MP's business modest accomodation could be provided, or they could lease flats which would remain the property of the House of Commons when the MP ceases to have that job.",
