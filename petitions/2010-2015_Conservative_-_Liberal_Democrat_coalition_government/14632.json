        "additional_details": "In light of some individuals asking to pay more tax, perhaps the government might consider encouraging the wealthy to make philanthropic donations to the government or additional tax payments to help plug the deficit.\r\n\r\nSome of the wealthiest people pay less tax as a proportion of their income than the middle-classes because of capital gains tax rates, rebates and off-setting. Whereas this helps encourage investment, some individuals may be willing to pay more.\r\n\r\nDonations could be made by way of additional tax or separately and may be general or to specific projects. Individuals could be encouraged to provide finance to establish new business/skills related projects (in their names).\r\n\r\nThe government may wish to encourage donations by setting up a web-page, allowing donations to be made and publicising the amount each individual pledges (allowing them to remain anonymous if they so wish). Perhaps the government could consider tax rebates or extending gift-aid on donations?",
