        "additional_details": "These are the actions, we the signed, wish the government to take to improve implementation of roadworks.\r\n\r\n- Limit the length of lane closures on the motorway to a bare minimum, lane closures for several miles with one person working 8 miles in are not necessary.\r\n\r\n- Overhead gantry signs should worn people up to a maximum of 1 mile before lane closures, not several miles before, forcing all road users into a single lane for miles when the lanes are still open.\r\n\r\n- Have repeater signs starting one mile before any lane closures teaching people how to merge, this will stop people getting into a single lane a long way back, rather than using all open lanes until the lane closure as is stipulated in the highway code.\r\n\r\n- When there is not any workmen (i.e. at night), the lane closures and/or temporary speed measures must be lifted. This will be easier if the closures are smaller in length.\r\n\r\nThanks",
