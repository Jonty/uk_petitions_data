        "additional_details": "Calling for the government to stop twin-tracking adoption within care proceedings. This is leading to many forced adoptions, victimising parents whom have not harmed their children. There should be an option of help for parents who fall into the following categories.\r\n- Parents with Learning Disabilities.\r\n- Parents with Mental Health Problems.\r\n- Parents with Physical Disabilities.\r\n- Parents with Intellectual Disabilities.\r\n\r\nThe option of twin-tracking where there is parents with disabilities should never be put forward in a court arena if it's only at risk of emotional harm etc. At risk doesn't mean proven risks, these are opinions of case workers put into the court, not a proven fact. The twin tracking route should only be used if deliberate intentional physical abuse is proven.\r\n",
