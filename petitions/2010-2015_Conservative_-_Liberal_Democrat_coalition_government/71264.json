Entrance on a bad bend, opposite two Grade 2 listed buildings, will spoil the surroundings and out of keeping on the street scene.Permission has been granted for three housing developments so no need for yet more houses to be built within 200 yards of each other. Drainage and sewers already under strain. ",
