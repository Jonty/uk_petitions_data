        "additional_details": "I would like to see the re-introduction of national National service for our younger generation. It would install discipline, fitness and a sense of worth to our demoralised youth of today. With job vacancies reducing by the day young people are finding it near dam impossible to get a start. So many of these kids find themselves out of school and with nothing to do but hang around street corners which usually leads to boredom then trouble! Get these kids of the street and get then doing something worthwhile. Fit bodies equals fit minds. I encourage you to sign!! ",
