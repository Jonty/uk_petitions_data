        "additional_details": "The purpose of the e-petitions website is so that those causes that receive the most public support can be put forward for debate between our elected representatives in Westminster. So far those petitions that have reached the required level of support have been debated in such a way as to avoid the main reason for them being generated to begin with. I propose to cease all MP's wages, renumeration, pension contributions, expenses and allowances unless those e-petitions that are successful are debated in full in their existing wording. Furthermore, they should be debated within the house attended by a minimum of 50% plus 1 of the total MP's who are considered by The Speaker as being able to attend the palace of Westminster. Failure to reach the 50% plus 1 attendance level will also result in the ceasing of ALL renumeration's to ALL MP's",
