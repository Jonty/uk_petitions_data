We rely on imports for food and fuel, we cannot sustain the (growing) population that we have in a decent manner.  Social resources such as the NHS and education are over-subscribed, we have high unemployment and soaring rents for inadequate accommodation.\r\n\r\nUntil the government get a grip on these problems the problems can be helped from getting worse, by holding the population at its present level.",
