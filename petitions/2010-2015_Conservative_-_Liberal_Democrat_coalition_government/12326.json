        "additional_details": "With the real chance that rolling 30 year road tax exemption will be adopted for classic cars status in the UK, there are a few neccessary and important exceptions that need to be addressed well ahead of introduction. As accepted by the majority of classic car owners, there is no reason for the inclusion of any British Leyland (and it's associated manufacturers) vehicles in the rolling 30 year road tax exemption listing, especially the Austin Allegro. In fact, much better to raise the taxation class for these vehicles guaranteeing their earlier demise from the UK road network.",
