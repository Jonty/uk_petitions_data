        "additional_details": "The new government stopped the construction of a new bridge crossing near Woolwich/Thamesmead... The ferry is a good service but out of date and too busy. This petition is for continuing the construction of this bridge. This wouldn't affect the Woolwich ferry as lorries would need to cross via ferry or Dartford tunnel the new bridge would only be for light weight transport. This would most certainly increase Woolwich and Thamesmead around property and most importantly attract more business and create jobs! Create a new bridge crossing between Woolwich and Dartford crossing! Thsnk you.",
