Examples of these could include;\r\n\r\nTo live or have lived for a minimum period of time in the constituency they wish to represent.\r\n\r\nTo have worked for a minimum period of time as an employee of a company or in Her Majesty's services.\r\n\r\nGenerally the review should also consider amongst other matters;\r\n\r\nThe number of MP's to be reduced.\r\n\r\nMP's to receive a realistic benefits package to attract good quality candidates.\r\n\r\nThe process of standing as an MP to be simplified including possible Government subsidy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
