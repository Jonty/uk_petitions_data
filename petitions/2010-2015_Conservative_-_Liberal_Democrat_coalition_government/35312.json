        "additional_details": "The workers of our nation are quiet simply paying for the non-working. With no sort of relief on tax or any other expenditure but yet those who don't work get their free money, their free homes etc. whereas some hard working couples out there struggle to get on to the property ladder.\r\n\r\nBenefits should be on redemption basis meaning that you can only claim what you have paid in.\r\n\r\nGranted sometimes even the hardest working person in the modern day climate can struggle to get a job so everybody should have an amount say \u00a34000 to claim (only eligible to claim after you've worked for 12 months), then you have an opt in opt out basis, where you can choose to pay in via income tax or not.\r\n\r\nAt the moment the government is paying billions every year on people that quite simply don't want to work. \u00a34000 per each person over 18 that's worked for 12 months is a lot cheaper than supporting even a street for life on the dole.\r\n",
