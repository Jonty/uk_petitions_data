        "additional_details": "We call on the Govt to stop the building of a supermarket at Serbert Way, Portishead, to protect a colony of great crested newts.\r\n\r\nThis species has declined dramatically due to the loss of habitat. In the UK they are protected under the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981. It is also a European Protected Species & has further protection in the UK under Reg.39 of the Conservation Regulations 1994. It is an offence to:\r\nkill, injure or take a gcn.\r\nintentionally damage, destroy or obstruct access to any structure or place used for shelter or protection by a gcn.\r\nintentionally disturb a gcn while it is occupying a structure or place which it uses for that purpose\r\n\r\nIt is proposed that the newts will be moved when they finish hibernation in March 2013. If Sainsburys proceed with the development it contraves the above legislation.\r\n\r\nThere are already 14 supermarkets within a four mile radius of the town. The destruction of this valuable habitat is not necessary.\r\n",
