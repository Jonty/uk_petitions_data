        "additional_details": "The \"Y word\" is not, I repeat NOT a pejorative unless it is intended to be so. It is the Yiddish word for Jew. It has no relation to words like \"the N word\" which are insults and pejoratives - and debating how/if they can be turned around is a separate conversation. When Tottenham supporters chant \"Yids\" they are chanting \"Jews!\" Ask yourself, are they saying that word as an insult? The answer is plain for all to see. True, if it is chanted AT a team like Tottenham or any other team identified as \"Jewish\" it is an insult, that's why Tottenham fans long ago said, \"Yup, that's us. We're the Yid Army,  Context is everything in this.\r\nWe would like our fans to stop being arrested and stop wasting tax payers money.",
