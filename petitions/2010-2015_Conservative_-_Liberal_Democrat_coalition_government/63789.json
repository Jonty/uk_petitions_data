Supertax was originally legislated in 1909, and brought into effect in 1929. In 1960/1970's it was at 99% for top earners! Surely people earning over \u00a3250,000 pa could afford to pay the last listed supertax rate of 75%, on earnings over \u00a3250,000, and I call upon the Government to bring back supertax forthwith.",
