        "additional_details": "This is a petition to support the start of a national gelding scheme in the UK to help prevent more unwanted foals being born who are then often left neglected.\r\n\r\nMany horses are born each year because of irresponsible breeding. A national gelding scheme would stop the majority of these foals being born and ease the burden on rescue centres and charities. It would create a more responsible attitude towards breeding and the subsequent care of horses in the UK. It would also ensure that only healthy sires and mares are used for breeding.",
