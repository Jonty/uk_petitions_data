        "action": "Include domestic violence, rape and sexual assault, and safe-sex for same-sex couples in sex education",
        "additional_details": "Currently schools have a statutory responsibility to teach young people about puberty, STIs and HIV, and human reproduction (the Education Act 1996) and the importance of marriage (the Learning and Skills act 2000). Despite this, only a small minority of young people are taught how safe sex can be practiced by same-sex couples. Schools have no responsibility to teach young people what unhealthy, violent or abusive relationships look like, and how to get help if they are in one, or about the importance of consent and legal definitions of rape and sexual assault.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, therefore request that the House of Commons extend the statutory part of sex and relationships education to cover information about abuse and domestic violence, consent, rape and sexual assault, and safe-sex for same-sex couples.\r\n",
