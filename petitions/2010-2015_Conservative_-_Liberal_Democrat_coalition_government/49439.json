        "additional_details": "Rick Rescorla was security director of Morgan Stanley at the time of 9/11. Rick Rescorla was born in Cornwall and served with distinction in the Parachute Regiment, North Rhodesia Police and the Metropolitan Police. In 1963 he moved to the USA and joined the military, fighting at the battle of La Drang in Vietnam. On the day of the 9/11 attack Rescorla heard the explosion and immediately acted.  After successfully evacuating most of Morgan Stanley's 2,687 employees, he went back into the building. When one of his colleagues told him he too had to evacuate, Rescorla replied, \"As soon as I make sure everyone else is out\". He was last seen on the 10th floor, heading upward, shortly before the tower collapsed. Rescorla was declared dead three weeks after the attacks. Rescorla was a brave and noble Englishman and this country has not recognised this. I petition this Government that Rick Rescorla be awarded our nation's highest civilian honour for gallantry The George Cross.",
