        "additional_details": "1 John 4:15 \"Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God\".\r\n\r\nIt is a growing trend among extremists to kill anyone accused of blasphemy and to become heroes in this world to secure a place in \u2018paradise\u2019 after death. Pakistan\u2019s controversial blasphemy laws are once again in the headlines. The world\u2019s media is talking about Pakistani Christian mother Asia Bibi\u2019s sorrowful story. She was accused of blasphemy in 2009 and, since 2010, has been on death row. On October 16, 2014 the Lahore High Court (LHC) rejected her appeal; her suffering will continue for many more years because of the country\u2019s blasphemy laws. A further appeal is due to be submitted in the Supreme Court (SC) of Pakistan and, although there is hope that she will be freed, there is no guarantee that after an acquittal she will be safe and able to lead a normal life. #FreeAsiaBibi #SaveAsiaBibi",
