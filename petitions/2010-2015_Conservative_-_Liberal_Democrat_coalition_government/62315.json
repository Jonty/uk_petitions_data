        "additional_details": "MMRV is the quadruple vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) and chicken pox (also known as varicella). Varicella vaccination has been used in Japan for twenty years and the USA since 1995. In 2006, the varicella vaccination was combined with MMR to make MMRV. MMRV was licensed in 2005 and is a routine vaccination in many countries including the USA, Germany and Australia. The advantages of this are to reduce the number of injections and therefore increasing acceptance and uptake, hence increasing coverage. Two injections of MMRV give 94% immunity against chicken pox.\r\nThe WHO recommends routine vaccination to be considered in countries that can afford it and where it is a relatively important public health concern, a socio-economic problem and where at least 85% coverage is achievable. In the USA, where records of chicken pox cases are kept, evidence shows that its introduction has benefitted the economy.\r\n",
