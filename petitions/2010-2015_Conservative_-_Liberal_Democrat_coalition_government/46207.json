        "additional_details": "Premium TV services 'poaching' imported programmes from Free-To-Air networks, FTA TV lagging behind not being able to always acquire recent film rights, programmes moving from channel to channel in the name of 'free market' practice...pretty much modern TV's state of affairs at the moment. How much will be allowed under the guise of 'healthy competition'?\r\n\r\n\r\nSigning this petition doesn't require unconditional support for some new kind of strict regulation like the Independent Broadcasting Authority, but support to reign TV in within the digital age. Something Ofcom doesn't always fulfill to a satisfactory standard.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurely the government should take more responsibility, by making sure TV doesn't head towards a totally free market saturated landscape?",
