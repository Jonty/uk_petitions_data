        "additional_details": " Currently, the price of carbon is so low- about \u00a37/tonne- that energy companies can continue polluting and at low cost. What is more, this money is often obtained by raising the prices already overstretched families are forced to endure.\r\nWe the undersigned request that:\r\n1)  you pass legislation to set the national price of carbon at \u00a31,000/tonne in a way that prevents the Big 6 and other energy companies from raising prices\r\n2) some of the money is invested in research & development for next generation renewables and their storage methods, which are less flawed e.g. intermittent than current ones; and protecting the environment\r\n3) some of the money goes to working class homeowners to help pay their energy bills AND a deal is brokered with energy companies to keep prices low for everyone\r\n4) promote and fight for a higher European price of carbon of at least \u00a3100/tonne- \u00a31000 will most likely be vetoed by some EU members",
