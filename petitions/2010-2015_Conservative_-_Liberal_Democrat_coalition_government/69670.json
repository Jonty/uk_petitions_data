        "additional_details": "Recruitment consultancy is big business. Job seekers are in a vulnerable position because they need to find work but by uploading their C.Vs their personal information and identity is at risk. Many so-called recruitment sites simply gather job-seekers personal information and trade it to other companies for profit and marketing rather than for recruitment. Some of these websites may even be completely fake, offering no real jobs at all. We need better regulation of the online recruitment industry to protect job-seekers from exploitation and identity theft. It is not good enough to put all the responsibility on the job-seeker because they are compelled to upload their data by their need to find work. These companies are exploiting the vulnerable position of the unemployed. ",
