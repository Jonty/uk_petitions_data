The train companies are not properly held to account and will do everything they can to avoid giving us refunds for delayed / cancelled trains. Passengers are often left stranded with no information whatsoever. The government should punish underperforming rail operators by removing their franchise. The government should review how the rail network is run and consider re-nationalisation. ",
