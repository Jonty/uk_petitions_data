The best thing David Cameron could do now for the UK is to act more like the Swiss. You don't see protesters in the Middle East burning Swiss flags and shouting \"Death to Switzerland!\".This petition urges him to consider a new long-term stance for the UK as a neutral, peaceful nation with a defensive-only army. Let the USA fail alone at being the world's policeman and let's stop getting involved in other regions of the world, spending taxpayers money in a vicious circle of debt, death and religious extremism.\r\n\r\nIf the Islamic State manages to conquer Iraq, then let's hope David Cameron refrained from following the US's lead. We don't want a new generation of brainwashed Iraqis bringing Jihad back to Britain.",
