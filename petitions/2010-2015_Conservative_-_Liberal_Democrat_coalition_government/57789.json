        "additional_details": "I request the Government to reconsider its approach when it comes to giving British citizenship to asylum seekers, refugees and individuals from other EU member states. I have personally noticed that there are many former refugees/asylum seekers that have been given a status of a British citizen, after spending time in the UK. I understand that as humans we have a moral responsibility to shelter and look after the oppressed but does this mean that we should let them become citizens of our country, bring their family members to the UK, let them claim benefits and travel to other EU states which offer the best welfare system. I think that it would be in the best interests of this country to deport asylum seekers/refuges after the conflicting in their country is resolved or when the regime that is oppressing an individual is overthrown.
