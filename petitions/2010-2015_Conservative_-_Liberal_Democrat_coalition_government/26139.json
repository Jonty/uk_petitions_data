This is more than the number of identifying Sikhs, and more than Jews and Buddhists combined. Yet still the UK government refuses to acknowledge 'Jedi ism' as a recognised religion, and that Jedi are a religious minority that are being denied their right have their beliefs recognised. By signing this petition I acknowledge that Government should change their stance and allow Jediism to be a recognised religion with in the UK.",
