        "additional_details": "Cyberbullying should be recognised as a criminal offence and laws be enforced accordingly. Currently there is no legislation protecting children from bullying via electrical means such as social network sites, e-mail or text messages. What makes cyberbullying so impactive is that it can happen 24 hours per day 7 days per week with no respite at home like conventional bullying. The Diana Award and The Childrens Research Centre at The Open University released a report in November 2011 indicating that 38% of young people experianced cyberbullying and 78% reported that cyberbullying is increasing with 16% feeling that it has stayed the same and only 6% recognising any form of reduction. Cyberbullying ruins peoples lives and can make life feel unmanagable and torturous, these feelings have started to lead to suicides. We must act urgently.",
