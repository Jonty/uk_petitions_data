The government's basis for raising the state pension age beyond 65 is life expectancy but what provisions are in place for those between the ages of 65-68 who cannot claim their state pension but cannot find a job (and are less likely to find one than a younger person)? Also, raising the retirement age or scrapping it altogether may block job opportunites for younger generations making the economic climate even worse. ",
