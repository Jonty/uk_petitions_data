        "additional_details": "Mablethorpe Seal Sanctuary and Nature Centre are dedicated to conservation and animal welfare. As of  18th July 2013 AHVLA/DEFRA have declared that disabled wild endangered birds cannot be displayed unless they have an article 10 certificate. However, they have also stated that due to stricter interpretation of the regulations from Feb 2011 they will only grant these certificates if it is shown there will be a genuine conservation benefit to the species.  Therefore it is highly unlikely that any wild disabled article 10 certificates would be issued for the Barn Owls, Tawny Owls or Kestrels in their care. AHVLA/DEFRA  have instructed that the birds be taken of display, with fines of up to \u00a35,000 for each bird on display if they do not comply.\r\n\r\nWE WOULD LIKE THE GOVERNMENT TO DEBATE THIS ISSUE AND SEE THE EDUCATIONAL BENEFIT IN THIS KIND OF WORK AND CONSERVATION.
