        "additional_details": "A 70 year old British man, diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, has been sentenced to death by a court in Pakistan which convicted him of blasphemy. Mr Mohammed Asghar is from Edinburgh and once ran a successful small business in the town of Musselburgh.\r\n\r\nMr Asghar's legal team said it was effectively prevented from representing him after the judge appointed state lawyers.\r\n\r\nHe has been in jail since 2010 and his lawyer says he has also tried to take his own life in jail on one occasion.\r\n\r\nWhilst the charge of blasphemy is ridiculous in and of itself, it has commonly been used in Pakistan to settle personal grievances.\r\n\r\nWith this petition we urge the UK government to take all necessary actions to ensure the safety of Mr Asghar and his return to his family. We remind the government of its duty to provide the necessary assistance and protection to its citizens.",
