This hate and systematic transphobia has been highlighted in the most tradgic of circumstances by the recent (apparent) suicide of Lucy Meadows.\r\n\r\nFollowing Lucy's transition as a transgender women as a teacher she was targeted by a hateful piece of journalism published in the Daily Mail suggesting she should not be allowed to teach and using all of the outdated stereotypes and ignorant attitudes transgender people have had to deal with for decades.\r\n\r\nIn light of the new Independent Press Regulator being set  up we call on parliament to highlight this issue with the body and to make the ending of transgender hate, bullying and systematic transphobia from some media sources to be a priority for the regulator to tackle going forward after its formation.",
