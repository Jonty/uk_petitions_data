Unfortunately the propsed site is 2 miles away from a main road. In an increadable green part of West Wales. The road is used by dog walkers, school buses and horses. There is not enough room for two cars to pass by each other never mind great big lorries, cranes and other machinery needed to errect the Turbines.\r\n\r\nI hope you can all support this great cause.\r\n\r\nThank You Very much ",
