        "action": "Make MPs salaries a fixed multiplier of UK average wages",
        "additional_details": "We petition the government to have MPs and cabinet members salaries directly related of UK average wages. Fixed multipliers of  the average wages should be chosen (such as 2.25 times for MPs and appropriate fixed higher multipliers for cabinet posts). The calculation should be carried out yearly.\r\n\r\nIf MPs are doing an effective job then living standards across the country will rise and therefore MPs wage should rise in direct accordance.  However, if average wages fall, so should MPs. MPs should not get to vote on their own wages, or have an \"independent body\" chosen by the executive set their pay. This will go a step towards demonstrating MPs receiving fair renumeration related to how the country and its residents are doing. ",
