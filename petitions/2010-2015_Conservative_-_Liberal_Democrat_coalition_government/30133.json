        "additional_details": "I have just discovered a move to start a petition by anglers to cull cormorants, especially those that are found more than 5 miles inland (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17123858 and http://www.fishingmagic.com/forums/general-fishing/57002-cull-cormorant-petition-prime-minister.html), just to maintain fish stocks for their hobby!\r\n\r\nBritain holds a substantial number of breeding birds, with a large number spending the winter inland on lakes and rivers. (http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/c/cormorant/index.aspx and http://www.birdguides.com/species/species.asp?sp=017004)\r\n\r\nCormorants naturally eat fish, an increase of cormorant numbers would indicate an increase in suitable habitat, including an increase in food source. I would like to see proof that cormorants are responsible for a decline in fish stocks, and if so, why are their numbers not dropping through starvation?",
