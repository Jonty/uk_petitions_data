It is anticipated that the route will open up into a \u2018Y\u2019 shape line with spurs off to the North East. With the first phase not due to open to passengers until 2026, the North East cannot afford to wait for HS2.\r\n\r\nA high-speed line from London to Aberdeen in the Northeast of Scotland will have a massive economic boost to the areas along the route. Slashing travels times will make the Northeast and Scotland more appealing for London to do business with. A high-speed route will cut the enormous pollution caused by the aviation industry, at present the only way for Scotland to travel to London within a reasonable timescale.\r\n\r\nA viable high-speed line would begin in London and pass through, Leeds, Darlington, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Dundee and finally in Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nThe government should action the construction of a new high-speed line from London to Aberdeen.",
