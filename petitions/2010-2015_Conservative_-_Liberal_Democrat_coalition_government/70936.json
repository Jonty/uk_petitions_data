The closest was British, I was told that the English option is not available. They stated what they would use was white other.I do not consider my self as British or OTHER WHITE as anyone who gets nationalisation from other country can class themselves as British. I class my self as English. Why is there no option for ENGLISH on form. There is options for Welsh, Irish and Scottish. Why are the English denied this choice. Even on this petition form for my details asked if a am British Citizen or UK resident. So even the government do not recognise English People. I find this very disappointing.",
