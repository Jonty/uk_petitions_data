        "additional_details": "Family courts are persistantly failing to protect children from abuse.\r\nFamily court judges are repeatedly failing to listen to reports of abuse and are ordering children to attend contact with their abusers.\r\nChildren under the age of 12 (gillick competance) have no voice or rights. Children of ALL ages MUST be listened to when reporting abuse and their voices MUST be heard.\r\nBehind the pretence of 'putting the child first' Family Courts are repeatedly destroying childrens lives and non abusing parents are rendered helpless to protect them.\r\nStop abusers using Family Courts to continue control and abuse. Stop Family Courts hiding behind secrecy.\r\nTime to close this loophole in the law that is failing so many and destroying so many childhoods.\r\n\r\n",
