But the government and/or the NHS don't seem to understand this and only make scanning available on weekdays during \"normal hours\". Pregnant women who are in pain and bleeding on Friday night have to wait until Monday morning at the very earliest to be told whether they are or arent still carrying their child.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to make scanning available for pregnant women, no matter how far along they are as long as the pregnancy has been confirmed by a GP, at all times. The emotional distress and psychological scarring this ridiculous policy of waiting until weekday causes is disgusting. And it MUST STOP.",
