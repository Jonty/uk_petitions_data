In the morning they go to school to come home, do homework, eat dinner and then sleep again to repeat the next day.\r\n\r\nChildren are only young and all the added stress isn't good for them. I think it would be better to get rid of/minimise homework therefore the stress and pressure.\r\n\r\nThe action I would like the government to take is to put a limit on how much homework school's can give kids.",
