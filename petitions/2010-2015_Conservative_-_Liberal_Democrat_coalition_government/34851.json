        "additional_details": "The currently excessive societal focus on the \"body beautiful\" is shallow, narcissistic, and ultimately damaging. People should be valued as they are - a range of shapes, sizes and colours. In recognition of this, we, the undersigned, ask that the Government:\r\n1. Ban all unnecessary (i.e. vanity induced) cosmetic surgery procedures on the NHS - there are patients (e.g. burns victims) who require these resources far more urgently.\r\n2. Ban the prescribing of \"diet pills\" and other such aids on the NHS - they do not address the underlying causes of obesity, and are therefore a dangerous \"panacea\" offering false hope of lifelong slimness.\r\n3. Ban all \"remedial\" cosmetic surgery on the NHS for patients who originally went privately - if your private procedure went awry, it should be your responsibility PRIVATELY to remedy it.\r\nThe NHS is currently under pressure, and can well do without providing unnecessary \"care\" to people who demand it for the sake of vanity alone.
