Their efforts have been been frustrated, stymied and denied by a recalcitrant BA.\r\n\r\nIt is time the government put pressure on BA to at least allow others to Get Her Flying even if they don't have the patriotism to execute this task for themselves, for us, for the country.\r\n\r\nSee here:- http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2011/12/undercover-engineers-the-resurrection-of-concorde/\r\n\r\nThe will is there, apparently others such as Richard Branson have expressed interest in bringing Concorde back but have been rebuffed. Who knows what might happen if BA see's what interest she stirs up.",
