        "additional_details": "Why are savers and pensioners still being penalised with low interest rates when the policy of having low interest rates has clearly failed to stimulate economic growth in this county. This mis-guiden policy plus the low exchange rate for the pound sterling (another failed policy) against the euro makes leaving this country economically impossible. The government and the Bank of England are supporting those imprudent people that borrowed too much, saved too little and live in housing they cannot really afford. I think when or if this country becomes financially stable again many people will never forgive the present government or BoE for what is happening.\r\n\r\nIt surely now is time to raise interest rates and the exchange rate with the Euro in particular",
