        "action": "BAN HALAL AND KOSHER SLAUGHTER IN THE UK",
        "additional_details": "Under UK law, all farmed animals have to be stunned to render them unconscious before their throats are cut. However, a special legal exemption (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/731/contents/made#sdiv12) which applies ONLY to Halal and Kosher slaughter, means that animals slaughtered, \u201cby a religious method\u201d for halal or kosher meat - are exempt. We believe that on animal cruelty grounds, that this exemption should be removed. This not racist, is not anti Muslim or anti Jewish. It is concerned over animal welfare in the UK.\r\nThese animals suffer prolonged and cruel deaths, after their throat is cut they are then hoisted up on hooks whilst still fully concious until they bleed to death. Large animals can take up to 10 minutes to die. I recently watched a video online which shows animals throats being cut and while still concious being skinned alive, put in large machines and beheaded in an inhumane and cruel manner. Please sign this petition and pass it on!\r\n\r\n\r\n",
