        "additional_details": "Sentencing according to productivity offsets prison costs and can secure a national profit, since labour costs are free.\r\n\r\nPrisoners work off their debt providing free labour. Productive prisoners work off their sentences faster than non-productive ones but minimum time terms can be set by the courts. Prisoners get no monetary reward for labour but it should be mentally and physically healthy.\r\n\r\nPrisoners can collect litter, dig holes for fencing, dig fields, produce and harvest food, sort garbage for recycling, etc.\r\n\r\nCredits can also come from education but primarily from labour tasks.\r\n\r\nSome profits can go into crime victim compensation funds. Tagging and supervision ensures that prisoners do not abscond during labour outside of prison walls but tasks can be arranged within prison walls.",
