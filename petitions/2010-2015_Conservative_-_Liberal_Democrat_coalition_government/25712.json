They have big salaries with expences almost twice their salary. They get travel and accomodation free. They employ family members without question swelling their financial pot at taxpayers expense. A dictatorship is a good description because there is no accountability to anyone for whatever they choose to do.\r\nIt is a self serving and egotistic organisation which has brought many countries to its knees.\r\nI think and believe that all those Eurorats should skuttle back to their own countries, bring back their own currency and listen to what the people want and need. It is time we got rid of all this uncertainty,lifted the shroud of fear that has embedded the whole nation. It is such a bizarre situation, they are behaving like Gods making up rules and laws as they go along. Power and control has gone to their heads, it is like an addiction, they cant stop.    ",
