        "additional_details": "Walkers can use 100% of the rights of  way system in Wales. Cyclists have their  own routes and can also use those that  are open to horses.\r\n\r\nAccess for horse riders and carriage  drivers is a different matter altogether.\r\nThere are 33,000km of public rights  of way in Wales, In Flintshire, : just 10% of the network is open  to riders. And much of that flows into  footpaths which cannot be used even to  lead a horse from the ground.\r\n\r\nAs a result, riders are forced back on  to dangerous roads. I am sure most  motorists and  tax payers would prefer  to have horse riders off the roads.\r\n\r\nQuoted from :\r\nThe British Horse Society's Flintshire access officer Vera Derby speaking to the daily post.\r\nhttp://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/local-news/opinion-riding-risky-without-having-7260200#.U-IhnQJ5UlI.facebook",
