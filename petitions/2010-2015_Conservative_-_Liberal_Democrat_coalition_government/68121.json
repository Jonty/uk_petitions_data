        "additional_details": "At present there are no funds set aside each year to repair and maintain the graves of British service personnel who have died on active service in the various wars and campaigns before World War I. The result of this is that ALL of these graves/cemeteries/memorials are falling into disrepair. In Crimea particularly, the assorted cemeteries and memorials are all beginning to crumble, are defaced and need to be tended and tidied. This petition has been set up to bring this matter to the Government's attention and respectfully require the said Government to make provision for the repair and upkeep of these places of honour. These men and women died for this Country so it is our duty to respect and honour them.",
