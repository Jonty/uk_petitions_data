        "additional_details": "Would like the government to look into why travel insurance companies make it difficult for people over 65 to get reasonable travel insurance with treatable health problems and yet they are able to work full time if they choose. Many over 65's are now going abroad without adequate travel insurance, because the premiums are far too high or they are unable to get travel insurance because of their disclosures.  Meanwhile many go away not knowing they have health issues and are able to get cover. I feel this is one area the aged population are being discriminated against. ",
