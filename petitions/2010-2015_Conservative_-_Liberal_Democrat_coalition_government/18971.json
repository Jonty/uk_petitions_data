        "additional_details": "We need to bring in legislation to heavily fine Construction companies that feel they have the right to withhold contractors payments which are rightly owed once work is completed. What other industry is allowed to get away with not paying for work that has been actioned as per contract yet use every trick in the book not to pay??. By not paying the contractors, in turn means they can not then pay their sub-contractors which then puts those people out of work thus putting yet a greater strain on our benefits system. This is a loophole that now has to stop as it is putting hardworking trades out of work yet we seem to be the only country that allows this to happen.  ",
