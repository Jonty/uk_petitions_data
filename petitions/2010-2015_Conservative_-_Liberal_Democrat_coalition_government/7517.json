        "additional_details": "Bring back the use of water cannon to control rioting groups and looters.  Emergency service personnel should not be harmed or attacked, our communities should not be decimated.  Particularly if personnel are being attacked, or if the situation demands, we should bring in the use of non-lethal alternatives (e.g baton rounds - known as rubber bullets), and other more 'forceful' response techniques used by our European partners.  Individuals considering engaging in these activities should be aware of the level of response they will experience - and this should be enough to effectively deter them. ",
