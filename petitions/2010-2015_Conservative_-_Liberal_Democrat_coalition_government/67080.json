Many thousands of Innocent Palestines are dying at the hands of the Isreali military. Despiration of Palestinian people by Isreal is fueling unaccetable acts of revenage on innocent Isreali's.  We as British citizens should help put pressure on the Government of Isreal to stop military action on Palestinian Land and it's people and to remind both sides that we are born with tongues and not guns, dialogue and greater understanding is needed to stop innocent lives from being lost.",
