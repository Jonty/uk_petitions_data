        "additional_details": "Defra Is negligent in using the AWA 2006 act to protect livestock This act clearly states animals will not be made distressed, harmed or mutilated  The United Kingdom is a Christian country the AWA act is not perfect but its the best foundation to protect livestock. Halal is not acceptable in the UK and this must be stopped immediately. The Defra department is very lame in its duty to the UK and to animal lovers The Defra AWA 2006 is not being enforced by the proper officials. Halal cannot be condoned in the UK. I am not interested in whether or not meat Is labelled halal or not No creature of God should endure a Halal process nor be displayed in packaging as undergoing a Halal process. Defra Is to do the Christian duty of the UK and abide by that set and abide by the DEFRA AWA 2006 to stop Halal killings NOW of any animal in the UK.",
