        "additional_details": "I think that with the amount of traffic on todays roads, the government needs to take action and do all it can to make the roads a safer place. One way that I can see them making a difference is by making it compulsory to put your lights on when it's raining, foggy etc.\r\nOver the past weeks with the torrential rain, I have noticed lots of drivers on the motorway with no lights on, they are almost invisible. I was taught by a good instructor who said, \u201cif your wipers go on, your lights go on too\u201d, very simple premise, but one that millions of road users seem oblivious to.\r\nI would like to see a law put in place that:\r\nMakes it illegal to drive in the rain (especially on fast roads) without ANY lights on the vehicle.\r\nMakes it compulsory for new cars have lights on all the time (like VOLVO).\r\nI see no NEGATIVE side to my argument and I personally believe that this could make our roads safer.\r\nSigning  this bill will make YOUR roads safer for YOU and YOUR families.",
