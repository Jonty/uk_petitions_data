        "additional_details": "Currently councils are telling tenants who have not paid rent or are at the end of their lease to not vacate a property until they are evicted in order for the council to rehouse them. This applies to families with young children.\r\nThe local councils will not rehome until the people are physically evicted costing the landlord \u00a31,000's in legal fee's and unpaid rent. In the meantime they will give the squaters housing benefit and not enforce it is paid to the tenant, in effect benefit fraud by the tenant. As it stands the council will not pursue the issue but just rehome the tenant on eviction by baliffs.\r\nThis petition is for all home owners, landlords and anyone who pays taxes to the local council for them to be mis-used in this shocking this way.",
