        "additional_details": "I would like to see a law passed which demands transparency of language and contracts of organisations who deal with the public - such as banks. Banks are able to use language by confusion and ommission to garner agreement to underhanded and self-serving contracts with customers. The majority of the population arent business-minded or business-savvy so the way these organisations manipulate language to skew meaning alienates most folk. Pass a law that requires the language of each contract or business agreement presented to the public to be tailored towards the most simple-minded of society. That way, no one will be taken advantage of by money-making corporations. Or, at least, the folk will have a fighting chance of fairness.",
