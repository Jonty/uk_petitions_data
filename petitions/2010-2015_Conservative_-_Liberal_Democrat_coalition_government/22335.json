        "additional_details": "The Parliamentary website (www.parliament.uk) includes the following with regard to the new European Union Act: 2011.\r\n\r\n\"Summary of the Bill\r\n\r\nA Bill to apply the terms of the European Union Act 2011 such as to require approval by Act of Parliament and by referendum of provisions for creating a fiscal union or economic governance within the Eurozone.\".\r\n\r\nAny treaty to bring about fiscal union of the Eurozone countries will significantly affect the Sovereignty of the  UK because such a Union would create a voting bloc that would defeat any proposal from those outside the bloc.  Such a situation would remove any semblance of democracy within the EU as the Eurozone Treaties would legally be able to pass any legislation it requires without concern to other Member States.\r\n\r\nThis fiscal union treaty must require the Government to hold a referendum under the terms of the EU Act before the treaty occurs.",
