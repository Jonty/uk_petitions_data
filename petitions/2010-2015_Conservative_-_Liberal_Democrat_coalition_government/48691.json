Harold Wilson won four. There were no grand costly funerals on the deaths of Attlee, Macmillan, Wilson, Heath and Callaghan. So why treat Margaret Thatcher differently?\r\nThe fact that she was a women should make no difference. Women have been striving for equality for decades, and rightly so. But not to be treated more favourably than their male counterparts.\r\nThere can be no justification for an extravagant funeral for Mrs. Thatcher, on a par with Princess Diana and the Queen Mother. She is not royalty.\r\nThe country cannot afford this grand event with the huge security costs. ",
