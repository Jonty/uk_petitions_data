        "action": "Protect UK Kit Car Manufacturers from the ERR Bill",
        "additional_details": "The Enterprise and Regulatory Reform bill (S.65), currently going through parliament, proposes to repeal S52 of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act.  This would have the effect of increasing the term of protection for many industrial designs from 25 to 70+ years.  This would enable major car companies to stop replica or 'kit' car manufacturers from making copies of cars in which in reality the original manufacturers have no real interest (they are no longer made) and will put the entire kit car industry out of business.  It is notable that such manufacturers do not exist at all on much of the continent for precisely this reason.  As the ERR bill is supposed to aid in UK economy/business, this aspect of the bill must not be allowed to pass.  Petitioners request that Parliament does not pass this aspect of the bill, or in turn must repeal it if it does pass.  Thank you.",
