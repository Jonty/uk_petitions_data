        "additional_details": "We often hear about people being charged thousands of pounds because they went over their limits on mobile phone calls or mobile broadband usage. We need a new law which will force all mobile phone providers to give customers an option to limit the amount they can spend in one month. This is especially important for parents as it would allow them to limit the potential costs associated with giving their children mobile phones.",
