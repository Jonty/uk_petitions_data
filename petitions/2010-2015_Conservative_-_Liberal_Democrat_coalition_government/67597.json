        "additional_details": "We, as the non FAC shooting community and Airgun Manufacturers would request that the home office would publish and standardise the testing procedure for the muzzle energy of airguns, that we may better abide by the current UK law as regards non FAC muzzle energy. Recent trends in gimmick ammunition to claim high velocities for mainly US marketing mean that its extremely difficult to keep up with the latest pellet products....a set, commonly available pellet in each calibre could be suggested and an median average over five shots, allowing the airgun manufacturers and end users to replicate the testing benchmark.",
