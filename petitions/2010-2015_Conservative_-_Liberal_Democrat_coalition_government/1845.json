        "additional_details": "Students should not have to pay \u00a39000 pounds per year in order to make up for the \"lack of funds\" that the government has to pay for students' education, especially when students of this generation did not affect the money troubles that this country suffers today. They should not have to compensate for that. Liberal Democrats said that they would say no to the increase of tuition fees but surprisingly they did not follow through. Ergo something must be done as \u00a39000 per year with added accommodation fees is a lot of money for students to be in debt with. ",
