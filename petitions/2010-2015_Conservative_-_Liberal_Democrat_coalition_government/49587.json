I wish the government to put into effect a ruling that the radio must limit the amount of songs played in a certain amount of time. For example during working hours.\r\n\r\nWe all play our licence fee and for BBC radio to play the same songs over and over again is ridiculous. It seems the radio dj job has become the easiest job in the world and it's about time they earned their money.\r\n\r\nSo come on, join the petition and lets get the radio back to the service we pay for.\r\nThanks",
