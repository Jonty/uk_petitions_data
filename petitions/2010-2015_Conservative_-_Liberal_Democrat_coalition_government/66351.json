        "additional_details": "With the untimely death of Rik Mayall, an icon to thousands in the UK and around the world we feel that it is of the utmost importance to have lasting memorial to Rik. Therefore we are asking for a bench to be placed in the location of Hammersmith, as close to the location of where the intro scenes for one of his most fantastic shows 'Bottom' were filmed. We, the Rik Mayall fans & friends need somewhere where we can permanently remember him, somewhere to pay our respects. Rik gave so much to this nation, he had an impact on so many lives. Let us now honour all that he gave us.",
