Currently employers in non-statutory settings receive \u00a328 per student which will be cut to \u00a320 per student. This means many non-statutory placements (such as The Sweet Project in South Birmingham who will lose a third of their income) may have to close, meaning students will either have insufficient placement opportunities or no placement at all. It additionally means that the support provided for the most deprived areas of the country will lose the vital support they need. ",
