        "additional_details": "We the undersigned, call for the government to stop spending millions on translators for services like the NHS. Those people who are not prepared to speak or learn English should not be provided with a means of translation which costs the taxpayer. This is England and we speak English, we shouldn\u2019t have to pay for other people not to learn or understand the basic principle of communication within this country.\r\n\r\nAccording to figures from the NHS, they spend an estimated \u00a322 million on translators in 2010 alone. This money could be used to provide thousands of extra nurses in overstretched hospitals.\r\n\r\nIt's time we got rid of the softy softy approach and made people who wish to use our services at least have a basic understanding of English.",
