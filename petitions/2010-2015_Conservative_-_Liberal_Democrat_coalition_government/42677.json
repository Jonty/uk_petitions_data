It doesn't even make sense to anyone who can see this for what it is. Just in case you don't know why it makes no sense heres why.\r\n\r\nPeople in government are always getting found out to be breaking the law and if they control the press then they will be able to break the rules even more than they do now and cover up anything they want. Just look at Jimmy Saville and the pedo-ring the press has uncovered and how little the government has to say on it. These evil people are sick and your giving them the power to keep this type of stuff going on.\r\n\r\nUNDERSTAND why they want this to go through now?\r\n\r\nDON'T LET OUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH BE TAKEN AWAY!\r\n\r\nIf your doing your job properly and fairly then you have nothing to worry about.",
