        "additional_details": "MHS currently have the exclusive contract to provide maintenance to the Armed Forces Married Quarters in England and Wales on a 7 year term.  Their Facebook page is filled with complaints and from personal experience they routinely fail miserably to effect even the simplest repair on the first visit.  Formal complaints to MHS appear to have little or no effect and they seem completely indifferent to the additional stress their incompetence causes Service Families.\r\n\r\nSign this petition to demand an end to the MHS contract and our misery.
