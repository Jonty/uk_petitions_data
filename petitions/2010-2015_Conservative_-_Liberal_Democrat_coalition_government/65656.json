        "additional_details": "The Access to Lullingstone Golf course bridleways entails crossing the M25 over a bridge, the parapets are currently set at 1 metre high. by law a bridge which leads to a bridleway should be raised to 3 metres, the highways agency refuse to do this as Lullingstone is not deemed a designated bridleway... vehicles use this bridge too and lorries on the M25 below have been known to beep thus frightening the horses.... it wont be long until we are dealing with a serious accident for both Horse ans rider and road users on the M25\r\n",
