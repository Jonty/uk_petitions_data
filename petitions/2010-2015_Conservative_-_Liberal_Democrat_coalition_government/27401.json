        "additional_details": "If MPs pay were cut to only 42476 pounds each per year then they would automatically, under current proposals, lose their right to child benefit (no matter how many children they had in the family home!!), as well as completely changing the current debates on payments for siblings going to university and so on. Being paid in excess of 65000 is too far away from the 'cliff edge' that they are creating for the 'squeezed middle'. If put in the same position they would rapidly change a whole host of policies that now afflict us!",
