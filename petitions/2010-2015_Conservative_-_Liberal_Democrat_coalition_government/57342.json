        "additional_details": "The Mayor of London's London plan has designated various sites in Park Royal for new waste disposal dump.  There are already two sites in NW10 causing numerous problems to residents.\r\n\r\nWe want the Government to urge the Mayor of London to reconsider re-siting these dumps out on land where there are no residents living nearby.  We think it should be against human rights to put numerous waste sites in one area.  Park Royal has changed in nature and is not just industrial.  They are building more flats and student accomodation and residents and their children need to be able to breath clean, fresh air.  ",
