        "additional_details": "It has been highlighted recently by the Labour Party the need for more nursing staff. They believe the UK needs 20,000 more nurses to fill vacancies.\r\nHospitals across the UK are currently attempting to recruit from abroad yet again.\r\nThere are thousands of qualified nurses in the UK who would like to work. However child care costs are often more than our wage.\r\nAs an example, I have 3 children under 4, to put them in childcare for 8 hours 2 days per week, this costs \u00a31200. I would have to work 2 12 hour shifts just to break even.\r\nIf childcare was provided free for nursing staff, I am confident that many nurses who cannot afford to return to work, would definitely return.\r\nThe high cost  of childcare is having a real impact on nursing numbers in the UK and this should not be ignored.",
