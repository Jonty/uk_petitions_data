        "additional_details": "This petition asks the Sports Minister to request that the RFU sack Rob Andrew with immidiate effect.\r\n\r\nFollowing the almost farcical World Cup campaign and the subsequent fallout, we call on Rob Andrew to save the RFU and English rugby any further embarrassment and resign from his position with immediate effect.\r\n\r\nVery few, if any people know what his exact role is, he appears to answer to nobody but himself and has enabled one of English rugby's true heroes to have his reputation diminished by appointing him England team manager, whilst fully in the knowledge that he had none of the experience required for the role.\r\n\r\nOnce this happens then English rugby will be in a position to appoint a manager and with a coaching pedigree which will enable the country to do itself proud when the World Cup reaches these shores in 2015.\r\n\r\n",
