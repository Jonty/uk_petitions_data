        "action": "Move Government Departments to the Regions",
        "additional_details": "In this age of modern electronic communications there is no need for Government Departments to be based in a small area of central London.\r\n\r\nDoing so actually costs the taxpayers billions of pounds in extra funding of Civil Service weighted salaries and higher real estate costs.  It also places government at greater risk from terrorist or conventional military attack - one attack on a small area could effectively 'decapitate' British government.\r\n\r\nMoving departments out into the regions not only solves these problems but would also stimulate economic growth in those regions rather than subsidising an already successful London.  It would arguably also lead to better informed decision making within government for the benefit of the whole UK.",
