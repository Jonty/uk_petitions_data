We wouldn't allow our children to drink anti-freeze/screen wash, so please make some changes to help save our fur-babies too!\r\n\r\nThe Veterinary Poisons Information Service, reveal the most common cause of death in more than 200,000 animals on its database is Ethylene Glycol poisoning the deadly ingredient in antifreeze. Ethylene Glycol used in anti-freeze & screen wash products has a sweet smell & taste, that entices cats, dogs & other small mammals in the countryside making it more likely for them to ingest it. According to The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration it estimates that as little as a teaspoon can kill a cat & a small desert spoon can kill a dog!\r\n\r\nRegulations must change to allow manufacturers of anti-freeze/screen wash products to add supplementary information & labelling to show how toxic the product is to small animals.\r\n\r\n",
