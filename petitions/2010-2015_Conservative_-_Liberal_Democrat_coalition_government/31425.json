This could include not being made to 'slop out', and having the right to vote - it is their country, too!\r\n\r\nPlease take your time to think about this issue, and sign this petition, and hopefully we can change the way prisoners are being treated for the better. Our ultimate goal is to try and gain your support, and raise awareness about the issue, and expose the facts and the real truth about prisoners\u2019 rights to the general public, and hopefully bring the issue up in Parliament, and make the government:\r\n1) Reconsider giving prisoners the right to vote\r\n2) Treat prisoners more like citizens of the UK.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",
