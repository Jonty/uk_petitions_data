        "action": "Add military status to the Equality Act 2010",
        "additional_details": "Currently, members of the armed forces have no legal protection from discrimination with regard to their profession under any law in the UK.\r\nThe Armed Forces Covenant stopped short of granting legal protection, instead championing a \u2018nationwide moral obligation\u2019 to support the men and women who make up our military.\r\nBy including military status within the Equality Act alongside other characteristics including disability, sexual orientation and maternity/paternity, no longer will organisations, service providers and businesses be able to discriminate against members of the armed forces. This petition says it isn\u2019t enough to ask the nation to have a moral obligation, what is required is a law which ensures an obligation to not treat people in the military less favourably in British society.\r\nThis petition calls on the government to add military status to the Equality Act of 2010.",
