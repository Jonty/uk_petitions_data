        "additional_details": "Drunk people cause the NHS many problems with aggressive behaviour and abuse which our NHS staff need to deal with on a regular basis. Charging \u00a350 for treating drunk patients (over the drink drive limit) would reduce the number of ambulance calls and drunk patients in our hospitals by delaying the non urgent drunk injuries from attending A&E until they have sobered up (the morning after). A charge of \u00a350 is similar to the cost of a night out drinking and therefore not enough to stop a patient from receiving treatment if required but is enough to help people to question whether or not their immediate treatment is necessary. This could help our hospitals and our NHS staff deserve some help. ",
