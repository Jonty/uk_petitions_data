        "additional_details": "We belive the Flora advert to be a mild case of pornography and inappropriate to be witnessed by young, vulnerable viewers. It is damaging for children's innocence, placing wrong ideas in thier heads. What is wrestling these days? Not sex. Do we want the younger generations to be fed sexual content, fuelling their urges, thus increasing the risk of underage pregnancy.\r\n\r\nIt's time to change. We expected more from a family targeted advert. All we ask, is that you consider moving the advert after the watershed to prevent corrupting the lives of our young ones, nothing much.",
