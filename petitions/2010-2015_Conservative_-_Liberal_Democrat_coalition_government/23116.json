        "additional_details": "Small villages and rural enclaves of towns (like Holdenhurst Village, Bournemouth) are being left out of the faster fibre optic broadband roll out.  In many of these cases, the broadband is painfully slow, erratic or even non existent.  The residents of these places are very often reliant on internet, some being housebound, particularly in bad weather.  BT states that it is not cost effective to roll out to these areas and the lines are so long that everyone else before the village use up the bandwith and speed.  Often the cables are above ground and need replacing.  Such areas should be entitled to the same service as everywhere else.  Often, 2 miles away from the rural area up to 100meg is available.  This has to be a government priority, particularly as local transport is negligible.",
