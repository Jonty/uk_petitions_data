        "additional_details": "Much has been made of the need to raise age thresholds because people are living longer and staying fitter. Amid all this driving licences continue to expire, and require renewal, at age 70. This limit was set for paper licences in 1971, and carried through to the paper half of the current licence, in 1998. After 41 years it is time to raise this limit, and save some bureaucracy and public money. I therefore petition that the limit be raised to 80 years renewable every three years after that.",
