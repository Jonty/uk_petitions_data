Raise the age of leaving foster care until 25, with no pay cuts, no excuses. This will save on a vast amount of services I.e teenage pregnancies, court cases, Y.O.I, probation services. If Y/P know they have a stable home they are less likely to commit a crime, to abscond, to become pregnant at such a young age. Please help out next generation.",
