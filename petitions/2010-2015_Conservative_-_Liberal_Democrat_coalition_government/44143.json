It causes many hours of confusion and laughter when a man who is as cultured as James turns up to work dressed as Jimmy Saville.\r\n\r\nJames is a talented musician and is well respected in the local music scene but enough is enough, can we please return to the multi coloured jumpers and brown wild west boots with immediate effect.",
