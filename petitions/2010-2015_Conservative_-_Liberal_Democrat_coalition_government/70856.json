He is godfather to my sons and for the past year he has been held in India , the majority in squalid conditions. Is only crime and that of the other men also being held was doing a job to provide a better life for his family. They patrolled the waters where needed against piracy. They were taken into custody over a year ago on terrorism charges amongst other things. He has served his country and the country are failing him . I want the government to step in and bring them home.  They have said they cannot interfere in judicial process but there is none in India. If we treated anyone the way they have been treated there would be uproar.  The company they work for have not paid them for the past year. Please please help end this nightmare x",
