There are pictures circulating of abused, sick and even dead children with captions similar to 'like if your against child abuse' or 'like this and Facebook will give x amount for every like to this charity' (which I doubt!) these pictures are exhibitionism of injured, sick, abused, deceased children which myself and many of my friends find disturbing, some of my friends have witnessed a home video of a young baby being abused which is being posted on Facebook in particular! They have understandably found this extremely distressing and have reported it to Facebook however it should not have been posted in the first place as it has quite obviously caused extreme distress to people which wouldn't of happened if such things were moderated BEFORE going public! This needs to stop!",

In the UK we support a self-regulatory model for the Internet industry and any Government intervention has to be light touch, very fast, proportionate and effective.  Legislation can rarely adapt and change quickly enough.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of the UK ISP industry takes a responsible approach to what content it hosts, both of its own volition and in co-operation with law enforcement and Government agencies.  Where the industry is advised that content they host contravenes legislation, they will readily remove it.  In addition, ISPs have contracts with their customers called good practice Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs), which they have recently strengthened, about what may be hosted on their servers.\r\n\r\nFacebook has guidelines on Prohibited Conduct and User Content that users must agree to before subscribing to the service.  Subscribers agree that they will not submit user content that is \u201cthreatening, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or that depicts nudity, pornography or graphic or gratuitous violence, or anything else that we may consider offensive.\u201d\r\n\r\nFacebook is a member of UKCCIS."
