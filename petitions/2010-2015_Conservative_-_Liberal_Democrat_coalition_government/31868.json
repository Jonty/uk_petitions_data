        "additional_details": "I want the government to set a threshold for Child Benefit based on whole family income, using the Tax Credit system. Under current proposals, claimants with a family income of \u00a360,000 (from one parent) will lose their benefit, while other claimants with a family income (from two parents earning \u00a350,000 each) of \u00a3100,000 will keep their benefit. There is already a mechanism for assessing whole family income (Tax Credit system). I want the government to use this system to assess family income. This will ensure that children, and spouses, are not discriminated against based on a single, successful individual in their family. This will ensure that all families, and children, are treated equally.",
