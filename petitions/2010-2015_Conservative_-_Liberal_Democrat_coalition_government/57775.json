        "additional_details": "Reopen the bus stop at Marshgate Lane!\r\n\r\nAll bus stops on Stratford High Street were replaced during the construction of a cycle path network in October with passenger islands built so that people could access the buses safely. However, the bus stop in Marshgate Lane remains closed at present as no island has yet been built even though all other stops have now been completed and reopened. Therefore we request that a passenger island is built and the bus stop reopened as soon as possible. This will enable local residents and people with mobility problems to resume access to their local bus stop.",
