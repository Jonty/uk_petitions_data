        "additional_details": "The rise of uninsured motorists in the uk costs the uk insurance market in excess of \u00a3400 million pounds annually. This additional cost is passed from the insurance companies to responsible motorists.\r\n\r\nIn light of the recent 1 millionth car being crushed resulting from the scheme targeting uninsured drivers in 2005, the government should use this momentum to increase the campaign to eliminate uninsured drivers from britains roads, thus reducing the extortionate financial burden of motor insurance to responsible road users.\r\n\r\nThe police should be more accountable, as enforcers of the law, in tackling an issue that affects the majority of households in the uk. Tackling this issue would reduce insurance premiums and remove any financial excuses uninsured drivers may use.",
