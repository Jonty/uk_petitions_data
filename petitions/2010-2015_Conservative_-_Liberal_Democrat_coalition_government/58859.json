        "additional_details": "It has been recommended by the government think tank 'Policy Exchange' that modernised versions of the police box be brought back as police stations have fewer visits.\r\n\r\nTechnologically enabled police contact points with two-way audio-visual technology where members of the public would be able to report crime and anti-social behaviour from the new boxes,\r\nThey could be sited in shopping centres and any other locations where the public spend a lot of time. The project could be funded by closing down out-of-date police stations.\r\n\r\nSuch places could also be safe havens for people in trouble and first aid stations in case of emergency, as well as obvious CCTV points for use as a deterrent against anti social behaviour and crime.",
