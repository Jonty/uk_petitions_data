        "additional_details": "In these times of austerity, cut backs and budget reductions is it not time now for the government to prove 'we are all in this together' and take a 15-20% cut in their salary in line with wage cuts and reduction in working hours that hundreds of thousands of the electorate who work in the private sector have had to do in the last 5 years in order to retain their jobs and keep businesses afloat.\r\nA basic MP's wage is in excess of \u00a365.000 and with more than 600 MP's a 15% cut would reduce the cost to the taxpayer of at least \u00a35.5 million and a 20% cut would reduce cost to taxpayer of at least \u00a37.8 million.  No excuses about MP's can't afford it, the electorate have had no choice we have had to afford the reduction in salary imposed on us through no fault of our own doing.",
