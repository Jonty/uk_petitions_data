        "additional_details": "The Death Penalty is not appropriate in a modern democracy and Parliament should resist all moves to bring it back. If it is wrong for citizens to take a life, it is wrong for governments to take a life. Once executed any further evidence that comes to light to support innocence is too late and innocent people COULD be put to death. Life imprisonment for crimes such as terrorism, mass murder, child murder, war crimes etc should mean LIFE with no hope of release. Murder is murder whether carried out by an individual (or group of individuals) or a government and is WRONG.",
