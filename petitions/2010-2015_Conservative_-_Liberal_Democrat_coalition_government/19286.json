        "additional_details": "The UK government should reform the weather broadcasting system on TV channels like BBC News and Sky News. The weather broadcasting system is letting down its viewers, with its unreliable, and often wrong weather predictions, that keep on changing. The government should deal with this problem, and to introduce a Weather Channel for viewers to watch whenever they wont without having to wait every half and hour.   ",
