        "additional_details": "Is it right that we vote for a group of people who will control the country and everything about it, without them being further accountable to those of us who voted them in? It is not enough to vote them out at the next General Election; we need to ensure that the next party who take up the reigns will fairly and properly represent each one of us and our best interests. Therefore, to ensure that this is the case, we should subject MPs' pay to a referendum, with a banding system so that if the country performs well under their leadership, their pay is raised subject to referendum, and conversely, if their leadership is detrimental, they take a pay cut.",
