David Attenburough with his timeless documeneries, and other sirs who have lately been found not to be so deserving. But on a lighter note, Jim Carrey is one who brings tears of laughter to millions and deserves a chance to have his title out in the world to put the creative, energetic, crazy attitude back into mankind. Again this is not to advertise, he is already a multimillionaire, this is a petition to benefit the spirit of mankind, and if that isnt reason for a petition to be created, I don't know what is!",
