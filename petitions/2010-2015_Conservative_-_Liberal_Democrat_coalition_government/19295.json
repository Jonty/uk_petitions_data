        "additional_details": "Fluoridation is the unsafe process of adding sodium fluoride to poison tap water supplies. The same sodium fluoride added to tap water and toothpaste is used to kill rats, roaches and termites and is used as a pesticide, because it kills bugs on contact. Sodium fluoride is the main active ingredient in rat killer.\r\n\r\nFluoride is more poisonous than lead and just slightly less poisonous than arsenic. Most SODIUM fluoride added to tap water contains mercury, lead, arsenic and cadmium.\r\n\r\nFluoridation causes dental FLUOROSIS, skeletal FLUOROSIS, bone cancer in boys, Osteosarcoma, Osteoporosis, ADHD (\"lowering the IQs of our children\" according to a top neurologist commissioned to study the health effects of fluoridation), brittle bones, hip fractures, and Alzheimer's disease...\r\n\r\nIt is mass medication and goes against our human right's. Please search up 'flouride in water' for yourself and see the facts. We must make a change.",
