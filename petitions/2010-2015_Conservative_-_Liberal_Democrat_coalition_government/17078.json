        "additional_details": "I petition the government to re-instate the policy of the 1944 Education Act which called for a Tripartite structure in secondary schools. It recognised that, although children have different abilities and skills, one set of skills was no greater or more important than any other. The UK needs machinists and plumbers as much as it needs doctors and lawyers, or shopkeepers and teachers. School system must provide all students opportunities to suit their abilities. Therefore, we should: establish 3 types of schools -- academically accelerated, academic/practical, technical/vocational; re-structure Form groups so that this split takes place later - 15/16 years old; consider compulsory secondary education till the age of 18, followed by compulsory 1-year National Service.",
