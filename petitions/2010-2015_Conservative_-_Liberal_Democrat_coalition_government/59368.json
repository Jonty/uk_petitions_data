        "additional_details": "The recent passage of a bill in Nigeria criminalising homosexuality has led to gay poeple across the country being rounded up, arrested and harassed on the basis of their sexuality. A Sharia court sentenced a man to twenty lashes leaving him screaming in pain.\r\n\r\nThe law has been condemned by the British government as well as by the UN's Ban Ki-Moon, and by international human rights monitoring group Amnesty International. Given the horrible historical precedents of governments rounding up minority groups, much firmer international sanctions against Nigeria are required otherwise they will be led to believe that the West quietly tolerates this kind of horrific persecution.\r\n\r\nThe British government ought to provide refuge and asylum to any LGBT person in Nigeria affected by the law and to consider strong economic sanctions until Nigeria stops persecuting citizens on the basis of sexuality.",
