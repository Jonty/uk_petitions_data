        "action": "Reduce the cost of low energy light bulbs",
        "additional_details": "The introduction of low energy light bulbs was marketed to the general public as an environmental issue and financial good sense as, we were told they last longer and are cheaper to run.\r\n\r\nThe reality is that they do not last longer than the old fashioned filament bulbs and that they are exponentially more expensive to buy presumably due to more complex manufacture.\r\n\r\nEvery household in the UK is therefore now forced to pay more for lighting their home than they used to, because of government legislation banning the old fashioned bulb.\r\n\r\nTherefore I propose that low energy light bulbs for use in homes should be zero rated for VAT thus helping to reduce the cost and that their manufacture should be government subsidised to reduce manufacture cost and therefore reducing the sale price.",
