The message to the Government is clear:\r\n\r\nStop, don't rush - it has taken years to get this far, this needs to be victim focused.\r\n\r\nThe CSA Inquiry needs to be led independently with zero connection to the Government - only then can it be dealt with honesty and transparency.\r\n\r\nThis has to be about victims - they have to come 1st, their voices have been silent for too long.\r\n\r\nNo more cover ups! Cut the red tape or a Royal Commission is needed.  Our PM is our PM because WE put him there, our politicians too, it is time this country protected victims!\r\n\r\nNo more cover ups - INDEPENDENT\r\n\r\nLet justice mean JUSTICE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
