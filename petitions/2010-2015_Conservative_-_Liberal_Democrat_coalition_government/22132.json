The present system allows Parliamentary Parties to introduce a whip and prevent MPs voting independently.  This flies in the face of Democracy.\r\n\r\nIf this is enacted power will be taken from the Cabinet and given to MPs, legislature will have to be debated more thoroughly and Parties will be uanble to bury important topics they are afraid of or simply uninterested in addressing.\r\n\r\nPlease vote for my petition and for Democracy.",
