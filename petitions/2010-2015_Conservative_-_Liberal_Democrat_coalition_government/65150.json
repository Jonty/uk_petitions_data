        "additional_details": "Recently ive heard of far to many cases of child abuse and murder, when reading the articles about these cases I have been in total shock at how pitiful murders and abusers sentances have been!\r\nTwo recent examples are Matthew Whickens who murdered his 5 week old son , he got 6 years and 5 months in prison. Another case is Megan Mckoen who left her 3 year old alone for 20 hours for her to return and find her son had died, originally she got a maximum of 42 months in prison.\r\nI am hoping that somehow people who commit such horrific crimes will get a life sentance with no bail.\r\nOnce there pitifully amount of time in prison is over,  they have literally got away with murder.\r\nPlease sign this e-petition to show your support for child abusers and child murders to get life in prison.",
