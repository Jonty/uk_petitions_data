        "additional_details": "A High Court judge is due to decide whether to \"strike out\" a right-to-die case. Comments were posted on the Yahoo boards and the replies sum up our society's attitude to cases like this. Most said, \"yes let him die\" We shouldnt be saying \"yes let him end it\" this should be a trigger to bring in people who can improve his quality of life. For example disabled sailing centres have an amazing record of turning peoples lifes around, people without sight, mobility and mental capacity. Empower these people, dont give them the tools to finish their lives. Take a lesson from the high profile failings of our society in the PC Rathband story Give theese people hope!\r\nThe government should work on giving social services a national referral point to signpost cases where quality of life has degenerated to enable them to take part in meaningful activities with trained staff to provide challenging experiences.",
