Abolish 1p and 2p coins immediately (allow them to remain legal tender for 5 years)\r\n\r\n2. Abolish the \u00a35 note (\u00a31 and \u00a32 coins are adequate for small cash purchases)\r\n\r\n3. Make the \u00a310 out of recycled plastic and abolish the \u00a320 and \u00a350 notes to raise the cost of tax evasion, corruption and crime.\r\n\r\n4. Keep the \u00a320 and \u00a350 as legal tender for 12 months only.\r\n\r\nSensible policies for a better Britain, eh?",
