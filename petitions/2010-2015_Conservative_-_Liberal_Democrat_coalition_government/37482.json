        "additional_details": "Up until 2005, terrestrial TV had shown live coverage of England test matches. This meant that children could watch the games during the summer holidays and get interested in the sport. Then Sky acquired exclusive rights to broadcast test matches, meaning that, without paying a hefty subscription, it is impossible to watch Test cricket at all. Eventually this is likely to result in a decline in interest in cricket at grass roots level, and mean that the top level of this sport once again becomes largely the preserve of Etonians and public schoolboys. To reverse this trend, home test matches must return to the \"Crown Jewels\" of British sports events, and be shown on terrestrial TV, whilst maybe satellite channels retain the right to broadcast overseas tours and one day internationals. Our national sports are not and should not simply be about raising money.",
