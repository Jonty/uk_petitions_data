        "additional_details": "Our nation, and the world, is currently remembering and commemorating the sacrifices made by a generation 100 years ago during the First World War. As a fitting tribute to those who fell, were injured and survived, I feel we as a nation should take the time to reflect on the events of the war on the two days above. The days have been selected as they are exactly 100 years since two of the most poignant events of the war, The first day of the Battle of the Somme and of course Armistice Day.",
