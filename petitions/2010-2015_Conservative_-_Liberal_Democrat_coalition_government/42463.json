        "additional_details": "There is a growing trend for Estate Agents, loft-converters, builders, and others service providers to advertise local events on static billboards outside houses and flats in the street.\r\n\r\nThis new street furniture clutter is an eyesore and mainly advertising for the sponsor because the local event details are often much smaller and less obvious  than the details  promote the sponsor's own business.\r\n\r\nMost sponsor details  take up more than 50% of the space with self promotions, extensive branding and logos. This is not really about supporting the community or advertising a local community event it is more about advertising the sponsor and their brand. Therefore I propose a limit of 10% of the space be used for the sponsor's details.\r\n",
