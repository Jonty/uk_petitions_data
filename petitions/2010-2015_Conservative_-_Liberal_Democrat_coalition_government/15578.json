This clearly is unfair as after the extension is completed, the owners have put an additional burden on the local authorities and clearly may now have an asset worth more than the neighboring houses.\r\n\r\nIt should be easy to pass a law that states that during the planning approval process, the council tax band would be reviewed.\r\n\r\nGiven the lack of new building, the planning departments of the local authority coul undertake a review of the values street by street.\r\n",
