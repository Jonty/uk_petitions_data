        "additional_details": "Petition Parliament to ban the sale of helium in party balloons.\r\n\r\nTaken from \"Ban helium balloons this Christmas, academic warns\" by the Guardian:\r\n\r\nHelium is a non-renewable gas that is used to cool magnets in MRI scanners in hospitals. It is also mixed with oxygen to make breathing easier for ill patients and can help save new-born babies\u2019 lives.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is currently a global shortage of the gas, which cannot be synthesized. The gas has to be extracted from beneath the earth\u2019s crust and 75 per cent of the world\u2019s helium comes from the US.\r\n\r\nDr Peter Wothers warns: \u201cThe scarcity of helium is a really serious issue. I can imagine that in 50 years time our children will be saying \u2018I can\u2019t believe they used such a precious material to fill balloons\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we keep using it for non-essential things like party balloons, where we\u2019re just letting it float off into space, we could be in for some serious problems in around 30 - 50 years time. The gas is hugely valuable,\u201d.",
