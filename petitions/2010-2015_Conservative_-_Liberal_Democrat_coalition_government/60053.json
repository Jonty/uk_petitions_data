        "additional_details": "One of the biggest waste of food's is by supermarkets who dispose of tonnes fruit and vegetables that do not look in perfect condition. There is nothing at all wrong with this food, it is perfectly edible. Rather than destroy it, it should be made available for collection by charities that work for the poor and homeless, such as The Salvation Army, in order that they may distribute it as required or to use it for \"soup kitchens\" as required. Any supermarkets refusing to take part should be subject to criminal prosecution.",
