        "additional_details": "We ask the government to:\r\nSet very strict restrictions on the building of new, or conversion of old buildings (many unsuitable in size and location) into mosques in terms of numbers and location.\r\nSet a permanent limit on the number of mosques that may be built (new builds or conversions) with no exceptions.\r\nRestrictions placed on the types of buildings that may be converted into mosques to prevent the speculative purchase and subsequent retrospective planning applications that are blighting local authorities.  No more community halls, public houses, cinemas or bingo halls to be converted into mosques or other places of worship.\r\nRetrospective planning to be overhauled as it is all too often used as a get out for such developments.\r\nWe feel the above, if adopted, will save endless hours fighting applications that should never have been submitted in the first instance.\r\nPlease sign this e-petition for effective legislation on proper control of mosque developments.\r\n",
