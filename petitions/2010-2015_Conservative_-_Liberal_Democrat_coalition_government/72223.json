The rules of the show state, if a Celebrity stays in the jungle for 72 hours, they will get paid in full, this means Collins has adhered to the rules, and will therefore be paid. This is undeserved, and therefore the money should be paid to a charty, and I believe that charity should be Poppy Appeal. Thank you everyone who signs.",
