How is someone like Chris Jeffries, landlord in the Jo Yeates case supposed to carry on after having his name splashed across the press, despite being innocent. Perhaps in 100 years time, people will recognise how very unfair this was (see 'Who Do You Think You Are') - but it will be too late. In the US, a gay college student Tyler Clementi committed suicide after a college room-mate secretly filmed him having sex then streamed it online. Couldn't technological and legal procedures put in place to prevent such things recurring. In fact, it could be said there seems to be very little at all that seems to be genuinely in the public interest - perhaps the warning of an escaped 'and dangerous' prisoner on the loose. The laws guarding privacy perhaps really need examined. The people to suffer from the knowledge of Ryan Giggs's extramarital relations are his children not him.",
