        "additional_details": "There appears to be a loop-hole in guidelines re;Mortgages. Currently if you sign a joint mortgage agreement & 1 individual leaves/is forced out of the property, both individuals are equally responsible for the mortgage. This itself appears fair, however for the individual who\u2019s had to leave the property, removing their name from the mortgage can cost over \u00a36,000 & needing both parties consent.\r\nFor victims of abuse this can cause distress, financial hardship, even homelessness. There\u2019s additional stress of joint financial liability for any damage caused to the property & missed payments by the residing individual.\r\nI\u2019d like to propose the government looks at an exit strategy for people in these circumstances so they\u2019re not controlled by the perpetrator via the mortgage, with a view to setting a guideline time limit where an individual can remove their name without incurring huge legal fees, capping of fees, & without causing further distress due to the Domestic Abuse Situation.\r\n",
