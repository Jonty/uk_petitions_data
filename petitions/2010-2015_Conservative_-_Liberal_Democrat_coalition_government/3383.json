Current treatments available are limited to rest, weight loss and anti-inflammatory medication.\r\n\r\nMany non pharmacological treatments, such as Kneease, a treatment for osteoarthritic knee pain, are only available privately and not on the NHS. The government should act to add all drug free pain relief treatments to the drug tariff to make them available for all sufferers.",
