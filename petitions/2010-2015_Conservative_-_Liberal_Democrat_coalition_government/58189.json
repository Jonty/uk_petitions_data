        "additional_details": "Being a cyclist myself, I see the dangers everyday on the roads. I think it should be law that when you take your car / hgv licence test, that you should have to take a Compulsory basic training (CBT) course on a cycle on public roads. I think this would greatly decrease the number of deaths on the road for cyclists. Its ok putting cycle lanes everywhere & such but its teaching people to actually look for cyclists, which I find seems to be the main problem.",
