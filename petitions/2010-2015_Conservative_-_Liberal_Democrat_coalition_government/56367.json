        "additional_details": "I am 12 and i feel strongly that the government's decision to spend 16 billion pounds on building seven more Nuclear Power Stations in the UK is a bad idea.\r\nIt is a waste of the money that could be spent on researching safer alternatives such as Carbon Capture for fossil fuels and renewable energy.\r\nIn the mining process of Uranium and Titanium, water sources can be contaminated with radioactive waste, this is very dangerous.\r\nBuilding Nuclear Power stations will not take away carbon emissions, I accept that unlike fossil fuels they do not produce CO2, but in the building of the station they still produce a lot.\r\nThe Nuclear waste produced will last 1000s of years and has to be stored safely because exposure to radioactive waste can be deadly\r\nBecause of this I want the government to stop the building of the new Nuclear power stations planned for the UK, and instead spend the money researching safer alternatives - especially renewable energy sources and Carbon Capture and Storage.",
