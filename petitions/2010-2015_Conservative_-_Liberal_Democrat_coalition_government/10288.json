        "additional_details": "At 20%, the UK rate of VAT for hospitality is the second-most uncompetitive in Europe. Only Denmark has a more uncompetitive rate, at 21%. Many major European countries have cut the rate of VAT hospitality businesses pay to help stimulate the industry. Last year France cut the rate for restaurants and hotels to just 5%, creating thousands of jobs in the process. Support Caterer and Hotelkeeper's Slash VAT, Boost Business campaign by signing up to this e-petition, so we can get MPs to debate a reduction to 5% in this country. Caterer believes that a reduction to 5% would create thousands of jobs and help give hospitality businesses a much-needed boost.",
