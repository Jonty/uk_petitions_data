        "additional_details": "Convicted villains commit burglary, assault, public disorder and alike. Murderers, rapists and paedophiles are not included.\r\nIn the riots of August 2011, 100s committed acts of looting, assault and destroyed communities. Many were given custodial or prison sentences.\r\nYet, communities remained damaged. Tax payers paid for repairs, the courts and maintenance of prisoners. This must change.\r\nConvicted villains must pay for their damage.\r\nOur prisons are over-crowded and custodial sentences are too soft. We must put these people to work in the community.\r\nBenefits? The community gets repaired and maintained. The villain gets work \u2013 paid work to be proud of. Justice is seen to be done.\r\nSecurity? Villains would be tagged and expected to sign in by a certain time. They would wear a uniform.\r\nManagement? Migratory workers would be in decline \u2013 villains will be doing much of their work. Gang Masters would be ideal managers.\r\nGet convicted villains to pay back society. Sign up now.",
