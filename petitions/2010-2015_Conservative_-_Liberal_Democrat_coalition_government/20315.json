Even when the local authorities have enough evidence to prosecute for breaches of abatement notices they often feel they need far more evidence before they can evict or prosecute said tenants.\r\n\r\nI hereby ask that our members of parliament discuss ways in which they can make it easier for problem tenants to be dealt with. And evicted if necessary if they break noise abatement notices and continue to be abusive after official warnings have been issued.",
