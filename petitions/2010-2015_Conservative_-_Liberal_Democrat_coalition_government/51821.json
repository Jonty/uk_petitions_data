        "additional_details": "Wardens give tickets regardless as to whether an appeal would obviously work. Why not try and prevent the issuing of foolish tickets. If the warden loses an appeal which the tribunal thinks has no grounds at all, the warden should lose part of his pay. If the person in the council responsible for the appeal rejected the appeal without good reason, he should lose some pay. Since the warden and those involved in the appeal are not affected and in the tribunal it is the council not the individuals who pay costs, if an appeal is lost, there is nothing actually forcing them to actually think rationally in the future. Thus by making the individuals involved more accountable, the bother of having to go to tribunal for silly appeals will be prevented. many people do not go to tribunals and just pay their fines, because of the huge effort appealing each time. It is time the individuals involved in the issuing of the ticket without any thought is liable for the consequences.",
