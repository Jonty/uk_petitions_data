        "action": "Unpaid internships should be made illegal, and minimum wage should be the lowest payable wage in any situation",
        "additional_details": "This issue is particularly important considering the current socioeconomic climate. Unpaid so-called 'internships' are being used for slave labour from a graduate market with very low job prospects. Consequently, many jobs now expect a young person to have completed unpaid work in order to gain skills, and are reluctant to offer training on the job. Graduates with rich parents are the only ones who can afford to undergo this slave labour. At the job centre, 8-week 'internships' are now being offered by Tesco and Waitrose, with the caveat of no job offer at the end. The only way to tackle this is to make unpaid 'internships' illegal; to have strict controls over whether they can then be redressed and re-advertised as 'voluntary roles'; and to give employers an incentive not to chase slave labour. The 'minimum wage for internships' that currently applies is an uncontrolled joke. Minimum wage should mean the minimum wage payable in all situations, as it was intended to.",
