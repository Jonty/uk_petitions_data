        "additional_details": "Introduce a new set of motoring laws to reduce road accident casualties. Most penalties are for speeding. Excess speed is a contributory factor in 30% of accidents, so 70% of accidents have causes that are not controlled by our motoring legislation.\r\nFine tune penalties for speeding. Marginal infractions should incur points / fines that more accurately reflect the excess speed and road conditions and visibility.  Dont just use 3 points...<10mph over 1pt, <20 2points <30 3 points >30 6 points. Multiply by 2 if wet/icy road or HGV.\r\nUse cameras to spot mobile use. Automatic ban for 2nd offence.\r\nUse cameras to penalise tailgaiting with penalties to again reflect conditions and especially the type of vehicle offending. HGV's will cause more damage in accidents.",
