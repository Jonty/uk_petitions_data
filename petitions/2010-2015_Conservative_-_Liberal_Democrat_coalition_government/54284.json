        "additional_details": "Officially recognise the NHS Ambulance Service as an \"Emergency Service\" and fund them properly so that they may become more effective.\r\n\r\nWhy is this important?\r\n\r\nDid you know that the NHS Ambulance Service is NOT currently recognised by the Government as an \"Emergency Service\"?\r\n\r\nThe Ambulance Service is currently funded by the NHS. If the servive is unable to fulfill their \"8-minute deadline\" quota, they receive less funding.\r\n\r\nThis is a huge problem, why should Ambulance Services that are not performing to standard be penalised on funding? Surely, the NHS should fund them further to create a service that may perform better?\r\n\r\nWhy is it important? - If the Ambulance service is officially recognised as an \"Emergency Service\" the funding would come from central government rather than the NHS budget.\r\n\r\nHow would this affect you? - You would almost certainly get a better funded, better trained and better equipped ambulance service for yourself and your family.",
