        "additional_details": "The law needs to change in relation to the way it is carried out in child welfare cases. the basis of our law system is that we are inocent until proven guilty but this is not the case when it comes to child welfare cases. at present if a child says to a teacher that he has been hit by his parents or some other type of welfare issue it is reported directly to the Welfare without even asking the parents and after that the children are removed from the home and examined by a Dr. with a welfare officer present. the family home is broken up until all investigations are compleat. statistics state that 50% of these cases show the parent or parents to be innocent so for every child saved they destroy an innocent family and this is not good by anybody's standard. this needs to change because the welfare are doing more damage to children than the people they are trying to protect them from.",
