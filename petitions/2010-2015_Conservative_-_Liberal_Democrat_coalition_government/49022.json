        "additional_details": "We call on the government to relax the current trading laws under the Sunday trading act 1994.\r\n\r\nIn a time of unemployment reaching over 2.5 million and stagnant growth in the economy, relaxing this law would almost certainly create more jobs and bring more money to our economy.\r\n\r\nWith the Sunday trading act meaning that sunday working is strictly voluntary already we propose an amendment to the current legislation, allowing an increase in opening hours to stimulate the job market, whilst also keeping sunday working 'voluntary'.",
