        "additional_details": "Nobody wants to come out of work to care for a disabled child, loved one or other family member but to alot of families in this country that is their only option. Like myself, we have to decide what is more important. At the moment Carers Allowance is paid at \u00a358.45 per week, & you have to care for a minimum of 35hrs per week to be eligible and it has to be declared to other departments as taxable income. This equates to approx \u00a31.67 per hour. We are desperate to look into increasing the levels of Carers allowance and to make it a non-taxable benefit to help families and carers with their finances. We need to make it nearer a minimum wage hourly rate to compensate for the loss of earnings and the fact that the 35hrs caring isnt justified by the amount paid.",
