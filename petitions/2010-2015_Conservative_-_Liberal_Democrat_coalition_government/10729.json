When your 12 year old doesnt listen, and knows if you slap him in fatherly way, he can call the police and will be placed under police protection, then social services will pamper him and give him more pocket money than you do, and this process they call investigation will drag on months if not years, You cannot see any future for him, and taxpayer will foot the bill from bringing him up or even his criminality",
