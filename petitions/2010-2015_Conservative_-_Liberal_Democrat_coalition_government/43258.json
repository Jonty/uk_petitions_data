        "additional_details": "Multi-million pound lottery jackpots often destroy the lives of the people who win (a catalogue of unhappiness, suicides, etc has been the reality all too often).\r\n\r\nThis Petition proposes that National Lottery prizes be restructured so that jackpots are smaller, but divided amongst many more people.\r\n\r\nSo instead of paying e.g. \u00a350m to one person, pay \u00a30.5m to 100 people. This will overall bring a far better, happier result to many more people, changing their lives for the better, not unhinging them with vast wealth beyond their needs or imagination, or ability to handle.",
