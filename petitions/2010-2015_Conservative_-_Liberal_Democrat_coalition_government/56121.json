The UK currently has record numbers in fuel poverty; Old people frightened to put their heating on for fear of the cost and with a further bad winter predicted, our friends at British Gas hike up their prices by a whopping 9.2%! (This after generating 11% more profits from the previous year, another staggering 606 million pounds!).  It\u2019s time to act, it\u2019s time for a change, fat cat companies shouldn\u2019t be allowed to hold the poor to ransom.  It\u2019s time to put the customers first! NOT the greedy shareholders!\r\nAn independent review must be made of how they justify such price hikes in light of huge profits...and made very very public!",
