        "additional_details": "Myself as many people I know with mental health issues find it really difficult to access proper treatment within the services. Their issues are used against them when visiting GP or A&E departments. There is stigma, judgement and disrespect attached to the treatment of people with mental health issues. Even in recovered people the history of mental health issues is being used against the person trying to get help for either emotional or even more so the physical issues. The professionals often say: 'It's all in your head'. It has to change! The Human Rights Act 1998 Article 2 states everybody has a 'right to live' and Article 8(2) talks about protection of health and Article 14 is the Prohibition of Discrimination. Therefore, Mentally Disordered people should not be treated differently when trying to receive help and support with their health. It has to change.",
