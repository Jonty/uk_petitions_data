This is not acceptable and needs amending in view of the availability of information via the internet.\r\nThe government should not be profiting out of voters, and your name and address should be not available to publish on line, unless you opt in to their scheme.\r\nThe government should vote to change the terms of this list from opt out to opt in, or vote not to sell the information at all for the good of all voters.
