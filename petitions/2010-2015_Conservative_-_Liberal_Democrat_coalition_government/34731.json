When an appointment is required time must often be taken off work far beyond the limit of the appointment when transport is an issue.\r\n\r\nA great deal of work hours would be saved, and a great deal of personal convenience gained, if employees were permitted to optionally register to a Doctor's Surgery near their place of work or register to a Surgery near their residence.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that registering at two Surgeries at the same time is not being suggested only the option to register at the Surgery that one has the greatest ability to access.",
