Why should we have to pay again to hear them talk about what they are (or more usually what they are not) doing for the people who pay them? Appearing on the public service broadcasting system should be part of the job description for an MP.  If MPs are not happy about that they should get their leader to boost them to the Lords where they'll get 300 quid a day for just turning up and not representing anybody so they don't need to be on the telly, and give somebody else a go.",
