        "additional_details": "Scottish Government has to reinstate ILA \u00a3200 funding for all applicants under the earnings threshold irrespective of previous study. We need to ensure people are able to up skill & even change career path if necessary. ILA \u00a3200 funding helps to increase employability and keep candidates able to improve skills should they be made redundant or be employed under the increasingly popular Fixed Term Contract. University degrees can become obsolete as time lapses; we cannot expect that a person with a degree will no longer require further education. We can also not assume that they are able to afford further training.\r\nWe have wage cuts, pay freezes, increased cost of living, and childcare crippling our country. We need to protect our people by giving them the tools to help themselves. People cannot afford to pay to gain new skills. We need to help our people help themselves. Reinstate ILA funding for the future employability of our Scottish People & lifelong learning.\r\n",
