        "additional_details": "In the context of deep cuts in the budgets allowed for schools, with spending on education falling at the fastest rates since the 1950's, experienced teachers are finding that they cannot get jobs. Schools simply cannot afford their salaries. Well trained and experienced teachers are pivotal in maintaining discipline and high standards of learning in schools.  Yet the rate of unemployment in the profession is rising, but the problem is not widely publicised in the press. Some of our best teachers are taking teaching assistant jobs, some are working for employment agencies who cannot find them work either. Many highly trained teachers are simply forced to leave the profession. They have cost millions to train and to inspect. These teachers are excellent, well educated professionals. Since teachers are the most important resource in education,  money for their salaries, from NQT's to the most experienced, should be ring fenced now.",
