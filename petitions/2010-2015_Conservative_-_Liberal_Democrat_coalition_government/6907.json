        "additional_details": "Politics in this Country has often been seen as having become a popularity contest based on style and not substance. Many people in this country vote for parties without having a full understanding of the parties policies and do not know where there views fit in to the political spectrum. Therefore we feel that Politics should be taught as a subject from the beginning of secondary school education.",
