        "additional_details": "This e-petition calls for the immediate abolition of the foreign and inferior system of weights and measures known as the \"Metric System\" that is being imposed on the British people by traitor politicians in this country and their friends in the EU when the British people overall do not want it.  It also calls for the full reinstatement of the tried and tested English Imperial System as well as the eradication of mad EU \u201cdirectives\u201d that criminalise traders who wish to sell their wares in pounds and ounces instead of \"grams\" and \"kilograms\" and the insurance that road signs throughout the country continue to display distances in miles and yards and alcoholic beverages in pubs continue to be served in pints and half-pints and not changed to fit in with Continental Europe.",
