        "additional_details": "In keeping with the Iron lady's legacy, Margaret Thatcher's funeral, state or otherwise, should be funded and managed by the private sector to offer the best value and choice for end users and other stakeholders. It would be a tremendous shame to heap more burden on the poor and afflicted.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned believe that the legacy of the former PM deserves nothing less and that offering this unique opportunity is an ideal way to cut government expense and further prove the merits of liberalised economics Baroness Thatcher spearheaded.",
