Estate agents are taking advantage of Buyers/ Sellers with buyers getting gazumped/ sellers being gazundered/ losing money etc.\r\n\r\n3. Scottish laws and regulations on house buying offer more protection for both parties WE NEED some sort of regulation in the UK- please sign this petition to get this process regulated.\r\n\r\n\"In Scotland, the buyer\u2019s solicitor makes a written offer to buy and the seller\u2019s solicitor accepts it in writing. The solicitors then exchange letters, known as \u2018missives\u2019, clarifying the details and conditions of the offer and acceptance. Once the missives are concluded, you cannot be \u2018gazumped\u2019 or \u2018gazundered\u2019.\"",
