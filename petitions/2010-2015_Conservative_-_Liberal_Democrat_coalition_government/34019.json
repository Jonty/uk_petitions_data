Every single Arsenal fan despises him, mainly but not exclusively because of his dispicable behavior over the Copenhagen situation (look it up).\r\n\r\nHe contiunally slates players of our great club over twitter and goads players from other teams in the campest possible way. His pathetic \"banter\" is the most embarrassing I've ever witnessed from any human being, it has gone on too long.\r\n\r\nBasically, he doesn't deserve to call himself an Arsenal fan let alone own season tickets in the ground....\r\n\r\nBAN PIERS MORGAN",
