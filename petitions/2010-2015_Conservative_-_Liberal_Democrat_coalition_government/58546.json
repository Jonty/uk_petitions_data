        "additional_details": "This petition regards the rights of animals and how they should be equal to humans. Why should an animal be put to sleep for using their instinct by biting someone? It isnt the animals fault that he/she hasnt been raised properly causing the bad behaviour, a human is given permission to live after KILLING another human being in a cosy jail cell, with a tv? central heating? 3 meals a day and the opportunities to gain qualifications and knowledge whilst a poor, defenseless, homeless dog/cat quivers away in a cat and dog home in constant fear, it doesnt add up. These animals should not be punished for nothing, the roles should be reversed as prisoners are in these jails to be punished for a crime they have commited. Animals should have human rights. ",
