        "additional_details": "We the undersigned request that HM Government instigate a Judicial Review on the proposals to modernise the Coastguard service and close around half of the UK Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centres. In our view the plan is flawed and won't work, valuable local knowledge and situational awareness will be lost by the proposals. Despite what is being said in order to placate the public outcry, staff at existing MRCC's do NOT hold a high level of LOCAL KNOWLEDGE of their 'pair' station's area. In many cases paired station's hardly ever cover their partner station's area, if at all. We feel this in itself is grounds for a Judicial Review.",
