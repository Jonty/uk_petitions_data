We'll applaud them, sure. But we'll also support them. Armed forces day fails to go far enough.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, it is seen a a drumming call to recruit people. My suggestion is to celebrate those currently within the Forces, to applaud their bravery, to support their families. We the public respect our Forces, we support them, yet they need a day of their own, whereby the nation, no, the United Kingdom gets behind them.\r\n\r\n",
