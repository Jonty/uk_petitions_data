        "additional_details": "As part of the comprehensive spending review there are plans to cut funding to Sure Start centres thoughout the country. Sure Start centres are often located in areas of deprivation and provide a range of essential services to the local community. Examples of these include childcare, support groups and access to healthcare and professional advice. This is invaluable for people aiming to come of benefits and accessing employment\r\nHowever cuts are already starting to affect services provided. For example in Coventry childcare provision for the under 2's has been cut and there is discussion of term-time only provision. This will further limit job prospect of people who use these centres and therefore keep more in the benefit trap.\r\n",
