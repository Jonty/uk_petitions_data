        "additional_details": "A large amount of litter originates from fast food outlets and is discarded from moving vehicles. Consideration needs to be given to introduce an amendment to the Environmental Protection Act 1990, to allow local authorities to send a notice to the registered keeper of any vehicle, from which litter has been desposited. Once the name of the driver at the time the offence has been revealed, he or she should be offered a fixed penalty notice, or prosecuted.",
