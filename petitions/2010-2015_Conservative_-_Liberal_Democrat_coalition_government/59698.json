It is thought that something damages or alters certain genes in the cell. This makes the cell abnormal and multiply out of control.\r\nMany people develop oesophageal cancer for no apparent reason.\r\nMost cases in the UK are not diagnosed at an early stage  This is because symptoms do not tend to develop until the cancer is already fairly large - a cure is unlikely. Only, currently, about a quarter of people diagnosed with oesophageal cancer are still alive five years after diagnosis.\r\nNew treatments must be developed, information on the outlook needs to be improved.\r\nPlease sign up.
