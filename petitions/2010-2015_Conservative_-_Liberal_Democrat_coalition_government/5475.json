Colleges should provide compulsory work experience in the course field that the student is studying. For example, food technology students could run their own restaurant.\r\n\r\nSixth Form students must attend university if the grades are met but can leave after A-Levels if they have received an apprenticeship or full-time job.\r\n\r\nCollege students must at least have an NVQ - Level 2 before they can get an apprenticeship or a full-time job and if that isn't possible, they must get an NVQ - Level 3.
