        "additional_details": "At present, my daughter's school refuses to allow students to wear sensible, school appropriate boots for school during winter time, insisting that they wear shoes. They may go in wellies and change out of them upon arrival at school but this does not allow for crossing school grounds in the wet/snow/cold etc from lesson to lesson, or break and lunch times. School shoes are expensive and no parent should be expected to replace foot wear throughout the course of a term (except for outgrowth) just because the shoes are spoilled due to the wear and tear of weather, when a sturdy pair of boots would prevent this.",
