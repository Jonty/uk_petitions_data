Whilst we were in the hospital we received good support from the staff, however once we left the hospital this support ended. The communication between health professionals appeared non existent and specific grief counselling and support was only available after months of waiting.\r\n\r\nWe are asking that there be a coordinated package of aftercare for all bereaved parents/families with a named lead worker to work with the family from leaving the hospital.\r\n  ",
