        "additional_details": "Leaseholders across England & Wales are being persecuted by greedy commercial landlords and their legal teams together with managing agents that these commercial landlords either own or control, mainly in blocks of apartments.\r\nMany of these apartment blocks are sold on long leases typically of 250 years from councils across the country to commercial investors who buy them just to monetise these sites.\r\nWhy are our councils selling these sites to commercial outfits on long leases who then typically resell with only a 125 year lease? Why are these sites not handed over to the people that actually own the properties on completion of build to a system that is called Common Hold? Why is LEASE, a government funded organisation, set up to \u2018help\u2019 leaseholders in leasehold properties, holding seminars and conferences for landlords and managing agents to \u2018educate\u2019 them on how to bleed poor leaseholders dry?\r\nIf you have had enough of being treated in this way then please sign this petition.",
