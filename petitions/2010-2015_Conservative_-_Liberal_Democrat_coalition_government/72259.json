        "additional_details": "In order for party leaders to understand what life is like for the normal working class people in this country they should be made to live like them for 1 month.  They should be forced to live in private rented accommodation, with the monthly salalary for \u00a310k a year, pay normal monthly tax and ni, pay rent, bills, travel to work and food.  They are so far removed from normal working class people that this will be a huge awakening for them.  It is the only way they will understand the challenges most of the country faces.",
