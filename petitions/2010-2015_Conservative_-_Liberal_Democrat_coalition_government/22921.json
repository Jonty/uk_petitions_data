        "additional_details": "I propose that we should lower the amount of people needed to sign a petition in order for it to be raised in the department for communities and local government, from a hefty 100,000 people to a mere 50,000 people. My reason for this is that i feel that there are not enough petitions going to the higher up departments and so i feel that the public cannot get their views across without using a pressure group of sorts.",
