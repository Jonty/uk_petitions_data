        "additional_details": "Up to this point UK modern language teaching has focused on French and German but in reality learning these languages does not provide individuals with any significant economic benefits. Citizens of these two countries study English to a great depth out of necessity. It makes much greater economic sense for the individual and the UK economy as a whole for our children to learn Spanish, Mandarin or Russian as these languages represent significant proportions of the world population and likely future economic growth opportunities. Moving away from French and German to Spanish, Mandarin and Russian is not aimed at distancing ourselves from France and Germany diplomatically, it is instead aimed at giving our children the right skillset to succeed in the future global marketplace.",
