Currently the only way to do this is not to sign but this does not capture the public view since 90% of people may disagree and their view is not captured.\r\nWith this amendment, the enhanced petition would give a clearer view of public feeling and would avoid extreme views from seeming to have broad support.\r\nThe presentation to parliament over 100K could then be a mean after negative votes were removed.",
