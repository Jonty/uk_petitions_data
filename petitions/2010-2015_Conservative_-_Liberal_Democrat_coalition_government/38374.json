        "additional_details": "The reason for the financial crisis is quite simple; if the banks create money, then banks own money. If the banks own all the money, then the banks have all the power. The private sector has the financial system in their own hands with little control and are committing many types of legalised fraud such as 'Shadow Rehypothecation' for example.\r\n\r\nThis petition is a call for a debate on money creation with a view to tie currency to a tangible commodity rather than currency representing a debt (nothing) and to create a currency that is publicly owned.",
