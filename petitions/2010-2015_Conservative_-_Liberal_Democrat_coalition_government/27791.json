        "additional_details": "Parents of young children (0-3) should be able to take a limited number of days per year off for children's illnesses. This may be additional days or an opt-in annual-leave sacrifice scheme. With rules governing annual leave requiring long notice periods in some professions (eg. medical staff), it is very difficult for parents to take time off on the day when children are sick. Of course, safeguards against abuse of such privileges should be made similar to employees' sick leave (GP certificate if off for more than 2 days, or if same illness recurring more than twice within a 3-month period).
