        "additional_details": "I am deeply alarmed that the Government is happy to allow other countries to build Nuclear Power Plants in the UK.  I feel that it is short sighted to sell this idea as a way of creating  thousands of new jobs which would in turn benefit local economies. It is not and should not be based on financial gain. What about the long term implications.  The additional Radioactive waste that these new plants would generate, and the problem of storing this lethal material is something that should concern us all. Where I wonder is  all  our current Radioactive waste  stored.  I urge the Government to make monies available to look into the viability of Wavepower.  As an island  the potential is all around us.  Germany has abandoned its Nuclear programme so should we.",
