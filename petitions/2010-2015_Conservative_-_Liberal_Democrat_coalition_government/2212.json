        "additional_details": "In current economic times increasing numbers of people are looking to precious metals, namely gold and silver, as a store of wealth and a hedge against inflation.\r\n\r\nChina is now a huge importer of precious metals and its government is encouraging citizens to invest in these commodities by relaxing its trade restrictions. I think we need to do the same.\r\n\r\nHere in the UK, VAT isn't charged for investment gold. However, the same cannot be said for silver bullion. Please help to make silver bullion a more attractive investment for the general public by removing the VAT.",
