        "additional_details": "We petition the British government to call for the forming an International Coalition of Armed forces with at least 300,000 well equipped soldiers from the USA, England, France, Russia, China, Canada, to stop the IS with the support of countries around Syria and Iraq to act against IS and stop them destroying all that is treasured in the West. The coalition forces must be given the best and newest weaponry and every kind of military equipment; tanks, fighter planes, tactical missiles, etc. IS already have genocidally murdered people and destroyed whole communities and would destroy all of our freedoms, our scientific and medical inventions, as well as our entire recorded knowledge. England must be a leader in calling for actions against the army of the IS which now consists of around 100,000 soldiers and is growing every day.\r\nMatthew Knight\r\n(Petition by US author/filmmaker Michael Horn also calls upon the Obama administration to do the same.)",
