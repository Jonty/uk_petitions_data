        "additional_details": "It has been nearly 50 years since the UK went metric yet the road signs are still in Miles and yards. The UK is the only country to officially to country in the world to have banned metric roads signs on our roads. In Australia all road signs where changed within a month with few problems .Most in the uk don't want it because they hate change but most people would adapt soon after.  With most people in the UK learning only the metric system at school and most children don't even know how much a yard or a mile is it is time we don't sideline this issue and at least give it more publicity .
