        "additional_details": "I would like to see Legal Aid applications declined for people of wealth, ie. owning their own business, house, investment accounts Stocks and Shares and also Foreigners seeking asylum.\r\nI feel we are funding too many court cases where people can afford to pay their own cost without being a burden on the Tax payers.  I also feel that where Legal Aid is requested  to support a Court case, funds should be secured against assets, i.e. a charge on their property before Solicitors are instructed and also passports confiscated until full funds repaid.",
