        "additional_details": "Luis Suarez is not guilty of doing anything other than retaliating to Patrice Evra's taunts. The FA have decided to take a stance against Sepp Blatter over his views on racism, and make an example of Luis. The FA panel consisted of 3 people, 2 of whom sit on the board of 2 rival clubs.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to clear the name of Luis Suarez so the lad can continue his amazing career without the stigma of the FA's clearly subjective charges.",
