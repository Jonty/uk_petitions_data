        "additional_details": "People who have been diagnosed with cancer often have to survive on benefits, family, friends or SSP. Mortgages are often the largest financial commitment yet patients & families who are already faced with such emotional turmoil are often down to one income or no income and aren't supported. Many lose their homes as they struggle to keep up payments.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative the government supports patients and their families, so they can focus on treatments as well as having the space to adjust.Cancer patients/\r\nfamilies do not need to worry that their home will be threatened or that the level of family support is strained because of a mortgage.\r\n\r\nI'm asking that the government acknowledge the support needed to help cancer patients who have their own mortgage or reside with the mortgagee a two year mortgage break. Especially as this group pay their taxes into a system and deserve an act of kindness at such a difficult time.",
