        "additional_details": "The growth and projected growth in UK population has highlighted many issues.\r\nThese include:-\r\n\r\n1) Employment - We cannot currently offer full employment as there are simple not enough jobs. With growth expected to be minimal for the foreseeable future this is a problem that will worsen\r\n2) Housing - Demand far outstrips supply and the only solution is to concrete over green belt in already highly populated areas reducing the quality of life for all\r\n3) Infrastructure - Our transport systems already struggle to cope with existing population numbers and the only solution appears to be pricing people away from all forms of transport\r\n\r\nA proper debate is required to assess whether we wish to accept large scale population growth and whether we should be using the benefits system to discourage families from having larger families",
