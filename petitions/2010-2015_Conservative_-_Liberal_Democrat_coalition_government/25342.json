        "additional_details": "Any dictation from EU that is against UK's own self-interests & HMG policies should trigger a referendum under EU Act 2011. Unless it is a single democratic country like the USA or the former USSR, monetary currencies (like euro) should be open to quantitative easing, devaluation, interest rate control, taxation, economic policies by legitimate government of a sovereign country, not by a trading partner (like Germany in the EU). Likewise, EU regulations (like working time directives) dictated by EU commissioners & EU Parliament impose (at times hare-brained) obligations for the UK to comply, even if against UK's own self-interests & HMG policies. Judgments (like on human rights, prisoner voting rights) by ECJ & ECHR are precedents in UK, even in our highest court (Supreme Court). EU is a trading block between sovereign states, not requiring a constitution or common monetary system. ",
