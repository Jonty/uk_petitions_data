        "additional_details": "King George V DLR station is over 5 years old and since this time of opening the original dockside acces from the station platform to the road has yet to be commissioned and remains blocked.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to demand the Department of Transport and TFL to investigate and complete the planned access as conveyed to residents during planning stages.  Access for events has taken place to the location but this now needs to be permanent linked to KGV station.\r\n\r\nThis will benefit local residents and commuters from city airport.\r\n\r\nA 12 week consultation to gather signatures as a sample in support of an open access to the station from the traffic lights on Manor Way E16.\r\n",
