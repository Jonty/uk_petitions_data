        "additional_details": "As drugs are illegal currently I think that our politicians and bankers who make decisions that affect the good of the nation should have mandatory drug and alcohol testing. Any caught either with drugs in their system especially cocaine, or over the drink drive limit would automatically lose their position and face criminal charges. This would only apply to MPs, Lords and bankers not to the workers of this country.",
