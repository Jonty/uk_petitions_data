        "additional_details": "All convicted rioters, looters, arsonists and worse who committed these offences during the riots which broke out in Tottenham and beyond, during August 2012 should as part of any custodial sentence restore any community that has been destroyed. The damage that has been created needs to be assessed and the monetary value needs to be divided equally per head of the convicted. Every hour of unpaid work will be for the equivalent of the National minimum wage. The time will be spent restoring the communities or providing other community service until each penny has been returned to the people. This way the youths will understand the true value of money and what it is like to work for a living. ",
