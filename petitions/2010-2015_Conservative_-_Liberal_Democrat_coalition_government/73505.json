        "additional_details": "There is a fundamental issue with the train system. The privitised system does not allow competition nor choice for the majority of commuters. There is no choice but to put up with lowsy service. Making the service public would be too costly and complex, so instead government should create a structure which gives power back to train passengers. This should consider\r\n- establishment of oversight committees for each franchise which is made up of members of the public. Franchises should be accountable to this body\r\n- give this body the ability to remove a franchise if service levels are not being met\r\n- have elements of performance related pay set by this group\r\n- ensure that fare increases are also reviewed by the group\r\n\r\nThe group would be elected and would need to have responsibility to ensure that train companies are being run in line with passenger interests. It would hopefully give power back to the passengers.",
