In the UK we need our own system in place which works with the police, broadcasting companies, transport companies, and anyone else who can help active an urgent alert in child abdication cases.   You could receive an urgent alert through your phone, on tv, radio or motorway signs and help save the life of a child. I'm a patent myself and believe anything in place like this could be vital.  thank-you",
