        "additional_details": "Scarborough Hospital are wanting to close down the Midwifery-Led Unit in October 2013.\r\nThey are keeping the unit short staffed so that when a lady is wanting to give birth in a relaxed environment with little intervention, she has no choice but to go over to the labour ward which they are keeping full staffed.\r\nSo the figures are showing that no one is wanting to give birth on this gorgeous unit. Which we know is not the truth.\r\nIf this happens the nearest Mid Wife Led unit will be Middlesbrough, Hull or York which could put mothers and babies at risk!!\r\n\r\nNot only this but the midwives who work on the unit are at risk of losing their jobs. Who between them have so many years of valuable experience.\r\n\r\nPlease show your support by signing this petition and lets keep the Mid Wife Led Unit open!!",
