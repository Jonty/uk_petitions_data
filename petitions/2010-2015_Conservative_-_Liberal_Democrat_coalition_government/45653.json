        "additional_details": "We want the government to lower the abortion weeks from 24 to 20 because a baby can survive outside of the womb at 21 weeks. Therefore women that have an abortion between 21 and 24 weeks is fundamentally committing a murder. Every year in the world an estimated 40-50 million women faced with an unplanned pregnancy decide to have an abortion. This corresponds to approximately 125,000 abortions per day. ",
