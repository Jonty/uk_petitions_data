        "additional_details": "This legislation requiring rabies vaccinations for dogs travelling between all EU countries - even though both Ireland and UK are rabies free. The enforcement of this ruling will have a huge cost implication for ALL Dog Rescue Organisations in Ireland who send dogs to UK. The result will mean they will be forced to rescue fewer dogs and those fortunate enough to be rescued will have to have rabies vaccinations 21 days before they can travel. This will add a time delay between rescue and re-homing and ultimately mean that more dogs will die in Irish pounds because there was not room for them in rescue. Please do not enforce this legislation for the import of rescue dogs from Ireland to the U.K.",
