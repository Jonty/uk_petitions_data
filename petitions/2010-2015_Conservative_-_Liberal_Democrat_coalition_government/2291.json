Our present system of democracy is in no way perfect, but at least we know who the decision makers must be and therefore have the option to vote for change. The EU decision makers do not have our vote and we in turn have no recourse bar to a parliament which in turn refers to the EU. Do the members of the House of Commons represent the electorate or do they now serve the interests of the political body of the EU.  If they do serve the electorate then how can they justify usurping policies arrived at through elected members of the House of Commons and instead instigate alternate policies dictated by the political body of the European Union.
