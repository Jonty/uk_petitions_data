        "additional_details": "The aim of this petition is to encourage the Government to include Design and Technology in the EBac. This will support manufacturing industry in the UK.\r\nThe EBac places emphasis on the teaching of English, Maths, Science, Languages and Humanities in schools and colleges.  Design Technology is left out in the cold. The one area of the curriculum that encourages pupils/students of all abilities to consider design and manufacturing careers, has been dismissed or forgotten.\r\nThe EBac has already damaged Design and Technology, as it has encouraged many of our best young minds to choose EBac related subjects at GCSE. The Government is unwittingly undermining manufacturing industry in the UK. Young people should be encouraged to take Design and Technology subjects and to aim for careers in manufacturing industry. This will support manufacturing in the UK, help rebalance our economy and reduce our National Debt, giving the UK a long term economically viable future.\r\n",
