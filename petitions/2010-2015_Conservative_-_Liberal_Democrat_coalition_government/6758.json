        "additional_details": "I propose that the BBC is permitted to raise funds by allowing commercial advertising during many of its broadcasts.\r\n\r\nSome areas of the corporation, such as the BBC News channel, the BBC world service, educational programming and BBC online, would continue to be funded by a greatly reduced licence fee and run independently from the entertainment sections. This would allow the BBC to remain free of advertiser influence in its informative broadcasts while allowing light programming to be funded by advertising, rather than coerced from an often unwilling public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
