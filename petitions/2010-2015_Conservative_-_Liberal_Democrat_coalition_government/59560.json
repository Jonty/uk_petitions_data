        "action": "reducing speed on Ruthin Road, llandegla by the Crown Hotel junction",
        "additional_details": "The current speed limit on this section of Ruthin Road in Llandegla village is 60 mph. This speed limit has created great dangers and threats to residents, pedestrians, tourists and bikers along this narrow road. The area is in a medium density residential zone and the road has single lane traffic on both directions. Local residents and tourists use this road by walking or biking to the facilities including Llandegla Forestand The Crown Hotel. Unfortunately, the current high speed limit poses a grave danger to these people. For the safety of local residents as well as drivers on this road, it is important to lower the speed limit on Ruthin Road. This petition is to require for the Highways to look into this issue and hopefully to initiate the process of determining a more reasonable and safe speed limit for Ruthin Road jt. Should it be 35, 30 or even 25 mph, any reduction will greatly improve our safety and quality of life for users",
