Central to this concept lies the heart of the education system. I propose that the Government enact laws  to protect all young children in education from any harm by; (1) including \"general child-protection awareness\" classes in the national curriculum for nursery and primary school students throughout England; and (2) putting further screening mechanisms and spot-checks in place for all existing and prospective staff members working with young children.",
