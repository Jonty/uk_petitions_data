        "additional_details": "McDonalds used to have the carbohydrates on its packaging to state how much was its in its products. They however have now removed them from the wrappers. This information was good for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics so they can administer the correct amount of insulin needed to break down the carbohydrates being put into the body. Without this information being clearly stated on the packaging, too much or too little insulin could be administered resulting in either and hypoglycaemic attack or a hyperglycaemic attack. This can cause issues for the body and in some cases can lead on to be fatal if it isn't treated.\r\n\r\nSo help to get the correct information back and sign!!\r\n\r\nThank you for reading.",
