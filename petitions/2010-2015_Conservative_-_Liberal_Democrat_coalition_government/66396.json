        "additional_details": "In june 2013 i lost one of my twins to stillbirth. We were able to spend 5 days making memories as a family thanks to our hospital coldcot.\r\nThis is a mattress that can be placed in a cot to keep the babies body temperature down. However not all hospitals and maternity units have access to a coldcot.\r\nWe have set up a non profit organisation (For the Love of Harley) with the aim of helping hospitals care for bereaved parents, part of this includes allowing the families to spend much needed time with their angels and creating memories. ensuring all maternity units have a coldcot will give families this much needed opportunity, we are therfore petitioning for all uk hospitals, midwife led birth units and maternity units to be routinely supplied with a coldcot for use by bereaved families.",
