Whilst they do everything they can to help their patients, she is currently having to endure Cliff Richard's music, whilst other patients and visitors are singing along.\r\n\r\nHasn't she suffered enough?  Is it too much too ask that the ubiquitous Mr Richard be banned from all such institutions (both his music and in person)?\r\n\r\nWon't someone think of Jane?",
