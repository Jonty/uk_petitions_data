        "additional_details": "According to a recent study, 52% of fatal accidents on motorways involve HGVs, despite HGVs only making up 10% of the traffic on motorways. This is in addition to the severe disruption normally caused by any incident involving HGVs. Therefore, and in line with other EU Member States, new regulations should be created to organise or ban the presence of HGVs on the motorways during rush hour. This can be coupled with reducing taxes and charges to help minimise the influence on these businesses. ",
