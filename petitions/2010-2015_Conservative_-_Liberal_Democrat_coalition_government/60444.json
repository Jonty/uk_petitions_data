This is undermining the other teachers authority within the school. Why do we have head-boys and girls instead of head-pupils? Because the pupils do not have a person in charge of them, they do not follow one person, they work together. Why shouldn't the teachers do the same? It is taking away their freedom. The people are not ruled by one man alone, but by the people.",
