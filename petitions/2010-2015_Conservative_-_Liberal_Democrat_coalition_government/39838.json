        "action": "MAKE DECEMBER 24TH A BANK HOLIDAY",
        "additional_details": "Every year millions of workers in the UK compete with their colleagues to endeavour to have the 24th of December as one of their leave allocations for the Christmas holiday. Many working men and women are extremelly stressed and busy at this time, either preparing for family members to visit, making preparations for their children and elderly parents, or trying to travel to destinations through congested traffic and travel conditions to reach their family and friends for the holiday.\r\nI'm sure many people would be extremely relieved if the government were to allow the 24th of December to be a bank holiday, so that everyone can endeavour to prepare and enjoy their time with their family and friends.\r\nFurther, I'm sure the government would agree that, given more free time on this day, many people would continue their Christmas shopping which would, in turn, benefit the retail industry and economy.\r\n\r\nPlease help by signing this petition. Thank you.",
