        "additional_details": "The facilities at motorway services are becoming worse. The toilets are disgusting, with cubicles not locking, toilet seats broken and broken taps, showers are dirty, mouldy and smelly, either too hot or too cold or just not working and don't always have female showers. The food is terrible and the cost of parking after two hours is far too high. Also despite having cameras, in some services, parking just isn't safe, with curtains being slashed, loads being stolen.\r\nTruck drivers deserve some where clean, safe and cheap to park. ",
