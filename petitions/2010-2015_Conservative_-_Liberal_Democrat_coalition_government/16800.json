        "additional_details": "The government should forcibly purchase all suppliers of non-renewable electricity and gas to the UK, creating a single state-run organisation. This will allow the government to take greater control over pricing strategies, therefore helping us to reduce our energy consumption and avert climate change.\r\n\r\nIn the present situation, the aim of individual energy suppliers is to make as great a profit as possible, which involves selling as much energy as possible. Therefore, there is no incentive to help us cut back. We cannot continue down this path, so the only option is to create a state-run company with no profit incentive, so we can work together to the common aim of avoiding the worst effects of climate change.",
