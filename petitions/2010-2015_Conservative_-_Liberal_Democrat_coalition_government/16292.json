It is annoying that a family who has never contributed to Britiain should get so much from us without paying tax ever in their family history, where a British born and bred family who pays taxes is put last.\r\nI would like to see local authorities housing local people first over all others, also that to claim benefits in the uk you have to have been a resident for 5-10 years continuously.",
