I propose that the train companies should be obliged to provide adequate seating for the average number of 2nd class passengers on any given route. E.g. if enough 2nd class passengers take the 16:45 train from London Cannon street to Ramsgate to fill 10 cars, then SouthEastern Trains should be forced to provide 10 cars on that service at that time.",
