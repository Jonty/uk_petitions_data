People dont want  to be asked every single day as they buy  their morning paper . This country is getting morbidly obese by the minute ,some have high blood pressure others diabetes and dont want to be reminded of this all the time.This is  also  very stressful for the staff who have to ask all the time as they are monitored .PLEASE MAKE THEM STOP !!!!!",
