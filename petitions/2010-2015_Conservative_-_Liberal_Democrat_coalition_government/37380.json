        "additional_details": "Hornchurch Country park/Reserve was the Airfield for the war Heroes of WW2 airmen who fought and died for our country. They have also spent thousands turning this Park into a nature reserve for wildlife and for families and children to play meet have picnics etc  the war heroes who came form all over the UK and beyond to fight for the freedom of this country lives where lost so I would see this as chucking rubbish on the dead .This is a beautiful place and is thriving with wildlife.Respect our heroes of WW1 and WW2 and stop this from happening I served my country and the only place I feel at rest and at peace is the country park As part of our history this can not be allowed to happen RESPECT the dead and the wildlife this country needs life not death and destruction.Please find somewhere else for the dump like the old ford works which has been left and is a dump now anyway why destroy memories and nature when their is other places that can be used .",
