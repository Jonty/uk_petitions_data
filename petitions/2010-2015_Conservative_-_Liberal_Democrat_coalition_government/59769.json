        "additional_details": "In addition to some other stimuli being used by the government to facilitate speedy economic recovery, I think they should also look at  creating a virtual economic recovery zone which will not be linked to any particular geographical region.\r\nThe VERZ as it should be called should operate on the basis of allowing individuals or self employed people to voluntarily opt out of the minimum wage scheme to be able to, at least to some extent, be able to compete with China.I believe the fashion and furniture industry amongst others will benefit immensely from this arrangement.\r\nLarge companies should also be encouraged to join the zone.\r\nThe government can make use of some unclaimed lottery funds or some other unused funds to subsidise members of the scheme.Better still , the government can work out some  tax incentives to encourage individuals and companies to join in.\r\nThis could be a short term intervention or be subjected to periodic review depending on circumstances.",
