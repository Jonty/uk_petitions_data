In a world where content creation is going to be key for our economy, we need generations of people who can write applications and generate content for these applications and also the web.\r\n\r\nIt's time to cut back on showing students how to use word processors and spreadsheets, and bring them into graphic design and programming in order to innovate in the digital world.\r\n\r\nThere are projects like Arduino which can show robotics, and the up-and-coming Raspberry-Pi which can give children a specific platform for development and sharing without the worry of incompatibility.\r\n\r\nWe got something right in the '80s with the BBC Micro, and the games and technology industries that have come directly from that.\r\n\r\nLet's push it in both primary and secondary schools.",
