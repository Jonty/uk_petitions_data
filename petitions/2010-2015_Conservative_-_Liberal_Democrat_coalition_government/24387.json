The NHS is one of the biggest cost generators for this country. So i am asking you to sign this petition for me to meet with the Department of Health in order to put my ideas across. I am not a politician i am an ordinary student but isnt new and fresh ideas something we need in a time like this? People who have had experience with the NHS and know the changes that need to be made? My ideas could save millions, and isnt that what the country needs right now. The ordinary people can make a change so lets try!",
