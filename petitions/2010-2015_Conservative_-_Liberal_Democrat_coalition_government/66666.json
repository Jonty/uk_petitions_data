That includes football, rugby, athletics (where generally we do participate as GB) etc. Exceptions could be made for competitions which are primarily between the home nations (e.g. Six Nations).\r\n\r\nThe whole country could and would come together to support a UK team, in whatever sport, in a way which does not happen when England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland play separately. The Olympics was a great reminder of how this could work.\r\n\r\nThere are two benefits:\r\n- greater unity across the UK in support of UK teams\r\n- a better chance of winning (well, it couldn't be worse!)\r\n\r\nGo Team UK\r\n\r\n\r\n",
