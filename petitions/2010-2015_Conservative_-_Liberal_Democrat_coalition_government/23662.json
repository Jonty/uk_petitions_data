His over the top behavior is lewd, lecherous and offensive, especially on a family show. His drooling over male celebrities is better suited to late night TV and he should be removed from an early evening slot.",

It is important to maintain the principle of freedom of expression which political interference could undermine.\r\n\r\nOfcom, the BBC Trust and S4C are independent of the Government and responsible for safeguarding the public interest in broadcasting. They set out the rules and guidance with which broadcasters must comply.  Within this framework, it is the broadcasters\u2019 job to make judgements about what individual programmes should contain."
