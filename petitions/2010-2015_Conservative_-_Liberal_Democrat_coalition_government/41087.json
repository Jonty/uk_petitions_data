        "additional_details": "The laws around reselling Government services, such as theory test booking services or replacing European Health Insurance Cards are not tight enough, and not being properly enforced.\r\n\r\nThousands of people every year fall foul of deceptive resellers. The OFT started an investigation two years ago and nothing has been heard since.\r\n\r\nThis petition asks that the Government speeds the OFT review, or otherwise start a new investigation into the current scope and enforcement of existing laws governing the reselling of Government services.
