        "additional_details": "Currently there is no legally enforceable way for British citizens to control their government. A legally binding petition and referendum system (possibly similar to that in Switzerland) should be introduced, to allow citizens to challenge any law that parliament wishes to pass, and introduce new laws, as opposed to giving governments free reign in changing the country's laws without any legal possibility of control by citizens, which runs contrary to the principle of democracy.",
