        "additional_details": "Why should the Family home be sold to pay for care in old age. People who work hard all their lives to buy there own home, and then when they have paid for it. It's taken from them to pay for care which they have already paid into the pot all there working lives.   The family home should NOT be sold to pay for care, this is family money which should go to the children.  How can it be fair when someone who's not been  prudent get it free anyway. Government action should be: There should be a fair cap on the money that people have to pay depending on there savings.  It's the same old story people who work hard all there lives have to pay, and those who donot work still get it free. NOT ACCEPTABLE COME ON DO THE RIGHT THING FOR ONCE. ",
