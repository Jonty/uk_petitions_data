Many of them are denied BC status because they hold some sort of unwillingly \"given\" Chinese nationality. They should be entitled the FREEDOM to choose their citizenships if both Chinese and British cannot co-exist. I petition the Home Office to amend the immigration law to allow Hong Kong born BN(O) holders to gain UK citizenship if they are willing to give up their forcefully given Chinese citizenships.",
