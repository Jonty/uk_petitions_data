        "additional_details": "The nursing and medical staff of Wirral University Teaching Hospital have joined forces with local Council, in an attempt to stop the relocation of all major vascular services from Wirral to Chester.  This move would impact on the patients of Wirral by increasing the time it would take to receive treatment when emergency major vascular surgery is required, as they would need to be transferred to Chester for time-critical hospital based treatment.\r\nCurrently Wirral Hospital performs 3x more of these major operations, so more experience and skills.\r\nWe therefore want the Government to reconsider the relocation of this service and keep it in Wirral.\r\n100 000 signatures can force a parliamentry debate, time is of essence though as they are looking to move the service as early as October 2012.",
