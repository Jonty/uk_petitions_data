        "additional_details": "The Government is proposing to roll out mandatory lie detector tests for people on the sex offenders registry (http://tinyurl.com/ouahxgf).\r\n\r\nSo-called \"lie detectors\" (polygraphs) have been repeatedly shown to be unreliable and generate an enormous number of \"false positives\". There is also a risk of creating a false sense of security, as passing the test will presumably mean that the registered sex offender will not have to take other, tougher tests (otherwise, why use the lie detector?).\r\n\r\nHowever, since the Government apparently believes in these devices, and since they are committed to openness and transparency, it should be a very short step for them to also commit to using lie detectors themselves.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this petition calls for every Cabinet Minister to make at least one appearance per sitting of Parliament to answer previously unseen questions from MPs while wired to a lie detector, with the results being made public via Hansard.",
