A cash ISA does not get taxed on the interest. but if you were to put money into a SS ISA divdends are taxed at 10%, never mind if you are a basic rate tax payer or a higher rate tax payer.\r\n\r\nAlso i dont understand why putting money into a SS ISA takes up our annual ISA limit if it is taxed anyway.\r\n\r\nTherefore a SS ISA offers no benefit to lower income people over an ordinary share dealing account. The only benefit of a SS is not paying captial gains tax but for someone like myself this is not efficient due to small sums i invest and the transaction fees.\r\n\r\nInvestments should be long term.. give us an incentive to invest for our future and also remove the ban on AIM trading for SS ISA",
