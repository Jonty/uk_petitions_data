Too many times we have gone to the aid of others, only to have elements within those countries and our own communities turn on the hand of support that has been extended. This must not be allowed to happen again.\r\n\r\nThe Middle East, is a volitie region, and has been further destabilised by these events. Our involvement in any way would place us in a difficult position. Furthermore the rebels, are as yet an unknown quantity, and many are believed to be jihadists.\r\n\r\nWe cannot police the world, especially given the brutal knife of cuts recently taken to our military. The money we would spend in Syria must be spent at home, on our own problems.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter for Syria, her neighbours and the Arab world as a whole. The UK Government must not intervene in any way. Financially, Morally or Militarily.",
