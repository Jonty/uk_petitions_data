        "additional_details": "The grade boundaries for the June 2012 English GCSE were changed from the January in the same academic year. This means that thousands of students who would have achieved a C in the January were denied a C in the June Exam.\r\nAfter uproar from teachers, parents and students Ofqual reviewed the situations. It said that they \"believe that assessments marked in January 2012 were \"graded generously\" but\" It would not be appropriate to revisit the January grade boundaries. That would mean lowering the grades of other students which would lead to further concerns over unfairness\"\r\nMichael Gove has said \"\"Everyone who sat the exam was treated in a way that either wasn't fair or appropriate.\"\r\n\r\nBut politicians could not act as \"chief examiner\", he added.\r\n\r\nHe said the structure of the exam itself had been \"unfair and inappropriate\".\r\n\r\nWe demand that the Students who sat GCSE English in June 2012 have their grades adjusted to reflect the grade boundaries set for the January exam.",
