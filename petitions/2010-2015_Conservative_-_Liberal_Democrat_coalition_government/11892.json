        "additional_details": "The last week, if it has shown anything, has certainly proved that the inequalities in British society are rampant. This began in the 1980s and we are now reaping the consequences.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be a fundamental realignment of such things as work and wages, home ownership or not. Just on these two issues I would like to expand a little.\r\n\r\nWork and wages. It is crazy one person working 50,60 and sometimes 70 hours a week, when onother person has no work. It is time for everybody to be employed on a 30-35 hour week.\r\n\r\nOn home ownership or not. There should be a rent act stopping ridiculously high rents which are as much, if not more, that most mortgages.\r\n\r\nThere are many more issues that need attention but the main thrust of this petition is for the Govt. to create a more egalitarian society.",
