        "additional_details": "Over the last fourty years traffic has gone up and up , but the services are the same size when the Motorways were built, many lay-bys have been closed and no were to park when tired, make driving dangerous.\r\nwould like to see more parking areas for trucks, possible between Motorway services, like those in France, Parc Aires, with showers and toilets. This job is 24 hours and we need some where to sleep in day time too. One shower at a service isn't enough, plus they are not very clear!!",
