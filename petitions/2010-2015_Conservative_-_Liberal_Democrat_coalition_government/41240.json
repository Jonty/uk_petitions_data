        "action": "A call for the UK Government to remove tax disincentives for workplace health support to manage psychosocial risks",
        "additional_details": "A 2008 report by Dame Carol Black estimated that stress and chronic ill health in the workplace costs a crippling \u00a3100 billion. It is now the biggest cause of long term absence from work. The BSI has published the first of three guidelines in managing psychosocial risks, meaning we finally have a recognised method for reducing stress. What we need now is for the Government to make wellbeing initiatives more affordable by removing workplace health tax for such programmes. If current taxes on all workplace health were removed, an overall productivity gain of \u00a3443m per year for UK business would be achieved (BUPA 2012).\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, request that the UK Government remove tax disincentives for workplace health support to manage psychosocial risks. We are pledging our commitment to the \u2018Earn your Stripes\u2019 campaign to promote work health programmes and are calling for this proactive movement as an investment in our economy and our workforce.
