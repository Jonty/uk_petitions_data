        "additional_details": "High Streets are in decline and communities are being disaffected.  With have a recession at the moment with lots of cuts but very little to stimulate the economy to get us out of it.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is simple - create Enterprise Zones in the High Street.  Allow new entrepreneurs to setup shops and boutiques without red tape and three years business rates exemption and 50% corporation tax reductions.  There must be regulation around qualification to the zone to ensure major chains do not just relocate or open up new shops.  The shops should also be categorised so that we don't end up with more pound shops, auction shops, knock off clothes or furniture.\r\n\r\nAlthough everyone now shops online we still need our high street.  We will always need community hearts and somewhere to meet friends or browse shops.  If we lose these important centres of communities it will only encourage more disaffected society. Vote for keeping our community and help create jobs.",
