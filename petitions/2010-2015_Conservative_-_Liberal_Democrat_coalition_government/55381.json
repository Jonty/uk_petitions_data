        "additional_details": "A few local residents were notified five days before a council meeting to approve a compulsory purchase of the land. Building a school here will involve the terracing of current farmland and two years of building, to create a school for up to 2000 pupils. This is in a highly visible and beautiful Green Belt location. It will not only destroy the Green Belt legacy of this stunning area but compound the current issues with traffic on the Lower Luton Road, flooding caused by bad drainage and major issue with power in the area. We would like the Government to initiate an enquiry into how this land was chosen and order the local authority look again.",
