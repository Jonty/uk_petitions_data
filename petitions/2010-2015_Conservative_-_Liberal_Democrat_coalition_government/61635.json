        "additional_details": "This petition is for the idea of high speed transit, but it believes that HS2 is not the only way.\r\n\r\nBritain itself developed the rail systems that are all over the world today. It is the 21st century though, not the victorian times anymore. This petition hopes to raise a debate in parliament to innovate a new concept of mass public transport in the UK, to relieve costs, environmental and sentimental conflict between the UK.\r\n\r\nThis includes utilising methods with Britains current infrastructure, but explore different methods of transport, rather than the current steel wheel used for 200 years.",
