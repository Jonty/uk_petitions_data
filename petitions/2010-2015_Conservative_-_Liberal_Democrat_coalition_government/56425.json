        "additional_details": "Presently in the UK, we have very few whole-country referenda. As a democracy, the people should be regularly consulted on issues concerning them, and in many cases decisions should not be left to representatives. Therefore, I propose that the government give the opportunity for more referenda, to allow us to have a greater say in the running of day-to-day life, in which we often have little say.",
