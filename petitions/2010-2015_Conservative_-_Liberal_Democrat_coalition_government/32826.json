Visual signing seems to have become the norm for films shown in the early hours.  The problem with this is that a good proportion of the viewing screen is either taken by a frame, or the sign language operative is superimposed in front of the film.  Why distract and visually impair the viewing experience when subtitles are available, and can be used without detriment to the vast majority of viewers?\r\nAction; either limit sign language to specific channels, deploy a marker to indicate sign language use, or ideally make the visibility of the sign language optional.\r\n",
