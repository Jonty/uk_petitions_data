        "additional_details": "\r\n\r\nThe current cost to get or renew the S.I.A. Licence is \u00a3250, this is absolutely ridiculous when you consider that security workers are amongst the lowest paid people in the job market.   This seems absolutely ridiculous when you consider the corruption and terrible working conditions that exist within the security industry, it seems that working class people are paying for useless beaurocrats to sit back and take a substantial cut of their wages\r\n\r\nI can completely understand that a criminal check is neccessary, but this costs only \u00a330, I propose that the cost of the Licence is decreased to \u00a350\r\nplease sign this petition and bring an end to this unfair extra charge on the poor working taxpayer",
