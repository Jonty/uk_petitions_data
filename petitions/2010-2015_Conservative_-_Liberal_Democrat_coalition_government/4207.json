        "additional_details": "The government must stop allowing the EU ito misuse UK taxpayers\u2019 money by providing aid to the Ethiopian government who ensure that the aid is handed out in exchange for support for the ruling political party, without EU monitoring.\r\n\r\nAid has increased to Ethiopia despite serious human rights abuses this is letting down all those who fight for justice and democracy and increasing the potential for conflict in Ethiopia.\r\n\r\nBritain stands accused of turning a blind eye to widespread human rights abuses in Ethiopia by providing billions of dollars of aid despite evidence it is used as a tool of political oppression.\r\n\r\nDespite violating human rights clauses in the Cotonou Agreement biding it with the EU, Ethiopia continues to be one of the largest beneficiaries of European support.\r\n\r\nDespite European Parliament concerns, the EU Commission and Council did not even bother to investigate these extremely serious claims.",
