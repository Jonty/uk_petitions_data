It is also not in the interest of the people to have their rights of choice withheld by a clear monopoly.\r\nA demand a reading in the House for the abolition of this monopoly and the freedom of every household to choose which utility company provides their water service. This practise has served us well with the Electricity, Gas, Phone and Broadband markets.\r\nPlease sign to end this flagrant corruption.\r\n",
