        "additional_details": "I am looking for a review into working tax credit. Currently you have to be 25 or older to get working tax credit. I fail to see how when your 25 your entitled to tax credits but if you are working and paying tax and are 24 and 364 days old you are not. That's that no other way around it.\r\nI suggest we lower the age to anyone of full working age. Or start basing the descision on independent circumstances. If they can do it with job seekers allowance, employment support allowance and personal indepenc e payment then tax credit should be considered in the same way. ",
