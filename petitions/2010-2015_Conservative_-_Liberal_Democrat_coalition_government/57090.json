        "additional_details": "The Regulation of Railways Act 1889 is often used by the train operators in UK to bring the fare \"evader\" to court, sometime resulting the person receiving a criminal record while taking up the court valuable time.\r\n\r\nWhile traveling on train/bus/ferry without a valid ticket should be punished by fines, it is very questionable if this should be a criminal offense.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, once a person got convicted for a criminal offense for traveling without a valid ticket, this offence will appear on their CRB check and might potentially affect their future career.\r\n\r\nAlso, very often, those who get prosecuted are those who do not intend to evade fare, but genuinely lost, forgot to purchase, cannot touch in because of the malfunctioned oyster machine or forgot to touch in by rushing to the train.\r\n\r\nOne should ask if someone should receive a criminal offense for not having a \u00a35 ticket. Please consider revising this law and how it should be applied. ",
