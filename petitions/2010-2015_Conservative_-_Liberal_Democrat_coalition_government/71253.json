        "additional_details": "Drink driving is an awful offence. It claims many lives every year and seriously injures, causing misery for hundreds of people.\r\nCurrently the legal limit is 80mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood. The majority of people feel this is still too high. A lot of serial offenders get away with drink driving because of the high threshold. The law is outdated and needs to be amended to show it is simply not acceptable to drink drive.\r\n\r\nThe limit cannot be zero because there are many legitimate reasons why people would have a small amount of alcohol in their blood, but lower the limit to 50mg in blood as Scotland and Ireland have done.\r\n\r\nThis will make people think more about risking it and not to drink at all as currently people have the attitude that 'I can have a couple'. This is the attitude that costs lives. ",
