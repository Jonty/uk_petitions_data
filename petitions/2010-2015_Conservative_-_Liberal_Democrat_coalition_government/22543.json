        "additional_details": "every mobile phone company is coning uk payers by saying unlimited free call or text, but they actually have a limit such as o2 there text limit was 12,000 but now is around 2,900 but they still seem to think they should be able to brand there service as unlimited which is misleading to buyers. I want to have the law changed so that these crooks can not lie and they have to tell us how many text and call we will be getting and unless it is unlimited they should not be allowed to state so",
