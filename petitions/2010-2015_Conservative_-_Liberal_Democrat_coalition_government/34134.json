        "additional_details": "Managing a long term condition like Heart Failure and it's associated conditions including cardiomyopathy is tough enough without the financial strain of paying for prescriptions as well.Remember medication is for life and there are over 1,000,000 people in the UK diagnosed with Heart Failure. Pumping Marvellous the Heart Failure charity is asking for people to support the e-petition which is long overdue. People can't understand why someone taking thyroxin or who has diabetes is exempt from paying for prescriptions when Heart Failure patients do. Pumping Marvellous is asking the government to overhaul the prescription system and include Heart Failure and it's associated conditions within the free prescription bracket.",
