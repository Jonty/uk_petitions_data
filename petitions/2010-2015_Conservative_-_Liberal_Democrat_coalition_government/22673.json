        "additional_details": "To scrap local council tax and replace with a local government tax based on affordability and not on property value/ location rates. A high percentage of people of all generations  (young, middle aged to old age pensioners) are struggling to pay the expensive council tax bills and meet the aggressive demands and debt collection method deployed by local governments.\r\n\r\nBills should take overall household income  into account together with levels of  essential outgoings  such as mortgages,rent, utility bills, travel and personal status which should include debts such as student loan repayments, parental child support .outgoings and more.\r\n\r\nHowever a fairer tax is assessed will no doubt be complicated  but that is no reason to continue with this unfair council tax system currently in place.\r\n\r\nA Change must happen!\r\n\r\n",
