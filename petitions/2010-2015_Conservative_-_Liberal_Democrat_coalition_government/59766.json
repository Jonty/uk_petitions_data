Examples of this is the use of lactose in tablets and gelatine in vaccines.\r\n\r\nThe adding of artificial colours, flavours and sweeteners should also be phased out - and replaced with natural alternatives.\r\n\r\nThis should not affect the efficiency of the drug in anyway, as only inactive ingredients would be replaced.",
