        "additional_details": "This e-petition proposes that Britain should not give one single penny more to Argentina considering the all too real threat they pose to the Falkland Islands. It is estimated that we give \u00a3450m per year from the Department for International Development to Argentina. Argentina have also took \u00a34.66bn out of a global aid fund in which Britain contributes a significant amount. Continuing this aid to a relatively prosperous country is not only madness considering the austerity here in Britain, but it is fuelling and funding Argentina's nationalistic sabre-rattling. The self-determination of the Falklanders is paramount, by ending this aid we can stop funding a potential aggressor but symbolically, show we are wholeheartedly supporting the democratic rights of the Falkland Islands",
