If someone comes to this country and commit crimes ,they forfeit any right to stay here.\r\nYet Judges always seem to believe that their human rights are more important than those of their victims. The only way to stop this abuse of our trust is to get rid of the act.\r\nThe only people who will miss it are the lawyers who grow rich on these cases.",
