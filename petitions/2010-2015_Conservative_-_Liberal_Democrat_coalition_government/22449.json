The time and a half would start from the fortieth hour.\r\n\r\nThe United States of America has had successful  similar law for over 50 years, and they are the most prosperous nation in the world.\r\n\r\nA labour law like this would provide an incentive for people to take overtime, this would add to GDP, and could boost disposable income and spending. If a workplace had to keep offering overtime on a regular basis, then it would provide an incentive for them to create new jobs, and avoid the penalty, there is an element of choice in this.\r\n\r\nThis law would also help tackle the scourge of unpaid overtime, by creating a legal recourse.",
