        "additional_details": "Background: In 1947, Zionist Jews forcefully entered the now state of Israel. In sympathy for the Jewish population persecuted under Hitlers genocidal regime, the United Nations sanctioned the state of Israel. The Arabs sent a small regiment to bring Palestinians to safety and were slaughtered in retaliation, the Arab-Israeli war. As such, tension has been rife in the region between Arabs and Israelis.\r\n\r\nActions: UK to sanction peacekeepers in Israel-Palestine:\r\n- To get israelis & Palestinians to enter into peace negotiations for a better 2 state solution\r\n- To diffuse the tension between the communities\r\n- To install of infrastructure\r\n- To rebuild homes and communities\r\n\r\nResult: Britain will demonstrate that she is at the forefront of peace negotiations.
