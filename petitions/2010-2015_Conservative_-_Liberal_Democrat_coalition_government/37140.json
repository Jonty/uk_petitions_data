        "additional_details": "Wigan Council has included a good deal of green belt and farmland around the borough in their strategic plan - in other words they are designating it for potential building land. If they turn these areas into housing estates the green spaces and wildlife habitat will be gone forever.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that homes are needed in Wigan. However it is our contention that in an old industrial town there must be derelict sites which could be used to provide building land without using the green and pleasant land which is becoming so scarce. The land around Gidlow Lane and Standish Wood Lane is a haven for wildlife and is partially in use as agricultural land. Woodland has been planted, the area is home to a wide range of native wildlife and many local people enjoy access to this area.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to lose this area forever then register your protest NOW, we only have until September 11th before the public consultation ends. Save this green and pleasant land for the future.",
