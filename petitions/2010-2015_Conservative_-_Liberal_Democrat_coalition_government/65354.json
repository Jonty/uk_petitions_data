On a payment of \u00a3200 the paying parent pays \u00a340 and the receiving parent \u00a38 - that is \u00a3576 per year - excessive even if a processing charge is necessary.  This service is vital and shouldn't cost so much that it makes it's use unattractive or impossible for those that need it.  This will take money away from children, who are often vulnerable and need it.  If parents were able to be amicable this agency - whatever called would not be involved.\r\n",
