We wish for only scientifically-proven or provable theories to be taught in schools. Religious discussion should only be allowed in RE lessons. Theories such as Intelligent Design should not be allowed to be taught to children in science lessons and religious artifacts and symbols must be removed from all non-faith schools. No item of clothing religious in nature or worn in support of a religion can be worn at any time in a school.",
