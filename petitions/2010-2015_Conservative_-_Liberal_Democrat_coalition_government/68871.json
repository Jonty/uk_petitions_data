        "action": "Remove BT from the Telephone Line Rental monopoly and open it to competition.",
        "additional_details": "BT has almost a total monopoly of the Telephone Land Line Rental market which is grossly unfair on the general public. This petition is asking the Government to take this monopoly from BT's control and to open it up to the market place in much the same way as Gas and Electricity has been.\r\nLand Lines are an essential part of everyday life for most people, BT knows this and their recent indication that prices are to rise by 7% is just blatant profiteering. The general public should have other options to find the best prices and terms for them. With BT holding this near monopoly we do not have that choice! ",
