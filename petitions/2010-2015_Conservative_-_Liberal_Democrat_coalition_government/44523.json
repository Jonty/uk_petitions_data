        "additional_details": "Now is not the time for a decrease in police officer salaries, with numbers being at an all time low. The number of young police officers has fallen by over 50% and will continue to fall with the appalling decision to dock \u00a34,000 from a new recruit's salary. There will be a sharp decline in the amount of people applying to be a regular PC and standards could slip due to police morale.\r\n\r\nJust because officers are Servants of the Crown - it does not mean they should be taken advantage of.\r\n\r\nThe salary of a police officer should be restored and if anything increased from the \u00a322,000 starting grade, given the amount of work they do to keep communities and this country safe.\r\n\r\nThe day an MP has to wear a protective stab vest to work should be the day they can tamper with the salaries of those who's jobs require it.",
