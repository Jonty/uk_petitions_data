And public opinion is such that no longer are we prepared to lock these terrorists up  in prison. A stronger message needs to be sent and that message can only be made with Capital Punishment\r\nOn Wednesday 22nd May 2013 a violent attack, with implications of a terrorist nature, took place on the streets of Woolwich, London.\r\nNo longer is custodial sentencing enough of a punishment for this kind of terror crime.",
