It seems that havering council have let its young sports people down by not finding us the temporary rink that the council and Morrisons originally promised us.\r\n\r\nwe are all for a new state of the art rink, however, Havering council promised over 800 young figure skaters and ice hockey players a temporary rink in the interim, but now we are told they are unable to fund this and that Romford ice rink is due to close in April 2012\r\n",
