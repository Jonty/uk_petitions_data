        "additional_details": "The proposed plans to build an incinerator at Charlton Lane tip / Shepperton are being forced upon local residents to accept, without any objections. This incinerator technology is not proven as successful however the local residents have NOT been asked on their opinions or thoughts.\r\nThis incinerator poses serious health risks to local residents with poor air quality and emission of toxins, leading to potential for asthma and cancer to name a few.\r\nApart from the above the proposed site is on a greenbelt, will be a massive eyesore for miles and will greatly reduce the value of properties in surrounding areas.\r\nThe government needs to look into why this site has been chosen for such development and without any consultation with local residents. It is an outrage that residents voices are not being heard with MP's clearly only worried about stats and figures, not the people they are supposed to stand for.\r\nPlease sign this petition if you are against this eco park.",
