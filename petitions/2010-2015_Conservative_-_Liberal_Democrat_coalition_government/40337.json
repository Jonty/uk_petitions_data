        "additional_details": "The people of England and Wales having been denied the democratic right to consider and vote upon the possible dissolution of the United Kingdom, which would have major implications for all parts of that Kingdom and upon which a selected minority of that union are to have a unilateral referendum, the Government is petitioned to hold a parallel referendum among the people of England and Wales, to consider the withdrawal of those countries from the 300-year-old union with Scotland, the outcome of that referendum to be binding on the UK Government in the same way as the impending Scotland-only vote. This petition does not promote a particular outcome of the proposed referendum, only to secure for the English and Welsh peoples the same democratic right of self-determination as has been granted to the Scots. The Government is also petitioned to seek the views of the people of Northern Ireland as to their future under their 200-year-old union.  ",
