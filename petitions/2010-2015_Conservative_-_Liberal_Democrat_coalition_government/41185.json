        "additional_details": "Banning the use of chinese lanterns would be a major step in protecting our wildlife.\r\n\r\nWildlife, farm animals, domestic pets, aircraft and coastguard services are affected by the use of these non essential, air born, menaces.\r\n\r\nFARMING:- Chinese lanterns released into the air at outdoor events such as weddings are killing livestock, and setting fire to fields.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY SERVICES:- The UK Coastguard says it has seen a large increase in the number of rescue teams and lifeboats being called out to false alarms, because decorative Chinese lanterns are being mistaken for distress flares.\r\n\r\nThe Government needs to take action now to ban the use and sale of Chinese Lanterns.\r\n\r\nIt would be highly advantageous for the environment, wildlife & even the general public if & when the lanterns are banned. They can cause unnecessary harm to wildlife as well as fires to property.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to end the cruelty that is being done to our beautiful countryside. ",
