        "action": "Make available and regulate single MMR Vaccines to the public on the NHS and Privately",
        "additional_details": "Given the current decrease in parents protecting their children with the current MMR vaccine, it seems evident from the majority of parents and public demand that people want the choice of safe single vaccines either in place of or as an option to protect their children from measles,mumps and rubella. As the UK currently faces an epidemic of measles it seems the government is failing to listen again to the majority. This petition calls for regulated single vaccines on the NHS and privately, made available immediately!!!",
