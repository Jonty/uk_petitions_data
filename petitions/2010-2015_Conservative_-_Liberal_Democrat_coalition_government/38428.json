        "additional_details": "From 1st October 2012 all providers of self storage will be required to charge VAT on storage services at the standard rate, currently 20%.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt shouldnt be imposed because:\r\n\u2022Self storage is essentially about letting out individual units of space which are clearly separated, and therefore should be exempt from VAT in the same way as other rental property.\r\n\u2022The new rules are being imposed at short notice, and without a transition period.\r\n\u2022The industry already collects large amounts of VAT for the government on sales of items such as packaging materials and padlocks.\r\n\u2022The self storage industry already pays large amounts to the government through business rates and corporation tax.\r\n\u2022It will hit small business customers particularly hard - larger businesses will be able to reclaim VAT, but not smaller start-ups which aren't VAT-registered.\r\n\u2022A increase of 20% will have a negative impact on economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe government should not introduce VAT and keep self storage VAT free.\r\n",
