They get decent benefits and salary increases compared to the rest of the country and many other government and council positions.\r\n\r\nFilming may be against the rules however this picture shows that the MP was more interested in leisure time than earning his salary - which is paid by the tax payer.\r\n\r\nIt should be the tax payers right to know what the MP's are doing to earn their salaries and claiming expenses.\r\n\r\nThe Government should remember - tax payers are the ones that vote MP's them into positions of trust to run the country on our behalf and earning a salary from our tax money.\r\n",
