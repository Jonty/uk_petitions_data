The main burden of providing the police service and the court service is borne by the ordinary law abiding taxpayer.  Why.\r\nMaking the law breaker or someone who is guilty of  anti socal behaviour pay the full cost of their behaviour would make more people realise how expensive their behaviour is.  It would also bridge the financial gap between what we have and what we need.",
