        "additional_details": "For our citizenship GCSE we are campaigning about the use of plastic bags in supermarkets and there effect on the environment.\r\n\r\nAll over the world supermarkets use polyethylene bags which take up to 1000 years to decompose and with nearly one trillion being thrown away each year they are taking a huge toll on the environment.\r\n\r\nSupermarkets use these plastic bags because they are usually made of less material than other alternatives such as boxes or other type\u2019s bags as well as being much cheaper to produce and stores often provide them as a convenience to shoppers.\r\n\r\nMarine animals often mistake these plastic bags for food and swallow them. This can cause the animals serious problems and often results in death.\r\n\r\nWe want supermarkets to stop using plastic bags and replace for more environmentally friendly bags such as biodegradable or canvas bags.",
