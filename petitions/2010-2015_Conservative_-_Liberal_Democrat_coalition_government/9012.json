I propose the following:\r\n\r\n- Stern sentences of not less than 5 years for those convicted of the current riots and to serve the whole term.\r\n- Rapists and paedophiles to serve no less than a minimum of 10 years without probabtion.\r\n- Those committing serious affray, GBH, muggings and robberies outside of the above mentioned riots to serve no less than 5 years.\r\n- Those convicted of murder to serve no less than life, or greater where serial murders have taken place.. Absolutely no parole/probabtion or any hearing allowed to petition for early release. Those convicted of attempted murder with true intent to kill should serve a minimum of 15 years with the same conditions applied as for murderers\r\n\r\n\r\n",
