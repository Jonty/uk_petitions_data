It is NOT a private members club where the members bear the cost of running the place.  It is actually a workplace canteen, and the ONLY workplace canteen from which the employer of the workers who use it are barred, and this MUST be corrected.  Action must be taken now to open upthis politicians and Lords' scam to those who fund it.",
