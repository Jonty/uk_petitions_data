        "additional_details": "Most other countries in Europe have a drinking age of 16, and our alcohol problems are much worse. It is better to let them drink in a controlled environment from 16, rather than them drinking in parks, and becoming anti-social. This will decrease crime, and decrease the billions spent on teens with alcohol poisoning in the NHS. The government should allow sales of lagers/ciders to those persons who are 16 and over",
