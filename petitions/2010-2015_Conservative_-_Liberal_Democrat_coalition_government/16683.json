        "action": "To compromise with the government to cut NHS costs on Gluten Free Foods for Coeliacs",
        "additional_details": "It is apparent that there is a debate regarding the costs of providing gluten free food to people with coeliac diease on prescription.I read \u00a340 for a box of pasta through the chemist,\u00a31.89 in the supermarket.If coeliacs were to qualify for the lower rate of Disability Living Allowance this would save the government lots of money & would give coeliacs the choice as to where they can shop,which means they can buy a wider range of foods as they have a better budget to help manage their condition. Low income families with children need to buy non prescription items which are triple in price e.g.free from fish fingers,chicken nuggets,lunch box fillers.If the lower rate of DLA was introduced low income families wouldnt need to suffer & can therefore offer their child a wider range of food.I would ask the government to consider that all coeliacs qualify for lower rate DLA & demolish foods on prescriptions,which would save the NHS lots of money that could go towards equipment for hospitals.",
