Any adult who makes a purchase of ANYTHING detrimental or deleterious to the wellbeing of a child, be it drugs, alcohol, pornography or unsuitable movies or videogames for their age should suffer STRICT penalties, as should the retailer who colludes with the parent. Careless parenting is the root cause of so many social ills, and this needs to be addressed.",
