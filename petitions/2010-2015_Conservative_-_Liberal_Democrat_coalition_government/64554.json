        "additional_details": "One of Kate Moss' most famous and most contraversial quotes is \"nothing tastes as good as skinny feels\" and this  quote is now a world known quote and predominantly used on pro anorexia website as motivation to other pro anorexics to continue into the tight grasps of anorexia and other eating disorders.\r\n\r\nTo celelbrate her 40 years in the fashion and modelling inudstry she is returning to topshop and launching a new range. I think after stating this quote she should be banned from the industry as she is encouraging pro-anorexia's and fueling the already fueld media's influence on eating disorders in society in general.",
