        "additional_details": "This petition is to gather signatures of people affected by the closure of services in Hartlepool and the surrounding area. There are 91,000 people in Hartlepool alone, not to mention the surrounding area. The elderly and infirm can't always travel the 15-20 miles to North Tees and unfortunate some of these have lost their lives due to a significant lack of care services in the town. Please show your support to this cause and get Hartlepool Hospital open again!",
