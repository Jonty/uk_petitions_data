        "additional_details": "Paraliament  made it possible in the Abortion Act of 1967 that women could abort their babies up to 24 weeks with the approval of two doctors for reasons of the mother's health or for the health of the unborn child.  It was passed so that women would not seek out unhealthy legalized abortions elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSo abortion was made legal in England, Scotland and Wales..however according to government stats as of\r\n2011, 208, 553 babies are aborted each year in the UK.  Of the years total 98 percent were the so called social abortions...only 1 percent was carried out because of a suspected handicap.  These figures show that we are nation that basically provides abortion on demand.  If we continue to go down this slippery path we will be a nation that does not have British Born Citizens because we will have destroyed our own heritage as a country.  Please consider lowering the abortion limit to at least 12 weeks. Thank-you.",
