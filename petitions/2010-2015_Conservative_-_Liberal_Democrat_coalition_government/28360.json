Upfront is the charity that runs this service to provide much support for children who are looked after in Kent. This service includes running local youth groups, holiday activities and residential this gain confidence, self esteem, socialise and build friendships with others who are in care. They are there for us to have fun in a safe, non-judgemental and positive environment! They are even there if you need a chat. These groups have helped so many young people over many years. The groups have helped children to take their minds off many things that have happened in their life. Where will we turn without them. Please help us by signing this, is will help young people to continue having someone who is there. I am one of these young people who will be affected; I can\u2019t do this alone. ",
