        "additional_details": "The EU Cookie Law, created in May 2011, is in no way beneficial to either the weboligarch or the visitor. A few negatives of this law are:\r\n\r\n- It will annoy and confuse users who don't currently know what cookies are.\r\n- It makes innocent website owners break the law.\r\n- It is unclear and most website owners don't fully understand what they have to do and whether they need to.\r\n- Every EU State has a different law, where's the consistency?\r\n- It will negatively affect several industries, which in the current economic climate seems like a bit of a stupid move?\r\n- It won't actually help privacy... Which is what it's supposed to do.\r\n\r\nThere are several steps the government can take in order to make this better:\r\n\r\n1. Scrap the law completely. This is the best outcome. What does this law actually achieve in a positive way? Nothing!\r\n2. Then go onto look at how privacy concerns can be dealt with. Cookies are not the way to do it.\r\n3. Stop working against online businesses.",
