        "action": "Introduce a trial period of Single/Double Summer Time in 2015",
        "additional_details": "Many people in the UK are fed up with the clocks going back to GMT during the winter and research suggests this is a bad idea for tourism, energy use, business, road safety, sport, exercise and much more. The most viable alternative is to change to Single/Double Summer Time (SDST). This petition therefore calls on the government to hold a 4 year trial of SDST to start in October 2015 when \u2018Summer time\u2019 would be maintained through the winter, then in March 2016 the clocks would advance to 'Double Summer Time' (GMT+2hours), then go back an hour to \u2018Single Summer time\u2019 in October 2016. The same would happen during the following two years. Parliament and other bodies can then decide what is best after this. During the trial the UK would be in the same time zone as France, Germany and many other European countries. ",
