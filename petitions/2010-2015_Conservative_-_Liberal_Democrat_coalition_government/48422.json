The Home Office does not normally let people waiting for their visa to travel outside of the UK (they are in possession of my passport) but my grandmother's 100th birthday is in a month.\r\n\r\nPlease support my plea to attend the once in blue moon family event in Detroit Michigan, USA. I'm not asking to jump the queue for my application, just the chance to celebrate my wonderful and inspirational grandmother in person without jeopardizing my visa application.\r\n\r\nThank you!",
