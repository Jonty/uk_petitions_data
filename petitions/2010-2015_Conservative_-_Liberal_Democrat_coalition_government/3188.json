        "additional_details": "basically i think it is wrong if a 16 or 17 year old commits murder that the minimum sentence is only 12 years where as if you are 18 and over the minimum is 25 years, i personally think at the age of 16,17 you know what you are doing and you should be held fully responsible for your actions, by this age everyone knows right from wrong so why can they walk away after just 12 years when the family of the victim has to suffer for the rest of there life, so please sign the petition to try and change this law.",
