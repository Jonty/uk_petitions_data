        "additional_details": "Conduct a feasibility study to establish a British Auxiliary Regiment of Foot separate from the Regular Army or Territorial Army to staff static perimeter defensive locations, check points or entry gates on Military overseas deployments, freeing the regular British military forces currently being used to enable these units to re-deploy on offensive operations or to minimise non strategic wastage of valuable trained and experienced military personnel on routine (non hazardous) duties. Potentially modelling it on a deployable unit of the Military Provost Guard Service already being used to protect and control access to armed forces establishments in the UK. This would minimise the requirement of fully trained (active service) personnel, allowing for potential reductions in highly trained and paid operatives and creating a cost effective, trained and deployable non strategic light infantry reserve for home defence/protection when not over seas.",
