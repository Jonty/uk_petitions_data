        "additional_details": "Bernard Hogan-Howe worked for the South Yorkshire Police service between 1979 and 1997, and is currently subject to an investigation by the IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Commission) over his role in the Hillsborough disaster. The investigation was launched after Hogan-Howe \u2013 who had a role working with bereaved families on the evening of the disaster \u2013 claimed to have provided a statement for the Taylor Inquiry, when in fact, he had not done so.\r\n\r\nWe find it astonishing and shameful that a University based in \u2018Liverpool\u2019 would consider awarding an honorary doctorate to Bernard Hogan-Howe, whilst the inquest into the disaster has not yet concluded, and whilst an investigation into his own conduct has not yet taken place.",
