        "action": "Debate the abolition of road tax and the increase of tax on fuel.",
        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the government to consider abolishing road tax in favour of increased tax on fuel. This would lead to a more proportional sharing of the costs of motor ownership and use. Heavy users would pay more and light users less.\r\n\r\nIt would make sense for commercial users and the emergency services to have allowances preventing them being overcharged.\r\n\r\nAs we are not lessoning our demand for carbon based fuels we should do more to offset the costs to heavy carbon users.\r\n\r\nThe details of any new road tax and fuel pricing system would have to be dealt with in committee but the idea is sound and should be debated at the very least.",
