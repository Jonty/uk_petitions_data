        "additional_details": "Ban cyclists from all roads unless on designated cycle lanes. Cyclists are a danger to themselves and other road users. How can a bicycle travelling at as little 5mph be safe next to vehicles travelling at up to 70mph? How, in this health and safety mad era can this possibly be considered safe?? They often cause congestion because at times you just can't safely overtake them. I'm not against cyclists, I just think they should be separated from todays modern road network and keep themselves and us safe. ",
