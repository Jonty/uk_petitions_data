        "additional_details": "Tattoo's are a thing much in demand from the teenage generation of today, however, with the law preventing tattoo artists from legally performing the ink-art on anyone under the age of 18, teenagers turn to other means.\r\nBecause of the current laws, teenagers go to dangerous, unhygienic and 'dodgy' places to get what they want. This should be changed, the government needs to keep up with the generations changing, and allow mature 16 year olds to make their own life decisions about their own bodies, and allow them to do it SAFELY.",
