        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition to convince Cadburys not to mess with the original recipe of the Creme egg! We, the general public, do not want our Easter staple tampered with in ANY way and will boycott purchasing the Creme eggs if the new chocolate mixture is used and the fondant is tampered with in any way!!! We are also outraged that a box of Creme eggs will now be five instead of six but is still being charged at the original price for a box of six. There is little enjoyment to be had these days, we campaign for our rights to be sold the delicious and original Creme eggs and in the box of six as previously sold. ",
