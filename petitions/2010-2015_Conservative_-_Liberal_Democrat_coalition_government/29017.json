        "additional_details": "The government is trying to push through a reorganisation that nobody voted for and will open up the NHS to private companies. Many in the medical professions are against this, especially GPs, who are very worried that patient care will suffer. Furthermore, the NHS is already under pressure to find \u00a320bn of savings by 2014. Adding a complex and costly top-down reorganisation at this time makes no financial sense.\r\nI propose that the government abandons this misguided Bill with immediate effect.",
