It will, among other things, repeal section 52 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, which means that artistic works will be protected by copyright for the period of the author's life plus 70 years, and will allow the use of \"orphan\" works (copyright works by authors who cannot be identified or traced) for commercial and non-commercial use, and for the appointment of an authorising body to license this use.",
