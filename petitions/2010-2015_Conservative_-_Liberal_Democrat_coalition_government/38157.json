The cost of the flight is \u00a3255 with the remainder been made from tax. If I flew from Berlin the flight drops to \u00a3500. This government is penalising UK citizens and disadvantaging them in been able to experience other cultures and societies. I am not a business man I work for a local authority. I have 2 children and would like for them to experience other countries and cultures. Please support this e petition and get this government to look again at this ridiculous tax.  ",
