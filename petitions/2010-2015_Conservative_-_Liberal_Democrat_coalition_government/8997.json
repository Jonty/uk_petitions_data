        "additional_details": "At the moment we still have the threat of riots in our cities and we are releasing charged individuals on conditional bail from court - even when they plea guilty - I would ask that the Bail Act in times of emergency is amended with a clause to enable the courts to insist that custody is immediate for up to six weeks to protect the public and property.  We do not have enough Police Officers to monitor curfews and tags - lets put them in prison until it calms down and then release with conditions.  ",
