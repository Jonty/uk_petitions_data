This has forced many thousands of students to reconsider going to University level education and making it only affordable for the most wealthiest/Upper class.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, demand the government to reconsider making what used to be free for all stay free for all. Our Universities should be paid for by the people for the people.\r\n",
