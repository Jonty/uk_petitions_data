        "additional_details": "This petition calls on HM government to reduce the UK contribution to the European Union Budget, commencing with a reduction of 10% in the 2012 contribution over the previous year, and following with further such reductions over the respective previous year's contribution.\r\n\r\nThe EU budget is effectively a tax on the peoples of the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe. It has not helped the real underlying economic situation of those countries that have received large sums of structural funding in the last 20 years and which are now in need of bailouts.\r\n\r\nThe budget is supposed to increase European competiveness in the global economy. However it is riddled with irregularities and the disbursements have not been given a clean bill of health by the Court of Auditors for the past 17 years. It is full of vanity projects, intended to make the EU appear more relevant to the citizens of the member states.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
