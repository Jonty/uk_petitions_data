Whilst developing a simple invention of mine I have created work for at least twelve UK companies, every product that gets to market could help create work and opportunities.\r\n\r\nEncouraging businesses through grants or tax relief to listen to inventors and develop their ideas could help the UK recover from the current situation.",
