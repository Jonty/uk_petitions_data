        "additional_details": "I want government to rescind the law on the sale of incandescent light bulbs.  Why can't we have both types of bulbs on sale, side by side, and allow the people to choose which bulb they want to use.  It is well documented that other major countries have or are repealing this law as it has been proved that low energy bulbs are a health hazard espcially to people who suffer from migrain, epilepsy or any kind of eye condition as the condition will get worse.  Disposal of low energy bulbs is not straight forward either as the mercury inside them is classed as toxic waste, low energy bulbs also have a much poorer performance record when compared to incandescent bulbs.  In this time of recession when everyone is living on very tight budgets forcing the people to buy Very Highly Priced under-performing low energy bulbs is dictatorial and condemns a large percentage of the people to poorer health.",
