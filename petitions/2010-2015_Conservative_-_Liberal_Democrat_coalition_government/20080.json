But the decision to grant planning permission, made by a Scottish government official, has sparked outrage among those who opposed the controversial move. Taken from the Ayrshire Post 20/10/11. I strongly ask the Scottish Government to to disallow the go-ahead for this project, and to ban further and all development in the future.petition to stop this development, this is our heritage, it's part of the history of Ayr and it's the peoples right to fight against it.",
