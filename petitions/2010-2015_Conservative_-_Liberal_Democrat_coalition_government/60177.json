        "additional_details": "The Wahhabi royal family in Saudi Arabia has slowly destroyed the historical and religious sites in the cities of Mecca and Medina. They must realise that not all Muslims agree with their interpretation of Islam and maintaining these sites is important for future generations.\r\n\r\nA number of graves, mosques, and houses have been demolished already including the house of Khadijah, the Prophet's wife, to make way for public toilets. The Gulf Institute estimates that 95% of the millennium old buildings in Mecca and Medina have been destroyed in the past twenty years.\r\n\r\nWe want the UK government to help in preserving this history by urging the Saudis to stop the destruction of any more sites. We understand that expansions must be made to accommodate the growing number of pilgrims for Hajj but this needs to be done without eradicating over 1400 years of history. Preservation of history no matter what era, religion, or country it belongs to should be enforced by the UK.",
