        "additional_details": "This is a petition to stop Universities charging extortionate fees for students and students family to attend graduation ceremonies.  These fees come at the most difficult time for graduates when they have the least available funds.\r\nI would like to see the Government regulate this and make sure that tickets are available to students and a limited number of family members in the cost of the tuition fee. No additional fee should be insisted upon for graduation ceremonies.",
