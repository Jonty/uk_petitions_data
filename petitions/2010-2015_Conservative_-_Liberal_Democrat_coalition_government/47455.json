        "additional_details": "The Government has discriminated against one earner families who earn over \u00a350,000 a year by taking away their Child Benefit, even though families where both work and earn over \u00a350,000 are entitled to full benefit. This is both unfair and discriminatary, please sign my e-petition to get this decision reversed, so hard working families with mums that stay home to look after the children are treated fairly.",
