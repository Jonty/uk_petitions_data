Other private companies manage to keep themselves going without this sort of 'support' so why do we need to pay a tax for channels we may or may not use?\r\n\r\nWhat's worse, if we refuse to pay for this 'license' then criminal proceedings are taken against us. Even if we do not use what we're meant to pay for, we are still treated as criminals by our duly elected officials. This cannot go on anymore.",
