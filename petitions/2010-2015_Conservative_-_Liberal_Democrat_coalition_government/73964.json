Certain aspects of social media should be kept private and the government should not be allowed to scrutinise individual opinions by \"spying\" on the public's social media profiles and messages.\r\n\r\nDavid Cameron's idea of \"banning\" social apps such as snapchat, facebook and whatsapp due to terrorists supposedly using them to communicate is ridiculous. Everyone in the country uses at least one social website and can communicate to others across the globe. If terrorists are using social media to communicate even if the government \"bans\" it they will still find other ways to get in touch with one another.\r\nHowever to take away our right to privacy (as stated in the UN Declaration of Human Rights) is violating our basic human rights.",
