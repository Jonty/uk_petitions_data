        "additional_details": "the current ECO eligibility criteria which is used to determine whether someone qualifies for a free boiler is seriously flawed and is being exploited by scheme operators meaning that the majority of boiler replacements are not necessary meanwhile the elderly and those with truly inefficient boilers are being sidelined due to non-eligibility or the fact that the margins for undertaking the work are lower, this is surely not in the spirit of the scheme where boilers operating at 60% efficiency are not replaced but boilers operating at 85% are. DECC and OFGEM need to review the process and ensure that boiler replacements are properly targeted to those most in need.\r\nplease sign this  petition and make sure your green levy does some real good and is not squandered on easy and  unnecessary installations\r\n",
