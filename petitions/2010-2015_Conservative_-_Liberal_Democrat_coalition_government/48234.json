Yet the richest in society seem to avoid paying almost no tax at all as they are able to move there money to offshore accounts or live abroad to pay a much lower rate of tax as they can move as they are rich.\r\n\r\nIt is about time that sanctions were imposed on these countries who reduce there tax to such a level and are taxing tax from the British people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
