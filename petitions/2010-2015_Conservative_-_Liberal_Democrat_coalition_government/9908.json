        "additional_details": "I think that at a fairly young age, maybe 13, kids should attend 6 months boot camp. This is short enough not to affect their academic development too much and long enough to teach valuable lessons that school struggles to teach like self control and discipline. For those with more severe behavioural problems, boot camp could last one year.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the boot camp is run properly and not watered down through, for example, excessive health and safety regulation.\r\n\r\nSelf control and discipline are attributes that will serve the children for the rest of their lives and help them to greater academic attainment. It will give them self confidence and a sense of achievement. Enforcing that kids from different backgrounds mix together in the boot camps would be crucial. Getting them to work together in multi-ethnic and religious teams would be very important to building better community relations.",
