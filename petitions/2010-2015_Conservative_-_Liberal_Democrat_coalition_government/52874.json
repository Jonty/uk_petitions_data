        "additional_details": "Over the years as a way to raise money, reduce costs, or some other excuse, large amounts of publicly funded assets have been sold off at a reduced price into private hands. Often, if not entirely, resulting in a worse service which costs the tay payer more and more money. Where lives are at risk, it is not in the interests of the British people that these assets are sold off. The short term profit made from selling off these national assets, when compared to the long term costs is also not in the interest of the british people. Please stop selling off our assets.",
