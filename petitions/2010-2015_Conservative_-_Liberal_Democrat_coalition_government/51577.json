But let's not fund surrogacy that gives childless couples the chance to have a baby and start their family!\r\n\r\nMy name is Lauren fowler and I am 1 in 5000 I was born with a rare syndrome called rokitansky this means is was born without a womb! I'm lucky enough to have my ovaries which means I produce my own eggs! In order to fund surrogacy to give me a chance to have a baby I need help, surrogacy costs around 15,000-30,000 without the help of the Nhs I unfortunately do not have a money tree! I applied for funding but they won't help me, because boob jobs are obviously more important than giving me a chance to have a family of my own! It all comes down to a post code lottery the end of the day! This is wrong! Help me get 100,000,000 votes and I can take this to the house of commons!!!!\r\n\r\nSurrogacy over plastic boobs!",
