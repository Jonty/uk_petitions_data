I.e shows like Britain and Ireland's next top model denying entry to people under a certain height.\r\nHow can we be surprised about rising rates of eating disorders and low self-esteem when the media is promoting a \"perfect image\" of people.  If the modelling industry showed that people of all shapes and sizes are beautiful then perhaps these cases of eating disorders and rates of self harm etc. would fall because individuals would not feel that they have to be stick thin and tall to be considered beautiful by society.
