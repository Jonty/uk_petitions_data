        "additional_details": "George Osborne has recently announced that the UK is \"willing\" to mke a loan of \u00a310bn to the IMF.This is immoral and makes a mockery of why we have raised taxation thresholds in this Country. We should not loan or give money to any other Country whilst tax on petrol is so very high, NI is at an all time high and VAT is at 20%. Especially when other countries have not placed the burdon of raised taxes on themselves.We request that British taxes should ALWAYS go back to the British people.",
