        "additional_details": "Currently, a \"cooling-off\" period only exists on car purchases which are made by phone or internet. As a car can be a huge investment, this should be extended to cover all purchases, and dealers should not be allowed to force a motorist to go through with the purchase if they change their mind within a set period.\r\n\r\nI propose that all finance purchases should be subject to a 30 day cooling off period. This applies to the car sold, and the finance arranged. If a buyer no longer wants a car then they will be entitled to hand in the car and keys and walk away, and the dealer allowed to keep any reasonable costs, eg deposit fees.\r\n\r\nCash purchases should have a cooling off period if the value of the car exceeds, say, \u00a32000 (a small dealership should not have to put up with hardship because of young people buying their first cars).\r\n\r\nFinally, an independent body should be set up to swiftly deal with any disputes, so that any grievances can be settled quickly and cheaply.",
