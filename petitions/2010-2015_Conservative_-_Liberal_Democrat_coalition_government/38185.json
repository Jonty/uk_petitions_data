        "additional_details": "It has recently been proposed in the UK that a network level censorship be put in place on adult content. To access this content you will need to 'opt-in' with your ISP.\r\n\r\nHowever I have a better idea that would satisfy those wanting to push this legislation forward and those wanting the internet to be 100% open. I propose that an ISP-level block simply be available to those who ask rather then forcing it upon everyone. If you are a parent who wants to block adult content you can simply contact your ISP and ask for a network level censor on adult content.\r\n\r\nI urge the coalition government to deny the request to implement a mandatory ISP-level content filter.",
