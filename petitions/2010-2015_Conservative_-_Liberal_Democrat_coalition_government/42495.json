If you had witnessed the repatriation of the men of 2 Rifles at Wooten Bassett you would agree to have been deeply moved.\r\nShe has now embarked on a hunger protest to force the government to review the legislation for service personnel and the families of deceased sevicemen/servicewomen killed on operations.\r\nAt present, it is a 2 tier system but Lucy wants it changed to a single, level playing field, in line with the Armed Forces Covenant that the government has pledged to uphold.\r\nThis petition needs to be debated in the commons, there is already a Facebook and media campaign running but you can appreciate that time is of the essence before the health of Ms. Aldridge is put in danger.\r\nHere is the Facebook campaign:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/#!/SupportLucyAldridgeMotherOfAFallenHero\r\nAnd here is her story:\r\nhttp://forcesdefender.tumblr.com/\r\n\r\n",
