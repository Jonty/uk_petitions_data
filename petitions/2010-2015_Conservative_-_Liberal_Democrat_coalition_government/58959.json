        "additional_details": "There are many Mobility scooters on the road these days and as suck I think the government need to step in with a compulsory CBT on these vehicles and their riders.\r\nA simple test on highway code, where they should be on the road or where they can go safely off road i.e. pavement.\r\nAlso a compulsory test every 12 months to make sure they are still road worthy i.e. lights, reg plate,\r\nmirrors and brakes.\r\nYes it is our responsibility as car drivers to make sure they are safe but like wise it is their own responsibility to also keep to the law of the road.",
