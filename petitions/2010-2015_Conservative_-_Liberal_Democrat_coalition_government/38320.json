        "additional_details": "From a look at the way airports around London have developed over the past 50 years, it is apparent that it has been haphazard and lacking in a comprehensive plan. The airspace around and over London is too crowded for safety as is the ground space and road access to London.\r\nThe Government needs both a short term and a long term plan for  future development of London's Airport facilities.\r\nThe short term proposal is to provide another runway for London, but at Gatwick, which has the capacity to cope.\r\n The long term proposal should be started simultaneously with the short term plan, and would be ready when the next call for expansion arises. This proposal is for the 4-runway airport in the Thames Estuary as suggested by the Mayor of London. Furthermore the sunken wreck containing explosives, which is seen as a deterrent to this development could be disposed of firstly by the use of flotation bags and towing the wreck into the North sea for contolled demolition.",
