        "additional_details": "We wish Her Majesty's Government to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty in this Parliament and give notice that the United Kingdom will withdraw from the European Union. Under the terms of the Lisbon Treaty, our Government is entitled to negotiate a 'trade only' arrangement with the remaining member nations of the EU. We believe the UK Parliament should be the only parliament with the powers to create legislation for our nation, including an exclusive right to control all immigration into the UK. The United Kingdom should be a sovereign, independent nation. ",
