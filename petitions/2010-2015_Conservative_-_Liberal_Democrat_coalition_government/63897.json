        "additional_details": "Independent Midwives, after a struggle of many years, have identified a workable, affordable insurance product that will enable them to continue trading as private businesses and providing maternity care for women who, for whatever reason, choose not to use the NHS maternity care system.\r\n\r\nHowever, the insurance product requires financial support from the UK government before it can be taken up to provide full protection for women and their families. The government have refused to provide this support, whilst at the same time seeking to provide publicly-funded insurance for private contractors at the Faslane nuclear weapons facility.\r\n\r\nThe petitioners undersigned believe that the insuring of weapons of mass destruction over women, babies and families is wholly unacceptable, and they call for the Department of Health to fully support insurance for Independent Midwives, to prevent this important choice being removed.\r\n",
