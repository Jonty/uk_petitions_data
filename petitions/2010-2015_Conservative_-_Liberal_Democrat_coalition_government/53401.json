We ask that the following campaigns cease and an investigation into the lawfulness of the public Twitter blaming be held.\r\n\r\nGo Home vans\r\n\r\nVans patrol areas with large billboards reading: \"In the UK illegally? GO HOME OR FACE ARREST\" and listing the number of arrests in the area in the last week.\r\nVince Cable has called the campaign \"stupid and offensive\" and we would add oppressive.\r\n\r\n#immigrationoffenders\r\n\r\nThe HO runs a Twitter campaign with messages templated like: \"X suspected #immigrationoffenders have been arrested in raids accross the UK today\". Accompanying are images (eg http://bit.ly/17WnAR0) of the arrests.\r\nOfficial news pages list the arrested as \"offenders\" more than once. This is a pre-judgement of the cases.\r\n\r\nThis in-your-face, socially networked activity is not how we would like justice to be carried out in the UK, and we believe it demeans those involved. Stop these campaigns now.",
