Unlike capital punishment, in the event of a miscarriage of justice, the victim can be adequately compensated.\r\n\r\nWe petition the government to review all treaties and international commitments which may inhibit the ability of Parliament to restore corporal punishment as a sentencing option for any crime that would attract a community sentence or more.\r\n\r\nFollowing this review, the Ministry of Justice should map out the necessary legislative steps which will be required to restore corporal punishment. The findings of the review and the necessary substantive legislation to be presented to House of Commons for debate no later than 12 months after this petition passes the acceptance threshold.\r\n",
