        "additional_details": "If you was to go into any of the dog pounds around the country you would see most of the dogs in there, are Staffordshire bull terriers all waiting for forever loving homes, you walk round and they all come to the door of their kennel hoping you are the one that is going to take them home,\r\nsadly not everyone wants a Staffie , all they want is to give love and be loved back,\r\nYet people who are after a bit of extra cash think \u201c oh if I breed a staffy I can make some money\u201d\r\nBut what they don\u2019t think about is what the poor dogs go through when they are born, basically they are BORN TO DIE!!\r\n\r\nSo I am doing what I can to help try and sort this problem out.\r\n\r\nLets ban the breeding of staffies and get the lovely staffies that are in the pounds into loving forever homes before we bring more puppies into this work that aren\u2019t wanted!!\r\n\r\nwe need the goverment to put a stop to people breeding staffies,\r\n",
