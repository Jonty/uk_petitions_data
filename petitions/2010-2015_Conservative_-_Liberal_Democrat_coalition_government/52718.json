        "additional_details": "The Liverpool Care Pathway is a tool that helps healthcare professionals focus on the last hours/days of a persons life.  It helps to provide holistic care and insure that medications that are needed are prescribed and any unnecessary interventions (which could be distressing for the patient) are stopped.  The LCP is supported by over 90% of doctors (in a recent survey by the BMJ) and should not be stopped due to negative press reporting but should be correctly reviewed and improved.  Trusts should provide full training to insure it is being used correctly by professionals.  Please support this petition and save the LCP!",
