We are, of course, concerned with what has been going on, but feel the priority is to calm the situation and do everything to ensure the conflict is resolved peacefully.\r\n\r\nWe also urge Her Majesty\u2019s Government to resist any pressure exerted by its allies, specifically the United States, to take sides. Furthermore, by not taking sides, Her Majesty\u2019s Government would be in the position of being able to act as an honest broker trusted by both parties in this conflict to ensure the conflict is ended sooner rather than later. We believe that remaining neutral would best serve the interests of the British people.\r\n",
