        "additional_details": "MCAD (Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) is a very rare genetic deficiency that is tested for in the heel prick at 7 days old. However sometimes that is too late to save the babies life. In pregnancies where the parents have already got history of MCAD, ie losing a baby to MCAD, the baby is given the heel prick the day they are born. I lost my little boy at 6 days old as he hadnt had his heel prick yet. If this early test can happen to the women who tragically go through this loss why cant every woman have the option of this early test and then the usual heel prick at 7 days old.",
