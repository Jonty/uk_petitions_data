This amalgamation will result in vastly increased class sizes, loss of teaching posts, greater traffic congestion around the identified new school location, already affected by congestion from Llantwit Major Comprehensive School, and a possible reduction in resources for the children attending the new school. Save Eagleswell Primary School and Llanilltud Fawr Primary School from closure!",
