        "additional_details": "We propose that, following his coordination of the #Riotcleanup campaign on Twitter, Dan Thompson be honoured in a way fitting to his contribution to communities across the UK. The riot clean up campaign brought together people of all ages and walks of life and ethnicities. It saved councils thousands of pounds and brought communities back together after the violence. We therefore ask that, in light of recent events, the Olympic Committee waive the deadline for nominating Olympic Torch Bearers and that Dan Thompson be accepted as nominee to carry the Olympic Torch for a part of the route, in recognition of the inspirational impact his campaign has had on community spirit across the UK.",
