        "additional_details": "Now that TB is on the rise, surely it makes sense to bring back the TB vaccination programme for all school children that use to go ahead in schools before the government decided to only vaccinate those that lived in high risk areas  It must be cheaper to vaccinate than it is to actually treat the condition.  We, the public would like the government to reintroduce the vaccination programme so every child is vaccinated.",
