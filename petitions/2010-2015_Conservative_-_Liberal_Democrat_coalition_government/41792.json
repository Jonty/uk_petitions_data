        "additional_details": "This roundabout & access road will be the only point of entry/exit onto Penrhos Road from the development of 245 housing units proposed by Redrow. This could potentially massively increase the already serious congestion problems on Penrhos Road, which in turn will increase the risk to pedestrians, further hinder the emergency services gaining access/exit to and from Ysbyty Gwynedd.\r\nThe Traffic Impact assessment carried out by Redrow was done so in August 2012 and was not a true reflection of the volume and congestion as it was carried out during the summer holidays. It is imperative you sign this petition to prevent this application from being granted.",
