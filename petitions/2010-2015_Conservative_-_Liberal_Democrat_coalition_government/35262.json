        "additional_details": "Make it compulsory for all new drivers to have a minimum amount of time undertaking motorway lessons after their test.  This is because so many people drive poorly on motorways in terms of indicating and correct lane options. Furthermore the government is spending millions on the building and especially the widening of current roads. If the current roads were used correctly the efficiency of them would increase dramatically and reduce the cost and environmental impact of the additional road space. ",
