        "additional_details": "Britannia Enterprise Centre is a small business community that is home to approximately 40 small independent local businesses providing a wide range of services predominantly to the wider local community.\r\n\r\nThe premises are owned by Hastings Borough Council (HBC) and have been leased for many years to the present landlord, who has been very supportive in assisting start-up and small businesses and instrumental in the success of many established local businesses.\r\n\r\nHowever, the future of the premises are under threat as the landlord has been issued an eviction notice claiming that he has not fulfilled the lease conditions.\r\nIn my opinion, HBC have an ulterior motive and are using this as an excuse to manipulate the properties for another use, as it is rumoured that the area has been earmarked for development.\r\n\r\nPlease show your support and not only save Britannia Enterprise Centre, but peoples businesses and livelyhood.",
