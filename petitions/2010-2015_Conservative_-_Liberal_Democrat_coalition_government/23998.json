        "additional_details": "With the majority of schools across the UK converting to academies more needs to be done on the standards of the food being served, especially during secondary education.  Standards have visibly slipped. My own school serves an assortment of junk with few healthy options available. Obesity is increasing rapidly in this country and it seems obvious why. For example my school not only serves an assortment of cakes and brownies but it slices them in half and fills them with cream too. How can a place of education be allowed to fuel are generation with complete junk food!? More needs to be done to implement healthy foods in are schools/academies. I want new legal standards for meals and food served in England's schools/academies to be passed by the government. ",
