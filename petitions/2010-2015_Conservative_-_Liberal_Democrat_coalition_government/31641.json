        "additional_details": "HMG should clarify whether racial groups practising their customs (like arranged marriages) have priority (or same priority) over believers\u2019 religious observances (like Halal slaughter). Which RELGIOUS PRACTICES so covered, if any?  Sikhs/Jews ethnic race, cult or religion? In Mandla v Dowell Lee (1983) House of Lords found that Sikhs constituted a RACIAL group when a Sikh boy was refused a place at a school because he wore a turban. The appeal was therefore allowed under Race Relations Act. This judgement was based on Sikhs long shared history & collective consciousness distinguishing them from other groups in customs, geographical origin, language, being recognised as a separate group in the surrounding community. Jews regard a person a Jew if born of Jewish mother. A person can be a Jew even if not practising Judaism. Surely belief in reincarnation would not require a believer to wear the insignias of Sikhism, Hinduism or Buddhism. So are they religion, race or both?",
