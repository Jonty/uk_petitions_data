The time has come for the Government to equally reward hard working, tax payers's who have never been a burden of the state. Who have paid into pension funds, only to see them taxed at the point of need.\r\nThis can't be fair, and provides little incentive to for a person to make provision for his or herself.\r\nI ask the Government to consider exempting pensions from tax.",
