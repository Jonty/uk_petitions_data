        "additional_details": " \"To kill a police officer is a particularly appalling crime.\" says the Home Secretary.\r\n\r\nTo the general public murdering a child or old age pensioner is an even more appalling so to give a life sentence for murdering a police officer and not giving an identical sentence to a child killer is discrimination of the worse kind possible.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to ensure that every person gets the same justice irrespective of their age, sex or occupation.\r\n\r\nA police officer is no different to anyone else and to say their life is more important is discrimination.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Home Secretary to ensure that every murderer is given the same prison sentence irrespective of the age, sex or occupation of the murdered person.\r\n\r\n",
