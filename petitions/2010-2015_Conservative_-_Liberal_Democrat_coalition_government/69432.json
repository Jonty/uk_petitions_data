        "additional_details": "Rotherham police commissioner Shaun Wright is defiant over calls to stand down amid claims he ignored the plight of child sex abuse victim & it appears he is accountable to no-one?  He is refusing to step down from his \u00a385,000 per annum position regardless of the abuse & suffering that took place whilst he has been in charge!  Please sign this petition to ensure the current government are aware of the growing disgust felt by the general public with regards to this matter,  in the hope that action is taken to remove Shaun Wright from his position.\r\n\r\n",
