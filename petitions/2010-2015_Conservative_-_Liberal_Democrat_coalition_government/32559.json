The latest budget is a disgrace, robbing the poor to feed the rich, typical Tory. I believe that it is time to organise a national vote of no confidence in this administration and rid ourselves of them. I also believe that it is time that a new political system was introduced into the UK one that does not give to the rich at the expense of the poor. WHO IS WITH ME ARE YOU READY TO SIGN UP TO THIS PETITION? This is a major step, one in which the ordinary citizen will take over from the rich. Are you with me? If so please sign the petition.",
