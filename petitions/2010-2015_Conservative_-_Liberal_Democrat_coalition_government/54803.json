        "additional_details": "With further unrest in Syria and the wider Middle East, petrol prices are on the rise again, I would like to propose that cost of any military action against the Syrian government is actually used to lower the price of petrol. Not that I nor the British public are for the deplorable use of chemical weapons in Syria, but with the Country still suffering from it's economic woes, I for one certainly don't wish to be dragged into another war with no clear exit plan. With costs of Storm Shadow missiles and submarine\u2013launched Tomahawks costing \u00a31.1million and \u00a3800,000 each (http://bit.ly/hkph3x). I feel this money is much better spent on offsetting the increased costs of war, even if the UK is not involved.",
