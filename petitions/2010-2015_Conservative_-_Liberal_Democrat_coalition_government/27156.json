        "additional_details": "Squatting needs to be made illegal, it is trespassing, damage to property, theft of utilities and often incurs threatening behaviour and breaking and entering.  The law should protect the tax payer, home-owner and law abiding citizen.  No-one should be allowed on your property without permission and for the home-owner to pay to live elsewhere and for legal fees to regain possession of their own property is ridiculous. It needs to be made a police matter and an arrestable offence.  The innocent people are the ones suffering whilst the squatters move from home to home causing havoc and ruining people's lives.  Make squatting illegal. ",
