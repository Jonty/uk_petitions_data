While we keep the list of proscribed organisations under review, it is Government policy not to comment on whether or not a group is under consideration for proscription.\r\n\r\nLegislation allows for a group to be proscribed in the UK only if the Secretary of State believes it is currently concerned in terrorism, within the meaning of the Terrorism Act 2000.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.",
