        "additional_details": "This is an online petition to show how many motorist feel that the changes to the MOT here in Northern Ireland is un called for and un justified. By the DVLNI printing 1 word incorrectly, cars with HID headlights MUST either have self-leveling or headlight washers even if they were manufactured without them. In England, Wales and Scotland they MAY have self-leveling or headlight washers and if none are there the benefit of the doubt is given, but if they are they must work! Please help support those who arent willing to pay hundreds of pounds to have this fitted for no reason other than a miss print. Thanks",
