According to the 1948 act of parliament we were promised 'Cradle to the Grave' care.  We have not had time to prepare for an alternate way of paying for our care.  Our property has been paid for by us and has already been taxed heavily on.  Had we known it was for our future care we wouldn't have struggled so hard to buy it  as we were already paying a third of our salary on taxes.\r\n\r\nPlease take into account contributions already made when accessing payment for care in our old age.\r\n\r\nSurely  this is unlawful or immoral.",
