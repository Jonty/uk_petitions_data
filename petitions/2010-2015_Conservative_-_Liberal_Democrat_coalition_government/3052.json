        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call the government to allow men the same autonomy in choosing whether or not to financially and legally support a child that women do. In circumstances of unwanted pregnancy the decision to terminate an unwanted pregnancy or give the infant up for adoption should remain the woman's right. Should she choose to raise the child, however, the man deserves the right to absolve himself of legal and financial responsibility for the child in the early months of his knowledge of the pregnancy or the child's existence.",
