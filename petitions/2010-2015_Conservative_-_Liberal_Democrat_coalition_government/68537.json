It is no longer acceptable to dismiss action against ISIS with a simple \"we support the Iraq government\". The US cannot win this battle alone, and waiting for others to act is a death sentence for thousands of people. The UK needs to take action from the air; targeted airstrikes is the very least we can do to help prevent a massive genocide.",
