        "additional_details": "The Scottish media/government does not wish to acknowledge the fact that the footballing authorities in Scotland are being openly unfair and biased against Glasgow Rangers in order to suit the agendas of corrupt leaders within the game. Completely unjust and, in some cases, illegal action is being taken against the club. The SFA, SPL and Scottish media are clearly openly biased against the club, and a full independent investigation should be launched to expose the lies, corruption, and shady dealings of those in power.",
