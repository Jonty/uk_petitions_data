        "additional_details": "At present if an individual receives a pension from any of the public services (Armed Forces/Police/Fire/Civil Service) these pensions are taken iinto account when deciding any state benefits.  Many individuals are unable to obtain employment after rhey have retired and may need to claim benefits.  Unfortunately the pension is used during the means testing, and therefore individuals are not getting state benefits (Employment/Housing) and are therefore forced to live in substandard conditions.  The Government MUST exclude pensions from means testing calculations.",
