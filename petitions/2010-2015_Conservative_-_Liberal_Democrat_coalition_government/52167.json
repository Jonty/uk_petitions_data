I would suggest 50mph for the slow lane with coaches and HGV's restricted to that. 70mph for the middle lane and 80mph for the fast lane. The only reason for moving from one lane to another, would be to change your speed of travel. The traffic should then flow and overtaking would not be allowed. You would be able to choose the speed that you would feel comfortable travelling at, but you must keep up to that speed. Anyone not wishing to drive at, at least 50mph should not use the motorway.",
