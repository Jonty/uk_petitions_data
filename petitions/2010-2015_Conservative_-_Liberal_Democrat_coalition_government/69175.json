Both acts are abusive and men, just as much as women feel the pain, both emotionally and physically of being slapped. What happens on television, films and in other media is blatantly gender inequality!\r\n\r\nI would like to see the government put a ban on slapping on television, pre-watershed. Children grow up thinking this is natural and an acceptable punishment.\r\n\r\nPlease sign below...",
