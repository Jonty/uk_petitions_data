        "additional_details": "Drones look set to fill the skies of the UK in the coming decades as a result of multinational companies such as Amazon seeing a business opportunity. UK citizens should be asked if they want the UK's environment to change in such a fundamental way, so that the sound of birdsong is in many areas set to be replaced by the humming of drones.\r\n\r\nLet's have a referendum to decide if UK citizens want their skies to fill with drones.\r\n\r\n",
