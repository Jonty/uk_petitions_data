        "additional_details": "Based on NHS figures, more than 100 victims of dog bites are admitted to hospital each week, a rise of 66 per cent in a decade.  5,221 people were treated during 2008-09 after dog attacks in England - up from 3,137 ten years earlier. The total includes 1,250 children, including many babies and toddlers.  These figures do not include victims seen in A&E who are not admitted, the true figure is much higher.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition recommends that the following practical solutions are included in a bill to bring this situation under control.\r\n\r\n1) In public places all dogs must be muzzled and on a non extending leash adequate for the pulling strength of the dog of maximum 5ft (1.5 metres).\r\n2) All dogs need to be registered and DNA fingerprinted or chipped and registered to an owner.\r\n3) All dogs need to be insured to cover for potential attacks to people.\r\n4) Insurance premiums to be reduced subject to attendance to an authorised dog training class with potential for a no claim bonus.",
