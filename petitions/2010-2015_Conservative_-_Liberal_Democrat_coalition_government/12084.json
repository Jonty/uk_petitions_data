        "additional_details": "Currently we are going through one of the worst economical times that the world has seen. And yet we are still sending foreign aid to countries that no longer need it. Pakistan is buying Chinese Fighter aircraft and we are sending \u00a3600Million in aid. Why have we not stipulkated that we will send aid as long as pakistan buys British or Euro Fighter aircraft, at least we would see a return. Instead of sending aid to Africa why do we not create a deal where we invest in Africa by sending technicians and engineers to make canals and de salination plants to put waterways across Africa turning the arid lands into arable lands. The costs would be incredible in the begining yet in the long term crops would be available world wide from the Central continent. Aid for tragedies is something we as a humane country should not ignore but we cannot afford to waste our finances without return of some sort.",
