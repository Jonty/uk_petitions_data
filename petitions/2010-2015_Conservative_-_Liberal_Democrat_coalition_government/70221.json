        "additional_details": "Schools and some educational TV shows have been portraying Florence Nightingale as racist, suggesting she rejected Mary Seacole from a nursing expedition because she was black. This is historically inaccurate as there is no evidence or indication that Nightingale was racist and it's unlikely she was even involved in the decision.\r\n\r\nTeaching kids that Florence Nightingale rejected Mary Seacole for being black is historically inaccurate and just flat out slander and needs to be removed from lessons and educational TV programs.",
