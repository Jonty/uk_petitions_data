        "additional_details": "Surrey police have released a new 'APP' on the iPhone and shortly the android system to track your local police officers in and around the Surrey force area. This App  also shows what the officers are dealing with. This is quite clearly at the very least an officer safety issue.\r\nPolicing Minister Nick Herbert said the technology will help deliver greater transparency.\r\n\"This new app not only gives residents in Surrey the ability to view what crimes are happening on their streets in a convenient format, but crucially provides them with live updates on where and how their local neighbourhood police teams are taking action to tackle issues.\"\r\nTechnology does have real value in today's modern way of policing but as for the location of officers?\r\nThe government need to stop this App before the criminal mind can use it to their advantage or an officer gets hurt.",
