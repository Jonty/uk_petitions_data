        "additional_details": "The over-use of seedless fruit leads to monocultures which can become prone to and possibly even wiped out by a disease. It leaves no natural reservoir of natural seed or variation.\r\n\r\nIn the shops, it is close to breaching monopoly law, in that the average person has no access to seed.\r\n\r\nOn a biological level, most fruits that are sterile, seedless fruits are not technically the fruits they claim to be!\r\n\r\nAn extreme possibility is the banning of retail selling of seedless fruit, it only allowed to be sold for commercial juice production.\r\n\r\nAnother would be to legislate that it is necessary to label that the fruit is SEEDLESS. Thus saving confusion, possibly also making it law that the species of the fruit be displayed on the label as well.\r\n\r\nThis law should apply to all fruit of which seedless varieties exist. bananas, lemons, oranges, pomegranate, grapes, apples, pineapples, cucumbers.
