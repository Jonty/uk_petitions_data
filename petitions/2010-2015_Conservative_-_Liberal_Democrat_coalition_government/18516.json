        "additional_details": "I believe that the amount spent on nuclear weapons should be decreased, and spent towards combating worldwide poverty.\r\n\r\nEvery year over 160,000,000 people die of malnutrition.\r\nThe amount spent on nuclear weapons- for one year- in the UK could result in NOBODY ever dying of malnutrition ever again.\r\n\r\nOther countries wouldn't attack; for there would be no possible gain- as gain is the reason for wars. If needed; Britain could make nuclear bombs much faster than many other countries- but they aren't needed in this current state. Malnutrition is a bigger killer than wars, and it must be addressed.\r\n\r\n",
