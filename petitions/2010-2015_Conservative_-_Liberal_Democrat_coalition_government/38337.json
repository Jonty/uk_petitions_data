        "additional_details": "Sheffield council are looking into closing 3 of Sheffield's main centres specialising in dementia. With the rising amount of patients unfortunate enough to be diagnosed with this illness, closure of such facilities will put strain on the patients as well as the families struggling to help their loved ones. Having 2 grandparents suffer from this illness I have witnessed first hand the devistating effects this has and how much help these centres give to those in need. Please sign this petition to help save these centres.",
