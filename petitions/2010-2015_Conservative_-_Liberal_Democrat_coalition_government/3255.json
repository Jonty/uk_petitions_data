        "additional_details": "EMA is a lifeline for many young people, throughout the UK. It allows young people to stay in education, without it many will be forced to leave school to find work. The government should not cut what is vital to the future of the country and social mobility. Young people did not cause the global financial crisis and the poorest in our society should not have to pay for it.",
