Since physical Gold and Silver is just that, physical, and also precious, it will always retain some value.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy do you think China and India have been buying as much Gold and Silver as they can? It's to protect their wealth and position in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for us Brits, Gordon Brown managed to sell half of our Gold reserves - right when the price was at its recent lowest! (This is Gordon's Bottom.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo protect the future value of the British economy, the Government should buy back the Gold that Gordon sold....and then some. Silver too.\r\n",
