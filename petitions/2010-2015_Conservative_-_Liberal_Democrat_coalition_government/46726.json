        "additional_details": "Peak times to be defined through consultation, and all Tractors and agricultural vehicles banned from using any main routes during these times. Moving machinery between farms and fields is essential for farming. However, agricultural traffic in certain areas seems to peak at rush hour. In areas of Lincolnshire for example, this frequently leads to commuter tail backs of up to a mile long. Causing lengthy delays, on a daily basis, for many people. The presence of these vehicles on the roads, which is currently heightened at rush hours, is unfair to many commuters. This petition seeks the common sense solution of forcing by law, the absence of agricultural machinery during rush hours/peak traffic times.",
