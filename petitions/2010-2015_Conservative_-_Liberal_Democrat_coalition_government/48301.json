        "additional_details": "We can still save the NHS.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th April 2013, supported by great public and political pressure, the opposition are going to the House of Lords to seek the annulment of the new NHS regulation SI 2013(257). Please sign this petition  in support of this action.\r\n\r\nThese reforms will allow large amounts of NHS funding to become private company profits. This will deplete the NHS leading to poorer standards of medical service for all, especially those who can't afford private healthcare.\r\n\r\nFor further information please see the following article;\r\n\r\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/healthcare-network/2013/apr/02/competition-rules-nhs-battleground",
