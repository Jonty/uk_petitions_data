        "additional_details": "The Government is about to embark on a badger cull in England, in a tragically misguided attempt to control the spread of bovine TB in cows. The cull will attempt to kill 70% of badgers in designated areas. It will be indiscriminate and virtually impossible to monitor;  meaning that  mainly healthy badgers which are slaughtered, destroying family groups and in some areas they may become extinct.\r\n\r\nIndependent scientific studies  have overwhelmingly shown that badger culling 'can play no meaningful role' in reducing bovine TB, and strongly suggest that it could make matters  worse in some cases, by dispersing infected badgers into clean areas.",
