        "additional_details": "I am petitioning the government to actively promote England & the English culture in a positive light by creating a Minister for England & an English Office which would bring us into line with the rest of the U.K.\r\n\r\nTo take back the Cross of Saint George from extremists & racists & fly it proudly alongside the Union Flag from all civic & muinicipal buildings as Scotland & Wales do with their flags.\r\n\r\nTo advertise England commercially as a specific country especially in tourism where England's identity is separate from other nations withing the United Kingdom which would hopefully encourage local investment, create jobs & raise revenue which could be reinvested back into England\r\n\r\nAlso I petition the government to proscribe Anglophobia & treat it like any other form of discrimination & hate crime.  England is a nation of over 50 million so its about time we had a voice & respect.\r\n\r\nEnd Anglophobia Right Now\r\n",
