        "additional_details": "Copper coins are a great inconvenience. They should cease to be legal tender and they should be withdrawn from circulation. Banks and supermarkets  should be required to exchange them at face value. When the 1p and the 2p coins have been abolished then the 5p coin will be the smallest denomination in circulation. This will cut down the weight and volume of change in peoples' pockets and it will recycle the hoards of unused change in circulation.\r\n\r\nAustralia did a similar exercise about 20 years ago and it developed solutions for rounding the amounts of cash transactions to end in 0p or 5p so that the correct change could  be given.
