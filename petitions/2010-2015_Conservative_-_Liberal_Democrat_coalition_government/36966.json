        "additional_details": "\r\nIt is clear that electrification of the Wrexham to Bidston line will be off the agenda until after 2019 at the earliest. In light of this it is suggested that at the very least a new half hourly services should be provided between Wrexham and Bidston calling at intermediate stations.\r\n\r\nA half hourly service will allow for improved connections at Shotton for services to North Wales and Chester and will improve the frequency of connections for passengers wishing to get to and from Liverpool.\r\n\r\nThe line itself could be of great use to many residents from North Wales, The Wirral and Liverpool. However at present the unreliable hourly service is not adequate and is putting passengers off using the service.\r\n\r\nAlthough the introduction of a half hourly service in effect will provide a doubling of capacity, it is believed increasing the frequency and reliability of the service will attract more people to use the line more often for leisure and commuting.
