In so far as, if you are an MP, you receive NO renumeration (in the form of salary) for carrying out the job you, basically, volunteered to do.\r\n\r\nThere should also be a 'cap' on expenses to tie in with the 'unpaid' positions and this cap should reflect what normal PAYE workers are able to claim for.",
