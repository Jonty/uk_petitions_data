The fraudsters then need to be treated in the same way as shoplifters are.\r\n\r\nOnce found guilty, the names and postal address(es) they use should be issued to Ebay, Amazon, Play, PayPal, online payment authorisation centres, etc.  Any organisation who has been passed the information and continues to allow a fraudster to continue stealing should then be charged with aiding and abetting and treated accordingly",
