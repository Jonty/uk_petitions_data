        "additional_details": "We ask the government to use overseas aid funds to provide the financial support needed by immigrants to the UK. These funds currently come from the budgets of other departments of central and local government. Immigrants' housing ,health, education and benefits costs should properly be paid from aid funds set aside for the benefit of non-EU foreign citizens. The use of overseas aid funds to support, for example, immigrants from Pakistan, should come from overseas aid allocated to that country.",
