        "additional_details": "Consistently news articles, social groups, religious groups and individuals claim, with no evidence, that violence in media outlets, especially computer games, has the effect of making people commit more crime, especially violent crime. This has been proven through countless studies to be completely false with absolutely no back up, and yet people are allowed to say it and report it like it is fact. Normally when slanderous or libel comments are made, action is taken, and yet for some reason these falsities are allowed to continued to be spread in this particular instance. This needs to be stopped.",
