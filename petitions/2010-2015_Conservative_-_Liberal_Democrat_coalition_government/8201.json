        "additional_details": "We have rioting on the streets of England.  Those young people do not have respect for authority or for their community. How do we change that?\r\nCompulsory National Service & Community Service for young people!\r\nThey will be made to get up early each day, present themselves smartly & do a day's work for their community.\r\nThey will learn how to take responsibility for themselves, to act together for good not against their community.\r\nThey will be doing something for their community but also for their country. They need to do this to develop a sense of Nationhood.\r\nThe government trialled this idea with the army in one area of England in the early 90's but dropped it.\r\nMaybe things would be different now if they had rolled it out nationally!\r\nAdd your name to this petition and let's change the future of this country! Thank you.\r\n",
