        "additional_details": "As it currently stands, between the hours of 4pm and 8pm, there are currently 13 trains that run from Woodford to Hainault via the Epping branch and 6 that run from Hainault to Woodford.\r\n\r\nHow Tfl can justify that all other 44 stations on the Central line are more important than Roding Valley, Chigwell and Grange Hill is beyond me. On average, the Epping/Loughton trains run every 3-5 minutes during these hours, leaving the rest of its fare-paying customers a 15-22 minute wait at the paradise resort that is Woodford Station.\r\n\r\nEnough is enough and this issue needs to be resolved - NOW.\r\n\r\nThere should be more trains that run between Woodford and Hainault in both directions. Better yet, why not just have a shuttle service every 10 minutes?",
