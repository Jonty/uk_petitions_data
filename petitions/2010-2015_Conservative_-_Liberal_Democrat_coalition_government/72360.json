        "action": "Remove pharmacy controlled entry requirements",
        "additional_details": "With the increase in pharmacist numbers there is an opportunity to increase competition into the pharmacy sector that can improve access and quality of pharmaceutical services offered.  The current system that is controlled by NHS England is archaic and out of touch with modern prinicples of a free market of supply and demand.  Existing pharmacies with a historical basis have little competition and therefore have little drive to be innovative.  I propose that removing the need for an NHS contract to dispense NHS prescriptions will create an open market where GPhC registered and regulated pharmacies can be free to innovate and therefore compete as 'any qualified provider' for services.",
