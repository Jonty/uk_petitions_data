        "additional_details": "A law should be enforced that criminals who have committed crimes that could endanger the public such as murder, rape, paedophilia have their committed crime tattooed onto their person. This will help deter future offences and make the public feel more comfortable and safe. This would also act as a strong enough punishment it could be an alternative to the death penalty which so many people of the UK wish to re-enforce. This will help to stop these crimes from occurring. The current punishment's for such crimes are simply not effective or strong enough.",
