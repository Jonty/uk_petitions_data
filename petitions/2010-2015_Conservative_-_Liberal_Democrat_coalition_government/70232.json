        "additional_details": "as of 01/10/2014 a vehicle tax disc is no longer a requirement to be displayed on a vehicle.  Along with this come different rules regarding the sale of a used vehicle.\r\n\r\nPrivate sellers are no longer allowed to sell a vehicle with tax.  This means, if you sell you vehicle mid month, you will only get a refund starting from the beginning of the next month.  However, the person buying you vehicle must now tax the car from the start of the current month, therefor the same vehicle is now going to be taxed twice as only complete months are refunded.  ",
