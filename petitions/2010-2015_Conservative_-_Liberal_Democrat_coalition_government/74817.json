This way there is still enough acceleration speed between 70mph and 80mph to aid in motorway driving and overtaking.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nPeople would not be tempted to speed in their cars. Some of the recent speeds recorded of people driving at 140+ mph is absurd and can only be achieved due to manufactures allowing the car to achieve these speeds in the first place. People are going to 'test' their cars to reach these top speeds and always have.\r\n\r\nIf you want to stop people speeding, restrict the vehicles speed in which they speed in. Simple.",
