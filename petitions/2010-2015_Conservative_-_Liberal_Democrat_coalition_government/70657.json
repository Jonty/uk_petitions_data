        "additional_details": "A simple question:\r\n\r\nHow is it possible that the EPC Energy Efficiency Rating of oil / gas boilers is better (higher band / score) than biomass boilers, which are considerably more efficient (>90%) & more environmentally friendly (less pollution / less carbon dioxide per year)?\r\n\r\nThe answer:\r\n\r\n1) Someone within a government department decided that wood pellets will be more expensive than oil & gas. It has been shown that wood pellets are considerably cheaper and the cost of oil & gas is steadily going up in price, whilst wood pellets are not.\r\n\r\n2) The software used to generate SAP EPCs has significant problems. HETAS & MCS have a detailed database of recommended renewable appliances with their tested efficiencies. SAP have their own separate databases, the PCDB for RdSAP EPCs & the SAP Appendix Q database for full EPCs. HETAS & MCS approved biomass boilers are not on the SAP databases & can not be used in generating EPCs - hence incorrect EPCs.\r\n\r\nJust use one database.",
