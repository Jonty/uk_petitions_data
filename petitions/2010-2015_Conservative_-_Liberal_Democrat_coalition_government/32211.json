        "additional_details": "Tickhill Town Council are intending to remove up to 80 Lime trees which line Bawtry Road as you enter our lovely village.\r\n\r\nWhilst we can appreciate that a few of them may need felling due to health and safety reasons the majority appear healthy and strong and have a high utility value to the community.\r\n\r\nNo independant report has been done to our knowledge or if it has it is not available.\r\n\r\nTickhill has a large conservation area within it, can you believe that these trees are not even protected by Tree Preservation Orders hence our Town Council don't even need planning to remove them, there has been no consultation with the village.\r\n\r\nSome say it's a done deal but until the diggers arrive we disagree. Please spread the word, Write a letter, sign the petition, something to help.\r\n\r\nFollow us on Facebook 'Save Tickhill's Trees' or on twitter.\r\n\r\n",
