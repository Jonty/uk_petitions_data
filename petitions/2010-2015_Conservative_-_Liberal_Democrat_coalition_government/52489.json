        "additional_details": "Bus fairs keep raising. However, young teenagers go out at night with their friends, but they may not be able to travel bas home. Either because they have lost their money, or acciendly spent it. Therefore, i think bus fairs should be free for under16's. Most teenagers do not have jobs, therfore they wont be able to afford to travel. It will also keep children safer on streets, as they can safely get home.\r\nOr teenagers should have to pay a reasonable sum of \u00a315-20 per year. They would then reseve a card for the buses, and would be ablre to travel for free.",
