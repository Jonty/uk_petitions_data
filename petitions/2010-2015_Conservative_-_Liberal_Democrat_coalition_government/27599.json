        "additional_details": "I would like the government to review the local councils policies on controlled parking zones and charges associated with being able to park. I would like the government to eliminate charges for controlled parking zones. users of CPZs are often not the primary users of the roads used to justify these charges and so this taxation is unfair. Charges should be limited to adminstrative charges only.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Lambeth, depending on your car you can expect to pay up to \u00a3300 to park your car outside your front door.\r\n\r\nThey charge \u00a318.75 per day and a book of five permits \u00a390 for Traders coming to work on your premises. This was increased from \u00a32.60 and \u00a310.40 respectively.\r\n\r\nDoctors on call in the borough permits are \u00a3400 increasing from \u00a3107. The price of permits for teachers living in Lambeth increased from \u00a3255 to \u00a3330.\r\n\r\nThese charges appear to be a veiled opportunity to tax those who have a car or are trying to get work down in the borough.\r\n",
