        "action": "Re open wilton wiltshire railway stations",
        "additional_details": "Wilton had two railway stations. One (later known as Wilton North) was opened by the Great Western Railway in 1856 on their line from Westbury to Salisbury, and another (later known as Wilton South) opened by the Salisbury and Yeovil Railway in 1859 on the West of England Main Line from London to Exeter. The arrival of the railways led to increased prosperity. The stations closed in 1955 and 1966 respectively; the nearest station is now at Salisbury. so now with the park and ride next to the railway line it would be a great time to open the stations esp now there is a new housing development being built Next to railway line as well so we should embrace the change and reopen the stations.This intern would lower the amount of traffic heading in to salisbury as more people would park at out of town parking also would allow commuters to commute from wilton as well as salisbury as parking at salisbury station is a nightmare in peak times as it is.",
