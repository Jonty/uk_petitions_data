        "additional_details": "Junior Doctors are being massively overworked. The 48 hours over 6 months period is not being monitored adequately and is not being followed in practice.\r\n\r\n-Doctors have to carry out self appraisals after working hours which is not being taken into account.\r\n\r\n-The handover process leading to most shift being overworked is not accounted for in the working hours.\r\n\r\n -The shifts are dangerously structured at times with more that 7+ days of working. which raises concern, given the additional stress of having to move between jobs and being accountable straight away . This is both dangerous for Doctor and Patient.\r\n\r\n-Government needs to ensure that self appraisals are only done during work hours and employers should accommodate this.\r\n\r\n-ensure doctors working hours are recorded and any excessive breech should be addressed automatically.\r\n\r\n- Better process around Rota generation, e.g algorithm based on doctors working preferences\r\n",
