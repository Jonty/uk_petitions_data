        "additional_details": "An arbitrary and accelerated increase in the state pension age is totally unfair and should not be introduced regardless of expected life expectancy. To qualify for full state pension you are required to have paid 30 years worth of national insurance contributions. Under the current plan I like many others are now being asked to work and contribute for 51 years for the same benefit as I started work at age 16 born in 1960. This is a totally unfair system which only becomes worse under the current plan.",
