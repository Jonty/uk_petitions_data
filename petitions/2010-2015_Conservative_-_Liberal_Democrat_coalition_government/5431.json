        "additional_details": "I suggest that the government issue 'war bonds' for this current (and probable) recession to the public with better rates of interest than the high street banks pay to reduce the cost of lending to UK PLC, and issue a better return to citizens on the basis of current bond rates plus 2 or 3 or 4 years so there is a win-win for us and our fine country. Cheap inward investment without strings attached.  I accept that the country already does this but make it accessible to everyone adn ADVERTISE it . A tenner here and a thousand pounds there and the debts could soon be covered off.  Then invest in UK businesses and rebuild GREAT Britain. Invest here not with Siemens.\r\n",
