        "additional_details": "Under Labour the state education system has failed the pupils of Britain miserably. Children fall into catagories as they evolve and are educated, typically there are Academics and Practicals. The Grammar School system needs to return for those who are gifted and do not have the luxury of wealth b them. Should a pupil show great academic abilities then he/she should have the opportunity to win a place at a School geared for such talents and should a pupil have lesser abilities yet show good practical abilities then equally he/she should have the opportunity to shine at a Grammar School geared to such abilities. A mathmetician will come from the academic side and a master builder from the practical side. The children of this country deserve the best, at present our education system is failing the youth of this country.",
