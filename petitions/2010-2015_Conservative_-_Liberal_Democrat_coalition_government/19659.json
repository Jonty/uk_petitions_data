The chancellor's budget has targeted the working classes, the poor, the disabled; whilst failing entirely to adequately tax the wealthiest members of society. This petition is to show the ConDem alliance that we no longer have faith and confidence in them, and demand an early General Election before the damage that they have done to our society, the NHS and the most vulnerable people in our country is increased any further.\r\n\r\nPeople are tired of banks, corporations and the very people who destroyed our economy with their greed going unpunished whilst the rest of the country bear the brunt of these cuts.
