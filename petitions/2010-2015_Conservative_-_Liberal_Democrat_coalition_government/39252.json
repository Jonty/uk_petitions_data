        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition if you believe prostitution should be legalized and regulated.  This should mean certain areas are set aside with indoor areas , or window prostitution. Such as in Germany, The Netherlands & Belgium.  Designated red light districts if you will.\r\n\r\nThe current set up in this country is daft to say the least. This is the oldest profession in the World and will never go away. Let's regulate it as best as possible. All girls should be subject to regular health checks and pay tax. Ok, so they won't pay all of it but at least they'd have to pay more than they are now.\r\n\r\nAll prostitutes should also be drug free and brothels should have CCTV, a manager and security.\r\n\r\nThis petition is nothing to do with street prostitution. That's an entirely different matter. ",
