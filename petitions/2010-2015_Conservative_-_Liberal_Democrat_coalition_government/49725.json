        "action": "A Tesco decision to label a children's chemistry set a boys' toy is damaging to the development of Children and wish to see change.",
        "additional_details": "By signing this petition you are stating that you wish Tescos to be forced to change the labeling of their Chemistry set from a boys to either a unisex toy or for the house's to consider if any sex labeling is indeed appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe scientific world is facing a shortage of women and those who sign this petition are in the agreement that Tesco's move could further increase that shortfall. We would like the houses to consider a bill that would mean any toys that have educational value do not be labeled in any form regarding sex. And in the future in the case of chemistry sets and the like sold in shops marketed at children, that they be by law advertised neutrally to all children regardless of sex.\r\n\r\nI wonder what Marie Curie would have thought of Tesco's position and I propose that any successful motion is named after her.\r\n\r\n",
