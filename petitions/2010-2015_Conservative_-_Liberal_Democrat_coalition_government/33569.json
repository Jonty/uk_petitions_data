        "additional_details": "Self proclaimed Captain of Industry \"Sir\" David Murray has taken a sporting institution in Glasgow Rangers to the brink of no longer existing.\r\n\r\nA club that was formed in 1872 and went on to become a world record title winning club with fans throughout the world spanning generations.\r\n\r\nFuture generations may not have the chance to support the team many of us have and we have been taken to this point by the actions of one man, David Murray.\r\n\r\nHe mismanaged the club for years, he sold it on to a man of very questionable means, morals and motives who then took us to the point we find ourselves at today on the precipice of liquidation.\r\n\r\nIn the same way that Fred Goodwin was removed of his Knighthood for almost bringing down an institution in RBS causing national outcry, I call on the Cabinet to remove the \"Sir\" from David Murray for doing the same.\r\n\r\nRegardless of what happens with the club going forward, David Murray is not a fit and proper \"Sir\".",
