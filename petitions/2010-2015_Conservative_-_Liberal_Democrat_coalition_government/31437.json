Having spent some time at a hospital recently I was horrified at the amount of hospital staff using mobile phones during normal working hours. One person in particular was hiding behind a computor screen whilst sending a \"Text\" message. I believe this is totally unneccessary and a complete disgrase. Mobile phones seem to have taken over from commitment and responsibility.",
