        "additional_details": "It is important we play our role in the world. Supporting others who are not as fortunate as we are (even in these hard times). However an unacceptable proportion of our aid goes to corrupt official/people. I believe this is easily corrected by paying our financial aid directly to international NGO\u2019s rather than to governments. By paying aid directly to NGO\u2019s we can be confident the vast majority of the money will be spent efficiently and most importantly it will reach the poor.\r\nWe can still, however, offer non-financial aid/support directly to third world governments i.e. by passing on our knowledge, experience and skills. For example we can help, train and develop their police force, hospitals, schools, business and transport systems. These are high intangible assets that we can offer that will truly develop a country, that will ultimately lead to self-sufficiency and offer greater independence.\r\n",
