Ministers are set to give their backing to proposals that mean moving in line with Central European Time, for trial period of three years. The changes would mean lighter winter evenings, which supporters claim would cut road deaths, boost tourism and reduced energy use. Do you think it's time for a change? thousands of British people want to stop being pushed more and more in line with the EU.\r\nTime change has been tried for 3 years before and it didn't work then so why will it work now?\r\nThere are arguments for and against time change this one is for a big NO.
