        "additional_details": "After sadly losing my cat due to being run over by a heartless driver who did not even stop. I discovered that cats are classed as 'free agents' where if they are injured/killed in a road accident, the driver does not have to report it by law. I would like to start a petition to have cats classed as \"legal property\". This will hopefully give cats more rights. Being classed as legal property will make it illegal for drivers to run them over without stopping and informing the police.\r\n\r\nBy people informing the police, it will help reduce the number of cats dying each year.  If an accident is reported quick enough, vets can give the injured animal sufficient help which  saves the cat's life thus reuniting them with their owner. For the cats which have regrettably lost their lives due to drivers, the owner will still be informed and can then make the correct arrangements. After all, it is best to know what has happened to your beloved animal than to not hear anything at all.",
