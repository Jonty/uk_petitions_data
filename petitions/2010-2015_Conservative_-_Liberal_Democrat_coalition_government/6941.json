        "additional_details": "This petition is to ban air brushed images in the media.\r\nIt creates unrealistic view of what people should look like as well as magnifying the visual effects of products.\r\nOn a simple moral level air brushing is effectively lying, it allows people to present themselves and products in an artificial manner. If their products work or models are that attractive then neither should require additional modification. ",
