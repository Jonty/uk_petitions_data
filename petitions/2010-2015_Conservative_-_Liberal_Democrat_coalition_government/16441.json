        "additional_details": "This closure is due to happen in the next couple of months, moving everything over to the new hospital at Pembury. This new hospital is over a 40 minute journey away down dark, unlit B roads and country lanes, one which is known for its accidents and this is without the poor weather (Colts Hill).\r\n\r\nWe have already lost our Maternity services to this hospital and Monkton ward is vital to the community of Maidstone and its surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nWith this closure and move to Pembury it is going to leave hundreds, if not thousands of families and children vunerable.\r\n\r\nMonkton has 24 beds and the 4 days I was there with my son, they were full. Pembury has just that, 24 beds and is there for Maidstone, Tunbridge wells and the surrounding areas, leaving not enough beds should they need it.\r\n\r\nThe decision to close this ward is going to cost lives and the only chance we have is if the Government step in and help us.",
