        "additional_details": "This petition is for the provision of a standard sized synthetic AstroTurf pitch in Towcester.\r\n\r\nSponne school is one of the few schools in the county without access to an AstroTurf pitch. This means that local sports clubs such as Towcester Ladies Hockey Club have to travel and pay to hire a facility from another school, it also decreases the access and participation to sport.\r\n\r\nThis pitch could be used for other sports as well as hockey such as football.\r\n\r\nThis local service provision would improve access to sport, improve community spirit and improve facilities as grass roots for future generations.
