They do not have human rights as they have displayed themselves to be animals. So bring back stocks where they will be displayed in public and public humiliated by the throwing of rotten veg at the imbecile. Although this could be rather unfortunate for those in the stocks as it would now include Melons, Pineapples, etc. but none the less more satisfying for the victims!",
