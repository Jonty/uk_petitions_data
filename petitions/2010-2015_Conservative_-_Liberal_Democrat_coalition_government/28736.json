        "additional_details": "This petition calls on the Westminster Government to convene a Recession Summit with representatives of the big six energy companies, the big supermarket chains and high street banks.  Its aim would be to help struggling families.The big six energy companies would improve on the 5% reduction in domestic energy bills announced by some suppliers effective from February 2012.  This would more reasonably reflect the 9.2 % fall in wholesale gas prices since November 2011.The big supermarket chains would contribute to the recession package by offering free dairy products namely, bread, butter and milk to families where one or more of the adults are unemployed and entitled to unemployment benefits.\r\nHigh Street banks should be encouraged to introduce a freeze on charges for overdraft facilities.\r\nThe Government should lead by example by abolishing VAT on domestic energy bills\r\n\r\n",
