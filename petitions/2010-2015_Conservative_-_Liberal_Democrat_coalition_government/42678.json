B, Tantamount to prejudice and C, An attempt to divide the British people into separate racial categories.\r\n\r\nWe also question the terminology used i.e \"White\" which surely should be \"Caucasian\".\r\n\r\nPlease legislate to have the two options of \"White British\" and \"Black British\" merged into the singular option \"British\".",
