It is insufficient that Management are merely replaced within Hospitals when such incidents come to light. All patients deserve to be treated with compassion, care and full attention regardless of their background or reason for being hospitalised. The government needs to ensure that all Managers in charge of Hospitals are held legally accountable for failing in their duty of care.",
