        "additional_details": "Please support this petition so that there can be a proper debate on the need for the Goverment to fully compensate children disabled as a direct result of the vaccination program.\r\nA responsible Government has a duty to protect the population from disease through a vaccination program AND therefore has a morale duty to full compensate the victims of this program.\r\nThe number of children affected as a percentage of the population is very small so there is no excuse for not doing this.\r\nThe Government needs to set up a fund based on possiblity a levy charged on each vaccine administered or some other funding mechanism. The fund should then be used to fully compensate all who are severely disabled as a direct result of being vaccinated. The payment could be a lump sum or a guarenteed annual payment for the life of the victim.",
