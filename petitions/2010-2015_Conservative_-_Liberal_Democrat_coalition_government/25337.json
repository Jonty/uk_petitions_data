        "additional_details": "At present immigrant workers from within the EU are entitled to claim benefits when out of work in this country as soon as they arrive, thus encouraging Economic Migrants coming here to claim more in benefits than they can earn by working in their own country.  This prctice is costing the UK Taxpayer \u00a3millions per year.\r\n\r\nThis is a requirement of the EU Treaty and is wrong.\r\n\r\nI want the government to renegotiate the EU Treaty to gain a change so that Immigrants will only receive benefits equivilaent to benefits they would receive if they were out of work in their country of origin. (even if that is zero) and that the cost of those benefits are passed back to their country of origin.\r\n\r\nThis would not discourage immigrants moving to work, but would discourage Economic migrants.",
