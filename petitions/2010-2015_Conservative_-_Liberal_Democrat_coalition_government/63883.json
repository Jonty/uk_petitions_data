        "additional_details": "As a resident of York I am passionate about my community. I have canvassed 3,000+ residents and we all feel the development, as approved, is good as it utilises a brown-field site and is for a fine mixed use site. All of those canvassed agree that this development, as approved, will complement the existing community providing the approved plan is maintained, not altered.\r\n\r\nWhilst a substantial number of trees have been felled the retention of those left is key to ensuring a harmonious and successful development.\r\n\r\nOur concern is that the developer has already felled trees marked for retention and we have been told verbally by developer representatives that they will be removing more trees.\r\n\r\nThe action we are asking the government to take is to not permit the developer to fell any further trees throughout the phases of the development.\r\n\r\nWith sincere and grateful thanks for the amazing support I have received to date.\r\n\r\nTina Fowler     07927 937 569\r\n",
