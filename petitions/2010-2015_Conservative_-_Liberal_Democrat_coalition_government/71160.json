However, if you visit seaside towns and tourist resorts up and down the country, you will see young children in the arcades gambling on slot machines. It is silly to ban underage gambling in one place and then not regulate it a few miles down the road.\r\n\r\nA few people may say its only small change, a few pounds... a bit of fun... but this is what almost every seriousely addicted gambler says when they first start down that rocky and expensive route.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to see to it that ALL premesis with paid games that allow you to win money or vouchers etc are strictly regulated to stop underage individuals from being allowed to gamble without exception.",
