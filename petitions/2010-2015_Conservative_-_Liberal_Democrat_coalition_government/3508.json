In many parts of the country there simply is not a legal network of trails open to cyclists, or too little to be meaningful.\r\n\r\nCyclists should be allowed to use the footpath network to pursue the sport of mountain biking, this would help to promote activity amongst young people, especially as the roads become increasingly congested.\r\n\r\nShared use of all paths and trails has been successful in Scotland and could be throughout the rest of the UK.  It will spread the density of mountain bikers further reducing the potential for trail conflict and the (disputed) erosive impact of bikes on the trail surfaces.\r\n\r\nThere are no costs involved (we don't need special gates or access) this is just a re designation exercise to make a bicycle an extension of a pedestrian on the footpath network (with the exception of roadside footways)",
