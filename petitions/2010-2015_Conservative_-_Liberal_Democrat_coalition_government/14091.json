The entire bottled water industry is a perfect example of the commercial world creating a need for something we don't need, let alone the damnage it does to the envoirenment.\r\nThe concept of an eco tax is well established.\r\nI would like to see an eco tax levied on all bottled water and the money spent on saving the planet.",
