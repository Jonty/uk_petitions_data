        "additional_details": "Remove all privileges from prisoners while in UK prisons, e.g. Playstations, TV, pool tables, gyms. How many people do you know come out of prison and say that it was easy, \"like a holiday camp\" and a \"good laugh\". Prison in the UK is not a deterrent to people, hence the reason the re-offending rate is so high. If these people spent more time reflecting on why they are in there, they might be a more productive person to society when they are released. ",
