        "additional_details": "We are calling for the Government to step in and implement Regulation of the Freehold / Leasehold Property Management sector.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is because thousands of Retirement Leasehold, Leasehold and Freehold property owners are tired of being ripped of by property management companies that feel it is okay for them to charge extortionate fees for little service.\r\n\r\nWebsites such as TheTruthAboutSolitaire, CARLEX and Peverel Action Group, boast communities of residents who are fed up with being overcharged by these companies and want Government regulation.\r\n\r\nPrior to the May 2010 Government change, a previous ePetition had obtained thousands of signatures calling for help.\r\n\r\nGrant Shapps is all too familiar with our plight, along with other MPs nationally.\r\n\r\nMr Shapps has previously stated in writing that he believes the current system in place is more than adequate for residents.  However, those of us living in properties affected by this disagree with his opinion.",
