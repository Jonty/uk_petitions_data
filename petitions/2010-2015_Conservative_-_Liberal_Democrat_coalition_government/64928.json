        "additional_details": "As the majority of the British public would agree, Halal slaughter and torture is a repulsive, barbaric 7th century act that has no place in our western civilised society.\r\nHowever our governing elite will never push for such a reform in fear of 'offending someone'\r\nTherefore, we must push for piecemeal improvements for our cause, and this is the first step.\r\nRaising taxes to a high level on all Halal products primarily acts as a disincentive to consume, and those who continue to demand it will have to pay huge sums - quite rightly.\r\nHigher taxes and duty on imports will also raise revenue, so instead of cutting elderly peoples pension and reducing the size or our armed forces, they can tax sheer evil instead.",
