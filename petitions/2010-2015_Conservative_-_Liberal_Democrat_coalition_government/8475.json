Their lives are often blighted by a small minority of repeat offenders who see the legal system as a joke.\r\n\r\nDuring the recent riots, many of the people identified as taking part were known trouble makers to the Police.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned request that the Goverment immediately debates the concept of \"3 Strikes and You Are Out\" where anyone convicted of a third violent or anti social crime would automatically spend the rest of their lives in prison.\r\n\r\nThose who repeat violent and anti social behaviour have no place in a civilised society and should be permanently removed from it.",
