        "additional_details": "Human life is precious and people who are labelled \u2018gravely ill\u2019 may feel that it is expected of them to agree to euthanasia out of duty & consideration for their relatives\u2019 needs and convenience. Large doses of morphine for 'pain killing', decision that a patient not to be resuscitated or no further treatment is required (but only \u2018tender loving care\u2019) can have the same effect as 'assisted suicide'/euthanasia. The patients\u2019 informed consent or their informed relatives\u2019 consent (if available) should first be sought BEFORE deciding on large doses of pain killing drugs or not for resuscitation (or withholding further treatment). However it is wrong to withhold basic nutrition to patients. The decision by a consultant that no further treatment or resuscitation is required should be made widely open to appeal by the patient and his/her relatives or next of kin under hospital appeal\u2019s procedures, not by merely by Judicial Review in the High Court.",
