This is particularly evident in cases regarding religion.\r\nI.e.\r\nSikhs crash helmet exemption - Sikhs can wear a turban instead of a crash helmet where everyone else is expected to have a helmet by law.\r\nBurkha-Niqab allowable in banks/shops - A Muslim woman can choose to cover her face in a security area whereas anyone else would be expected to be identifiable.\r\n\r\nI believe that religion should play no part whatsoever in law. If we are all truly equal then a RULE FOR ONE, MUST BE A RULE FOR ALL.\r\n\r\nNO EXCEPTIONS regardless of your religion, race, sex, sexuality etc...\r\n\r\n\r\n",
