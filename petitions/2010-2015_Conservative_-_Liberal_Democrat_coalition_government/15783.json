Although it will be moved to Comedy Central this will only be available to those who subscribe to satellite or cable television.\r\n\r\nIn these times of economic downturn, rising energy prices and global conflicts programmes such as Friends have to be available to the masses.\r\n\r\nI suggest that Friends is taken up by another freeview channel (possibly BBC Three as it's awful anyway) and shown for all of Britain to view.
