Why haven't they gone into other countries like Zimbabwe where human rights are zero. We are blindly following the USA into conflict with countries who want to print their own money. The Americans don't want this so they are creating false impressions the countries are being run by dictators. Libya loved gaddafi, don't believe the BBC!!!! ",
