HRRWT.\r\nThere are more and more people taking up horse riding on the public roads/highways without much if any formal training,\r\nThe rider will also need to wear high viz vest so other roads users have a chance to see them.  If its possible the horse should wear a kind of nappy to stop messing on public roads/highways which could become dangerous for other road users especially motorcyclist.\r\nHorses and riders trained to a standard where horses can withstand & remain under control of the rider when a loud or sudden noise is exposed to them.  A minimum Rider age of 17 should be imposed if they want to ride oh public roads/highways.\r\n\r\nCost of training to paid for by owners",
