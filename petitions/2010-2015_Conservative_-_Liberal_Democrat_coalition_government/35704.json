        "additional_details": "All claimants would be required to work a minimum of 1 day (5 hours) community service per week to be eligible to receive Jobseeker's Allowance.\r\nThis would help claimants to have a positive impact on the community as well as cut into the expenditure currently set aside for JSA.\r\nI believe that people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance rightfully would welcome the contribution to the community. I also believe that this would help to reduce the cost of community projects to the government, whilst still enabling the projects to go ahead as planned.\r\nThe role that claimants partake in these projects could be tailored to provide experience in the area of work that they wish to have a career in. This would be a major step in gaining the crucial work experience that employers seek.\r\n",
