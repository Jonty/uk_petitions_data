        "additional_details": "Balisongs are very unique and special knives, they are no different to other knives but yet the World makes them illegal, no different to the knife me and you use to cut our meat, fruit and vegetables, but has two long handles and can fold, they are much safer to use and  swifter, it has risen over the years from a knife that used to be used for fighting to an art of culture. Just because they have been used for crime it does not mean the should be illegal because house knives, cars, bats and guns are used for crime more than balisongs, but are they illegal? No, the solution to solving how much something is used for crime is not to ban them but to make them need an ID when buying, we understand that guns need an ID and are illegal in the UK, but they could be stolen, just like cars, bats, house knives and balisongs can, these knives should not be illegal but allowed and something must be done about crime and not what is being used for crime, but this petition is not about crime.",
