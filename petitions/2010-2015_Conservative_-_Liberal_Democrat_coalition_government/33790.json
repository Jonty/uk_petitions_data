        "additional_details": "During these times of austerity, how often have you gone to the supermarket in pursuit of a \u2018special offer\u2019, only to find that it is sold out?  This often happens within minutes/hours of the offer having started, even though it is advertised to run for several days or even weeks.  This is an immoral business practice, designed to lure people into the shop, chasing a non existent offer.\r\n\r\nSupermarkets should by law, be made to honour any \u2018special\u2019 offers, either by substituting for an item of equal quality or value, or offering customers a promissory note, which can then be redeemed, when the product is back in stock.  This should also apply to the vouchers found in newspapers and magazines, offering free products.\r\n",
