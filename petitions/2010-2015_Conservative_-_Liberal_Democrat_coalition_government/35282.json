        "additional_details": "Between 1 -4 children die as a result of abuse or neglect in the UK every week. This figure has been consistent since the 70\u2032s. Nearly a quarter of young adults are sexually abused in childhood. (*NSPCC).\r\n\r\nWe believe the present child protection system to be 'unfit for purpose', demonstrated by the same\r\nfailings and mistakes  shown in various SCR's and Inquiry's over the years.\r\n\r\nWe are aware of the ongoing Munro  Review and the suggestions made for reform of Child Protective Services.\r\n\r\nWe hope this is a genuine attempt by your government to adress the underlying causes and root problems within the system and in practise. No lip service, no more empty promises.\r\n\r\nWe urge you to do everything possible to keep child protection issues at the top of the political agenda, and to ensure that this time, you will deliver the real, lasting and effective social reform that vulnerable children desperately need.\r\n",
