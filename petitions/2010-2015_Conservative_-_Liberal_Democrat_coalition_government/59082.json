        "additional_details": "Nigerians across the world have noted the recent Prisoner Transfer Agreement signed between the UK and Nigeria.\r\n\r\nWhile we agree that this agreement carries significant benefits for both countries, we are deeply concerned and worried that Mr James Ibori might be a beneficiary of this agreement.\r\n\r\nThere can be no benefit to Nigeria in including Mr Ibori in this deal. He remains a wealthy man who continues to wield significant influence at least in the politics of his state.\r\n\r\nWe are hereby calling on the UK government to exclude Mr Ibori from any prisoner transfer agreement between both countries. Mr Ibori should complete his prison term here in the UK.\r\nAllowing him to return to Nigeria will be as good as setting him free as wealthy people find it easy to circumvent the laws in the country.\r\n\r\nPLEASE DO NOT RELEASE JAMES IBORI AS PART OF THE PRISONER TRANSFER AGREEMENT",
