        "additional_details": "3 ways to improve, far to many people drink and drive causing lots of deaths. 3 ways to improve so that people people don't away with it and harsher sentences.\r\n\r\n1. The breathalyser (that Policewomen & Policemen) use at the roadside for drink drivers should count, in courts, so there's no need for another breathalyser. This would be more accurate because the breathalyser takes place when the drink driving offence took place and it would save time.\r\n\r\n2. It should be the average of the 2 breaths and should count, not the lowest, that is a more fairer and accurate way.\r\n\r\n3. The drive drink limit should be lowered from 80 mg micrograms of alcohol in 100 ml of blood, to 50 mg micrograms of alcohol in 100 ml of blood, this would stop more drink drivers getting away with it, and it would send out a clear message stating that Drink Driving is wrong.",
