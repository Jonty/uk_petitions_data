        "additional_details": "I propose that the minimum age for drinking alcohol should be raised to 21. There is a growing health problem in this country from people drinking too much. Some of these are people who will drink no matter what the legal age is but some are people who would benefit from starting drinking 3 years later. It would improve peoples health and save the country a lot of money in health and support costs.",
