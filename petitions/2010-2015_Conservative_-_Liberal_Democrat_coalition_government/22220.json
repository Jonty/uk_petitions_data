        "additional_details": "At the moment , a woman in divorce can claim a spouse maintenance over and above what a man pays in child maintenance. This means that any woman who leaves her husband for another partner can claim a monthly sum from her ex partner even if she then goes on to become much wealthier than the man who has to pay her.  My proposal is that spouse maintenance should only be awarded where the husband earns over \u00a3150,000 a year , and for periods of no more than 4 years without a court based review of the financial status of both parties.",
