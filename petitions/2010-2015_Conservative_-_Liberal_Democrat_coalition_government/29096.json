Spitting is banned in some countries and it should be banned in the UK.  Please sign the petition and spread the word, rather than allowing this vile habit to spread.  We need at least 100,000 signatures to make this eligible for debate in the House of Commons.  If you want change, sign now.  Thank you.",
