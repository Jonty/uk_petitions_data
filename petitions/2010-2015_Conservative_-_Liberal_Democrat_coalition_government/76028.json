        "additional_details": "I think the rules of the fa are unfair. I've read that in the 2015-2016 season under 12's will not be allowed to compete on a competetive basis against each other. I think this is unfair because I really enjoy playing football with my team but there is no point of winning? I do not agree with the rules. I hope you all understand my petition and you can support all of the under 12 footballers. Thanks Blake, JDG Athletic.",
