        "additional_details": "The Government should heed the \u20184Growth\u2019 campaign and invest the proceeds of the 4G spectrum auction in unlocking the UK's high-tech growth potential.\r\n\r\nSecuring a sustainable recovery from economic crisis depends on backing science and technology. The \u20184G\u2019 auction only exists due to past publicly-funded innovation.\r\n\r\nWe could become a world-leader in innovation again if investment in science & technology is prioritised. The 4G windfall gives us the opportunity to jump-start this process in four key areas:\r\n\r\nTalented researchers and innovators; ensure that the UK is home to the world\u2019s top scientists and engineers\r\n\r\nScience & technology infrastructure; make Britain the place to be for accessing cutting-edge facilities\r\n\r\nApplied technology; create new avenues for blue-skies research to be turned into social, health, and economic gains\r\n\r\nBacking entrepreneurship; fill the finance gap which stops businesses bringing new technologies to market",
