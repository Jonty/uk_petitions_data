        "additional_details": "Everyone who has a telephone has to pay to use the line, so why should random callers be able to try to sell people things that in the vast majority of cases the person doesn't want? These people spend money to have a private phone line so why should they have to be harassed by salesmen from many different companies? This wastes time for many people when they would prefer to be doing something else.\r\n\r\nI propose that the government must enforce a ban on these sorts of call, unless the caller has legitimate business with the receiver.
