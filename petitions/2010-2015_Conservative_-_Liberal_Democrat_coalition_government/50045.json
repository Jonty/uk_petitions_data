Therefore, I propose that everyone on the electoral is to receive unbiased information on the political parties they are able to vote for in upcoming elections. This should help reduce the number of votes for far right extremist parties such as the BNP. As well as this, it will allow all voters to unserstand the choice they have to make. If this idea were to enter into force, we would have a government elected fairply by the public who make a reasoned and accurate decision based on their opinion and not based on being bombarded by propoganda which may not always give a true reflection of the political party it is promoting.",
