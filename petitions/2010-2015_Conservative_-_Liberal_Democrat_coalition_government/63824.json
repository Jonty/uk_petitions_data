How galling it must be for you to know Cathy Ashton, an overpromoted civil servant is now being shown as MUCH, MUCH more important than you in the grand scheme of things?  Perhaps this will drive you to give us our referendum so we can get ourselves OUT of the EU.  Just think, were that the case you might be able to demand a seat at the meeting which you say you have an important contribution to make.",
