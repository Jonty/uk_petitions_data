As a member state and High Contracting Party to the Convention, Britain has a responsibility to ensure that this protection is achieved. But it is deeply alarming in the lack of British Government\u2019s response to the developing crisis in Gaza, in particular, the situation for Palestinian civilians.\r\n\r\nIt is disgraceful that our government is arming the state of Israel to continue its slaughter of Palestinian civilians including women, children and the aged. We are devastated by the sight of the severely injured and the dead Palestinian Children, Women and the Aged and our anger is towards the Israeli war machine.\r\n\r\nWe ask the UK Government to STOP supplying Military Aid and Equipment to Israel and isolate apartheid Israel and impose sanctions now!\r\n\r\n\r\n",
