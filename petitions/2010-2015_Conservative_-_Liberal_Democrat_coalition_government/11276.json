WE are breaking the law by paying Council Tax.\r\nCouncil Tax was also introduced as a temporary measure.\r\nThe things that Council Tax purports to fund are already funded by Income Tax, VAT and other income-base taxes.\r\nTaxes are proportional sums paid according to the MEANS of the individual.\r\nWhilst irresponsible to ask for a refund of all over paid and illegally obtained monies, we simlpy finish off paying the years' 'Bill' and cease this fantastic Tax altogether.",
