Hopefully they would all choose to stay part of the United Kingdom. England should then have a referendum on EU membership. If we vote to leave the EU, we would trade with them under WTO [World Trade Organisation] guidelines. Most importantly the government should then seek to maximise trade with our Commonwealth partners.\r\n",
