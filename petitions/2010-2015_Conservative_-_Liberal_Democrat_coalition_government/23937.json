Within this framework, day to day decisions about expenditure remain the responsibility of the BBC Executive.\r\n\r\nUnder the terms of the BBC Agreement, the Trust has responsibility for commissioning value for money investigations into certain areas of BBC activity. The  Agreement was amended in September 2011 to give the NAO full rights of access to the BBC\u2019s accounts and to give the NAO the final say in deciding which areas of BBC expenditure should be subject to investigation. The Trust and NAO  regularly discuss the scope of the audit programme.\r\n\r\nThe Government believes it is important that the Corporation is aware of the concerns of television licence payers. If you have not already done so, you may therefore wish to raise your concerns with the BBC direct at Broadcasting House, Portland Place, London, W1A 1AA."
