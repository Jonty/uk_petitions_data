        "additional_details": "Nick Clegg should be removed from government as his statement to uphold Human Rights does not reflect the will of the people when those that commit acts of crime use and are allowed to use Human Rights as a means of defence. The Government has a duty to uphold and support law abiding citizens and Mr Clegg by not allowing reform of Human Rights is abusing every law abiding citizen in the country.",
