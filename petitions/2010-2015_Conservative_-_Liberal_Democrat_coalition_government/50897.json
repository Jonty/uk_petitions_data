William Hague uses up huge amounts of taxpayer pounds on personal and physical security so will not be under threat from those weapons.  The people of this country are persuaded to carry on as normal in the face of terrorist activity, it is only right, therefore, that they be given a chance to vote whether or not they wish to increase that risk to exponential levels by giving weapons to the people who will be looking to kill them in the future.",
