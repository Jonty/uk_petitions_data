The Council\u2019s Cabinet approved the recommendation to commence consultations on the proposal to redesignate the school as a Hospital Pupil Referral Unit.\r\n\r\nPHS is currently a school of among 30 pupils who cannot attend mainstream school for a number of reasons. These do NOT all have a disability or specific illness.\r\n\r\nPHS gives a number of pupils the chance to achieve, gain qualifications and believe in themselves. If the re-designation goes ahead, only children with a medical certificate OR a child reffered from mainstream school can attend - and places are limited. If a mainstream school wanted to refer a pupil to PHS, any costing falls on them. Mainstream schools will NOT do this because of the cost.\r\n\r\nDO NOT FIX WHAT IS NOT BROKEN!",
