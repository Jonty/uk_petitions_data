        "additional_details": "Recent media coverage exposed multinational companies operating in the UK without paying the legally required taxation.\r\n\r\nIn some cases HMRC has been accused of 'negotiating' a special discount for the company on what is owed, resulting in tens of millions of pounds loss to the UK economy and corporations avoiding paying their real debts.\r\n\r\nI propose that the power to 'negotiate down' any unpaid corporate taxation bills exceeding \u00a31 million be removed from HMRC. Instead a cross-bench parliamentary committee be made responsible for examining in public each case, and making binding recommendations to the Chancellor for implementation through HMRC.",
