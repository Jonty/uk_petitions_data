        "additional_details": "The law sets out that if you are entering a public building, you cannot have anything covering your face/head. No hoods/helmets etc.\r\n\r\nThe Burka should also be including in the category as there is no way of proving who you are behind a Burka.\r\n\r\nMy old driving instructor told me a true story of how a woman dressed in a Burka took the driving tests for 4 other women and passed their test for them. This is fraud and crimes like this are happening all over the country - even at our borders.\r\n\r\nI am not a racist at all, I just think it is very discriminating against all non-Muslim people. If we covered our faces with anything we would be turned away or if we were persistent in staying in the building the police would be called.\r\n\r\nThe Burka should be banned in public areas.\r\n\r\nPlease sign if you agree.",
