British principal dictates that we should disarm civilians and assist the Syria Government in so doing in order that a political opposition party if any may be formed and a democratic election held. If terrorists are disarmed then there will be no more people killed and no refugee problem.\r\nCurrently ordinary citizens are being used by terrorists as human shields and although clearly the fault of terrorists the Government are blamed for defending its people from same. Supplying arms or anything to the Terrorists will only serve to cause more deaths and prolong the terrorist struggle to overthrow the government by force. Promote democracy.\r\n",
