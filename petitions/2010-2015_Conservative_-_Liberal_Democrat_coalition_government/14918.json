Seeing as they cut the red tape allowing the banks to act recklessly its about time they made a sacrifice.\r\n\r\nI propose that the Houses of Parliament moves to the Olympic Stadium after London 2012.  It has the transport links and all the necessary infrastructure to accommodate all of our MP's.  The Houses of Parliament and all of the land it comes with can either be sold to the highest bidder or can be used as a tourist attraction.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, i am serious about this!",
