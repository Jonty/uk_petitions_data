The acid from the bird droppings will eat through machinery, roofs, wood, steel, metal and paint. Bird droppings can also clog ventilation ducts and obstruct drainage systems. Birds will nest in the gutters and clog them up. Birds expect to be fed by people and have become aggressive,. Bird\u2019s nests and droppings can contain a variety of pest insects and disease bacteria that can be passed on to humans\r\nWe, the undersigned, call upon the Department to undertake national Pest Control initiatives\r\n\u2022\ttrapping,\r\n\u2022\tegg pricking or oiling,\r\n\u2022\tscaring,\r\n\u2022\tproofing.\r\n\r\nPlease help us to do this for our community by signing the below Petition\r\n",
