I am currently producing good qualitiy, local meat and vegetables in a totally ethical and environmentally friendly way.  All my power comes from renewable energy.\r\n\r\nI need to be on the land to protect my crops, animals and poultry from sudden, adverse weather conditions, as well as from predators and vermin.  My alternative energy is also used for incubating eggs so it needs monitoring in case of power failure or overcharging. The only way to make to make my business fully sustainable is to live on the land.\r\n\r\nWest Berks Planning Department insist I need planning permission to live on my land even though I have no intentions of ever building a house.  I put in my application last March which was refused and am now going through the appeal process.\r\n\r\nIf you feel you could support my appeal please sign this e-petition.",
