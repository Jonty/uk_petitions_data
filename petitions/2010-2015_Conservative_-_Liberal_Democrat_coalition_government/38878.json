        "additional_details": "We seek the Government immediatly withdraws all proposed legislation legalising same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriage represents a threat through assimilation to the Lesbian and Gay culture that has developed in the face of discrimination.\r\n\r\nMarriage is seen as  traditionally an heterosexual institution. An institution that has been used to justify homophobic discrimination.\r\n\r\nCivil Partnerships demonstrate the continuing discrimination that Lesbian and Gays experience and is a part of the British culture. To be truly equal we call upon the Government to ensure all marriages are to be registered as a civil contract.    ",
