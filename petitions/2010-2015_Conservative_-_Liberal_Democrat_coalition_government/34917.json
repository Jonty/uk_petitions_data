        "additional_details": "In our modern society why is it that we have 650 members of parliament. Why is it that these 650 MP's have to decend on the house of commons to debate a subject and in doing so claim massive expenses each time they do, we have video confrencing which is a cheap one off expense. No need for a second home, no need for three expensive meals per day. Do we want to reduce the budget defecit LETS START HERE!\r\nClean up politics by making it an offence to obtain a financial gain from a decision that an MP or any other person appointed by an MP implements through any political process. eg. if a person is appointed by the Home Office to make cuts to a service, that person should then not be able to make a gain by privatising part of that service for his / her own companys profit.\r\nIn addition to this there should be a complete ban on MP's using spin doctors and allow people to formulate their own opinions from fact.",
