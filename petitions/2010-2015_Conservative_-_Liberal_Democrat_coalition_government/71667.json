We believe that the pitches could be a great asset to the local community if our club could book them for our training and for our matches.\r\n\r\n\r\nDumbarton United AFC follow strict guidelines and this has been recognised by the Scottish FA wherein our club has been awarded the SFA Quality Mark status at Community Award level.\r\nOur club has held previous bookings on the original Astro pitch at Dumbarton Academy, before the new school was built so it makes sense that the planning position should be reviewed and changed to allow the Community use to return to the new Astro pitches.\r\n\r\nDumbarton United AFC has over 270 players from this local community and many have to use training facilities out with Dumbarton\r\n ",
