We feel that the UK Government should encourage this practice and legitimise this feedback method to constituents by introducting the following .uk domain to standardise web addresses for these inviduals:\r\n\r\n.mp.uk\r\n.msp.uk\r\n.am.uk\r\n.mla.uk\r\n\r\nWith a domain name being provided to currently active members of each government, the domain name should, for ease of use be that of the constituency NOT the individual. thereby enabling a person to use a single web-address to discover their representatives and see what issues that person will be campaigning on.
