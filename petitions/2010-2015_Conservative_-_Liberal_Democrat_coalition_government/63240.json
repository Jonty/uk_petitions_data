The closure of the A&E units at Belfast City, Whiteabbey and Mid-Ulster Hospitals as well as the reduction of hours in Downe and Lagan Valley Hospitals has caused massive pressure on remaining A&E units.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned demand that the Northern Ireland Assembly Executive immediately re-opens Belfast City A&E unit with full resources as a concrete step towards the end the A&E crisis.\r\n",
