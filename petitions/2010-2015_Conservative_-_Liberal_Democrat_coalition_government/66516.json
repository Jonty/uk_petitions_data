We need to recognise that we are more as a group that the sum of our individual parts. However this should not be at the loss of ANY individual culture, quite the contrary, we should celebrate those differences with vigour and guile, for its precisely those differences that make this nation GREAT.\r\n\r\nI propose that we celebrate that we are a proud nation that is better as a whole than separate parts. This celebration could centre on each of the patron saints and by celebrating each patron saint on the same day in each nation, whilst we collectively are celebrating the whole together.\r\n",
