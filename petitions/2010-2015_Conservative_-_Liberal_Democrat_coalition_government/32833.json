Nothing else in our economy is taxed at such a high level; currently 80% of the price of fuel is tax, either fuel duty or VAT. An increase is not acceptable. To that end I pledge that I will not vote for either party of this coalition government if it increases fuel duty.  I encourage you to think about this issue and if you feel as strongly as I do, sign this petition and send a clear message to this and future governments. \"If they increase fuel duty, you will not win the following election\".
