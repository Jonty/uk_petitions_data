Trust me I have first hand experience. Invest in kids to get the off the streets and stop committing crime by working in partnership with the private sector to get kids into hobbies and other activity's for a lower price.\r\nPut it this way. The average pocket money for a 14 year old is \u00a310 a week, that is too last them a whole weekend, if they went bowling or too the cinema that money would be gone in minutes. on the other hand if they went and brought 5 bottles of cheap cider that is their weekend sorted. see my issue? If the government forced the private sector to make things for kids to do cheaper for them it would slowly but surely clean up the streets.  ",
