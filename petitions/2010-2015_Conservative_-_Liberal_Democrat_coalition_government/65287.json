I am currently crowdfunding to expand https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cleaning-supplies/x/7489143 donations welcome.\r\n\r\nBut i believe that theres not enough help for people with mental health problems to start a business or get back in employement. Its easy for the government to say something but different when they do something.\r\n\r\nI never got one bit of help off the government and im sick of people that think depression is a diease it can be managed and we are still the same as everyone else, Help people that had mental health problems to move forward ",
