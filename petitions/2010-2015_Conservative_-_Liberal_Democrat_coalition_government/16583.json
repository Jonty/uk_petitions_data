In this slaughter the main participants are young teens.\r\n\r\nWHY?\r\n\r\nA celebration,  to show that they are adults and mature!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this big celebration, nothing is missing for the fun. Everyone is participating in one way or the other, killing or looking at the cruelty \u201csupporting like a spectator\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it necessary to mention that the dolphin calderon, like all the other species of dolphins, it\u2019s near extinction and they get near men to play and interact.  In a way of PURE friendship  ",
