So many crimes go un punished due to police being un able to identify the offenders. This typ of clothing is the No1 choice of the criminal fraternity and you can see why, just by watching the news covering the London riots. Maybe Burkhas / head scarves could be considered too.\r\n\r\nIts time to crack down on the Mindless Thugs, who have no place in our decent scociety....Stop them from hiding their faces so we can identify them & punish them accordingly. We must learn lessons from the London riots & this would be a good place to start. Decent law abiding citizens will have no objections at all.\r\n\r\nG Bowden",
