        "additional_details": "Wokingham Borough Council recently refused a planning application appeal which will result in 22 venerable families becoming homeless. There is no affordable housing available to these families in the Wokingham Borough area for at least 10 years. Children will be taken out of their schools and their community leaving these families even more venerable than they are already.\r\n\r\nWe are fighting for planning permission for 22 static caravans to exist permanantly and at the very least temporary permission until affordable housing is available.\r\n\r\nIt is common knowledge that there is a shortage of affordable housing in the Wokingham Borough area and this appeal has been refused without an offer of another home.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to raise awareness of the housing shortage in Wokingham and to save our homes.\r\n\r\n",
