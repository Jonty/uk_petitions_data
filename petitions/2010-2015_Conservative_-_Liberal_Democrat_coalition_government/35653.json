David has made a remarkable contribution to world soccer and has had all the professional success one can ask for, but he's always been for \"Queen and country\" playing a vital role in bringing the Games to London. Imagine after Becks has given all his time, effort and passion to playing for his national team \u2013 during failed trips to the Euros, Olympics, and World Cup \u2013  we might win with him sitting, not even on the sidelines, but in a box next to Sebastian Coe.\r\nThe Minister needs to make sure that David Beckham is included in the 18 man squad, not as a standby. Stuart Pearce must be made to reverse his decision and include David Beckham now.",
