Why in the view of this is there no discussion about introducing a form of national service to teach our young people how to be responsible citizen, respect property and other people and also to appreciate that there are a lot of people in the world with no priviledges whatsoever. I think there should be compulsory national service for our young people either before they enter higher education or employment.",
