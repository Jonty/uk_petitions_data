        "additional_details": "Education Secretary Michael Gove plans to drop American classic novels and plays such as To Kill a Mockingbird; Of Mice and Men; and The Crucible from the new GCSE syllabus in favour of British authors.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, believe that to do so would constitute an injustice to British children, who can and do currently benefit not only from the themes of such literature such as courage, honour, respect and tolerance; but from the opportunity to study timeless, talented writing.  While Mr Gove's proposed replacements (Romantic poetry, pre-20th century literature, Shakespeare and Dickens) are all worthy of study, they are not necessarily the best tools to foster a passion for reading in children.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the Government to block these plans and refuse to allow such classics to be removed from the syllabus.",
