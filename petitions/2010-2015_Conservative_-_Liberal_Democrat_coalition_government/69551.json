It seams the council and government are quick enough to go against Gypsy's in any which way instead of helping. The government are trying to abolish Gypsy traditions such a travelling. The reason so many travellers park caravans illegally is because not enough stopping places/sites are provided by councils. councils are quick enough to moan about the Gypsy community instead of coming to an understanding of the traveller life and providing legal stopping places. This is costing councils millions a year in enforcing evictions whereas the money would be better spent in providing more legal stopping grounds.\r\n\r\n",
