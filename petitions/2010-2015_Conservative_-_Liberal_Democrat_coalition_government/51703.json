I hope you will join me in giving her the only gift I can. A gift that can remain for hundreds of years in her memory, and one which can be be appreciated all over the world no matter the origin of the listener. A gift for everone t\u00f8 enjoy, to come together and say \"she is, was and always will be a strong, steady monarch and a wonderful lady that will always do us good to be a little more alike\". Join me, be a part of it and help to give an amazing woman an amazing, well remembered history.",
