There is a bias towards the mother and breaches of court orders by hostile mothers are not being upheld properly. I believe that this is a form of sexism and inequality to both parents and children. The law should change to give a default equal contact for the child to both parents unless there is proof that contact of a parent will be detrimental to the child's welfare.   ",
