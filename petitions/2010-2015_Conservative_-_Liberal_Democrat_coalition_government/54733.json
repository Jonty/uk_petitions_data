This usually ends up with different severe genetic diseases being transmitted from generation after generation which can turn to be a complete disaster after a while.\r\n\r\nLike done with dogs this can be also done with any other animal!\r\n\r\nThe government should therefore prohibit procreation of animals, that is not proceeded under a specific license or certificate to evidence that the owner's utilities and circumstances are definitely adequate to the well-being of the animals! Also, after the procreation they should be immediately required to proceed to the right newborn medical examinations, insertion of micro-chip and respective registration of the animal.",
