        "additional_details": "There is much debate currently as to whether the death penalty should be reintroduced for murder.  Roughly 600 people were murdered in the UK last year.  However an almost identical number of people are killed each year by drink drivers.  Many of their victims are children.  Not only are drink drivers therefore as dangerous as murderers, but as this is rarely a crime committed in the heat of the moment, these killers are far more likely to be deterred by severe sentencing.  It would be excessive to execute all drink drivers of course and, as our Prime Minister often argues, everyone deserves a second chance.  Repeat offenders however, must be shown no mercy.  The implementation of a strict \"three strikes and you're out\" rule would, to quote a former Metropolitan Police Commissioner, be a major contribution to road safety. ",
