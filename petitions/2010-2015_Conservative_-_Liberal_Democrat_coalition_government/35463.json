        "additional_details": "Even as a Welshman I feel that Micah Richards inclusion in the team over David Beckham is a disgrace.\r\nHe refused to be on the reserve list for his nation during Euro 2012. He has sworn on live TV during an interview and could in no way be an ambassador for GB.\r\n\r\nI call upon the government of this country and the Olympic Committee to overrule the exclusion of David Beckham and install him as a squad member. Not merely for his talent on the field, but for the professionalism he shows in every aspect of his involvement with the Olympic Committee.\r\n\r\nHe is a fantastic ambassador for the UK and should be included for this reason alone.",
