        "additional_details": "Part Payment Consultation Response confirms that legislation will be drafted to allow debt to be removed.\r\n1. There will be an ability for the NRP/PWC to make a Part Payment offer (as a full and final settlement) which will be treated as a full settlement of the debt. The remaining arrears will be removed from the account permanently\r\n2. Settlements will initially have to involve lump sum payments but Gov has accepted that allowing part payments via instalments should also be considered - this will be developed and introduced at a later stage.\r\n\r\nThese debts are legitimate debts owed to Parents with care and children,  Non Resident Parents have avoided Child support in order to accumulate debts.\r\nWe the undersigned would like the government to ensure debts owed are paid in full, and not offer a discount if NRPs comply. Every child has a right to be looked after and every parent has a responsibility to their child(ren).",
