Even time to give personal hygiene, including shaving men, to feed or to help and encourage residents to feed, to assist to the toilet or to change when needed. Even time just to talk to residents, to let them know that someone cares. Time to give them a smile and a few words to cheer them up\r\nSome people never have visitor and, due to dementia or other neurological problems, don't recognise their loved ones if they do visit. Its heart-breaking but these people have feelings they need to have someone to hold their hand and spend a few minutes with them, to answer the repetitive question \u201chave you seen my Mum\u201d Sadly in care homes today there are not enough staff to give that care\r\n\r\n",
