Pink Floyd are the best of British and if they could reform for a one off special at London 2012, we could show the world what we are made of.  I understand that 66% of the Floyd are up for it and the other 33% don't care about this great country we live in.  As tax payers, the ones who are paying at great cost for these game, we should get a choice in this one.  Show the world that we can make something worthwhile in England.  Waters, Gilmore and Mason your country needs you.  If you don't then you aren't welcome in Enland anymore.",
