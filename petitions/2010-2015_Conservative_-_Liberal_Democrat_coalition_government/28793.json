        "additional_details": "As an alternative to the Bank of England continuing to give billions of pounds to the banking sector to promote growth (which has failed to work), a cheaper and more cost effective solution would be to give everyone \u00a310,000 to spend. This would have the effect of helping businesses, boosting growth and ideally create a healthier economic environment. Even if some people failed to spend the money, this is likely to be a minority and there would still be more money coming into the economy than currently being provided by the banking sector.",
