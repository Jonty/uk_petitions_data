        "additional_details": "Car insurance prices must never driven by the cost of a 'market'\r\n Prices, premiums, quotes and renewals must only be based on a persons driving style, habits and consistant safety record. So here are my suggestions to make a fairer car insurance industry.\r\n\r\n1. Cap insurance payments at a maximum of \u00a35000 used as an mandatory 'excess'. That money stays in an 'account', untill you make a claim, rewarding  those who never make claims.\r\n\r\n2. Mandatory Black Box for new drivers to prove you are a good driver and put an end to out-of-date generalisations based on age, location, profession and sex.\r\n\r\n3. Car Insurance companies can never pay out for WHIPLASH or any other newly created, similar minor injuries unless actually proven by reputable doctors.\r\n\r\n4. NO REFERRAL FEE's EVER!\r\n\r\n5. People should have a greater say in the cost of car repairs, let them compare prices with other garages to find the best deals so Insurance companies help cannot overprice repairs and push costs up.",
