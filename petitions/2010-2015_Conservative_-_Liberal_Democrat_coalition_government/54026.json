(Gluten-free food can be 3-4 times more expensive than standard food). It can result in some people either having to eat less bread or suffer an expense that they could do without, and can have a negative effect on their diet, health and well-being.\r\n\r\nThe differences in the amount of food that is allowed to be prescribed differs in various areas in the UK. This is unfair, as people in some areas are allowed approximately twice as many items as others.\r\n\r\nI call on you to reverse this decision, as I consider this to be of great importance in relation to public health.",
