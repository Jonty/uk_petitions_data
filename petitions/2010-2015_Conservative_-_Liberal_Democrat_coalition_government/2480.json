        "additional_details": "Road tax is currently calculated by the number of grams of CO2 that the vehicle would emit in a kilometre..\r\n\r\nSo it is not fair that a person with a vehicle with high emissions that does very few miles is charged more than a person with a car that has low emissions but potentially would travel more miles and therefore creating more grams of CO2 in the course of a year.\r\n\r\nA tax should be added to fuel to cover road tax and the traditional annual fee should go. This way, the more fuel you use the more pollution you create and therefore the more road tax you pay.\r\n\r\nThis would mean that there would be no more untaxed vehicles on the road.\r\n\r\nThis way the charge for road tax would be fairer.\r\n",
