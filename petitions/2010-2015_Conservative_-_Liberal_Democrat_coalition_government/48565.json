        "additional_details": "John Griffith-Jones was chairman of audit firm KPMG when it gave clean audit reports on the accounts of the failed bank, HBOS.\r\n\r\nUnder Griffith-Jones leadership, KPMG also sided with HBOS when the former Head of Risk raised concerns about HBOS lending.\r\n\r\nToday HBOS is part of Lloyds and is 43% owned by the taxpayer as a result of the government\u2019s bail out of HBOS. Lloyds have written off \u00a346 billion of loans in total.\r\n\r\nGiven the recklessness of all involved, we, the undersigned believe that John Griffith-Jones should immediately resign or be fired from his position as Chairman of the Financial Conduct Authority ",
