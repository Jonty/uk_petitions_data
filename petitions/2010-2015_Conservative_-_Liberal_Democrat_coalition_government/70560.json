        "additional_details": "Abolish the Council Tax in the UK, and replace it with a 2p in the Pound increase in Income Tax for people earning up to \u00a340,000 per year and 3p in the pound for people on over that figure. This could be placed into a central fund and Local Authorities would get their funding by submitting an annual budget to Central Funding, who would then allocate the monies.\r\nIt would have many advantages. It would stop Local Authorities from frittering funds on frippery. It would put money in the pockets of low income people.finally It would drastically reduce repossession of goods by bailiffs, as there would be no need for court action.",
