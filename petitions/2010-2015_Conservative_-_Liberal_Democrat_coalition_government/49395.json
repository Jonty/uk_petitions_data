        "additional_details": "Michael Gove has no understanding of what it means to be a teacher, but is hell-bent on enforcing his changes on the Education system\r\n\r\nSince he refuses to listen to what the teaching profession has to say about his changes, it seems logical that Michael Gove is in need of some education himself...therefore teaching for a term in an inner city state comprehensive school that is Satisfactory-sorry 'requires improvement' would surely provide this for him\r\n\r\nMore needs to be done to ensure the general public is aware of ALL changes and the impact this will have on on their children's education.\r\n\r\nLastly, a review body that is made up of practising classroom professionals from a mixture of educational institutes should be consulted to consider all future changes to ensure the DfE implements changes which benefit pupils rather than any political agenda",
