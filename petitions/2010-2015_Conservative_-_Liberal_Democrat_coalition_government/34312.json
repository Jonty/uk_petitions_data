        "additional_details": "DEFRA is about to spend \u00a3375,000 on capturing buzzards and destroying their nests to see whether this reduces their consumption of young pheasants, despite presenting no evidence that buzzards make an impact on pheasant numbers. This is state-sponsored persecution of a protected species to please some of the richest people in the country, who are pursuing a cruel, destructive and pointless activity. Again, this government is spending tax payers money for the 1% - or the 0.01%. The government has no responsibility to protect pheasant shoots from our native wildlife, though it does have a responsibility to protect our native wildlife from pheasant shoots. The government must abandon this pointless exercise and instead focus on helping the 99% and our native wildlife.",
