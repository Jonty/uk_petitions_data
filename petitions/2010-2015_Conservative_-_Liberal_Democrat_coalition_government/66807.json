        "additional_details": "For over 40 years British children have been taught the metric system of weights and measures in schools, yet they then have to familiarise themselves with the imperial system as well, since the changeover remains only partially complete. This is confusing and unsatisfactory.\r\nThere is nothing patriotic about wishing to preserve the imperial system. It largely derives from the Roman Empire, not the British one, and is complicated for those more acquainted with decimal systems of measurement.\r\nFormer imperial countries such as Ireland and Australia have succeeded in fully implementing the metric system. After a half century of transition, the UK should do the same.\r\n",
