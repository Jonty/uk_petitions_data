Young people do want to work yet the lack of experience creates a barrier which limits any chance they have of getting into an occupation.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the last 4 months, I have been trying to apply for various jobs from social care, to administration, to cleaning and retail but in most of these job descriptions, it has been imperative for me to have some sort of experience for a year or more.\r\n\r\nNow, as a young person in today\u2019s society, the question lies as: how am I to start work if employers do not give me the opportunity to do so due to the fact that I have limited experience?\r\n\r\nThe main fault has been identified and in order for any significant result to be achieved; the government also, need to recognise the problem and put policies into place which can break the discrimination barriers young people face when applying for jobs.
