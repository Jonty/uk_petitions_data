This will cost the tax payer more.\r\n\r\nAll those convicted and involved in non violent acts in the riots should be given community service to rebuild and tidy up areas.  We also need more youth and community workers engaging young people in positive activities. This may put some young people on the path of a better future and employment.\r\n\r\nWe need Surestarts, EMA, volunteering organisations, Youth Centres, anti gang work, adult education and jobs.\r\n",
