        "additional_details": "We are fighting to save a beautiful unspoilt area of natural beauty that is currently being considered for the development of over 300 properties. Residents from the surrounding areas are working together to stop this. We would lose the wildlife and the beautiful open space that the community loves and that many local people use regularly.  If you believe that local authorities should not be able to build on every piece of land that suits them, they that have a responsibility to protect these areas for the future generations please sign our petition and share with as many people as possible. We, the undersigned, are concerned citizens who urge our leaders to act now to protect the open space named above, already earmarked as a proposed public open space. We want the government to say NO to any development on this land and convert it to a nature reserve or help the residents purchase the land and prevent future building.",
