        "additional_details": "Mobility scooters are designed for those with limited mobility to improve their quality of life and allow them to be mobile.\r\n\r\nRecently more able bodied people are using these because they are easy to get around towns/cities. Also the scooters are getting faster and are larger than many motorbikes. Being fast and quiet I believe these are a safety risk.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to prohibit the sale of mobility scooters unless you have medical condition and to provide funded mobility scooters which will not only help those on limited incomes but mean that the number of larger tank like scooters can be reduced.",
