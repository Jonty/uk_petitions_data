        "additional_details": "The Common Agriculteral Policy (CAP) costs UK taxpayers about \u00a3107 each a year = \u00a347.6bn.\r\nSubsidies should be stopped to any farmer who engages in the cruel & vile trade of intensively breeding companion animals = dogs.\r\nWe should be encouraging efficient farming to meet the future need of our nation. To produce food & maintain the land. The farming of puppies should not be included in this.\r\nThe imprisonment of adult dogs is not farming.\r\nPuppy farming is giving a negative image of the farming community as a whole.\r\nHardworking efficient farmers & the NFU should be calling for this practice to stop.\r\nPuppies are not needed by the Country. If farmers intend to engage in the activity of puppy farming. They should use their \"cash in hand\" sales to subsidise their own farms.\r\nWe need to call an end to this. It should not be seen to be legitimate for farmers to diversify in this way.\r\nWe need to bring in legislation to prevent this from happening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
