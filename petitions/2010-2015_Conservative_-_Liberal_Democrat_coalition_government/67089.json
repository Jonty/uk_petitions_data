In so many cases defendants have to seek legal advise at cost, only for the claimants to drop the case. It should be law that if legal proceeding are issued through the claimants solicitor and they then drop the case. The claimant should then have to pay the legal costs of the defendant defending the notice of legal proceeding. This would stop a lot of legal threats and  undue stress.",
