        "additional_details": "Following the murder of my grandmother in November the intrusion of the press on our family just accentuated the pain we were going through. Less than 24 hours after her death four different reporters had been multiple times to her home while we were then then followed us 10miles to our home to request a statement. This petition is to protect other victims and their families following violent incidents. I ask that restrictions are put in place to prevent the media following or contacting families for statements by any means other than via the police press office thus giving the victims time to come to terms with their trauma without fear of being followed or approached.",
