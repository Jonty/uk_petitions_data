Ideally targeting the skin, but marking of the clothing would also be a benefit.\r\n\r\nThere is a risk of personal injury to the rioters/looters, but this risk has to be understood and recognised beforehand and balanced against the risk of personal injury otherwise to the rioters/looters and others innocently caught up through the actions of the rioters/looters.",
