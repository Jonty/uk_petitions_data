The cookie law is an EU law that requires websites to notify users of the cookies that are installed onto the users computers, but the problem is that the cookie notifications are almost as irritating as pop ups, constantly requiring their users to close the notifications in order to proceed.\r\n\r\nI propose that the government reviews the cookie law with the intent of abolishing cookie notifications under the grounds that it is:\r\n\r\n1. A nuisance\r\n2. No one cares that cookies are being installed onto their computers (in most cases they are harmless and essential)",
