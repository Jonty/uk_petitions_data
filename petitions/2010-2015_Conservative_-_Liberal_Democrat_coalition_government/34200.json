        "additional_details": "As it currently stands, it is a legal requirement to complete the electoral registration form. Whilst we are given the option to opt out of the 'edited' register, the full register is available to anybody who goes to the council offices of the town in which a person lives and views the register. No record is kept of this access and people are allowed to view and write down information for 'research' purposes. This exposes a loophole within the Data Protection Act as it enables people to view personal and private data and act on it accordingly. This needs to be reviewed and safeguarding measures put in place to prevent unauthorised access to private information by members of the general public which could potentially be used for criminal purposes.",
