        "additional_details": "The BBC is the only broadcasting company to enforce a \"tax\" on the public, regardless if the public use its services or not. In more recent times, the BBC has become very poor value for money and as a result has fallen out of favour with the \"viewers\"  as such the BBC should be forced into following the same business models as that of its rivals and seek revenue from advertising,\r\nIt has now also become apparent the BBC has been receiving funding from the EU, which must call into question its impariality, and that it is also funday Radio stations in other countries\r\nIt has therefore come the time to abolish the fee once and for all.",
