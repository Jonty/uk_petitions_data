Appeals to users to decrease their usage have failed, and a tax is required as a deterrent.\r\n\r\nThis has worked very well in The Republic of Ireland and should be introduced to the UK without delay.\r\n\r\nAny revenue raised should be used to help in an international effort to remove the giant island of plastic waste drifting in the Pacific Ocean, as this material is a source of severe environmental damage.",
