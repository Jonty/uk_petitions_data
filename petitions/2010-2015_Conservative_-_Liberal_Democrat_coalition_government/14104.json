        "additional_details": "The FA Cup was formed in 1871 and is the oldest association football tournament in the world. Its heritage and great history of quality football is undeniable. Next year the FA plan to move the FA Cup final to 5.15pm from its traditional slot of 3pm. Also last year, the Premier League title was decided on the day of the FA Cup final. These events of past and present undermine what some believe to be the best and most historic club football competition in the world. The current football season is crowded and too busy. Many managers put out their second team in the FA Cup. Please can the FA do everything they can to keep this competition at the forefront of the English game and keeping the FA Cup at 3pm on its own special day will no doubt help English football. ",
