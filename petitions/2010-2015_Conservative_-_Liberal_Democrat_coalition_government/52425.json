If they had done a mamagram they would have found it but because Im under 35 I wasn't offered one. It has now spread to my bone in my back & my liver. I also know someone who had cancer of the womb but wasn't allowed a smear test as she was under 25. I want every woman in the UK be able to have a mamagram or smear test at any age.",
