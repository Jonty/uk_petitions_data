        "additional_details": "In early December 2013 I received a reply letter from HMRC explaining that police officers receive \u00a3140 and that civilians receive \u00a360 for their laundry allowance.\r\n\r\nThis is a serious unequal pay as the type and quantity of uniform are the same for both types of staff. For example, Detention Officers in Hampshire use exactly the same uniform as sergeants, only for the colour of shirts.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask you to liaise with HMRC, Home Office and the Equality and Human Rights Commission to have the laundry allowance to be made the same amount for both police officers and civilians. All police forces across the United Kingdom vow to Equality and this discrepancy is clearly unequal.\r\n\r\nI also seek that, should the allowance be upped, that all civilian personnel receive a refund of the difference for the past 6 years when they have received unequal pay.\r\n\r\nIn my view this is a straight forward issue which needs to be resolved as a matter of principle, moral and urgency.",
