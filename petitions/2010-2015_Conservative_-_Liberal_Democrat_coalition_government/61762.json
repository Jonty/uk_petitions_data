As a small catering business there is no incentive to grow and turn over more than \u00a379,000 as you cannot claim back the \u00a315,800 you would have to pay in VAT. No business even if turning over a little more than \u00a379k will declare it, however if the govt introduced a 5% threshold between \u00a379k and say \u00a3125K they would be more likely to receive payments, and as 95% of UK businesses are small businesses this could have a dramatic benefit for both the HMRC and the business.
