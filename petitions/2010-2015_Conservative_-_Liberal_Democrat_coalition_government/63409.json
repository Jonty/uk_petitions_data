        "action": "An inquiry into into the expenses claimed by Maria Miller MP",
        "additional_details": "The Secretary of State for Culture Maria Miller has been found by the House of Commons Committee on Standards to have over-claimed \u00a35,800 in mortgage payments. The Parliamentary Standards Commissioner found that Maria Miller MP claimed more than \u00a340,000 in mortgage payments to which she was not entitled.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the widely differing conclusions of the Commissioner and the Committee detailed in the Report warrant further investigation. The actions of Maria Miller, the Commission on Standards and her fellow MPs who have lent her support, including the Prime Minister, have brought the House of Commons, Members of Parliament and the Office of Secretary of State into disrepute.\r\n\r\nThus, we, the undersigned, ask the government, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister to launch an official inquiry into the expenses claimed by Maria Miller. We also ask that the report by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner be published in full.",
