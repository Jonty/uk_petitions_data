        "additional_details": "The UK should create a national police force similar to that of the French gendarmerie.\r\nThis should include the merging of the coast guard, border control and the 'special police forces' under one structure. The already unified police air service would come under this structure. It should have higher entry requirements than the current force. The Military Police could possibly come under this structure as well. However this police force would not undertake the standard policing duties such as foot patrols, rather this would be undertaken by district forces which recruit local people.\r\nIn summary, by merging the many different agencies under one command, fewer senior officers would be needed, greater standardisation, improved communication and more efficient use of resources, all this saving money.",
