        "additional_details": "For to long now this departemnt has been failing to meet the standards of the people that it should be helping. The goverment has pushed so many benift reformes to make things so they say better for the unemployed to find work.\r\n\r\nHowever the department that is to inact them is in disara. Letters are confusing and so are the forms. Infomation is lost or never taken down. phone calls never returned, kept on hold for longer than is nessassery.\r\n\r\nThis is not only happeing at the bottom run of the ladder but in all areas right to the top.\r\n\r\nThey have a website that is insucre badly degined and barley works and when issues are brought up about are push aside as though they are not there.\r\n\r\nThe DWP is represented in Parliment by a man who is so out of touch with people he has no clue what is happening in the real world. The DWP play games with peoples lives and this must stop. It is time to write a new rule book one that makes sence.",
