        "additional_details": "We would like for the government to cancel all plans for HS2, taking into account the unwanted effects it will have on house values, communities, businesses and livelihoods, the destruction of ancient woodland and the destruction of peace for those living near the route and the parks, playgrounds, schools and recreational areas.\r\nThe basic effects of Sheffield alone amount to the destruction of homes, listed buildings, ancient woodland, city landmarks, destruction of business, decimation of property values running directly through the city.\r\nMany more cities would be affected similarly and as voices join together it appears many people do not want HS2.\r\nImprove current structures of transport and work on national debt or community rather wasting money on an unwanted train track.",
