        "additional_details": "Peacfull protest should always be encouraged but this can often be tainted by a small number that get drunk at a protest and cause trouble, some groups even use the excuse that they are holding a \"demonstration\" simply to get on a coach to a random city then stand in that city drinking and shouting abuse at people while surrounded by police, these \"demonstrations\" always end in mindless vandalism and violence which costs the tax payer millions, most protests that turn nasty are fuelled by alcohol and in some instances alcohol is the only reason people attend, I strongly believe that removing alcohol from these events will not only save the country a lot of money but also give genuine protesters a chance to get their point across.",
