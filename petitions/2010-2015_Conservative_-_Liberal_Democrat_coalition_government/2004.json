        "additional_details": "Free healthcare is a beautiful concept. However in a society where so many are not responsible enough to look after themselves, it fails. As a result the NHS is severely underfunded which has caused the quality of healthcare to fall.\r\n\r\nThis petition is aimed at introducing charges for treating those who have clearly inflicted their condition on themselves, such as an alcoholic requiring a liver transplant or an obese person wanting a gastric band.\r\n\r\nThe result would hopefully be to provide the NHS with extra income and to further encourage those on self destructive paths to act more responsibly. Possibly even to lower NHS tax.",
