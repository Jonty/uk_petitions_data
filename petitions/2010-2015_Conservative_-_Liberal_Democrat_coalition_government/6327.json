        "additional_details": "With unemployment levels slowly increasing the government continues to press ahead with plans to remove frontline permanent and temporary staff from jobcentres while handing out the responsibilities to private industry.\r\nJobcentre staff not only assist jobseekers looking for work but also are responsible for combatting fraud on a daily basis. Ensuring public money Is justly awarded is crucial to the economy.\r\nBenefit fraud is fought face to face, not through an automated benefit system and not by a system which only targets companies to put people into employment while not addressing non compliance and other underlying barriers.\r\nYou can't fight a battle without soldiers in the trenches.",
