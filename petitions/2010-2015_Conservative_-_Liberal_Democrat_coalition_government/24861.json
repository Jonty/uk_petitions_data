        "additional_details": "The EU achieves two things:  common standards for business and help from rich regions to poor ones.  Having 27 countries working together enables standards to be set for environmental controls, energy efficiency, minimum social standards like unemployment pay, pension and maternity leave.  EU grants help Cornwall, Scotland, Wales and the less well off areas of England. Without the EU and in the face of world competition, the UK will struggle to feed itself and would have to abandon environmental controls and social benefits to enable firms to cut costs and compete.",
