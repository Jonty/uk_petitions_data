        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call upon the Department of Health in N Ireland to put more funding into providing more specialist professionals to work with children who have sensory processing difficulties within Camhs.\r\n\r\nLack of specialist professionals, occupational therapists in particular has a significant impact upon vulnerable children who so desperately require intensive therapy provided only by these specialists.\r\n\r\nLack of education around sensory issues is debilitating enough for many individuals. Specialist OTs can not only provide therapy for children but educate parents, schools and society as a whole thus benefiting thosechildren affected.\r\n\r\nSensory difficulties can impact upon everyday life, shouldn't a child have the right to therapy to help them manage these issues?\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned therefore call for urgent action to be taken in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
