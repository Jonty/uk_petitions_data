        "additional_details": "Former gp and ex tory mp Owen Lister believes that disabled children would be better of guillotined than have money spent on their care, he claims they are a waste of life! They are wonderful human beings who have as much right to life as anyone else( look at Stephen Hawking!!) . They are loved by all around them and it sickens me to hear such comments from a supposed respected member of government he should be made accountable just like anyone else would. We demand he is dealt with in a court of law\r\n\r\n",
