        "additional_details": "A growing number of self employed childcare providers are charging customers (parents) when their facility is unavailable, due to the provider\u2019s illness, holidays, odd days off and periods of exclusion which is at the providers will.\r\n\r\nCustomers are not employers and should not have to bear the burden of costs which are subject to employment laws. No other business charges for their unavailability.\r\n\r\nAs this becomes increasingly common, parents are becoming unable to sustain the rising costs of paying their current provider in addition to securing and paying an alternate carer. Furthermore, government subsidiaries for assistance with childcare costs are being exploited through this loophole.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for childcare costs in Scotland, England and Wales to be legislated for, to end a practice which is crippling working parents and the government. We petition the government to stop allowing providers to charge when the facility is not open for business.\r\n",
