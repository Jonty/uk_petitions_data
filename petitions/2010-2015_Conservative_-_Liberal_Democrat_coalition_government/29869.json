        "additional_details": "From 6th April 2012 to continue getting working tax credits at current levels couples with children must work 24 HOURS a week between them.\r\n\r\nEvery Disabled Child Matters found that families supporting a disabled child are 2.5 times more likely than other families to have no parent working for more than sixteen hours per week and will be disproportionately affected by the change from 16 to 24 hours requirement.\r\n\r\nCaring is work. Parents in receipt of Carers Allowance should either be exempt from the new rules or have their caring hours counted as 'work' for tax credit purposes.\r\n\r\nWorking 24 hours can be very difficult where a disabled child requires two adults to support them; where there are other children in the family; or where the family contains more than one disabled child. Childcare for disabled children is more expensive and there is a lack of suitable provision. Few employers will be able to offer extra hours in the current economic climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
