        "additional_details": "This is a petition to give the people of the UK there right to oppose something that not one of us signed up for, the simple fact that the Government in power today is formed from two political parties who without the permission of the people joined together to form a leadership. People voted for their political party to have seats in government and not for them to decide whether they could share Number 10 with someone else. This is not an attack on the present Government but an indication as to what the people of the United Kingdom think about this action",
