        "additional_details": "The government should overrule the Bank of England and ensure that notes remain paper and are not converted to plastic.\r\n\r\nPlastic notes would feel like game money and like chocolate bar wrappers. The notes would lose their distinct crisp feel and an important tradition would be lost.\r\n\r\nThe overall saving from this move would only be \u00a3100 million over a whole ten year period not taking into account the cost of changing or upgrading the printing machines.\r\n\r\nThis would have an extremely negative effective on consumers and businesses and the change would be depressing.\r\n\r\nThe tradition and enjoyment of a crisp paper bank note should not be lost simply for the sake of environmentalist practicality.",
