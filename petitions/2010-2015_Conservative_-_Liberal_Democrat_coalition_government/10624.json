        "additional_details": "One of the main reasons we've seen all this recent rioting is because the youth of today have no respect for the law and this country. Prison sentencing is far too lenient and prisons are more like holiday camps with TV's and Playstations. If you are sent to prison it should be a PUNISHMENT for your crime, and you should have all of your rights withdrawn apart from basic food and toilet facilities. Offenders give up their 'rights' when they take the law into their own hands and if they are under 25 then they should have a spell in the army.",
