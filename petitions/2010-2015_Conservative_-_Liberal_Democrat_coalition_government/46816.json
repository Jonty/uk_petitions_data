He has not only had his guns removed, he has been charged with possession of class A firearms, it is actually a cap gun which can't fire. Adam teaches Jacobites as part of a valuable history lesson around the schools in Edinburgh and East Lothian, because of the charge, Adam can\u2019t teach. Kids and Adam are distraught.\r\nI think it is time we made a stand against stupid bullying tactics by Lothian & Borders Police.  If Adam has inadvertently broken any laws,  is there a need to charge him as some sort of gun wielding criminal?\r\n",
