        "additional_details": "Why is that people such as my wife, an American citizen, living legally in the UK, has to take a driving test, go through the expense of having lessons, paying for licences and the stress and inconvenience of having to go through all this, when people from countries such as Japan, Canada and Zimbabwe don't?  My wife comes from Seattle, 2 hours from the Canadian border.  Also, current policy means she can drive for a year in the UK, without having to obtain a UK licence.  Surely, she would be more of a danger immediately on arrival in the UK?  This is a mad policy, creating extra work for the government and costing us taxpayers money that makes no sense and is clearly not logical.  People from countries such as the US, should be allowed to drive in the UK in the same way people from Canada are.  After all, I wonder which country has more qualified drivers?  The US or Zimbabwe?",
