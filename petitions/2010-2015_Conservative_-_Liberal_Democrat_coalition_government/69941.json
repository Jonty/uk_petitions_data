        "additional_details": "The 45% do not accept the outcome of the 2014 Scottish Independence referendum.\r\n\r\nThe media bias, consistently focusing on the negatives and the daily tirade of project fear and the lies conspired to sway the vote in favour of a No.\r\n\r\nHad the media instead focused on the positives and potential benefits for everyone, in the long run for the whole of the UK, the outcome would have been different.\r\n\r\nI believe that the most sensible way forward at this stage would be to allow Scotland to have a 10 year trial move towards full independence pending the next Scottish election, with a set of criteria to meet. and that should those not be met after those 10 years we go back into the union, in the interests of everyone.\r\n\r\nThe 45% call on you to do the right thing and allow Scotland a fair and honest chance at becoming a fully autonomous state, as this is the true democratic will of the people as was reflected in recent Scottish elections.",
