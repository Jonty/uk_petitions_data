Awkward delivery times, all day slots, poor customer service, inaccessible depots.\r\n\r\nWhen choosing to make an online purchase as well as the price and reputation etc. of the vendor the public should be told which courier company/delivery service is going to be used - and preferably offered a choice.  Just because a particular company might be more convenient for the retailer it doesn't mean that for me, the customer, its not going to lead to lost work time, having to stay in, problems getting to depots and long calls to hopeless call centres.",
