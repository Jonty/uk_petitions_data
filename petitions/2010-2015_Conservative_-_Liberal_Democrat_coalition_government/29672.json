        "additional_details": "There are many unemployed people in Britain and this is leading to homelessness. The rule at the moment is to sign onto JSA, the person needs an address so that letters can go to the address given and you need to have a bank account for money to enter to the account holder. This is clearly unjust and immoral. This rule doesn\u2019t look at different perspectives. The anecdote may be that a person who was well off got their own accommodation and a highly paid job, due to the recession became redundant and lost accommodation. Why shouldn\u2019t they be entitled job seekers? Why does the rule undermine ones misfortune? I propose that this rule should no longer exist as it makes it harder for homeless people to get employed. Demolish the rule that suggests that homeless people aren\u2019t entitled to JCP because they don\u2019t have an address. ",
