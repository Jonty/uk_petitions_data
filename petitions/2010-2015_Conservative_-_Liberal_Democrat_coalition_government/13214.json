Childcare would be carried out by a proportion of the mothers on a rota basis, making most of them free to go out to work, or to seek work, or to improve their qualifications for the job market. This would  be instead of housing benefit, so it would no longer be attractive for young mothers to simply have children in order to avoid working and to get their own housing provided by the state.",
