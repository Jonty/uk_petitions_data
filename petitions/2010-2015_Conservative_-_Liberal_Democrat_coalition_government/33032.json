        "additional_details": "A multicultural society is often a disharmonious society with differing eclectic groups of people with different lifestyles, religion, culture, upbringing, beliefs, values, loyalties, priorities, perspectives, etc.  As long as there are perceived differences in \u2018culture\u2019 & \u2018religion\u2019, there will be separate lifestyles & hence potential disharmony & friction. Britain is a secular society. Invoking God on complex issues can hinder the seeking of explanations & solutions from a scientific & logical standpoint. Immigrants would often serve their own self-serving perceived cultural needs (thus requiring more foreign cooks, spouses, Imams, workers etc), as well as those of their extended overseas relatives\u2019 & countrymen\u2019s interests first. Thus a vicious circle, changing the future demographics & security of UK forever. No country in the world would allow immigrants of different cultures and religion to change their indigenous culture & values. British culture is what makes Britain great.",
