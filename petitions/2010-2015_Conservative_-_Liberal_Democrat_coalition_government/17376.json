        "additional_details": "As a young person who has just completed my A-levels, I often look back with utter confusion as to the objective of citizenships lessons in secondary schools. From what I preserve these lessons aim to teach young people about how to become responsible citizens by illustrating the symbiotic relationship between our rights and responsibilities. However too often these lessons have become overly trivialised and often disintegrate into nothing more than \u2018circle time\u2019. I however do believe that if reformed or replaced to encapsulate political education young people will be much better prepared to become responsible and well informed proactive citizens. I believe this because having studied A-level Government and Politics I have become much more aware of the role each individual plays in society. Moreover it has inspired me to participate in the shaping of society; this is something which my citizenship lessons never did!   ",
