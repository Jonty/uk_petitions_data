        "additional_details": "Muslims are being brutually killed in Burma. The media have not broadcasted anything about these killings. The internet (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, etc) are being filled with videos of Muslims being killed brutually by Buddhists in Burma. This petition is for the UK govenment to intervene in Burma and stop these mass murders of men, women, children and babies. For once we need the British Army to actually go to a foreign country for a good cause. We need these crimes to go on international telelvision showing the world what is happening rather than staying quiet. Please sign the petition and get friends and family as well to stop this ethnic cleansing.\r\nFrom this petition we want Britain to:\r\n-Intervene and help the Muslims affected by giving them aid, food, shelter and protection and help them rebuild there lives.
