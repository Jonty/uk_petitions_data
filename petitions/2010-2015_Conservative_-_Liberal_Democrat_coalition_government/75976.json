        "additional_details": "A Tarlov cyst is a dilation of the nerve root sheath or outer covering of the nerve. Cerebral spinal fluid gets trapped inside the sheath and forms a cyst. The fluid in the cyst can put pressure on the nerve inside and on the adjacent nerve roots and cause debilitating symptoms. The cyst is the nerve and therefore cannot be cut out.\r\nWhen pain is intractable, despite a variety of interventions, or when other neurological symptoms become severe and the sacrum is eroding and remodeling, surgery may be the treatment of choice. There are a small number of physician's in the world who have surgical expertise in the treatment for TCs, and the short-term and long-term outcome of surgery is improving but variable in individual patients at this time.\r\nHowever, the surgery is not available under the NHS, either routinely or through specialised commissioning because of a lack of evidence for its effectiveness.\r\nUK citizens have to pay up to 30.000 \u00a3 for a private surgery abroad(Cyprus or USA).",
