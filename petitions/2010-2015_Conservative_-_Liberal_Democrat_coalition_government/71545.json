        "additional_details": "We the undersigned respectfully request that the government takes appropriate action on the A47 between Acle and Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.\r\n\r\nThere are long-standing concerns about this stretch of road, including safety and congestion, stifling business growth in Great Yarmouth.\r\n\r\nFollowing several fatalities, we again request that the entire length of road be turned into a dual carriageway with the road-side ditches re-structured.\r\n\r\nThis will not only protect the dykes, which are an important habitat for endangered water voles, but also alleviate the danger of vehicles leaving the road in an accident becoming trapped.\r\n\r\nAs the A47 is part of the Trans European Network Transport (TENT) One route, from Great Yarmouth to the Midlands, improvement should be made with the help of EU funding both for its transport significance and its importance for Norfolk\u2019s economy.",
