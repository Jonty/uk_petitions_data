If however any person who comes to this country ends up committing a serious crime then we feel it is in our societies interest to deport this individual. If we went to another country and was caught committing a criminal act, we would not expect that country to extend our stay. So why should we let so many individuals from other countries who commit criminal acts stay. No criminal is welcome in any society whatever country they come from, but unfortunately the ones who are British have to stay here, but in our opinion we don't have any duty to keep immigrants who break the law.",
