The noise can be low, like electronic noise or dragging furniture on the floor, etc. Because it is LOW, the Dept of Environment from Council cannot deal with this issue, as it will not be counted as \"stautory noise\".\r\n\r\nSign up pls so this issue will be added to the Anti-Social Behaviour law.  Thank You.",
