On the contrary, some people really struggle to make ends meet. Therefore, lowering benefits to create deeper poverty to a majority for the sake of catching the benefit scamming minority is not the answer.\r\n\r\nFrustration and, anger from good hard-working people comes from the fact that there is just not enough in the wage packet to cover the rising cost of food, fuel and services. With major Governmental changes this will impact the pockets of the lower-end earners further. The meagre amounts offered to fill-out the wallet/purse just don't reach far enough.\r\n\r\nMore energy really needs to be placed in paying fairer wages to the backbone of our country.
