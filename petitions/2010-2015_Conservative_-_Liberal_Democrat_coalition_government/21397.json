Allow some change after 11 plus for those children who advance to the level at a later age: i.e. allow some flexibility. Currently bright children from poorer backgrounds do not have the opportunity for education we used to have and to get on e.g. in the professions. The other children can then also have education better aimed at their potential so they too can feel confident in their chosen path.",
