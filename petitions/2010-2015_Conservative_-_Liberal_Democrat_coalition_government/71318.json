        "additional_details": "We, the parents of the pupils of Blackmoor Park Infant and Junior School as well as the residents of the surrounding area, petition Liverpool City Council to assess the safety of the road outside the school.\r\nLeyfield Road is an extremely busy road that serves four schools, a hospice, Alder Hey Hospital and a large residential population also. Yet, the road itself has just one lollipop lady and one set of traffic lights. This is insufficient and as of Friday October 24th after a child was fatally injured the safety of our children is compromised.\r\nWe suggest that the council install speed bumps to help dramatically reduce the speed of vehicles using  Leyfield Road, we would also like electronic  signs erected to warn passing cars to reduce their speed and adhere to the 20mph speed limit. Finally we would like to see more safety barriers along the length of Leyfield Road  where possible and not just outside Blackmoor Park Infants and Blackmoor Park Juniors.",
