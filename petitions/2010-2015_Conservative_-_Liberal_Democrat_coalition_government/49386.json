For a job seeker applying for many vacancies, this can represent hundreds of hours of input, even though much of every application form asks for the same information - personal details, education, further skills and training, employment history, hobbies and interests, CRB information, references and equal opportunities data.\r\n\r\nApart from this standing information, the only part of the application form that changes each time is the personal statement.\r\n\r\nThis is a particularly heavy burden for people in fixed term contracts, who need to fit in applying for a new post while still working.\r\n\r\nI call on on the government to create a framework whereby job applicants\u2019 standing information can be kept online with the possibility of being updated and that this information be accepted by any employer seeking to fill a post.",
