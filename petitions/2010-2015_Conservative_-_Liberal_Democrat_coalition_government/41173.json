We, the British people, have had enough of her and other nations government members dictating what we, as British citizens, should do. As a nation, we should stand up to the pressure and bullying from these foreign governments and our Prime Minister and his government should be strong in their message to the EU. The government should now give the British People an IN/OUT referendum. IMMEDIATELY!",
