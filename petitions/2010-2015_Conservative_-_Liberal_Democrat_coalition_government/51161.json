        "additional_details": "Change to Local Government Finance Act allows Councils to remove the 6 Months C/Tax exemption period.\r\nLandlords always want their property occupied, and quickly, but It is simply impossinble to make good/refurbish a property after each tenants departure and then find a new tenant in such a rediculous period of 2 Weeks!\r\n\r\nThis is very damaging to the many small investors among us with no works pension, who by attempting to top up their State Pension income through property are now being penalised by this crippling monthly cost.\r\nWhen the income ceases where does the money come from to pay the C/Tax and/or any Mortgage that may be on the property.\r\n\r\nLike most I'm not looking forward to the Basic State Pension of \u00a3117 a Week!!
