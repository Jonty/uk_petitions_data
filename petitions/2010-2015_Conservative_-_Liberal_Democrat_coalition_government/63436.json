Something I didn't know until recently.  Why not?\r\nTHIS NEEDS TO BE AMENDED.\r\n\r\nA Part P electrician who is not fully qualified surely is only a COMPETENT PERSON and therefore should not be able to do work in high risk areas.\r\nTHIS NEEDS TO AMENDED.\r\n\r\nThe HOMEOWNER IS RESPONSIBLE (according to Building Control) NOT the ELECTRICIAN when the Part P Certificate is not supplied.\r\nTHIS NEEDS TO BE AMENDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
