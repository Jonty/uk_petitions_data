        "additional_details": "Please support our cause by bringing awareness to the way the Spanish central government treats it's citizens, tourists and Gibraltarians at the Gibraltar/Spanish border. Due to territorial water disputes, sovereignty disputes, fishing disputes, etc, the Spanish central government has implemented a car-by-car search at the border control. This approach is being used as a way to intimidate the local populace of both nations. Woman, young children, elderly and even pregnant woman are being forced within the EU, to wait in the heat for up to 7 hrs without water or shade. One instant a pregnant woman had to abandon her car, leave her husband to walk across the border instead. This approach is restricting reasonable free movement within the EU and even causing high levels of pollution from car fumes. Please help us spread the word globally so as awareness is created and a solution can be found for this small nation. Thanks",
