        "additional_details": "In 2011 the Royal Institute of British Architects claimed that many new homes are \"shameful shoebox homes\".\r\nUntil 1980 all new builds in new towns and council housing had to meet the Parker Morris Standards, which among other things, set out a minimum room size.\r\nMany new houses have rooms which are far too small for their intended purpose.\r\nModern concerns about the quality of new builds has resulted in the Office of the Mayor of London adopting a Design Guide for Housing which is 10% more generous than the Parker Morris Standards for new housing within London.\r\nTherefore this petition calls for an updated version of the Parker Morris Standards to be introduced across the country for all new builds.",
