        "additional_details": "In Safety Week 2014, a day was devoted to slips trips and falls.  Slips, trips and falls are particularly dangerous on stairs.  There has been much published on stair safety and \u201chold the handrail\u201d is a common workplace instruction.  One frequent omission which is necessary to ensure that a handrail is available is the \u201cWalk as you drive\u201d orderly use of stairs.  This aligns with footway safety etiquette which keeps pedestrians with their back to the traffic away from the kerb (Highway Code para 1).\r\n\r\nI propose that the Government supports the \u201cWalk as you drive\u201d initiative to improve safety on workplace, school and public stairs.  I believe it is better than the \u201cfree for all\u201d (every man for himself) approach.\r\n\r\nI propose that the Government encourages a \u201ckeep left\u201d policy in any documents for stair and footpath safety for the UK.\r\n",
