        "action": "Non Maintenance of White Lines",
        "additional_details": "One aspect of road safety is being neglected and that is the appalling state of the white lines, cats eyes etc. on all our roads. Highways Authorities seem to have plenty of money for speed cameras which have a limited effect on safety but woefully neglect the white lines which, if properly maintained would have a huge effect.  Road safety is greatly enhanced, particularly at night or in bad weather by good clear road markings which should be maintained in that condition. A short drive anywhere will reveal that this is just not being done. Cats eyes are often non-existent and white lines are faded,  many disappearing altogether when it rains. At some roundabouts, it is impossible to know where you are going especially if you are a stranger. It is a mystery that there are not more accidents caused by the disgraceful state of the road markings. My petition is this:- Give all Highways Authorities a mandatory legal duty to provide road markings and to maintain them in good order.",
