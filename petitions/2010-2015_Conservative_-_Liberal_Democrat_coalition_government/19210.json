        "additional_details": "Why does the government keep increasing the Pension age when there is such terrible unemployment in the young? Why when there is a huge increase in older people being made redundant do they up the age of retirement? It does not make sense. The young need the older employees to retire in order to move in at the bottom of the employment ladder. People over 60 need time to enjoy their older years. What good is a work force run by an ageing sometimes ill workforce? Yes, people should have the choice to work longer but not be made to. When they are made redundant they will need to claim unemployment benefits along with the young so how does that save anything? All we are left with is an elderly disgruntled workforce and youth on the streets.",
