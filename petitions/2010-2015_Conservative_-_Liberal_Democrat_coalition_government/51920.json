        "additional_details": "\r\nWe would like to request the UK parliament to support the Impartial Interim Governmental system during the general election so that the upcoming general election in Bangladesh scheduled for 2014 must be free, fair and independent to ensure its legitimacy; notes that the 15th amendment to the Bangladeshi constitution, which was passed last year, abolished the caretaker government system which has been used to ensure credible elections through an impartial interim governmental system; and encourages the Awami administration to reinstate the 13th amendment to the constitution which would restore this interim system.\r\nAs Bangladesh and the United Kingdom have a longstanding diplomatic and economic relation, we feel- it is appropriate to utilise your strong diplomatic influence for the greater interest of 164 million Bangladeshi people.\r\n",
