Any unpaid work outside of this criteria makes the individual ineligible for JSA.\r\n\r\nWhat about the people who want a career in childcare but are unable to volunteer at schools? What about graduates who need experience to get a job? What about people who could do an unpaid internship but can't afford to live if their claim is withdrawn? What about the Big Society?\r\n\r\nThe government should allow people to volunteer in an organisation relevant to their proposed career path without it affecting their claim, so long as they prove that they are still seeking paid work. Each person's claim is case-specific and some of us are trying to better ourselves and pursue a career.",
