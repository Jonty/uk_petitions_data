        "additional_details": "Dear Minister,\r\n\r\nCurrently we are in dispute with our Local Government in regards to a road where by they expect Young Children i.e. Primary School Age (4-11) who do not have the concept of Distance of Speed yet to walk to school on a road which is meant to be a 30MPH road according to the Council, the 85th Percentile is 40MPH and they claim the road is fit for their purpose.I would dread to think what the 15% of vehicles do if 40MPH is the 85th Percentile.\r\n\r\nThe rule should be to the fastest car i.e. 100%, takes one car to hit a child.\r\n\r\nI would urge the minister to amend the Road Traffic Act to reflect this change, not for Adult but for the countries future, Children, they deserve at least this chance to be safe to walk on UK Roads!",
