If people are concerned about the electromagnetic issues, they will not be required to have one. We have been willing to give assurances to Hon Members on that account\" and:a DECC spokesman told us: \"This is not actually new. While smart metering brings significant benefits, it will not be an offence for householders to refuse to accept a smart meter and we have made it clear that we do not expect suppliers to seek an entry warrant simply to fit smart metering equipment.\r\nThe Energy Companys Terms & Conditions need to make it clear that the Customer has a choice.",
