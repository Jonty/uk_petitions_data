        "additional_details": "Billions of pounds have been stolen by banks who used PPI to boost their profits at the expense of the British public. PPI was described as being \"mis-sold\" when in reality it was theft & deceit on a grand scale. Money was being siphoned from the masses each month, causing extreme financial hardship for millions. These people just wanted to borrow some money, but they were robbed instead.  The banks took bread out of childrens mouths. Rioters were justifiably jailed last year for stealing a few pounds. bankers have stole billions - it was not a victimless crime. The perpetrators need to be identified and jailed.",
