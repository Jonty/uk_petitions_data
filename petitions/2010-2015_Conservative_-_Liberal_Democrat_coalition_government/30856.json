        "additional_details": "We feel that the UK Government should consult the British public more frequently especially on issues where public opinion is strong. Examples could be bonuses for bankers, university tuition fees, taking our armed services to war, public service cuts and major tax rises. The British government is elected every four to five years and then operates independently without consulting the electorate. Please support our petition and get this motion debated in the House of Commons.",
