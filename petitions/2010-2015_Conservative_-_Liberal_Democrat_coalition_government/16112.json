        "additional_details": "Advice in which advisers/counsellors have financial interests about the need for a proposed medical treatment should be objective and free from conflicts of interests be from private abortion providers, GP budget holders or dentists. 200,000 embryos are aborted every year in UK (about 500 a day). Clearly far too many! Embryos should NOT be aborted on financial grounds, innocuous psychological social circumstances of parents or for convenience, as healthy babies can always be adopted or placed in care. Private profit making companies may give bias advice about the need, importance, relevance & effectiveness of the services they propose to provide. Take an analogy of a private company being given an open cheque to repair a car. If not properly supervised by the customer, this may result in creative accounting by the private company for performing unnecessary expensive work.",
