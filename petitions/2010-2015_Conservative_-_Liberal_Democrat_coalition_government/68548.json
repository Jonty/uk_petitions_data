        "additional_details": "We believe the teachings of depression to children and teens in schools is heavily overlooked, considering how many young people suffer from the illness. The word depressed gets thrown out of context far more often then not. So this causes people to believe the illness is not a concern and it may not need to be addressed. This campaign may bring change to a vast number of peoples lives. A high number of people struggle from a form of depression in their lifetimes. So this issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible and teach children from a young age how to cope and possibly help someone else in need.",
