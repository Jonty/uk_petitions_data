Even with this subsidy train services are late, overcrowded and above all else too expensive and fragmented. The track is owned in effect by the government why not the trains. why are private companies allowed to make huge profits out the basic human need to travel to work?\r\nI propose that the rail industry is taken into state ownership once again and run in such a way not to maximize profits but service.",
