        "additional_details": "'Slavery' occurs all the time, even today but by a different name.  Even in marriage and employment, 'slavery' does occur today.  HMG should take seriously modern day \u2018slavery\u2019, like child slavery, people trafficking for sex/employment, abusive marriage partner or employer, bullying, humiliation in media/cyberspace, etc. I would define \u2018slavery\u2019 as most forms of racism, discrimination, exploitation of labour (economic or otherwise), bullying, blackmailing, caste/social class system, deception, abuse, physical aggression, humiliation, unjustified domination of one party over another, imposing one's will over another and forcing a person to perform acts/labour he/she does not will wish or consented to do. Slavery in the Victorian age occurs even for whites in Victorian Britain, not only slavery of blacks in America & other groups in other parts of the world. ",
