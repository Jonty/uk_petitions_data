        "additional_details": "On behalf of most candidates of Edexcel C3 exam June 2013, we strongly feel the examination was unfair. More than 11087 candidates felt disadvantaged by the paper on facebook page and the number of candidate is rising. I have to stress the irresponsible behavior of Edexcel to have allowed the leakage of exam papers and it is completely nonsense that not all candidate were taking the same paper. Also, the replacement paper is ridiculously difficult, in the sense that the results of this paper will not reflect the true ability of the candidates. I urge the department accurately address the issue and ARRANGE A RESIT for the paper ASAP (within a month), for this is someone's life and dream especially to the 2013 A2 students who have their future depends on this exam.",
