        "additional_details": "Since the Dawn of Humanity, We have gazed upon the heavens and have created stories and myths. Since the Greeks we have studied the skies and have found out the most incredible answers to some of the most complicated questions. Such as, Is there other worlds then our own? Is there other Galaxys? How did the Universe begin? This all started with our ancestors gazing and wondering. But the sky is becoming brighter, Not with stars or comets but with a Orange glow. This is limiting our view to the Moon, planets and Stars when there should be a dustly lane which we call home. The milky way galaxy and Thousands of Stars should be visible.\r\n\r\nI am wanting the Government to limit and control the Light Pollution so stargazers are benefited and the general populace can learn and wonder again .But to also meet the objectives of crime and protection aswell.",
