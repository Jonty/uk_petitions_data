        "additional_details": "We NEED tighter regulations for the secondary ticket market, for both artists and customers.  The secondary ticket market is worth up to \u00a31 billion a year, with ticket fraud estimated to make organised criminal networks \u00a340 million a year. In the UK, the resale of tickets for a profit in breach of conditions has historically been left to the event organiser to tackle. The secondary ticket market has to start taking responsibility to keep consumers safe!",
