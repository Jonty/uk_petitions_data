        "additional_details": "This act needs to be amended to cover the following situations which it does not currently take into account. I would like this to be addressed in Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn an acrimonious breakdown of a relationship there needs to be a sensible \u2018cooling off\u2019 period applied before the Police start issuing \u2018first time harassment warnings\u2019 for non violent behaviour.\r\n\r\nA sensible amount of written correspondence allowed in an acrimonious break up before the \u2018two incidents\u2019 can be applied. Is it really sensible to charge and convict someone of harassment giving them a CRIMINAL RECORD\u2019 for life for TWO TEXT MESSAGES?\r\n\r\nContact between people who\u2019ve had a relationship after it\u2019s ended, e.g. returning items. If this is done politely and with no malice, it cannot be harassment.\r\n\r\nYou cannot apply indirect contact to people with whom either party has had a relationship before the break up.",
