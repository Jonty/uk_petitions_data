        "additional_details": "I would like JSA to be ended, and replaced by unemployment benefit, Because:\r\n\r\nJSA is bad for Employers, The Economy, Job Seekers and the Department of Work and Pensions.\r\nEmployers as they are inundated by vast quantities of applications, because unemployed people are coerced into sending vast quantities of application to try and ensure they receive the benefits they need to live on.\r\n\r\nThe economy suffers as vast amounts of money is diverted from the DWP and society; into the multi-million pound industry of running useless bums on seat courses for the unemployed; non-for profit scams; set up by millionaires paying themselves vast sums of public money\r\n\r\nJSA is bad for Job seekers, when you write to a firm when you don\u2019t fit the criteria required (because you need benefits) you risk being black listed when a suitable vacancy arises.\r\n\r\nJSA is bad for Department of Work and Pension money is diverted from it to private firms.",
