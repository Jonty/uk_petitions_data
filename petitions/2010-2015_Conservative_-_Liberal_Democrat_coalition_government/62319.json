This rule of continuous attention applies equally to an ICU in a veterinary hospital as confirmed on the website of the American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia.\r\n\r\nWe ask Government to either split the RCVS Preliminary Investigation/ Disciplinary Committees from RCVS; create an independent veterinary Ombudsman; or veterinary hospitals are included in Government's series of measures resulting from public enquiry into Stafford Hospital scandal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
