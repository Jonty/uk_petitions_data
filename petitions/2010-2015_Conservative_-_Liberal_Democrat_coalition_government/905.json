        "additional_details": "The introduction of Sunday parking restrictions and extension of weekday parking restrictions, by Councils, is yet another revenue raising activity and 'tax' on the motorist.   in most cases, these parking restrictions are not driven by the need to tackle congestion, and are enforced by Private Parking Companies, motivated by the maximisation of profit.  We petition the Government to introduce strict guidelines to curb the power of Councils, and Private Parking Companies, to raise revenue through the introduction of excessive and oppressive restrictions and charges.",
