If you move back into a house share or to live with your partner you nevertheless have to pay the whole year. If not you would get a criminal record. Even renewing of a contract is subject to another 12 months. So most people will be forced several times in their lives to pay many months for nothing. This development must be stopped by law as you just have done with gym contracts. ",
