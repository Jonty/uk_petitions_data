        "additional_details": "I recently bought a pint of milk and saw that the price had increased by over 15%.  This is 3 or 4 times (or possibly even more) the acknowleged rate of inflation; whatever this rate happens to be in September determines increases in pensions and benefits for the following year.  Many of the items in the indices used to judge the inflation rate are luxuries which people on the State pension, or Pension Credit, couldn't even dream of buying; in addition I believe I am right in saying that their prices are increasing at a far slower rate than necessities such as milk.",
