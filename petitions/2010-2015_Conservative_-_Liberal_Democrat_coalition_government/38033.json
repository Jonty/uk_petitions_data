        "additional_details": "The M64 was originally planned in the 1970s however it was forgotten about. I would like the government to reconsider, as the would benefit the entire country. It would do this by connecting Stoke on Trent to Leciester, the would benefit both cities and all the cities in between it would also remove congestion from the M6, M1, M42, M40 and Birmingham and the surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nStoke-on-Trent gets extremely congested as a result of cars driving through my city trying to get to the A50 which pollutes my city even more. It's also highly dangerous as thousands of cars drive through each day dangerously close to homes.\r\n\r\nThe M64 would remove this congestion a take it on a safe route past the city, yet still connecting it to the motorway.\r\n\r\nPlease help my city, help me.\r\nMorgan, 12",
