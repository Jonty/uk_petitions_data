It appears that the controlling bodies think that children/teenagers all go to bed at this time, this is obviously not the fact. Yes we can turn the television off but why should we. If you don't believe me look at (mock the week/Live at the Apollo/Johnathan Ross/Celebrity Juice) some of the programmes could be funny if they would cut out the filth.\r\nThe goverment worry about the decline in morals in this country. I blame TV for this",
