Payment of any fees ended\r\n2. Conditions for good character tests\r\n3. Requirement for civic ceremonies\r\n4. Requirement for oath to our Queen\r\n5. The process for Children of British Mother's is not exactly the same as the process for Children of British Father's - Children of British Father's are automatically British by birthright from the moment of birth (if the parents are married).",
