        "additional_details": "I believe that Guided Busway in Cambridge is too fast given the small proximity to the shared pedestrian and cycle path.\r\n\r\nCrossings that exist are dangerous with some sections of the Busway reaching speeds of 60mph which makes it incredibly hard for people crossing, especially younger people, to gauge the speed of the oncoming bus.\r\n\r\nI feel pedestrians and cyclist should be protected, by a bar fence along the Busway which would make the Busway safer for busses, pedestrians and cyclists.\r\n\r\nIdealy a fence that wouldn't block the view to the traveling public, but would allow safety would be perfect.\r\n\r\nNearly 40 emergencies were reported on the guided busway in the last 18 months, how many more will you allow?\r\n",
