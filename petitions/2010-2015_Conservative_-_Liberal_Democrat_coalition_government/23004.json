        "additional_details": "The proposal is to broadcast afternoon & lunchtime programmes across regions, rather than providing a truly local output. There are also plans for national evening broadcasts, and reducing output further by merging some local breakfast shows.\r\n\r\nWith the demise of Independent Local Radio, BBC Local radio is the only true voice for local people, views, groups and information. With the cuts Stations won't be able to focus on local issues in the way they do now. Please support your local BBC station, and make your voice heard, while you still have the chance to be heard locally.\r\n\r\n If this is successful, we would like MP's to debate the importance of having a truly local, licence payer provided service, which the BBC provides so well at the moment.\r\n\r\n We would like MP's to get the BBC to reconsider local radio cuts, and look to alternative ways to save the corporation money, and maybe additional ways to generate income.",
