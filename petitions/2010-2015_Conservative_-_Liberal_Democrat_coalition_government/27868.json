        "additional_details": "If you are injured or killed in an accident in your workplace, the employer is liable for the accident unless it can be shown that all necessary safety measures have been put in place or that there was contributory negligence by the injured person. On the roads it is often the victim that must prove his innocence and this is particularly true for cyclists and pedestrians. Where these latter people are injured or killed by a motorist there should be the automatic assumption of guilt of the motorist, who is indeed in charge of a deadly weapon, and the driver would then have to prove that there was no fault attached to him/herself. This could help redress the appalling attitude displayed by some motorists towards more vulnerable road users.",
