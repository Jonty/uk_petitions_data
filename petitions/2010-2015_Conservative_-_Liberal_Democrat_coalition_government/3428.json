        "additional_details": "It is clear that the country's population is too large for the infrastructure to cope. Immigration is out of control and still the prospect of benefits are too much of an encouragement and people are choosing to have children they can not afford.\r\n\r\nSchools are full, hospitals can't cope, there are not enough houses and public transport is over-crowded. This petition is for the government to seriously look at ways of controlling population growth in the UK, through the reduction in unskilled workers immigratiing and the discouragement of child births by families that can not afford a child.",
