Whilst for offences such as theft and violence are perfectly understandable, we must draw a line. I argue for the removal of fingerprints obtained for arrests or lesser cautions which did not end in a charge or were in connection with a violent crime or theft of property. I also seek that henceforth fingerprints can only be obtained in cases pertaining to theft or violent in nature. ",
