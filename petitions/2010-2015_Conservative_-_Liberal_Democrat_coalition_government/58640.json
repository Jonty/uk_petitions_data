        "additional_details": "This petition is to make the government aware of the fact that there are gay/bisexual men out there who are in long term committed relationships who are unable to give blood because they have not abstained from sex for 12 months or over.\r\n\r\nI Would like there to be a change to this law where heterosexual and homosexual people should be questioned on sexual history before making a pre-judgment that gay/bisexual males are automatically in the highest risk bracket for giving blood.\r\n\r\nAs a gay man in a committed relationship, with absolutely no risk of disease or infection i think it is ridiculous that we are judged to be a higher risk than a heterosexual man or woman who has had many sexual partners without contraception. I would really love this petition to work out because i am ver passionate about this and i believe it could be the start to a change. Not only to the laws of this country but also to peoples lives ",
