The Attorney General must be an officer of the courts who can be trusted by the people to work to uphold the law in all circumstances and a person who is beholden to a political party leader, on recent performance of politicians as a cohort, just CANNOT be trusted to do ANYTHING other than work to promote the party, regardless of the effect on the people and is incapable of seeing that what he does is an abuse of public office, for which he MUST be arraigned before our courts.",
