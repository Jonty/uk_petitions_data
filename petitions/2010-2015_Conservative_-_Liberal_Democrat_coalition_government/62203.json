There should not be such a difference in price it should be in line with the costs that actually happen or even a bit more to allow for a profit but not \u00a344.25 on one bottle of pain killers I would like pet medicine to be like prescriptions or the dentist where you pay a certain amount of money for what you get a tier system even but as long as its fair for the consumer as well as the vet.
