        "additional_details": "There are numerous online UK passport 'check and send' services that mis-lead users into completing online application forms for renewing a passport, whilst all they do is 'pre-populate' an official IPS government passport form and charge the user for the priviledge.  The biggest example is www.passport.uk.com.\r\n\r\nThese companies pay for the highest spot on Google searches, when users look for 'applying for a passport' and their customer service number charges over \u00a31.35 a minute.  There are numerous cases of these organisations being sued, or paying settlement fees.  Enough is enough.\r\n\r\nThis petition asks the government to remove and ban all sites who con UK residents, looking to renew a UK passport, of their money (usually \u00a372) and their personal data through the use of a 'check and send' service.\r\n\r\nFor more information visit: http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/investigations/2013/02/passportukcom-charges-for-advi.html\r\n",
