        "additional_details": "TV licensing is a blanket style operation, of which every house hold must always pay the fixed fee.\r\nThis is unacceptable and breeds fear for what other fees in said style could be introduced in the future.\r\n\r\nSuch taxation should be firmly judged as to how it can be that you \"MUST\" pay, or go to prison/receive a nasty fine for failing to adhere,\r\nfor something we do not fully understand as to why we pay for it again and again.\r\n\r\nTV Providers such as Sky, Virgin, and Freeview etc, are paid for services/generate an incredible amount of money per annum.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if TV Licensing truly is found to be 100% necessary, then it should be sought from these organisations\r\nor the BBC should perhaps begin to advertise, just like most other channels, and find 100% of their money from advertising.\r\n\r\nIt is a disgrace that this can be enforced and its time to make a change to this long and greatly disliked,\r\nincredibly confusing licensing/tax to be completely abolished for private households.\r\n",
