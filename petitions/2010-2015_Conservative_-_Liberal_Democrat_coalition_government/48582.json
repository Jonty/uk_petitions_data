        "additional_details": "Since the death of Baroness Thatcher was announced on Monday 8th April, it has become apparent that resentment towards her is still as strong as it ever was amongst large sections of the general public.  The Baroness herself did not want a State funeral.  Given the dire economic situation in which the country finds itself, and the polarised views of the public, we believe that the use of tax payers' money to fund Baroness Thatcher's funeral would constutute a gross misuse of public funds. We propose that instead her funeral should be funded by private donations.",
