We now face escalating international tension as a result of this ridiculous man hunt.\r\n\r\nThe power our government has granted itself in it's attempts to bully someone many people would consider worthy of the word hero have already seen Assange put in prison, and under house arrest for over 650 days without even being charged with a crime in any country. Not to mention the fiscal damage done to Wiki Leaks through international pressure (bullying.) This sort of extrajudicial force is completely unacceptable and we ask that our government start following the correct course of justice.\r\n\r\nWe have continued to attempt to ruin this man's life, business and reputation and are yet to release a single statement about the documented torture Bradley Mannings has been subjected to over the last  couple of years by our \"allies.\"",
