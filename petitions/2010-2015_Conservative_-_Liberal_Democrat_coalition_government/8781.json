        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the UK Minister for Education to bring forward legislation, or a Statutory Instrument, to limit entry to teacher training to individuals with a degree from a UK university awarded with 2.1 or first class honours.\r\nIn 2011 our workforce has to increasingly display higher level scientific and other complex skills in a context of fierce global competition which research on prototypical international trends suggest will increase for the forseeable future.\r\nWe cannot ope to hcompete on an alternative strategy of undercutting the low wage economies of the developing world.\r\nThe UK teaching workforce currently includes many intellectual featherweights who have 2.2, third, bare pass degrees and even the old teacher's certificate.\r\nIt it is a grotesque and ineffective customary anomaly to train and employ persons other than those with proven high intelligence to hone high-level skills of critical analysis in the next generation of children.",
