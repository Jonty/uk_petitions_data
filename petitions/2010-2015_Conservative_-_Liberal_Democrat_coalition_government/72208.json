I also refer to human right number 2:\r\n\r\n \"(1) Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.\r\n(2) Everyone has the right of equal access to public service in his country.\r\n(3) The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.\"\r\n\r\nHow is having voting age restrictions not a violation of this basic right we signed up to in 1998?\r\n\r\nYours sincerely Brodie Gibson, Age 11.\r\n\r\nLeader of the future political party The Greenish-Purple Pussy Cats Party Party.",
