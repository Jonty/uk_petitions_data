But no Infantry Role due to the reason that they are 'Too Weak' or 'Too Much of a Hazard to the Mission.'\r\n\r\nIf you look at the American Army there is a 2nd Lieutenant Stephanie Hecker who is a Platoon Commander in the Airborne Division, they are an infantry Unit.\r\n\r\nI believe if a Woman wants to join the Infantry she should be given the opportunity to see if her Physical and Mental capabilities are up to standards. And as we do with the Cadets when staying in Barracks have them split up, to stop people from presuming that the Soldiers may end up sleeping together.\r\n\r\nIf Male and Female soldiers can work effectively and Co-Equally in all other roles in H.M Armed Forces, why should infantry be any different?
