Unrestricted sale results in anti-social behaviour, injury, strain on A&E departments, nuisance to law abiding citizens and distress to animals. Restrict sale to approved individuals and organised displays only. This would also mean fireworks would not be going off at all hours, often many days before November 5th.",
