        "additional_details": "Health Education, better known in schools as PSHE has slid from view in the last few years... Obesity, Emotional Health, Drug, Alcohol and Teen Pregnancy are all major concerns for parents/carers & teachers. Maths, English, Science are all mainstays, as they should be... but the gaining of life skills through health education should be equally as important (not in terms of the time spent in PSHE lessons, but that all schools should treat health education as being equally as important as the other subjects we all know in schools). Please sign this petition to show your support for making Health Education/PHSE a statutory requirement in schools. Thank You.",
