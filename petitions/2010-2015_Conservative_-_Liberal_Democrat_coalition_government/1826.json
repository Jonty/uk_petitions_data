        "additional_details": "We petition the government to pass legislation that establishes equal rights to marriage, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.\r\n\r\nIn a society where the law has already recognised the integrity and rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people to have relationships and love, protected from discrimination: we ask for legislation that enshrines equal marriage rights for all.\r\n\r\nWe believe the underlying law of the land should detach equal rights to marriage, from religious objections and practices, since the state is not a religion.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to remove the clear discrimination and unfairness which presently exists.\r\n\r\nNew marriage legislation, based on justice, equality, and non-discrimination will in no way undermine marriage. The threat to heterosexual marriage comes from heterosexual relationships themselves.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, petition the government to establish equal rights to get married, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.\r\n",
