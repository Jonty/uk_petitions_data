        "additional_details": "With the scandal that has surrounded the MP's expenses recently, it seems that something needs to be done in order that it doesn't happen again.\r\n\r\nI therefore, propose that the MPs wages are increased to \u00a380,000 per year, without the ability to claim back any expenses whatdoever. I think that this is a reasonable sum for any person to live on.\r\n\r\nIf MP's require housing in their constituencies, this should be funded by the tax payer so it remains in public ownership. If at the next election the MP looses his or her seat, the incoming MP will use the same accommodation. Although, all utility bills and associated costs should be met by the MP with no recourse to claiming expenses.\r\n\r\nIf overnight stays are required in London, purpose built accommodation should be provided at tax payer expense.",
