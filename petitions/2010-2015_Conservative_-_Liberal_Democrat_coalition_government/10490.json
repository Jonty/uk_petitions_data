This is much lower than the National Minimum Wage and isn't fair for those under the age of 19 who aren't able to get jobs because they don't have the relevant experience. The Government give funding for the training providers to get young people qualifications. I think the Government should give employers some money towards having the apprentice to train in their workplace, and the apprentice should get paid more than \u00a32.50 an hour.",
