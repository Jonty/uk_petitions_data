Those banks are now using those same scores to refuse credit applications by UK citizens. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD FORCE CREDIT AGENCIES TO RESET EVERY UK CITIZENS CREDIT RATING, IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM AN EQUAL CHANCE OF PROSPERING. LENDING WOULD INCREASE, THE ECONOMY WOULD START MOVING AGAIN AND BAD PAYERS WOULD EVENTUALLY BE THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE RIGHTLY MARKED DOWN BY THE CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES. GOOD PAYERS WILL AGAIN BE ABLE TO OBTAIN CREDIT AND BETTER MAINTAIN THEIR FINANCIAL STATUS IN SOCIETY.",
