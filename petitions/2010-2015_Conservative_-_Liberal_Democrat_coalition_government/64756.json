        "additional_details": "We note with great concern that UK and US troops are scheduled to participate in joint military exercises in Ukraine in July as part of NATO\u2019s Rapid Trident manoeuvres. Ukraine is not a member of NATO. Its participation in military exercises by a nuclear-armed alliance with a first-strike policy can only further destabilise the country.\r\n\r\nWe call on the British government to urge the US and other NATO governments to cancel the Rapid Trident exercise, and to give a plain and public undertaking that Britain will not participate.\r\n\r\nInitial signatories:\r\nLindsey German, convenor of Stop the War Coalition\r\nKate Hudson, general secretary of CND\r\nCaroline Lucas MP\r\nJeremy Corbyn MP\r\nJohn Rees, Stop the War Coalition\r\nBaroness Jenny Tonge\r\nKen Loach, film and TV director\r\nMark Rylance, actor\r\nMiriam Margolyes OBE actor\r\nMichael Rosen, author and broadcaster\r\nSalma Yaqoob, former leader of the Respect Party\r\nAndrew Murray, chief of staff for Unite union",
