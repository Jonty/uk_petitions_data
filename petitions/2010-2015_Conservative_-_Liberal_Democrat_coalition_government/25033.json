        "action": "Stop India from building Tipaimukh Dam on Bangladesh borders",
        "additional_details": "We ask the Prime Minister & the Minister for International Development to intervene on Tipaimukh Dam construction.  The Indians are going ahead with the construction which will impinge on Bangladesh and affect its ability to survive as it shares water along 53 common rivers between India & Bangladesh. The project is just a kilometre north of Jakiganj in Sylhet and when completed is to provide 1500 megawatts of hydroelectric power to the Indian state of Assam but in return it\u2019s going to bring disaster for Bangladesh, practically contributing to drying up of 350 km along Surma & 110 km along Kushiara rivers which water most of the north-eastern regions of Bangladesh affecting agriculture, ecological, climatic and environmental changes of vast areas in both Bangladesh & India.  We believe the British Government can make interventions at the highest levels as a good friend & part of the commonwealth. Please help by asking for a joint study & immediate stoppage of construction.\r\nRBPP, UK",
