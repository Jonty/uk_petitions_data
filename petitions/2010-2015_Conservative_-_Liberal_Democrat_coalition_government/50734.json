His body was found in the river, which police believed he fell in. And before josh another young man sonny fell in and sadly died too. The barriers along Rochester river are not high enough, and I think something should be done about this.\r\nEven though I never knew these young men, one day it may happen to someone I know or care about. Or even someone you know or care about too. So I am trying to stop it now before anyone else dies.",
