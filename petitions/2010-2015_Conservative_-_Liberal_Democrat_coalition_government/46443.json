        "additional_details": "The current CT system is unfair, iniquitous, undemocratic and not fit for purpose and should be abolished and replaced by a PST.\r\n\r\nIf you agree that a tax should be based on \"the ability to pay\", then it should be based on a percentage of earnings, from whatever source.   Less than 50% of the electorate pay CT yet everyone from babies to the elderly benefit from our public services with many properties housing a large number of adult workers, some working a hot bed system, but paying only a single CT!\r\n\r\nCurrently central government provides the bulk of local authority funding, the balance mainly from CT. Why not 100% central government funding based on revenue from a PST using the current taxation systemn, and save money by abolishing all  local authority CT departments?  It would also eliminate the need for a mansion tax.\r\n\r\nA 2% tax on gross earnings would equate to \u00a3240/year for a person earning \u00a312,000.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS NOT A POLL TAX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
