They work around the clock including all Bank Holidays including Christmas and New Year.  They are all stressed through the working hours they are expected to do.  They also have to fight HMRC for any allowances which are rightfully theirs ie: fuel allowances, uniform washing, CRB checks, which are rightfully theirs to claim.",
