This should be readdressed in favour of those who gave their lives etc so that MPs can even make such decsions as to treat the aged.\r\nMPs lunch allowance per day is far in excess of what a pensioner can expect per week to live on. Greed must stop and now start from the top down.\r\nWe want MPs to live on the same allowances they say OPAs must live on.",
