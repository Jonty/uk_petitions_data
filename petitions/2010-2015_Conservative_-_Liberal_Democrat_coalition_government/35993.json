        "additional_details": "Action we want the government to take: These sites (eg youporn.com) should be blocked in the UK, or be made to have them adhere to every other type of porn in existence - it needs to be paid for access, which at the very least ensures 9 year old children cannot access these sites. Obviously you can get pre-paid credit cards, so it won't stop ALL under 18-s from viewing porn, *but* much like making drugs illegal doesn't stop everyone from taking drugs, it *does* protect many children's innocence.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to allow very young children access to such an amount of easily accessible free porn (remember, these sites are exactly like youtube, but filled with hardcore porn), just to satisfy an adult's need/want/right to porn.",
