Should the crime be perpetrated by somebody in another country they have little or no jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nWhat we need as a matter or urgency is both a national and international computer crime agency tackling the crimes of the 21st century. These crime agencies should have alliances with all other countries so that there are simply no borders when it comes to these types of crimes.\r\n\r\nIf we are connected to the world then we must police the part we control correctly\r\n",
