        "additional_details": "Recently we have seen the Occupational Health facility taken away from Dentists staff. This means that although we are treating patients (many of them on an NHS basis) and putting ourselves at risk of blood borne viruses, we are not entitled to the protection that the occupational facility previously gave us, through Hepatitis B vaccinations etc. We now have to source occupational heath services privately, which is extremely costly and hugely problematic as we often need these services quickly, for example if a neddlestick injury occurred. In essence, if we are providing treatment to the public, we are at risk, therefore why should the NHS not fund this service? It is a disgrace to remove this facility and it is yet another example of the lack of support, funding and resources allocated to NHS dentistry. ",
