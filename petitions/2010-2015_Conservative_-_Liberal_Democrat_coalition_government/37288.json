        "additional_details": "There has been much press debate recently about major offshore wind farm developers carrying out public questionnaires regarding large wind farm developments. There has been discussion that the questionnaires are often not sent to people living close to the land, denying local people the right to have their say. The Government must ensure that these questionnaires are removed from the developers and given to an independent body and audited by a public body.",
