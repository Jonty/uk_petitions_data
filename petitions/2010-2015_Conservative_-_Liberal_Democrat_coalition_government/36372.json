        "additional_details": "We all know in britian were nuclear & into alternative energy in a big way. Even with all this extra power if we want to enable quick charging of electric cars just before rush hour ect expecting by 25 years over 50% of the population to be using electric cars something drastically needs to be done about the efficiency of the grid.\r\n\r\nIf we don't invest properly now there will be masses of excess electricity not being used at night and power outages every rush hour ect.\r\n\r\nBritian needs over time her PAL, ARM and Dirac codec moment. Just like with those great inventions and more we need to take the US I got there first prototye systems for their grid and totally out class their pilot system givng the UK an EV (electronic vechile) market a high quality approach.\r\n\r\nThis will only come through If the UK and her people work well to make tommorow happen and it would be nice if the government stepped in with a 25 year flexable Investment plan for improving Grid energy storage.",
