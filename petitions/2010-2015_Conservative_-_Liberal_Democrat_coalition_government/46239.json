It makes women seem inferior. (As you see with jobs, and certain types of jobs)\r\n2. It has created many sex-obsessed generations. (Shallow minded, selfishness from urge)\r\n3. I have also noticed that it has seemed to help create many pedophiles.\r\n\r\nI would like everybody in advertisements to be fully dressed and wearing appropriate clothing. (Covering stomach, thighs, back, and chest.)\r\n\r\nI would also like for all forms of under wear to advertised only on manikins. ",
