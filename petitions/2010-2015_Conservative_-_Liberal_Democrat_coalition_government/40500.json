The current system stands is a restrictive impotent service that can actively keep claimants from getting back into work.  The fact there is a list of \"approved\" courses is absurd! Everyone has unique skills,employment history,qualifications,living situations, transport situations, so the service should be to aid individuals on the best route to employment. People have been refused financial support from JSA to go on courses that would significantly aid me getting a job because they were \"not offered courses\" or even able to get help to get to them, leaving me stuck totally dependent on the service. I believe that if an individual finds a relevant course that can help them get into work they should get help to do so. Things must change! Help them who wish to help themselves back into work!",
