        "additional_details": "HGV,s are the cause of most congestion. Either when they are using up most of the lanes on the motorway to overtake, or when one of them breaks down. The government should introduce a scheme to replace them with smaller vehicles. More vehicles to be produced and driven, will result in more driving jobs and more manufacturing jobs which in turn will help the employment situation.\r\nThis will probably result in more fuel being used but the damage to the environment from emissions will be substantially less than that from all the queues of traffic currently produced by using HGV,s ",
