        "additional_details": "It was the tradition of England that the religion that the monarchy chose for themselves whether it be Catholic or Anglican would sway the general population and decide the official religion of the country, now that the monarchy has less influence on the beliefs of the people of modern times.\r\n\r\nIn England today there are considerably more Catholics and i believe that this reason alone is enough for a change of the countries official religion\r\n\r\nI suggest that parliament discuss this matter openly and have the Anglican Catholic and people of all faiths discuss this prospect.",
