        "action": "Ban the sale of alcohol in petrol stations",
        "additional_details": "A 17 per cent increase in drink-drive crashes means that one in six road deaths last year was alcohol-related.\r\n\r\nSo why can I drive to a petrol station and buy alcohol?  The sale of alcohol in a petrol station simply encourages drink driving.\r\n\r\nHaving observed drunk people trying to buy more alcohol from a petrol station I believe this is not safe.\r\n\r\nThe 24 hour licence some petrol stations have encourage drunk people to go to the petrol station.  I was shocked to learn from a petrol station worker that this is a normal event. Also that nearly all used a car to get there.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you believe petrol stations should not sell alcohol.",
