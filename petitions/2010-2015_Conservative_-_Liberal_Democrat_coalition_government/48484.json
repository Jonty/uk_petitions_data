        "additional_details": "If you read the Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s constitution in full you will see that they are currently  in contravention of almost every part of it \u2013 every paragraph, every phrase, almost every word. I urge you to do so. For instance they say that they 'reject all prejudice and discrimination based upon race, colour, religion, age, disability, sex or sexual orientation and oppose all forms of entrenched privilege and inequality.' The Spare Room Subsidy (better and popularly known as the Bedroom Tax) is discriminating against fathers, against grandparent and thereby a family life, against people trying to find work, the disabled, the sick, the aging etc. and further entrenches privilege and inequality.
