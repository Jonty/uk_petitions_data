        "additional_details": "Since 9H was withdrawn from service there is only 1 route which uses routeoligarchs, so if there is only 1 left I think it would be nice to improve it.\r\n\r\nOxford Circus is a famous part of London and it would be nice to see traditional routeoligarchs running through it once again.\r\n\r\nRoute 6, 13 and 23 which is accessaible to wheelchairs runs from Trafalgar Square to Oxford Circus. If you still dont think its a good idea you could extend it instead to somewhere like Limehouse Station or make it come every 10 minutes instead of 15, but I think some improvement needs to be made.\r\n\r\nAlso start replacing the BT telephone boxes with the K6 telephone box within Central London, because when your in Central London at least, it nice to feel like your in London.",
