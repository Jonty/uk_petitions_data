Motorcycles and scooters do not use as much space on the road, they do not damage the road and they are far less poluting than cars (and the half empty buses running in some bus lanes).\r\n\r\nPlease remove the ability for local authorities to dictate which bus lanes can be uses and set it in the highway code that ALL bus lanes can be used by motorcycles and scooters.",
