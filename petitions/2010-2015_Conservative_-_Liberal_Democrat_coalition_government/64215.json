        "additional_details": "On 5th/6th June 1944 (D-Day), Flying Officer Harvey Edgar Jones (RCAF) was captain of a Dakota of 233 Squadron as part of Operation TONGA (the first wave of paratroop drops). The aircraft was hit by flak, setting it on fire. Jones flew on until the drop was completed and remained with the aircraft until all crew had bailed, dying himself when it crashed.\r\n\r\nHe was recommended for a Victoria Cross by the Station Commander, by No 46 Group & by AOC Transport Command, but denied it by the Air Ministry. He received a Mention in Dispatches.\r\n\r\n\"Jones deliberately sacrificed his life to carry out his orders and to ensure the safety of his crew\" (from the VC recommendation statement)\r\n\r\nOn this 70th anniversary, it is high time to rectify this mistake and posthumously award this hero a VC.",
