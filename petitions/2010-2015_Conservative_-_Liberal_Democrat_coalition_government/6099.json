        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that an automatic one year driving ban should be imposed on those who use a mobile telephone while driving. Research has shown this to be at least as dangerous as drink-driving and so the penalty should be the same. We believe that more people would be inclined to use cycles if the menace of telephoning drivers was removed from our roads.",
