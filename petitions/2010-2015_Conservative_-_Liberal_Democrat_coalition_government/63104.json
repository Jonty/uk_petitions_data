        "additional_details": "The current waiting time for a person  to convert to ILR on UK Ancestry visas, is 5 years. This is a very long time!  Would the government consider reducing this to 2 years (as is the case with Spouse/Partner applications) or 3 years maximum?  Persons who are in the country with strong familial ties on a UK Ancestry visa and who are in employment, cannot fully settle and integrate when they are basically sitting in limbo for 5 years.  Many families would like to purchase property, start businesses etc. etc. but the current 5 year waiting period before a UK Ancestry applicant can apply for ILR is prohibitive and in many cases highly stressful and costly.
