        "additional_details": "I am calling for a referendum in the regions of England on having devolved regional parliaments with the same power as the other devolved bodies that currently exist within the UK\r\n\r\nBecause the regions of England vary greatly socially,economically and politically so a English parliament would not be anymore representative of the regions of England than the current political set-up. So regional parliaments would bring many of the key decisions that effect peoples lives closer to home such as the NHS and local authority finances\r\n",
