        "additional_details": "I believe the police forces of the United Kingdom exist mainly to protect the establishment and the rich, stop people protesting legitimately and badger and hound motorists.  The people pay them excellent salaries and most retire at age 50 on a package far above what most workers can dream of achieving. In return for this commitment the people of the United Kingdom should at least expect police to have a duty to care for the people, support them and to work for the benefit of the majority. I would like to call for a long overdue inquiry into the role of the police in society.  ",
