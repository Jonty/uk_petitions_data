        "additional_details": "At the current rate of deployment for next generation FTTC services, we'll continue to fall behind other country's within Europe who are far ahead of us already.\r\n\r\nBroadband is becoming more essential in acquiring jobs, a decent education and for disabled people (e.g Shopping).\r\n\r\nMany areas suffer from speeds under 5 Mbps on old hardware which is unreliable.\r\n\r\nTo improve upon this, BT shouldn't be allowed the right to own any Market 1 exchanges and offer LLU / ADSL2+ within 3 months, this should apply to all exchanges without access to FTTC services, and if cables need replacing etc then replace them with fibre-optic cables and not the old copper lines.",
