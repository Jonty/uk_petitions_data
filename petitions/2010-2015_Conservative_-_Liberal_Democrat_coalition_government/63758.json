In fact, if it wasn't for thousands of people coming together to show their frustration then Maria Miller might have got away with it - something that couldn't happen outside the Westminster bubble.\r\n\r\nThis is just one example in a string of cases that undermine trust in MPs. A generation of voters might be so put off politics that they never engage in democracy in their lifetime. I think this is a crisis and we need to fix the root of the problem.\r\n\r\n",
