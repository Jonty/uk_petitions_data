At least that service was efficient and very quick.\r\n\r\nThe present system isn't working, when you ring to check the progress you get told its in 'The examination Stage'. Poppycock !!, it does not take 3 weeks to see if the correct documents are there for a renewal of a Passport. The online service is a disgrace and does not allow for anyone who wants to  'upgrade' to the 'premium' service.\r\n\r\nMisinformation is given out on the telephone and in person ( when one is fortunate enough to get an appointment).  You get promised call backs that never come and you never get through to the same person. What is wrong with ringing local numbers to speak to a person who can see instantly where the application is up to?, instead it seems one does not know what the other is doing.\r\n\r\nWith this system failing, why can't we just travel with driving license ID within Europe?\r\n\r\n",
