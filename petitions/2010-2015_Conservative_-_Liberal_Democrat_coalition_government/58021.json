This would be seen as a major deterrent, which would send a clear message to those whom feel it necessary to; murder, rape and Arson with intent/reckless as to endanger life. These are just a few examples. If a person is convicted of a crime similar to this, they should face the death penalty..\r\n\r\nAn offender should only face the death penalty if they have been clearly found guilty, linked to the crime via DNA. They should get a 2 month appeal, so they can challenge the verdict. ",
