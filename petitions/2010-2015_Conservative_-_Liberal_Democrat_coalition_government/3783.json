        "additional_details": "Stop the UKBA from jeopardising our personal security by asking UK citizens to send their senstive personal data to countries (outside the EU) that do not have effective data protection when relations from these countries apply for UK visas. Such sensitive information is easily verifiable in the UK where data protection is in force. Requiring potential UK hosts to send such data abroad exposes them to unnecessary risk of identity theft and other potential losses.",
