        "additional_details": "Formula 1 in the UK is being prevented from being shown from license fee payers due to cost saving at the BBC. However, this will end up costing more to the British public as a whole to watch a sport that helps create British jobs and encourage engineering skills in this country we desperately need over other sports such as football which provide no such benefits. The long term cost of this to the British economy and British morale is enough to make me feel this deserves a debate in the House of Commons to add Formula 1 as a protected sport for Free to Air television LIVE.",
