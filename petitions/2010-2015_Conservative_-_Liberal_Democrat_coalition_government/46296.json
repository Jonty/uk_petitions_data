        "additional_details": "1 Child Allowance should be restricted to no more than 3 children. Put responsibility back with parents if they want more children. Restructure Child Allowance so that the allowance for first child is, circa, 1.5 times the present level, for the second child it should remain the same and the third child is apportioned 0.5 of current payments. After that no more.\r\n2 Child allowance should be stopped for children born and/or living abroad. When born such children should be in receipt of benefits pertinent to the country of birth.\r\n3 Child Allowance should not be paid to immigrants for a period not less than 18 months after arrival in this country to stop 'visitors' cashing in on generous handouts from the UK..\r\n ",
