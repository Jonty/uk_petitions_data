        "additional_details": "Many grandparents are given no option but to ask the Courts for access rights to see their grandchildren, such Courts having very little power to award any such rights, as grandparents do not have a voice legally.  Where is there a balance being reached to give justice to those affected families?\r\nOnly then after many years have passed & memories are erased can a grandparent follow through on their wish to re-establish their relationship with their grandchild.  Should it not be after strict & stringent assessments are made for the children\u2019s welfare through a Court, that such contact rights be granted to those grandparents?\r\nSo my request is for Government support into this very grey area of law to address the present failings of the Court system as it stands & support to help recognise the paramount importance that grandparents play.  As David Cameron is quoted to have said \u201cfamily is everything\u201d. ",
