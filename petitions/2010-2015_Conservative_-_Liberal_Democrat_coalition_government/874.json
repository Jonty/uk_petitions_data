        "additional_details": "The coalition government plans to reduce the cap on rail fares from January 2012.\r\n\r\nUnder Labour, fare increases on many lines were limited to the rate of inflation plus 1%. However, from 2012 this will increase to inflation plus 3%.\r\n\r\nIf inflation remains at the level it is now, around 4%, this could mean a 7% increase in fares in 2012.\r\n\r\nThe government must reinstate the cap at its former level to reduce the burden on commuters and support sustainable transport.\r\n",
