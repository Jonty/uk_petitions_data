        "additional_details": "The UK civil service stifils the UK by its inflexibility and the lack of innovation. I have heard cases where civil servants have been unwillng to change a minister's model of car because it was government policy to be green. The minister then asked fora \"green car\" but made in the UK. The civil servant still refused, saying the department's chosen model was this type. This inflexiblity and lack of innovation is not in the private sector and all the non security related tasks should be outsourced to UK based companies as its obviously harming the UKs competitiveness.",
