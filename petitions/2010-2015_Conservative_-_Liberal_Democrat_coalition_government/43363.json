They should be considered employees of the UK Government and paid in accordance with UK Law.\r\n\r\nUN Article 25 Paragraph 1 states:\r\n\r\nArticle 25.\r\n\r\n    (1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.\r\n\r\nSince carers allowance is currently \u00a358.45 per week this is clearly a breach of all carer's in the UK's Human Rights as they are unable to fulfill the UN's requirements on the current Carer's Allowance rates.",
