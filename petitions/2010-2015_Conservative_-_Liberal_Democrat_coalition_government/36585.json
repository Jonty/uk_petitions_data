        "additional_details": "Everyday people of all ages walk down the street or drive along the road. Everyday they are exposed to advertising of all types, without any choice over what they, or their children, are exposed to. People do not have a choice to be out in public and therefore do not have a choice about being subjected to advertising. It is unsightly and it ruins our environment. In addition to this, decisions over whether to allow our children to be exposed to such advertising should be made by the parents, but that power has been taken from us. The authority to make a responsible decision that is right for our child and to raise them in the way we see fit is taken from us, by the sheer mass of public advertisements. We cannot stop our children from seeing these when they are out in public. Where are our rights as people? Where are our rights as parents? Where are the rights of our children? It is time we were given back the power of CHOICE and reclaim our environments. End public advertising, NOW.  ",
