        "additional_details": " We call on the UK Government not to opt into the Full European Arrest Warrant Scheme. In just a couple more months, the UK propose to opt fully into the European Arrest Warrant, alongside 34 other EU legal schemes, without any recourse to the general public. For a Government talking tough on reforming Europe, and blocking the handover of any further significant powers to Brussels, this is an abuse of our legal rights and must not happen. We have recently seen a case of how unfair & unjust this system is which is clearly not working. We say no more handover of our rights to the EU without a vote.",
