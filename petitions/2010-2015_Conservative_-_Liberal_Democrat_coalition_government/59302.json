Dose prison really rehabilitate these monsters desires? All known sex offenders who live in a mile radius of a childs' home and school should be known to the parents, this will equip us with the knowledge we need to protect our children from the most inhumane crime. If a child goes missing the police check with all local sex offenders, which clearly indicates they are a risk and top of the suspect list when a child is missing.\r\n\r\nFurthermore why are sex offenders of the worst type even living in society? Murder is mandatory life when intent is proven, in every single case of child sex offence intent is shown. Therefore mandatory life should apply to cases involving a minor which is equally as heinous as murder. ",
