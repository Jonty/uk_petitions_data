        "additional_details": "MPs have stolen vast amounts of money from the taxpayers in recent years, all coming to light in the recent expenses scandal. It is the actions of our self-styled leaders which have led to a growing \"culture of theft\" in the country and has certainly influenced other sectors of society.\r\n\r\nIt is the belief of most that the alleged thieves and fraudsters have gotten away with it, having been \"judged\" by their colleagues and not a jury of their peers, as everyone else would be.\r\n\r\nWe ask the government to bring in an independent court to try every MP who has stolen in excess of 0.9 pence, with strict sentencing guidelines. Only this will set an example to the rest of the country.",
