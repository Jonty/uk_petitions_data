If governments want to save money, they can cut the number of people in hospitals by removing this poison from the water supply.\r\n\r\nCheck your toothpaste; I guarantee you it will ask you to go to a doctor if you ingest fluoride from other sources.\r\n\r\nSo why is this dangerous, health damaging poison allowed in our water? Remove it, save money and more importently, save lives.",
