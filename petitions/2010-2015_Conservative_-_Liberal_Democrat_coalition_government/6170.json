        "additional_details": "I would like a free/discount Travel Card to be introduced to people claiming Job Seekers Allowance. I have noticed, some Job seekers are unable to obtain refunds for signing at Employment Agencies or they end up short changed due to high cost of living. I have noticed some Job seekers have missed interviews and were unable to receive reimbursement for travelling to Employment Agencies.\r\n\r\nI would like Transport for London and DWP to devise a Travelling card to make easier for Job seekers.This card should be activated when Job Seekers Allowance is awarded.The card should be able to be deactivated when the claim has been stopped.\r\n\r\nI think a monthly allowance or discounted Oyster Card should be sent with or after the Award for Job Seekers Allowance.\r\n\r\nThis will allow Job Seekers to Travel in order to seek work or Training. This will play a part in the Economic recovery",
