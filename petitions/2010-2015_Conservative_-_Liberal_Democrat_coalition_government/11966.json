        "additional_details": "I want the Government to bring in stricter measures when Local Education Authority's have to deal with pupils who Bully other Children and disrupt lessons.\r\n\r\nEducation is a privilege not a right. If a pupil is virtually uncontrollable, constantly bullying despite warnings from Teachers and the parents either won't or can't curb their child, then the child should be permanently excluded from the School system. We as a Society just have to accept that there are some children who will waste the whole 11 years that is provided at Taxpayers expense and will only succeed in making school miserable for children who want to learn. Teach them something different like life skills, but do it away from mainstream school.",
