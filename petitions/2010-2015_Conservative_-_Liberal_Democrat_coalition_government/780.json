        "additional_details": "An MP, once elected, has a more or less guaranteed a job for a few years, knowing that they can break as many manifesto promises, and live of expenses as much they like knowing that until the next election they have no chance of getting the sack. There is however, a solution to this problem. I propose a system of recall elections. This is a system where if a significant percentage of constituents sign a petitions saying they no longer wish to have a certain MP or Councillor in charge, a by-election is triggered. This would mean that there is real accountability of parliament to the people, stopping MPs from lazing around on expenses knowing that they can't be giving the boot for a few more years, but making MPs constantly aware that they can be given the axe at any moment, making them work harder to please their constituants.
