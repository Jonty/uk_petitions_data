This is especially important in the public sector as the constant threat of strikes are not aiding the recovery of the economy, however the loss of work and increased productivity of the areas will help the recovery.\r\n\r\nThis would also be a fair approach for private sector companies that have high threat level of striking as this undermines any chance of a recovery.",
