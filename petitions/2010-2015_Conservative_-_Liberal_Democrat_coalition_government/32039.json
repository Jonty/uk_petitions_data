        "additional_details": "The former co-treasurer of the Conservative Party recently revealed in a sting operation by the Sunday Times that access to private policy meetings with the current heads of government could be bought by wealthy institutions and high net-worth individuals.\r\n\r\nThe current Prime Minister has rejected these claims and promised an internal party investigation into the matter. This is an insufficient response that could potentially result in a heavily biased outcome.\r\n\r\nA full independent inquiry into the current process of political party funding needs to be undertaken - one that encompasses all political parties in the UK. This will reveal whether these allegations are true, and pave the way towards a more balanced system, where government policy isn't dictated by those with large reserves of cash.",
