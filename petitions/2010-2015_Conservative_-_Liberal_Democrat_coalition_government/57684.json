        "additional_details": "I would like to petition to ban the production and use of methylisothiazolinone in products in this country.\r\nMore research is needed to show how severe the effects this product has on adults and on children.\r\nIt has been banned in Canada for it's toxicity and is causing allergic reactions to so many people in the UK and seems to be getting worse. Around 10% of people are allergic to MI.\r\nMI is used in anything from cleaning products to shampoo, conditioner and baby wipes and can cause itching, rashes and other symptoms\r\nMI is widely used in everyday products such as toilet rolls and face cream as well as sanitary products.\r\nThe British public did not even know about this product until recent media publicity.Many are horrified that we have had no choice or information regarding the use of MI.\r\n It has also been rumoured as a link to cancer. and surely the British public need to be made aware of the dangers that this product poses to their health.",
