        "additional_details": "Currently, its not possible to gift aid subscriptions made to grass roots sport, conversely a subscription to a charity such as the Scout Association can be.\r\n\r\nSports clubs cannot typically register as a charity with the Inland Revenue but can as a Community Amateur Sports Club (CASC). However, once registered as a CASC, membership subscriptions are expressly excluded from gift aid. Regrettably, the contrived tax rules make it very difficult for most grass roots sports clubs to claim any gift aid at all.\r\n\r\nThis epetiton makes the simple suggestion that subscriptions to grass roots sports clubs registered as CASC with the Inland Revenue should be elgible for gift aid.\r\n\r\nDelivery of this egalitarian measure in the year of the London Olympics would be a great way to celebrate grass roots sport and to create a truly lasting legacy for all.
