        "additional_details": "On the 25th January 2012, my cousin Lee Davison sadly lost his life while cycling to work.  Too many people are losing their lives on Cherry Blossom Way, Nissan.  The speed limit needs reducing and there also needs to be sufficient lighting along this road.  60mph and no working lighting is absolutely disgraceful.  A cycle lane would also be beneficial.\r\nPlease sign this epetition requesting for the speed limit to be reduced and hopefully help prevent other families from losing a loved one.",
