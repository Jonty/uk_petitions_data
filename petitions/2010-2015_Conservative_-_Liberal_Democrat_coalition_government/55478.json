        "additional_details": "It appears obvious that there has been a serious amount of corruption involved in the FIFA 2022 World Cup bidding process which was ultimately awarded to Qatar. Two members of the committee had their voting rights suspended due to cash-for-votes allegations. Qatar has been deemed completely unsuitable for a large number of reasons including: extremely hot weather, lack of football culture/history compared to other bidding nations, very small population, appalling working conditions for construction workers, etc.\r\n\r\nDo we really need to sit back and be forced to co-operate? This is an event which affects millions of people in this country and billions across the world and should ruined by a few corrupt individuals. Surely we have a responsibility to speak up and make sure that if the bidding process was not fair, legal action is taken, and the bidding process is repeated.\r\n\r\nSign this petition and end the corruption.
