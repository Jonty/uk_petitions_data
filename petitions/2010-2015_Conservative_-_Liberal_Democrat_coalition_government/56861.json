While it is true that a very small sample of this codex will be destroyed in the C14 testing, the codex has many sample blank areas.\r\n\r\nIt is important to introduce the scientific method into the age estimates for the earliest ancient Biblical manuscripts (of which this codex in one). The C14 dating of this codex will either confirm or suggest a variance to the date of codex Alexandrinus, currently conjectured to be of the 5th century. ",
