I recently took on extra work and was told by the tax credit department that I will have to pay for the extra childcare out of my own pocket as the childcare changes need to be at least \u00a3520 more over the year. This means that during holiday time and while taking on extra customers I fall under this amount. I cannot claim childcare for hours which I do not bill customers so travelling, bookkeeping and secretarial work are not covered either.\r\nWe need a fairer system for the self employed who need extra support to fully support the families without the need for extra support from other benefits. This will help people move up off the bottom rung of the working ladder within self employment.  ",
