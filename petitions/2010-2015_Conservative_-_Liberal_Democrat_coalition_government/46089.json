        "additional_details": "That on the Anniversary each year of the Bomb in Warrington on 20th March 1993 one or other of the First Ministers for England, for Ireland, for Scotland or for Wales be invited to address the people of the British Isles as a whole on the State of the Union between them. As historically it has been the English who have to the greatest extent determined the future and the nature of the Union the first Address should be made by the First Minister for England, but thereafter the Address would rotate between all Leaders. The purpose of this would be not only to offer a more complete and a more balanced perspective on the Union but also to demonstrate the new dispensation of power and the more collective form of leadership that the new Union of the British will require.",
