        "additional_details": "You'll probably have read of the charge that Nottingham Council is bringing onto businesses with more than 10 parking spaces. Such businesses will be required to pay \u00a3288 per annum, which most will probably pass on to their employees. This petition has the intention of stopping this charge. Not everyone lives in Nottingham, obviously, but this certainly paves the way for similar or identical charges to be rolled out by councils up and down the country. Sign this petition, and see if we can't get the charge dropped. It is absolutely ridiculous, and as one user put it, \"a slap in the face to the companies who have actually decided to stay in this country rather than up sticks and move abroad\". It is also, it goes without saying, a slap in the face to those people who choose to work hard for a living rather than sit on their backsides and claim benefits.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition! Make the difference!",
