        "additional_details": "The amount of money needed to attend University from 2012 onwards is completely absurd. Considering the recent financial crisis, students are finding it increasingly difficult to be funded by their parents, and therefore must take out Student loans. The interest rates on said loans are far too high (if you earn over \u00a341000, interest rates are 3%+ inflation- think about how high inflation is currently), meaning if you choose to go to University and have to take out a loan, you will be in debt for the next 30 years- unless you make a salary well into the six figures. This will harm the Government as much as the borrower, often much of the debt will be written off.\r\n\r\nImmediate action needs to be taken to reduce the financial burden to students who are starting University from 2012 onwards. It is my personal belief that Tuition fees should be no more than \u00a35000 per year, and interest rates on student loans should be in line with inflation, no higher.",
