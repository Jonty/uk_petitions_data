        "additional_details": "Private Eye recently revealed (Eye 1332) that in the 2012 Energy bill draft legislation was published for the privatisation of the strategic Government Pipeline and Storage System (GPSS). This network of underground pipelines and storage facilities dates back to WW2 and is used to ensure the secure distribution of fuel to military bases, RAF stations and Heathrow and Gatwick. The network has also been used for the distribution of Civilian petrol. This system is of strategic importance both to the military and to the public especially as it is cheaper than tankers and provides a secure supply for the emergency services during times of fuel shortages or tanker driver strikes.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to rethink and not implement these proposals.\r\n\r\nFor more information: http://www.private-eye.co.uk/sections.php?section_link=hp_sauce&",
