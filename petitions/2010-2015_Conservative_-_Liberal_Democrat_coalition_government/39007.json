        "additional_details": "Restoring the death penalty for two or more independent murders would safeguard police, prison officers, or other people tackling a murderer.\r\nIf someone kills one person, they might as well kill a few more, as the penalty will be the same.\r\nThe chance of a miscariage of justice is far less than for one incident. This would stop the drain on resources keeping serial killers in jail and may even protect other prisoners.\r\nAnyone may be driven to murder in a crime of passion or a stressful situation and may be rehabilitated. Those who take multiple lives on separate occasions deserve no such consideration.\r\nI request a debate with a free vote to be followed by legislation if carried.",
