Robert Maxwell ruined the Daily Mirror pension fund.  There is nothing in the legislation to prevent a new owner of, say, Morrison's or any other company, to remove all the money held in the pension fund without reference to the pension scheme contributors.  MONEY PAID INTO A PENSION FUND MUST REMAIN IN THE OWNERSHIP OF THE PERSON WHO PAID IT IN. ",
