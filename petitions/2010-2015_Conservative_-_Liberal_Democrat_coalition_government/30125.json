Under current Government rules pensioners who retire abroad only get state pension increases in line with inflation if they live in countries with reciprocal arrangements. All Commonwealth countries would welcome and support the British government to pay its pensioner their indexed pension.\r\nMany who are denied indexing of their British state pension worked and fought for the freedom that the British people have today. What goverment can possibly deny payment to those who paid their full national insurance contributions throughout their working lives? ",
