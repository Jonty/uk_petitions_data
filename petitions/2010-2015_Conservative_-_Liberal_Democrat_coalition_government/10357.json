        "additional_details": "News organisations have said they will not hand over footage to the police without being compelled to do by a court. That is a defensible position and one would expect a judge to order disclosure and for the media to comply. What is completely indefensible is the media protecting criminals and giving them the oxygen of publicity which they inhale via their hoodies or balaclavas. The worst example is Channel 4 News which interviewed a convicted criminal and agreed not to name him. This is completely unacceptable in a democratic society.",
