        "additional_details": "Gambling ruins lives, it is more addictive than drugs, smoking and alcohol yet it is rammed down our throats and advertised as a fun social activity.\r\nIf you think about how many people start gambling after seeing adverts and how many of those people become addicted now think about the damage this is doing to the UK.\r\nI think advertising gambling companies on football shirts should be banned and also advertising at football grounds. I am petitioning for this as it is sending out the wrong message to our children who are the future of our country",
