This way it should force them back to work, allowing them to provide for their responsibilities upbring, personally \u00a35 a week deduction is easy for them which is why they chose to stay on benefits. Fathers who quit their jobs when the child support agency has caught up on them shouldn't be rewarded benefits for 3 months and if refusion to pay maintenance the law should allow mothers to remove all parental responsibilities of the father as its not fair they can walk back in their children's life in a few years as they have a 'right' despite not contribution to the children they abanded.
