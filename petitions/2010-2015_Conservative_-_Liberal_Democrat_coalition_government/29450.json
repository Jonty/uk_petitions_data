The funds for Quantative Easing are presumably derived from Tax Payers who pay their Taxes correctly and dutifully. Quantative Easing is made to Banks to enable them to lend and help the Economy not to prop up Banks who are failing and inefficient in their failure to lend.The UK PAYE Tax Payer \"Pays Up\" from their Income, be it their Wages, Pensions, Investments and purchases with VAT, with no let up. There has so far been no Benefit for any ordinary Brit, in the form of any \"Trickle down Effect\" . The only ones who seem to benefit are the Financial Sector, the wealthy and the Establishment. Avoidance of Tax by the exploitation of loopholes should not be possible and the same rules should apply to all. No-one should be above the Law just because they are super rich.",
