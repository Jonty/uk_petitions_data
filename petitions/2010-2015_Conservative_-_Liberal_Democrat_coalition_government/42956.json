        "additional_details": "Preston Bus Station is an iconic and striking structure that has been underfunded and left to rot in the hope that it will become unviable. Preston council seems to have got their way but we the undersigned regard this action as dishonest and a needless waste of a structure that is both unique and fit for purpose. With a long overdue and, so far wantonly neglected, refurbishment this structure could continue to serve Lancashire for many years to come. We do not want the homogenisation that will result in any new and no less costly scheme.",
