        "additional_details": "The Government wants to introduce Central European Time which means in Summer it won't go dark until midnight and in winter we will have to get up and go to work/school in the dark.  This is absolute madness, it has been tried before and rejected.  Children will be at risk going to school in the darkness in winter and sleep and melatonon production will be severely disrupted in summer.  There will be more anti-social behaviour in summer due to excessively long summer evenings.  We want the Government to permanently drop this ridiculous idea.",
