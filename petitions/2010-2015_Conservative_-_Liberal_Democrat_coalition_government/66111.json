        "additional_details": "UK's Parents need to gain the upper hand over unruly teenagers, teenagers that society have created as a direct result of the removal of parents rights to discipline their own children. We need to break the ever decreasing circles. Tonight it is a stroppy 15 year old daughter who has told us all her rights. Has left the home and is now missing with the police resources utilised to try and find her. Let alone the impact to the family from this and the ongoing bad behaviour. This family has been through the current system of support and come out it in a worst position than before they went into it. They were thrust into the system by lies she told, disrespective speech, hell if we spoke to our parents the way kids do today? They believe they are untouchable and it is time for change! Change the law, reduce children's rights, prevent a failing future, we need to stop the erosion before it is to late.",
