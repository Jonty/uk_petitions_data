This is a once in a decade opportunity for the whole world to discuss the defining issues of our time, and generate directives and declarations that will drive policy for many years to come. It would be simply inappropriate for the UK Government not to participate, at the highest possible level, in both the full Summit and its Preparatory Meetings.",
