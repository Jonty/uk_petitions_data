        "additional_details": "The UK Food Law definition of natural flavour http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1994/1486/regulation/3/made\r\n\r\nA person can be allergic, intolerant or simply dislike (by preference) any individual ingredient or a combination of ingredients within this broad definition.\r\n\r\nThe term \"Natural Flavouring\" makes it a struggle to find food that is safe to eat on an everyday basis, is useless in decision making processes and causes confusion among the public (especially as 'natural' implies 'healthy'). Ultimately this prevents informed choice.\r\n\r\nAs the constituent ingredients are not clearly defined, they cannot be adequately avoided.\r\nSymptoms resulting from consumption of these foods can range from the uncomfortable to anaphylaxis (which can lead to death).\r\n\r\nIn short, we should know what is in our food.\r\n\r\nWe request that the term \"Natural flavouring\" on food packaging is used solely in conjuction with a full list of the ingredients included in the product.\r\n\r\nThank you",
