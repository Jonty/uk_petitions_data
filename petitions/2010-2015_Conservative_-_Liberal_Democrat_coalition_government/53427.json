        "additional_details": "In the wake of the recent Daniel Peltza case I think it should be compulsory for all children under 16 to have yearly check ups at their GP's. If it becomes law that every child must have their check up within 1 month of their birthday every year then their welfare can be assessed as well as their health. We give new babies a red book to log all test, checks etc until they are 2 so why don't we carry this on throughout every child's juvenile life. Each result is logged on the child's health record, could become a health passport, and if a child doesn't have a check up logged within the required time frame it triggers a report for Social Services to investigate and eliminate any suspicion of foul play through genuine reasons or flag issues that could cause for concern. We need to start safeguarding the lives of these innocent children....I propose it to be called Daniels Law. ",
