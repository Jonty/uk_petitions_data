The resentment and ill-feeling generated by benefit claimants could be replaced by welcome and appreciation if Social Security benefits for migrant workers were paid from central EU funding. Instead of taking  money from UK tax-payers, benefit claimants would be bringing money into the country.\r\nThe UK  government must demand that the EC fund all Social Security payments for migrant workers.",
