Please do not allow party politics to  hinder our goals of sustainable clean energy while reducing our dependence on  unreliable costly  external sources of gas. This is not a new process. It has been developed over decades.\r\n.\r\nWell meaning , concerned people have repeated scare stories produced by some elements and irresponsible headlines intended to boost circulation  of newspapers. We should try to address their concerns and correct misconceptions.\r\n\r\nParliament should work across party lines to ensure this technology is given every opportunity to provide us with cheap safe energy from a reliable source.\r\n",
