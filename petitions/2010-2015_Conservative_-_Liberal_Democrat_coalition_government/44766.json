        "additional_details": "Currently anybody can read a few books, call themselves a nutritionist, and start giving out advice. Not all members of the public are aware of this, leading them to seek advice from those unqualified to give it. Some advice could seriously harm peoples health. At this time when preventative medicine through diet is so important, the people giving out dietary advice should be properly qualified to do so. The government should make the term nutritionist restricted to those who have a science based degree in the subject.",
