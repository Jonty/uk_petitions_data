A Lot of them offer recycling bins but public schools do not have the money to pay for collection, therefore it all ends up in general waste.\r\nPlease take this in to acknowledgment; I hope that goverment will either make compulsory free collection or give the school a budget for collection.\r\nThis is important because a huge amount of paper waste comes from schools.\r\nThankyou Imogen\r\nimmy_099@hotmail.com",
