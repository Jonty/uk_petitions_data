        "additional_details": "For the Government to step in and block banking institutions raising prices not inline with the BOE rates in times of austerity.\r\nSaying a loud NO to banks profiteering...\r\nSome banks are increasing mortgage interest rates with others surely to follow suit after gauging the level of public outcry.\r\nThe customers are supporting banking through its bad times and now they repay us by raising mortgage rates to cover their greedy loses.\r\nBonuses still remain high.\r\nSavers rates wont benefit this is purely an overhead recovery to maintain profits.\r\nIncomes will become more squeezed which inturn leads to less consumer spend/confidence pushing the UK back into recession  by the institutions who put us in the current mess. Will they ever learn?\r\nPLEASE SUPPORT THIS PETITION",
