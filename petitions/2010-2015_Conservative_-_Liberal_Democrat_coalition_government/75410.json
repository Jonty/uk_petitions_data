We are not able to do as much research as we once could.\r\n33% of deaths in the UK is related to cancer and only \u00a34.50 per person/per year is spent on cancer research. This is out of \u00a311,000 worth of spending done by the government on each persons behalf per year.\r\nLess than 50pence is spent out of the \u00a311,000 per person per year on stroke and we all know how dangerous and common it is.\r\n\r\nThis needs to change for the better. Innocent people die all the time because of health problems and we aren't doing all we can to solve this problem. We need to stop being ignorant and change this!",
