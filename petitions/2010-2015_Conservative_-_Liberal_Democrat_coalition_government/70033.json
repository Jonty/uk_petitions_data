        "additional_details": "Too many new drivers on the road (Particulary young ones) are being killed all the time. In most cases, it's because youngsters are getting powerful cars, which they cannot handle, and end up killing the selfs and endangering innocent lives. People who wish to have luxury cars can do so, but with limited engine capacity. For example, drivers aged 17-21 cannot get a car above 1.2 litres, drivers aged 22-25 cannot get above 1.6. This could also be modified greatly for a better example.  The government needs to limit the engine sizes that new car owners can buy. This can be monitored easily by enforcing the law, and police can pull over young drivers in the incorrect engine sized car who don't look that age and get told they're 'on suspicion of dangerous driving' which driving powerful cars is.",
