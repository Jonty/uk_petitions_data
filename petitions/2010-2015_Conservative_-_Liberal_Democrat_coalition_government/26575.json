When they are expected, childcare providers have chance to get everything in order if it was not so already. This means that OFSTED are missing important weaknesses in how childcare providers are following regulations. As a result of a complain to the nursery my child attended, OFSTED did carry out an unannounced visit and uncovered faults that they had previously missed on announced visits.",
