This is despite train companies posting record pre tax profits (for example in the case of South West Trains nearly \u00a3240 million).\r\n\r\nMy proposal - which would likely require secondary legislation (a statutory instrument should be sufficient) is that train companies are not allowed to increase rail fares where they are making a profit - unless they can show that they meet the 98% puntuality and reliability targets at commuter times - therefore between 06:00 and 09:30 in the morning, and between 16:00 and 19:30 in the evening.\r\n\r\nThis might then mean that instead of posting record profits every year, the companies would start spending some of that money to improve services!",
