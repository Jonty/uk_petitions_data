        "additional_details": "Local, Neighbourhood & Parish Plans take years to develop, issue for consultation, amend, (re-issue & re-consult if required) & get adopted, so local people's opinions do not seem to count for decisions made in their area.\r\nWhen a planning application is refused, the applicant can appeal, but locals have no such right. This frequently results in large scale developments proceeding in unsuitable locations with little or no infrastructure. In accordance with the Localism Bill, decisions on local developments should rest with local people.\r\nWe request that the Government allow the Planning Inspectorate to comment only, then put the decision to a local poll, with all people within a 20 mile radius of the application site being permitted to vote. If there is sufficient local demand, the application will succeed. Where there is not a clear majority, the local council may re-assess the application, based on all the information available, to make the final decision at a public meeting.",
