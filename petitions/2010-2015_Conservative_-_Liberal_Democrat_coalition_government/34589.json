        "additional_details": "The Government is proposing to end current protection afforded to STRAY domestic animals such as cats and dogs when it integrates the new EU directive on Animal Experiments into UK legislation.  The Government proposes to slip this change through the Commons by using an ad hoc committee with no debate to the floor of the House. Most MPs would then have no chance to oppose it.  We cannot stand by and let this happen.  Too many animals suffer horribly in UK labs now for things as trivial as makeup and washing products.  This has to stop.  ",
