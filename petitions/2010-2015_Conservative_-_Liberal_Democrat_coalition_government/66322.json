        "additional_details": "I have watched a video of this man ranting about getting more and more muslim politicians into parliament and i find this extremely offensive as a white, englishman who does not follow the muslim religion. I feel that if the majority of politicians are of the muslim faith this will only lead to the influx of sharia law and the medieval ways such as public stoning to be the norm in England.  He is tantamount to preaching hate / prejudice against all nonbelievers!!  If i were to do the same i would be classed as a racist (although you should call me a religionist!)",
