        "additional_details": "Since allowing Gas, Electricity and other utility supplies to be owned by private companies, the British Public has been subject to a continuous upward increase in prices, usually followed by announcements of huge profits and obscene bonus payments.  If these industries can make such profits the government should re nationalise them, run them to the same standards and use these profits to reduce costs to the public and benefit our country. At the very least deny ownership of these companies ( British Gas etc) is maintained within the UK to prevent these profits benefitting foreign countries.",
