        "additional_details": "In many countries and cultures, it is usual for all women and girls over a certain age to have pierced ears. It should be made compulsory that all women in the UK aged 16 and over must have their earlobes pierced. This would apply not only to UK citizens and foreign citizens holding permanent resident rights through marriage to UK citizens etc, but also to temporary visitors too, who must have their ears pierced on entry to the UK if not already done. This law would apply retrospectively to all women, including those over the age of 16 at the time of its introduction, who must also have their ears pierced.",
