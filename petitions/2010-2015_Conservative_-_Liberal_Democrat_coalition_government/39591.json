This needs to be changed and a total overhaul of the sports dept in schools needs to be done.\r\n\r\nThe legacy of the olympics was to inspire a generation, how can we inspire the next generation of olympians if they are held back in the sport they shine in.\r\n\r\nCompetition, losing and winning is an essential part of life, and are an essential part of growing up and learning that if you want to do well at something you have to put the effort in, it also teaches children to be gracious in defeat and humble in victory.",
