Traffic jams, ineffective or no train services and costly fuel are stifling business and taking up vast amounts of the commuters time and money. The government department could:\r\n\r\n1. Investigate current failures/ hotspots (e.g M25 holdups, M6 Birmingham, inadequate rail services and areas lacking a decent public transport network)\r\n\r\n2. Consider the following:\r\n\r\n-Widening strategic motorway routes (with minimal environmental impact).\r\n\r\n-Subsidising freight on rail(to ease traffic and road damage, so reduce future road works).\r\n\r\n-Provide good incentives for motorists to use rail/public networks.\r\n\r\n-Work with key manufacturers to seek alternatives to petrol & diesel power sources.\r\n\r\n-Promote home/tele-working as a truly viable alternative to commuting, this alone could save Millions per year.",
