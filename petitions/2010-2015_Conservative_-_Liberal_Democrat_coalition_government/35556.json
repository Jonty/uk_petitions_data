        "additional_details": "Judges are rebelling against an attempt to make them contribute to their pensions for the first time.\r\nMaking judges pay contributions would cost a typical Crown Court judge \u00a3137 a month and save taxpayers around \u00a34million a year.\r\nThis  refusal to pay comes amid delicate negotiations with public sector unions to cut the cost of paying final salary pensions.\r\nJudges say they are a special case because of the constitutional need to protect their independence from Government, means politicians should never cut their pay.\r\nThe Government needs to bring about legislation to  abolish these blatantly unfair loop-holes & get-out clauses. Anyone earning money in the UK should be contributing a fair amount in both tax and pension contributions. This is an equality issue.",
