        "action": "Overturn EU pension annuity gender equality rules",
        "additional_details": "Currently, men often receive higher retirement incomes from their pensions than women. Women have a greater life expectancy, therefore retirement income providers offer a higher income to men in the knowledge they will, on average, pay out for a shorter period.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is set to change. New gender equality rules will take effect on 21 December - from that day onwards incomes from private pensions must be the same for men and women. This is likely to mean male incomes will fall.\r\n\r\nIn effect, men will be receiving less from their pension pots over a shorter period of retirement, to subsidise women, who will be living longer.  How can this be right?  The EU pension annuity gender equality rules should be overturned as they are clearly unfair.",
