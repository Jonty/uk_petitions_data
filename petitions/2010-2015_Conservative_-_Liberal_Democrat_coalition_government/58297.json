        "action": "Stop tax breaks for all religions in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Now that the Supreme Court of England and Wales has decided that Scientology is a religion and entitled to the same status as other religions in the UK, then they will receive the same tax breaks as other religions in the UK which will include being exempt from business rates for their premises, since they will claim that their premises are places of religious worship. This will gain the Church of Scientology more than half a millions pounds a year, which shortfall to the Treasury will be made up for by taxing businesses and the British taxpayer extra. I don't think that gifting this Church of Scientology with taxpayers' money is an acceptable thing. But since the Supreme Court has decided that they are on an equal footing with all other religions in England and Wales then the only way to stop their tax breaks is to stop tax breaks for all religions in the UK. If you agree with this then please sign this e-petition.",
