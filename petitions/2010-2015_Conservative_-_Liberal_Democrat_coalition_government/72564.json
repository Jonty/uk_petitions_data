        "additional_details": "Petitioning to help raise awareness and protect the Slow Loris.  Please veiw the recent BBC documentary regarding illegal pet trading etc and support the petition.  The documentary raised the point that a YouTube video of a domesticated slow loris looking cute and cuddly  had gained over half a million comments mostly asking where you could buy one as they were so cute. They may be cute but they belong in the wild and every one sold supports the illegal pet trade, capture, poaching and cruel treatment of endangered wild animals. Our county needs to do more to pressure other countries into protecting these and all other animals. Please support and sign this petition.",
