        "additional_details": "Margaret Thatcher's legacy is still being felt by all. In line with the Governments current policy of \"freeing up business\"  \"rolling back Government\". The undersigned believe the Government should put our former PMs upcoming funeral out the tender. I feel this would be attractive to business and the 3rd sector given the revocation on PQQs - and would show further that Britain is open for business!\r\n\r\nThe legacy of the former PM deserves nothing less than offering this unique opportunity to deal with the structural deficit and show we are taking the difficult choices for Britain.\r\n\r\nMargaret Thatcher's state funeral should be managed by the private or 3rd sector to offer the best value and choice for end users and other stakeholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
