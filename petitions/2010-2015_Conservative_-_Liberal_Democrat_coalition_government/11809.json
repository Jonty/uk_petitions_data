        "additional_details": "The huge increase in university fee's has led to a lot of students life plans/dreams being put out due to them not being able to afford the increased fee's, I've spoken to various students who would like to go university to study various subjects, 1 wanted to become a teacher but she can't afford the \u00a39,000 a year fee, another student wanted to do photography but again can't afford the fee's, another engineering but couldn't afford the fees. I personally feel this is stopping students being able to progress without being in masses of debt, and while I understand the original fee's where causing problems, an uneducated next generation due to excessive fees could cause a lack of qualified people in certain areas (Such as teaching, nursing or engineering) if the fees couldn't be reduced back to 3,000 then a smaller but still increased fee (Say for example 5,000) would still be more affordable and offer alot more people opportunities in the future.",
