        "additional_details": "I would like the government to introduce a weekly care programme for people who suffer from mental health issues .This would include the family of the person suffering to be involved with a constructive weekly care programme . To have access to professionals 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week. For home visits to be introduced, as many suffering cannot go out of their house. If appointments are missed, then the health professional can contact the family to inform them, so the family can take action to ensure the person suffering is not in danger. I would also like to  propose that if medication is perscribed , it is given is immediately to prevent further deterioration and that the care programme is to be on going. Mental health affects 1in 4 people in the uk . Mixed anxiety and depression is the most common mental disorder in Britain . So please sign and share this , in order for the government to take action . Many thanks .",
