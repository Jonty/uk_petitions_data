Mill Hill Broadway station is one of the busier stations on the Thameslink line yet the elderly, disabled, mothers with children and anyone with luggage have to struggle up two flights of steps to get to the platforms. We request the Department for Transport to provide Network Rail with the necessary funding to open up access to this busy station.",
