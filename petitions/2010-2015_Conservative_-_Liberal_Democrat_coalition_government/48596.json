Government tells us there is no money, yet reports suggest millions in public funds will be spent subsidising the funeral of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher despite claims that her personal estate runs in to an 8 figure sum.\r\n\r\nThis is a gross slap in the face to all who are suffering under the Government's austerity plan and should not be permitted.",
