        "additional_details": "For the mortal remains of England's last Plantagenet King, and the last King to die in battle, recently discovered under a Council car-park in Leicester, to be re-interred with due dignity and respect in Gloucester Cathedral.\r\nKing Richard had a strong link with the city of Gloucester. He was Duke of Gloucester and visited the city, granting it its charter in 1483. There is already one King buried in Gloucester Cathedral, Edward II. King Richard had no significant connection with Leicester beyond being killed there. He ought to lie in Gloucester Cathedral.",
