        "additional_details": "We, the democracy-loving people living in the UK and other parts of the world, urge you to press the Chinese Government to honor its promise of democratic elections to the Hong Kong citizens.\r\n\r\nBeijing\u2019s recent decision ruled out a democratic election of the HK Chief Executive, which has made large-scale peaceful protests in Hong Kong inevitable. Given Beijing's records, we fear a second Tiananmen Massacre will happen in Hong Kong. We believe that the UK as sovereign state of the previous British colony has the responsibility to prevent such bloody tragedies from happening. We hereby strongly appeal to the UK government to make it clear to the Beijing authorities that any effort to crackdown peaceful demonstrations by force will be strongly opposed and severely punished.",
