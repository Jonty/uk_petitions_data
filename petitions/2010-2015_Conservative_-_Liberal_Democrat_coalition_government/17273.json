        "additional_details": "There will always be parents who do not see teaching their children to respect and view the world objectively as a priority.  The culture of disrespect in this country has bred a generation of children who do not possess basic manners and skills essential for a productive and happy society. This disrespect has been indoctrinated into children through the media.  It is time there was a counterpoint to this in the form of compulsory 'Respect' lessons in schools (e.g. Years 6 - 11). These would involve speaking to children about domestic violence, discrimination, consumerism, sexualisation, tolerance, basic manners and morality (from a non-religious viewpoint) - and would encourage open discussion between students. They could also have guest speakers from various charities and organisations.  Teaching children about these issues from a young age would positively affect the decisions they make as young adults and beyond, reducing anti-social behaviour and a myriad of other issues.",
