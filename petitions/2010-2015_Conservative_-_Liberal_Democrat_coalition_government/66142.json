        "additional_details": "The government should introduce legislation making anyone speaking to a driver who is using a hand held mobile phone should have a statutory liability for all injury or damages caused in the event of the driver being involved in a motoring accident whilst the call is connected. The only defence would be that if the non driver can demonstrate (by recording the telephone conversation) that they asked the driver whether they were on hands free and were satisfied that they were, then the liability transfers back to the driver.",
