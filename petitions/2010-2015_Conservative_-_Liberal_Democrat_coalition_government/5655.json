        "additional_details": "The State Pension age must remain at 65. Most of the workforce will have worked for over 40 years by the time that they reach 65, and will have contributed in full for their hard earned retirement. The earlier that older people are released from the workforce, the sooner there are vacancies for younger people starting their careers, rather than paying them benefits or expecting them to do low paid work.\r\nBy forcing people to work until they are older could lead to many having shorter lives, especially those in manual or stressful occupations.\r\nThere are many, of my vintage, within 10 years of reaching 65, who will if the Law changes, not receive our State Pensions until we are 66. This is wrong, and the legislation must be halted.",
