        "additional_details": "Sheffield City Airport opened in 1998 and effectively closed to commercial flights in 2002, losing its CAA licence in 2008. A short-lived facility given the level of investment. Prior to its opening, Sheffield was the largest city in Europe without its own airport, and now, in reality, finds itself in that position again. Robin Hood Airport must be a good 20 miles away, and road and rail access to it is slow and unsatisfactory.\r\nSheffield City Airport once operated flights to Amsterdam, Several smaller cities in the UK seem to have thriving airports. The lack of an airport must surely disadvantage Sheffield in relation to other comparable regional hubs. This airport should be retained and reopened for the benefit of the local community, and the area's economy.",
