        "additional_details": "This petition calls on the British Government to create a parliamentary constituency for each of the British Overseas Territories, to allow them to elect a Member of Parliament to the House of Commons. This would include the British citizens of the Channel Islands, Gibraltar, the Falklands Islands and other Territories.\r\n\r\nFrance allows each of her Overseas Territories to elect a representative for their parliament. They have even recently created a representative for the French citizens in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe foreign policy of the British Overseas Territories is controlled by the Foreign Office, but electing their own representative at Westminster would allow them a greater say in the formation of this foreign policy, as well as enabling these MPs to represent & voice the wishes of the British citizens in each Territory.",
