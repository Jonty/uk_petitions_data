How can the BBC so ignore England and the English nation, whose population comprises 84% of the UK\u2019s total population?\r\n\r\nWith devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, much government is based at home nation level.  The BBC \u2018gets\u2019 the fact that Education and Health in Scotland are Scottish national issues, and properly cover these as such.  In contrast, the BBC refuse to acknowledge that England requires coverage of these political issues on an English national level.\r\n\r\nWhether or not in 2014 the Scottish nation will vote whether to secede from the Union, it is essential for the purposes of social cohesion in England that the BBC takes a constructive role in building a shared sense of English identity.\r\n\r\n",
