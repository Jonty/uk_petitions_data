        "additional_details": "These are the reasons the Government must stop this attempt by the Scottish to gain independence.\r\n\u2022There is a gap between public spending in Scotland (\u00a340bn) and revenue raised there (\u00a327bn). A Scottish government would have to choose between higher taxes and cuts in public services.\r\n\u2022Scotland has more influence in Brussels as part of the UK than it could have as an independent state.\r\n\u2022The integrated British economy is more capable than an independent Scotland would be of meeting the challenges of globalisation. Likewise, having independent defence and security structures would overstrain Scotland's resources.\r\nIf you agree with these please sign this petition and make your voice heard in this fight againsts Scottish Independence.\r\nSay NO TO SCOTTISH DEVOLUTION.",
