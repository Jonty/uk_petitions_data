Moby Golf at the junction of Whalebone Lane North and Eastern Avenue, Chadwell Heath RM6, we believe is causing driver distraction hence since opening accidents which have been fatal have increased since the attraction opened on I believe April this year.  The attraction can be seen from the junction, good for business, but not for road users distracted by it.  It needs blocking in, either fencing or trees.  This is an urgent request to save many more from getting injured and families losing loved ones.",
