ON THE TURNOVER OF THEIR BUSINESS.\r\nTHEY NEED TO DO SOMETHING AND FAST, EITHER HIGHER THE THRESHOLD TO \u00a3100,00.00 FROM \u00a379,000.00, OR AT LEAST IF WE GO OVER 79,000.00 PAY V.A.T. ON THE MARGIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 79,000.00 AND 100,000.00 THE DIFFERENCE TO US SMALL BUSINESS\u2019S WOULD MEAN A LOT OF US SURVIVING THIS RECESSION. THERE ARE ALREADY INDUSTRIES THAT WORK ON MARGIN I.E. THE CAR INDUSTRY, SO PLEASE WIDEN THE SPECTRUM.\r\n CUSTOMS AND EXCISE ARE CLOSING BUSINESS\u2019S WITH NO CHANCE OF RECLAIMING OWED TAXES. THIS SITUATION ONLY LOOSES JOBS, AND REVENUE FOR THE GOVERNMENT, IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE.\r\n",
