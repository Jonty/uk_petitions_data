        "additional_details": "As from April, tenants with a spare bedroom will struggle  to find 14 -25 percent of their rent due to the bedroom tax. Their crime is that they need a little help from the state. Many will have to give up their first and only home. These are not people who cannot get out of bed in the morning but have worked most of their lives.\r\nIt should be proposed that the same criteria be applied to MP's second homes - they only need one bedroom whilst working at Westminster. The state too pays these allowances and they should be brought into line with the legislation created for the rest of the country. They should not be exempt. ",
