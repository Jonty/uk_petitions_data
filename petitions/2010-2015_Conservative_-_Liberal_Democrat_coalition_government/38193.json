        "additional_details": "We would like to see the licensing of all airguns in England. Many animals are injured and killed with these guns and it is unacceptable. There have also been several incidents where children have been shot and killed. These types of guns are not toys and it should not be so easy to buy them. Licensing these guns may prevent them from getting into the wrong hands. Something needs to be done",
