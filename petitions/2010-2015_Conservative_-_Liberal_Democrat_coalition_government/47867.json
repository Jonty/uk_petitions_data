        "additional_details": "We the undersigned want the government to carry through and expand welfare reforms to cut the huge welfare bill. We the hardworking employees need a voice too. After paying taxes on our incomes and savings, paying national insurance and some paying student loan repayments we still have to pay our rents, mortgages and council tax bills wihout help. So why should others who don't work have more at the end of month than us. It is a question of fairness. Save our country from running out of money. Make work pay. Reward success and raise the tax bands further.",
