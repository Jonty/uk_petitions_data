        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the Secretary of State to establish an independent and open enquiry into what appears to be widespread mal-administration at the Peak District NP Authority [PDNPA].  We believe that officers are regularly abusing their position of Trust and are failing to serve the community.  As the Authority is effectively unaccountable the most senior officers appear to repeatedly excuse and covering up gross failings in order to prevent external review.\r\n\r\nA similarly unaccountable National Park, the Brecon Beacons NP in Wales, recently underwent an external review which found gross mis-conduct resulting in the CE and other senior officers losing their posts \u2013 the issues in the Brecon Beacons appear to pale into insignificance compared with those at the PDNPA.\r\n\r\nWe do not believe that the residents of the National Park can wait for the proposed \u2018democratisation\u2019 of the Authority for these issues to be addressed.\r\n\r\n",
