        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the UK Government to introduce a nationwise experimental programme of Vipassana meditation, as taught by Satya Narayan Goenka, into all UK prisons as an essential part of the rehabilitation and healing process.\r\n\r\nVipassana Meditation was tried on an experimental basis in Lancaster prison with significant success in\r\n1998.\r\n\r\nDr Kishore Chandiramani, a lecturer in psychiatry based at the Queen Elizabeth Psychiatric Hospital in Birmingham, quizzed prison staff on whether the technique had proved useful.\r\n\r\nHe found it helped improve inmates' discipline and their willingness to co-operate with prison authorities.\r\n\r\nHis work also showed that inmates who studied the technique were less prone to depression, feelings of hostility and helplessness and a sense of hopelessness.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners themselves readily accepted the technique, said Dr Chandiramani, and the cost of running training courses was minimal.\r\n",
