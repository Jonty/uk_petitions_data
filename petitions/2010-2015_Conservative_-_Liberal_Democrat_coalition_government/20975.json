This would stop the unnecessary work and costs to both the owner of the plate who has to pay every year to keep it but cannot use is it on an older car and also the departments dealing with all the paperwork this involves.  A personal number plate costs a lot to purchase and register and is usually bought for personal reasons and, now that technology has moved forward, please allow them to be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
