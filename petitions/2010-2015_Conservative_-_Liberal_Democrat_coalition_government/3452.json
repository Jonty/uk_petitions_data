This: creates large scale wealth inequality; artificially increases house-prices - making home-ownership out of the reach of many aspiring people; has an unsettling effect on communities; restricts genuine housing stocks for settling families; perpetuates an immoral economic model where poorer people pay the mortgage of wealthier people; and leaves vulnerable people at the mercy of hapless amateur landlords who do not keep responsibilities to their tenants.
