        "additional_details": "Many people in the UK suffer from asthma. A huge amount of these people include students who need to travel to school or to college and university.\r\n\r\nThere are university students who are not living nearby the institution they are a student of and therefore need to travel far in order to get there on time.\r\n\r\nIt would be a huge advantage for them to get a way to travel to the university with a free mobility bus pass so that they are not making their condition any worse.\r\n\r\nThis means that sufferers will use less medication such as inhalers when walking or cycling to the university. Using less inhalers will ensure that the sufferer is keeping to his daily dosage limit and it also means that less prescriptions will be required.\r\n\r\nI ask everyone with severe asthma or moderate asthma where they need to take inhaler puffs every few minutes or so to sign this petition.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
