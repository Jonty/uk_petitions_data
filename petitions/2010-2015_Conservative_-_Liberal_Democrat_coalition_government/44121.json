So lets change the mindset of the country and reduce benefits payments to the unemployed to be either set at or just below the minimum wage.\r\nWhy should an unemployed couple with one child get a free two bedroom house and get \u00a31200 per month in benefit payments??? This is more than the minimum wage and totally unfair.",
