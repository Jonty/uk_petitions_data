We should not punish the citizens of Northern Ireland who truly act in chivalric ways for the greater good. Scotland have the Order of the Thistle, The Kingdom of England and Wales have the Garter, let Northern Ireland have St Patrick.\r\n\r\nThis is a call for a more active role of the Order, with it's last award being delegated in 1936 and it's last member dying in 1974 with Prince Henry. Please help us keep this noble order alive.",
