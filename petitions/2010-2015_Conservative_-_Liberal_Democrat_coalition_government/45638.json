        "additional_details": "Currently most MPs have their own website, these websites provide a vital link with the community, and a way to keep voters engaged and informed.\r\nThis is however flawed for several reasons;\r\n- First, the websites can be difficult to find as they do not follow a uniform naming convention.\r\n- Second, the cost of hosting and domains for hundreds of sites is borne through expenses; as is explicitly included in the Green Book.\r\n- Third, these sites are already limited by the rules of parliament, this must be difficult to enforce due to their distributed nature.\r\n- Finally, it is left to each MP to ensure that their site is secured, potentially leaving some open to abuse.\r\nI therefore propose that each MP is provided with secure access to a completely separate area on the parliament.uk domain, such as;\r\nhttp://www.parliament.uk/my-mp/member-name\r\nAlongside this funding for hosting external websites and domains should be phased out as current commitments wind down.",
