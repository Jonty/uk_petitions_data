I was unlawfully arrested and taken to the station  and while in custody I was arrested again because the first arrest had nothing to rely on so the second arrest was a joke because there was no name of a victim or any information or statement taken from the alleged victim.\r\nSo I was arrested while in custody for nothing.",
