        "additional_details": "What constitutes racial abuse is blurred, therefore clear guidelines are required. Using racial terms/insults can severely distress/persecute the victim & are forms of verbal & psychological abuse. What is regarded as racism depends on the context it was said. Racist terms used can range from banter, carelessness, as a form of swearing to ACTUALLY ridiculing/demeaning one\u2019s racial origins, bullying, hatred, disgust, degrading prejudice, etc. Even if racial remarks are said as a form of swearing & thus \u2018letting off steam\u2019, it should be discouraged. Attribution of fault on another person can range from looking sympathetically at the other person\u2019s unique situation/social circumstances (e.g. living environment) to the other person's personal (racial) attributes. Angry/upset people tend to get personal with the other people\u2019s personal attributes. Perhaps a racist will refer to other person's colour of skin all the time, whilst a non-racist may do so on only when angry, upset, in jest, etc.",
