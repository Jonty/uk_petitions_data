        "additional_details": "We want the government to reach the goal of universal primary education. In 2000, over 180 countries committed to the Millennium development goals, which included universal education for all by 2015. However, 60 million children remain unschooled. UNESCO estimates that 250 million children are illiterate. At this rate, about 48 million children will lack schooling in 2015. Education is a fundamental right, stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Every child irrespective of race, gender, nationality, religion or disability is entitled to free elementary education.\r\n\r\n\r\nSigning this petition shows you want:\r\n\r\n\u2022 The UK to provide aid for education in the developing world.\r\n\u2022 Developed nations to ensure education is relevant, of good quality and leads to learning skills.\r\n\u2022 Developed countries to establish standards and training for school teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour support will help us show the strength of our GCSE Citizenship campaign and the global campaign for education.\r\n",
