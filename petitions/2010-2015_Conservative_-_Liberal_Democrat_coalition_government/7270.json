Criminals and yobs do not perceive these light touch sentences as any kind of sanction.\r\nWe want our government to take control of Law and Order. Criminals should be jailed, and should be made to work to earn their keep, and pay for the cost of keeping them in jail. They should not be given access to privileges without earning them against tough targets. Parents of children found to be rioting must be held to account.\r\nWe must finally restore common sense to the justice system take control over Law and Order.",
