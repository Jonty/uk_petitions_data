        "additional_details": "Given the recent revelations about GCHQ's 'Tempora' programme UK citizens are facing the greatest threat to their civil liberties in this countries history. Indiscriminate surveillance is being collected on the populace on a massive scale with no public mandate or accountabilty. This is being allowed through a legal loophole which would have been legitimised with the snoopers charter. If this kind of system is allowed to exist at all at the very least it should have a mandate from both the public and parliament - with external accountability and auditing. No publicly accountable body currently exists to audit this programme.\r\n\r\nThis petition demands a debate in Parliament to examine the implications of this programme, for the government and GCHQ's legal advice on this programme to be reviewed, and for a full public consultation and possible inquiry on the implications of this programme and impact on the individuals human rights and right to privacy under both UK and EU law.",
