The investigation has uncovered the appalling plight of animals: \"Behind the closed doors of this \u2018world-leading university\u2019, our investigator discovered a nightmare world for animals used in experiments: animals who suffered even more than necessary for an experiment and died because of staff incompetence and neglect; a failure to provide adequate anaesthesia and pain relief; breaches and lack of knowledge of UK Home Office project licences and the shocking way in which animals were killed \u2013 all to the relentless blaring sounds of pop music.\"  Imperial should lose their license over this; an example must be set to other universities.  Without public pressure and government action the staff responsible in this case will, at most, be 'disciplined'.  This is not acceptable and will not provide a proper deterrent to future abuse.",
