        "additional_details": "Elections to the European Parliament must be held using a proportional system, either single transferable vote or party list PR. At present, elections in Great Britain are held using closed list PR, the least democratic legal system.\r\nUnder closed list PR, voters have no choice as to who represents them, merely their parties. Which candidates get elected depends on the party as much as the voters choosing who they want as MEP.\r\nAs the vote is non-transferable, many of the votes go to waste on non-winnable positions, a problem exacerbated by the size of constituencies in Britain, with amongst the fewest MEPs per constituency in Europe.\r\nSTV solves these problems with few disadvantages. It would help connect voters to their MEPs, by allowing voters to support individual candidates instead of having to vote for a party. By transferring votes, fewer votes would be wasted, and the candidates would have a greater mandate. STV is good enough for Northern Ireland, why not the rest of the UK?",
