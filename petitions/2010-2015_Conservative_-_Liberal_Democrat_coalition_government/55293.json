This would ensure all claimants are attending interviews each time they go into a Job Centre and would ensure someone claiming would get the job.\r\n\r\nIt should also be introduced that all JSA claimants should attend the Job Centre in formal attire, a collar and tie at least in preparation for interviews that day, as to give a good impression to the interviewer, and that they be ready to go off to other interviews should there be other employers interviewing that day.
