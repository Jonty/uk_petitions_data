        "additional_details": "Critical thinking is a self-disciplined way of looking at the world. It teaches you to look at the world with an open-mind, to raise questions and problems, gather the relevant information with which to answers those questions and come to reasoned, objective and self-corrected conclusions.\r\n\r\nGiving our children the tools with which to assess the world objectively for themselves is more important now than ever. We are living in the age of information, television, newspapers and the internet provide a constant barrage of conflicting information. Without the necessary tools to assess the validity of this information or to understand the world around us it is easy to develop a biased, prejudiced, distorted and uninformed view.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned propose that the Department for Education seek to bring Critical Thinking more explicitly and systematically into the national curriculum.\r\n",
