I've met thousands if patients who are absolutely addicted, even some who have lost their family over these drugs. I see it everyday. ABUSE, causes a lack of motivation to look after your family, yourself, to work, to maintain hygiene (costs nhs more ultimately). How I as a pharmacist can easily recognise this issue yet drs can't. I don't understand. Paracetamol and codeine effervescence is absolutely abused, the latest drug is diphenhydramine as a sleep aid. Also to add to this I can't understand why people are prescribed Zopiclone so readily, a very strong hypnotic actually used as a sleep aid most commonly. Supposed to prescribed for absolute short term use like in grieving over a lost family member over a week. Makes me angry that I have to help patients pick up the pieces of their lives due to incompetent prescribing!!! ",
