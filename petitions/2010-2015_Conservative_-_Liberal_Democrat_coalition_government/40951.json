If a school fails to meet the minimum standards in providing an education it has unacceptably jeopardised the education and prospects of its pupils. The school should immediately be closed, and to compensate the pupils, the Department of Education should foot the bill for them to attend the country's top independent schools.\r\n\r\nAfter being inadequately serviced by a failing school, a top independent school provides a student with the best chance of recovering lost ground. After being failed by state education, the government has a duty to provide such pupils with the best chance of repairing their damaged educations.",
