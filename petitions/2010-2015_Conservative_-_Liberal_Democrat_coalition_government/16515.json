        "additional_details": "Many parents of children who have separated have shared residency orders. This may mean that they spend an equal amout of time with each parent over a year.\r\n\r\nHowever the CSA does not take this into account. The only issue they take into account is who claims the Child Benefit.\r\n\r\nIt may be the case that the parent who is being claimed against spends an equal amount of time or even more with their children, but they are still allowed to claim.\r\n\r\nThis is completely unfair and needs urgent reform, please sign my petition.\r\n\r\n",
