        "additional_details": "Caversham, Reading UK  is a picturesque  village on the banks of the River Thames. The main road which is the hub of the community and is flanked by shops and restaurants does have one pelican crossing but the traffic exceeds 30mph most times and residents want 20mph to help with traffic calming. Also people want to enjoy this reach of road without worrying about speeding cars, so PLEASE help Caversham, Church Road become a 20mph. Thank you.",
