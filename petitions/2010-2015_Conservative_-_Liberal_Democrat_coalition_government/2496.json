When I try to confirm my entry as per your email I receive the notification 'page not found'.\r\n\r\nThis is not the problem but it does confirm my belief that  this is a flawed idea.    Suggesting that we can all take part in government simply defies the maths.    If members of parliament were doing their job effectively they would recognise what was considered important and what was not.    This system allows well organised and motivated minorities to have a disproportionate impact on the system.   Sir George Young's comment on BBC News do more to confirm my fears than alleviate them.
