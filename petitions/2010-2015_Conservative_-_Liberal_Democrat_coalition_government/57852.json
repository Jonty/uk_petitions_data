        "additional_details": "As seen on TV recently, where the pregnant Italian lady had forced surgery and was then separated from her infant, ECC do not care about people.  This month alone:\r\nThey ignored a 12,000 community petition, representations from other Local Authorities and their own Scrutiny Committee and closed the Deanes an OFSTED rated Good School using massaged figures.\r\nThe Basildon Highways panel currently comprises all of Basildon\u2019s elected County Councillors 3 Tories, 3 UKIP and 3 Labour.  They want to exclude 5 of the 6 opposition Councillors elected by the people.\r\nThey plan to save \u00a33m from the Youth Services budget whilst looking to spend \u00a35.5m on administrative tendering processes.\r\nECC is not open and transparent it\u2019s arrogant and abuses the powers invested in them to the detriment of the people.  We WANT the organisation dissolved, its assets stripped and the funding utilised to finance the re-organisation of current service provision to new local Unitary Authorities. ",
