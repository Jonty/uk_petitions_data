            "details": "As this e-petition has received more than 10 000 signatures, the relevant Government department have provided the following response:\r\n\r\nThe future of Hong Kong is of great importance to the UK, both as a signatory of the \u2018Sino-British Joint Declaration\u2019 and as a country closely connected to Hong Kong by business, cultural, educational, economic and other ties.\r\n\r\nAs the then Foreign Secretary the Rt Hon William Hague MP noted in the most recent Six Monthly Report to Parliament, published in July 2014, some commentators suggested that the Chinese State Council White Paper signalled that Hong Kong\u2019s high degree of autonomy was under threat. We note that both the Central People\u2019s Government in Beijing and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government have been explicit that the White Paper did not represent a change in policy.\r\n\r\nThe British Government\u2019s position is clear: Hong Kong\u2019s unique constitutional framework has worked well. It is important that it continues to be respected, and is seen to be respected, by all sides. The principles of \u2018One Country, Two Systems\u2019 and a high degree of autonomy, as enshrined in the Joint Declaration and Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China, are vital for the future of Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nThe UK government hopes that all parties will engage constructively in the next round of consultations on Hong Kong\u2019s constitutional development to allow a meaningful advance for democracy in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nThe Government has responded to two debates in Parliament on Hong Kong since the start of October: one, in the House of Commons, on 22 October (http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm141022/halltext/141022h0001.htm), and one in the House of  Lords on 16 October (http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldhansrd/text/141016-0002.htm#14101679000328).\r\n\r\n(Published as of XXX November \u2013 A further updated response may be provided by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as necessary)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.",
