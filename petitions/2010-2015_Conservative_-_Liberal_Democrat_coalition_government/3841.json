        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, believe that at the moment too many universities are unfairly charging the maximum tuition fee. We understand that the government will not back down on their decision to increase the cap to \u00a39000 and so we put it forward that these fees should be regulated correctly. These regulations could be based on a university's position in the league tables, their general results pattern, student satisfaction or they could be based on the course (some courses require more equipment and the universities could therefore charge more for those courses). There are other options for new regulations as well, anything that could make the fees more fair for everyone.",
