        "additional_details": "The government should stop Essex County council closing it's children's homes. Many off the homes have been getting good inspection reports and by closing them there is no care provision in Essex other than fostering for vulnerable young people. If a distressed young child cannot maintain a foster placement - if there is a suitable one available that is, then they are going to end up being sent many 100's of miles away to a private home costing the tax payer a fortune and further distressing the child.",
