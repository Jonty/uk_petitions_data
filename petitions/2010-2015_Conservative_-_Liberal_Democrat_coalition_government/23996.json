As a result, many unemployed applicants become demoralised and disillusioned; whereas, with useful feedback, applicants can adjust and improve their applications and the way in which they present themselves as potential employees.\r\n\r\nThus, businesses will receive better-constructed, more relevant applications, from motivated, better-presented applicants, making the process of hiring staff easier.\r\n\r\nThe Government should take immediate action to ensure businesses respond, with feedback, to all complete applications received.
