        "additional_details": "Retail giants consistently provide lengthy receipts and vouchers regardless of whether a customer purchases 1 item or 100.\r\n\r\nIssuing an unnecessary amount of paper in the form of receipts and vouchers during a transaction is irresponsible for companies to be doing in this day and age, where green energy and environmentally friendly technology needs more investment to help pave the way to a cleaner and more sustainable future.\r\n\r\nThis petition is aimed at ensuring the government pressures retailers, such as WH Smith, to acknowledge this is environmentally unfriendly, and to start proactively working on, and implementing, continuous development and solutions that reduce the amount of paper used per transaction through limitations on the amount of paper allowed to be issued per transaction by a retailer.\r\n\r\nUK retailers hand out over 10 billion paper receipts each year. Reducing the size of, or eliminating, receipts and vouchers will go a long way to preserving the planets forestry.",
