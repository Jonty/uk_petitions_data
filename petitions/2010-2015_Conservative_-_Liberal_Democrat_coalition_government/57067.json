There would be wide spread panic and concern if this were at the hands of a flu epidemic or murderer. The effect is the same and so should the effort be to prevent further deaths.\r\nEach death leaves a black mark against the efforts  TfL make to increase cycle safety.\r\nThese numbers are unacceptable and warrant the need for the Government to get involved and aid TfL in increasing their efforts, as they evidently fall short of what's needed.\r\nPlease help.
