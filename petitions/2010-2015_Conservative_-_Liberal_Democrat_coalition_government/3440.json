The government has the power to overturn the decision to give the train project to Siemens so why don't they do that. Giving it to Siemens will not only be pumping money into the German ecomony but several British jobs will be lost, meaning more money being spent on benefits for the redundant costing the British taxpayer. How does that benefit Britain? Give British jobs to British companys! And if the EU don't like it then lets have a referendum.",
