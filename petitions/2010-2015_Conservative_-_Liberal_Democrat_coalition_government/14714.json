The problem seems to be; an 'inherent part of our modern advanced capitalist system', and should be recognised as such by government. With this humility, and in the recognition of the repetitive failures, by all types of governments: tough action should be taken. This should fall on local authorities (diversity of employment activity, facilities, training - reasons) applied by central government and in law. Local authorities should be heavily fined, or given an extremely strong incentive, to get every Neet that lives within its area (that registers - a check up made on Neets that don't) to be given some form of employment, education or training (for a reasonable reward). The long-term waste, and cost, to the government and society, of the Neet problem, is unsustainable.",
