(OF ANY DESCRIPTION)\r\n* \"Celebrity\" opinions on any subject whatsoever.\r\n* 30-second BBC promo advert thingies.\r\n* Programming which focuses on the BBC itself and would not be shown on a commercial channel.\r\n* TV and iPlayer content which unfairly over-represents minority languages in the UK (Scots, Welsh, or any other) - the quantity of this is alienating and divisive to an Englishman.\r\n\r\nIt's a broadcasting service which serves a function. That is to entertain and inform, not to self-promote or build cults of personality.",
