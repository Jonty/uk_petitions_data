        "action": "That the United Kingdom secedes from the EU and sets it's own financial trading levy at half of the EU rate",
        "additional_details": "The Government is concerned that a Financial Transaction levy (Tobin tax) proposed by the EU will disproportionately affect the UK as a large percentage of EU Finance is carried out in the City of London.\r\n\r\nThe present financial recession has been caused by reckless  Financial Trading yet the Traders appear to be least affected by it.\r\n\r\nThe majority of people in the UK wish for a referendum on secession from the EU.  It is  required that the secession occurs and that the UK institutes it's own levy at 50% of the proposed EU level, thereby keeping a financial edge for the UK but off-setting any financial loss caused by secession.",
