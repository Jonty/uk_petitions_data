The cost of mobile electronics is ridiculously high as providers sue each other for the most pithy of patent infringements.  It would be near impossible for a new company to develop a mobile device without having to pay ridiculous royalties and as such products are more expensive than they should be.  Patents were originally created to protect companies AND competition.  The current patent practices do not protect competition and are stifling new companies ability to compete.  It needs to be addressed as the only winners seem to be the patent lawyers.  ",
