        "additional_details": "The Francis Report has really opened a can of worms that needed to be out there. But the vast majority of nurses are caring, wonderful people that really want to make the patient experience as positive as possible.  It's the 'must meet targets' and 'save money at any cost' attitude that's been interbred with the NHS that has impacted on patient care. There are not enough nurses allocated to each ward - the result is demoralised nurses who exhaust themselves on 12 hour shifts, working to complete all the compulsory tasks, whilst they long to spend more time on patient care. Government, please allow the Francis Report to lead to positive changes in the NHS ... MORE nurses on each ward so we CAN give the care we're already capable of, and so desperate to give!",
