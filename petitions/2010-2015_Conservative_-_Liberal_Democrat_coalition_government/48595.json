She also said she did not want a public funeral on the grounds of cost.  She would object to the planned public funeral for this reason alone.\r\n\r\nShe was not royalty.\r\nShe has lived as a private individual since her resignation as PM.\r\nShe was a divisive person and her passing does not need marking in this way.\r\nUse the money for the living, not the dead.
