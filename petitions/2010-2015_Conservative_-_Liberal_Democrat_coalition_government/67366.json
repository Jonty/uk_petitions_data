        "action": "Petition to request amendments to the infrastructure bill, to stop energy companies from being allowed to drill under my property without my consent.",
        "additional_details": "I am extremely concerned with the Government's decision which is pending a consolation to propose within the infrastructure bill, a law which would make it possible for energy companies to drill for gas and oil under people's homes and land without their consent. Public opposition to these plans is estimated at 74 per cent so the Government lacks a popular mandate to institute this change. According to a YouGov survey published on the 6th of May 2014, 73% of Tory and 70% Lib Dem potential voters believe energy firms should be required to have permission. Only 13% of respondents said energy firms should not be required to have permission.\r\nThis law would priorities the interests of big business over the rights of ordinary citizens, their properties and the protection of the environment. I am strongly opposed to these elements of the bill and request these elements of the bill to be amended.",
