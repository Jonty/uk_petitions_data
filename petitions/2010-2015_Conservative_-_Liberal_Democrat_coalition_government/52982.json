        "additional_details": "Debating & legislating laws on child porn, pornography & censorship together is emotive, devicive & doesn't bring clarity to the issue. It risks trivialising child porn, which is clearly abhorrent but using its emotive nature to colour the debate on pornography which is a different subject. Again censorship/stopping child access to porn is important. All 3 subjects deserve to be debated separately and sensibly.",
