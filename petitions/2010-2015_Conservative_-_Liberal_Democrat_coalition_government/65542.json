        "additional_details": "The education secretary, Michael Gove, has decided to scrap the classical books such as the American Bildungsroman novel 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and 'Of Mice and Men' -  a barbaric decision.\r\n\r\nMichael Gove is the same education secretary who said that he wanted children to read books like Twilight, in 2013, too.\r\n\r\nAs Atticus once said: \"Delete the adjectives and [you will] have the facts.\" Therefore, by banning American novels, you are banning novels. A novel itself should be appreciated for its content, and not for where it was written.\r\n\r\nActions which needs to be taken by the Department for Education:\r\n\r\n1. Any education secretary, including Michael Gove, should not be able to dictate what children and teenagers read.\r\n\r\n2. Michael Gove should allow novels like \"To Kil a Mockingbird\" and \"Of Mice and Men\" into the curriculum again.\r\n\r\n3. An apology from the Department of Education for allowing the decision to happen.",
