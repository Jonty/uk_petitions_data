        "additional_details": "Department for Transport statistics show that young drivers account for just 5% of all the miles driven on our roads, but they are involved in 20% of serious crashes involving death or serious injuries.  Also, more than a fifth of deaths on British roads in 2011 involved drivers aged 17-24.  Drive At School (in association with The Driving Project) launched in England in 2012.  Co-founders Matthew Best and Lee Bonnici, both Advanced Driving Instructors, believe a lack of driver education, rather than age, is the reason one in four young drivers crash within a year of passing their driving test.  Combining both practical and theory education within secondary school, this is a serious project which is aiming to lower road casualties.  The aim of this petition is to make under-17 driver education compulsory in the UK as part of the National Curriculum in an attempt to save young lives and make our roads safer for us all.  The message is simple: Educating a Safer Generation of Drivers.",
