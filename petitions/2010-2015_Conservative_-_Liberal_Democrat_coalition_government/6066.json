        "additional_details": "The cost of Premium Rate telephone services in the United Kingdom is too high and many of the services exploit vulnerable and disabled people into using them when they do not have too much money. As we know, the scandal in 2007 when many television companies that used competitions and quizes with a Premium Rate number proves my point. Do people who have difficulty with relationships because of social and personal relationship difficulties have to use Premium Rate numbers in order to try and get a chance to meet someone? It doesn't seem fair, and at times, the poor can pay more than the rich when it comes to things like this. I would like to see the end of Premium Rate telephone services in the United Kingdom as soon as possible because they are unfair, elitist and even sexist.     ",
