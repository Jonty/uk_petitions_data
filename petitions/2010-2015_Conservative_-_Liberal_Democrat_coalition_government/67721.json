A crime in many countries.\r\n\r\nSurely that now there is a warrant out for Julian Assange's arrest, any property, digital or hard, should be seized or destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe highly damaging information that has been revealed on their may have set back Global Counter Terrorism Intelligence 5 years or more.\r\n\r\nPlease, action something of this kind.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nO.",
