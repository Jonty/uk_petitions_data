I believe our MPs should not be able to vote on legislation that affects only England. I agree with a referendum to set up an English Parliament.  Let's make Westminster the UK only parliament,  if England gets its own parliament then if one devolved parliament wants more powers then we can make it that all devolved parliaments get the same powers.",
