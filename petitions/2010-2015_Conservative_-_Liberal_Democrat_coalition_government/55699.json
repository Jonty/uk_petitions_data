        "additional_details": "A need to severely improve the link between Scunthorpe and Lincoln, due to the inadequacy of the A15.  The road is slow, narrow and extremely dangerous for overtaking slow moving vehicles, particularly tractors and HGV's.\r\n\r\nThe road connects the major Humber ports to the south of Lincolnshire and beyond.  By making it a dual carriageway, this would improve journey times as well as greatly handle the growing number of vehicles that use it on a daily basis.  It could also potentially improve the road distribution of goods imported and exported via the Humber ports.",
