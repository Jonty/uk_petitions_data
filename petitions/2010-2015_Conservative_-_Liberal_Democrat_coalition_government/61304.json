We need to take action to prevent the currency cynicism around our political system from becoming a mass crisis in political engagement.\r\n\r\nBy educating young people at an earlier age of 13-15 about politics we can increase their awareness,attitude and motivation in politics. It would also increase the number of votes as people know what they are voting for.",
