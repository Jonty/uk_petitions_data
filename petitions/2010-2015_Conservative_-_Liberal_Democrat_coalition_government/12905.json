        "additional_details": "It is an offence to carry out tattooing on any person under 18, but it is not an offence to carry out any form of piercing except genital piercing on persons under 18.  We believe that it should be unlawful for anyone to carry out ANY kind of piercing on a minor, regardless of parental consent.  These procedures are purely a fashion choice, which no adult should be allowed to inflict on a minor, and which should not be allowed until the person is an adult themselves and able to make the choice for themselves in full understanding of the potential consequences, medical and social, which may arise.",
