        "additional_details": "UK energy policies, laws & regulations to mandate gas, petrol, diesel & aviation fuel suppliers to keep 2 weeks' reserve supply of each fuel in each region.\r\n\r\nThe UK gas supply has a 2-day reserve; France has a 2-week reserve. This leaves the UK more vulnerable to changing market & supply conditions.\r\nThe UK was unable to take advantage of a surplus in gas supply because we had inadequate storage facilities.\r\nThe UK needs more resilience in fuel supplies as we import more and produce less. Fill up empty UK gasholders for the winter.\r\n\r\nThis policy will ensure that the UK does not run out of gas or other fuels in the winter.\r\nIt will also improve companies' ability to buy more fuel when the price is lower, saving on consumer bills.\r\nSpreading the storage by region reduces the impact of any break in the national supply networks.\r\n\r\nDept. of Energy to update policies, laws & regulations to mandate a minimum of 2 weeks' supply of each fuel, to be stored regionally.",
