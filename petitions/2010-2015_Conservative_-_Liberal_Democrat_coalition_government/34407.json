        "additional_details": "Face book has become one of the easiest  FREE places to advertise  pets, with thousands of groups /pages set up by anyone who wants to set them up . Thousands of Animals exchange hands on FB every day. There is no policing of any of these groups or the content posted on them . People are breeding pets and using FBs FREE groups to sell them. With many people never doing home checks or any background checks on buyers, dogs cats rabbits and so on are being handed to whoever has the cash or even given away free. People are breeding without health testing and using FB to offload there unwanted pets.. THIS NEEDS TO STOP.  Help me by signing a petition to ban all pet for sale groups/pages, and pages used to encourage breeding such as stud dog pages . This FREE pass to Animal abuse needs to stop NOW ",
