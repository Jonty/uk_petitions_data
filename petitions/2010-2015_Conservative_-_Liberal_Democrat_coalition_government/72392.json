        "additional_details": "According to the present requirements to settle in the UK, a Tier2 General Visa holder is required to have lived and worked in the UK for a continuous period of 5 years.\r\n\r\nHowever, time spent on Tier-1 post study work permit is excluded for the calculation of the 5 year period.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned believe that the calculation of 5 years should include all forms of legal employment - including time spent on post-study visa. This is because:\r\n1. To obtain post-study visa, the applicant has paid valid Visa fees.\r\n2. They have been paying taxes and contributing to NHS legally through their employers\r\n\r\nTo clarify, the undersigned believe that if a person has not been employed during the post-study work permit, this time should be excluded from the calculation of 5 years for the purpose of ILR.",
