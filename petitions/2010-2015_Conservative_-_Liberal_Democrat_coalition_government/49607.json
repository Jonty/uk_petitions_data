        "additional_details": "Signing up for Universal Job Match (UJM) and uploading a CV is being made mandatory for JSA claimants.\r\nPlease sign this petition to stop the compulsory use of UJM. JSA claimants are facing completely draconian and unfair sanctions (removal of their benefit) not for not looking for a job, but for not doing so by using the UJM system.\r\nThis is disgusting; victimisation. It is intimidating and unhelpful to real job seekers who feel constrained and stressed by the need to prove their job hunting using a system which is widely criticised ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Jobmatch) with a number of security issues; whilst leaving it open to the very very few who are lazy to cheat the system by logging on to the system and clicking on a few jobs and saying they are not suitable.\r\nUJM is being used as a method of finding easy victims for sanctions  (see http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/mar/28/jobcentre-scorecard-areas-stopping-benefits).\r\nThs system limits my words to this.",
