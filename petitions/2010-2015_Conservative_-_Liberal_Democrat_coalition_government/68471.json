        "additional_details": "In October you will not be able to sell on your car tax when selling your car, instead you will receive an automatic refund for any WHOLE months you still have left, whereas the buyer must backdate the tax to the beginning of the month.\r\nSo unless you transfer your car registration at midnight on the last day of the month the Govt will receive DOUBLE the money for that month\r\nMy proposal is that the seller receives a refund to the nearest day not month and the buyer buys car tax from the point of sale. As all calculations are done by computer, there is absolutely no reason for this to be implemented apart from stealth taxation .",
