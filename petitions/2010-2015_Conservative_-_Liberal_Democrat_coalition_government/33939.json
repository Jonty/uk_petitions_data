        "additional_details": "Print, TV and digital media in UK and abroad keeps using the word Islamists to use for any terror activity comitted by so called Islamic groups. Do you don't feel this is injustice to majority of muslims who are peaceful and adhere to laws of their country and practice Islam which stands for peace and humanity.\r\nWhy not just write or publish these group names like Al-Qaeeda or whatever crap these group name themselves. Why do the media have to add \"Islamists\"? It is just for sensationalism and selling news and nothing else.\r\n\r\nI request the government to stop this illegal activity of marginalising peoples belief.\r\n",
