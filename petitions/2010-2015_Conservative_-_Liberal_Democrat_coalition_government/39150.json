        "additional_details": "One factor which contributes to the low level of cycling in the UK is the attitude of the police to cyclists. Too often cyclists are regarded as a nuisance who do not deserve to use the road. The recent incident in which the Chief Whip was required by the police to dismount and wheel his bicycle through the pedestrian gate on leaving Downing Street exemplifies this attitude.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Home Office to encourage the police to recognise that cyclists are vulnerable road users who deserve at least as much respect as other road users.",
