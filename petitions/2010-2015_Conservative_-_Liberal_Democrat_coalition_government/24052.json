        "action": "Reduce Teachers' Retirement Age Limit",
        "additional_details": "The recent proposals on pension reform propose raising the age limit at which teachers can retire in line with the national limit i.e. 68 years old eventually.  The physically demanding nature of the profession is quite different from the office based roles of civil servants with which it is often compared in retirement policies.  The vast majority of teachers are unable to perform the role beyond 60 years of age and many quit prior.  I petition the government to reduce the age limit at which teachers can retire and collect their full pension based on the physical demands of the job and the typical age which someone can perform these duties effectively up to (in much the same way as currently done for the Fire Brigade and the Police).",
