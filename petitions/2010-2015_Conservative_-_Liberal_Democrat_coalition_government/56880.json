        "additional_details": "The Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear reactor is available for \u00a3800million (less if bought in volume).\r\n\r\nThe Hinckley complex costs \u00a316bn purely because of gpvernment rules. Including everything, 90% of every electricity bill is political parasitism. A similar European built project in China costs \u00a34.5bn.\r\n\r\nNuclear power is, by several orders of magnitude the safest power we have and all the politicians know it.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to get out of the way and allow us to have as much cheap electricity as there is demand for. Since there is a 1:1 correlation between energy use and gdp this would end the recession.",
