        "action": "Protect the Brownfield Sites of the Thames Gateway",
        "additional_details": "Many of the brownfield sites along the Thames Gateway hold populations of nationally rare plants and insects. Various agencies appear intent on developing these sites despite the fact they would be destroying (and already have destroyed) some of the UK's most significant areas for rare species. Much of the desire to build on these sites is borne out of ignorance of their value.\r\n\r\nContrary to other petitions on this subject (search 'brownfield') this petition urges the government to protect these nationally important sites by immediately designating the Thames Gateway a SSSI before we lose these sites forever to economic 'progress'.",
