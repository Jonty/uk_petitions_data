        "additional_details": "There is still ambiguity around the \"Challenge 25\" policy that is enforced in many stores in the UK.The policy is sometimes ineffective. Customer assistants have to use common sense on occasions to serve customers who \"look under 25\" but are definitely over \"12\". If this policy was strictly followed there would be an uproar from the general public.\r\n\r\nIn order to deter under aged consumers from attempting to buy restricted products (particularly alcohol, lottery tickets), I suggest that an additional penalty should be enforced on the deliberately defiant consumer.\r\n\r\nThe person attempting to buy should always be asked for ID, and refused accordingly. However, if an occasion should occur where the cashier makes a mistake and does not request ID but is later found out to be under aged, then the responsibility should not lie entirely on the premises the under aged person bought from. Both parties should be punished fairly.",
