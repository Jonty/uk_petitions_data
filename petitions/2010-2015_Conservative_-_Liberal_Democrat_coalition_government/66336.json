        "additional_details": "\"The Practice of the One Country, Two Systems Policy in the HKSAR White Paper\" published by the PRC government deters any possible and foreseeable so-called riots or chaos in Hong Kong which are in fact protests for the political reforms promised. The joint promises by the British and the PRC governments to a free and democratic Hong Kong after 1st July 1997 has been the reason why we, the local British-born Hong Kong citizens, still work and live here. The White paper announced a re-definition of \u201chigh degree of autonomy\" undermining or even the abolition of the Basic Law. In such sense, the Sino-British Joint Declaration is DEFAULTED. The British government remains silent and is not acting properly to protect the rights of the British-born Hong Kong citizens. We therfore request to regain our full British citizenships which have been illegally forfeited in the 1990's and were replaced by BNO passports and status.",
