        "additional_details": "Today, many known child sex offenders are permitted to work with children because their original offence took place prior to the Sex Offenders' register being established. There needs to be a change in law to enable sex abusers who received historical cautions for serious sexual abuse to be registered as offenders for life. There also needs to be legislation available for adult survivors of child sexual abuse to choose to prosecute perpetrators when they are adults, and able to make an informed choice.\r\n\r\nRight now, known sex offenders are working with young children across the UK because cautions given in the 1990s have expired, enabling these paedophiles to gain positions of responsibility and trust to access young children.\r\n\r\nPlease protect our next generations from going through the same sexual abuse which we suffered.
