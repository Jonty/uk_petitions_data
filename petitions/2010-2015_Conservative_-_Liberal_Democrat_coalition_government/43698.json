You need to re-evaluate this and pay to those that have no work by unfortunate circumstances but will be very pro-actively wanting to get back out there, lets hope you never have to go through being sacked off from your own jobs and then the door slammed in your face when you need a couple of months financial support by the very people you have been serving your whole life.",
