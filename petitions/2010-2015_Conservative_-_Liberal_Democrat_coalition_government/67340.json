        "additional_details": "With the economy today, Lap Dancing Venues, Strip Clubs, Gentlemen's Clubs are not quite what they used to be. In America performers make up their income by the form of the \"Tipping Rail\" where patrons could place 'dollar bills', in some cases the club would \"Make It Rain\" with dollars being thrown at the stage sometimes in black bin bags. In the UK this would be more like large hail stones or some cases a stoning as \u00a31 and \u00a32 coins would be thrown at the stage if the practice was duplicated. UK customers at best do not like to tip, so leaving a \u00a35 note is a figure that exceeds an acceptable figure.\r\n\r\nPlease lets help the dancers of Great Britain and make them feel great again and bring back the \u00a31 'note' as every little helps.",
