        "additional_details": "Individuals who will not take a job or are deemed to be deliberately avoiding take-up of work should have their benefits reduced to encourage them to take lower paid positions. Benefits should be supported with written recommendation of what the benefit will be used for. Benefits diverted to other non essential costs such as tattoos, smoking, drinking and drugs should be stopped. Benefits recipients who are evasive,  avoiding employment by making themselves unattractive to the job market through bad personal hygiene, unemployable behaviour or deliberate poor dress code to attempt to put off employers should lose their benefit.\r\n\r\nAll work programs should themselves have a staff and program of mandatory community work initiatives to take participants out into the community to do community tasks such as litter picking, garden and park tidying to teach individuals about structure, discipline, responsibility and citizenship.  Failure to comply will result in loss of all benefits.\r\n",
