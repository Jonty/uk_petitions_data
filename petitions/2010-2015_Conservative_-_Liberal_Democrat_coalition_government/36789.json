        "additional_details": "Due to recent events in the London 2012 Olympic Games, it has been made obvious that 'God Save the Queen' is not the ideal anthem for Team GB in the Olympic Games, as many members of the team refuse to sing it due to the lyrical content.\r\n\r\nIt is unfair on the members of Team GB who don't feel able to join in (since admittedly it is the anthem of England, and these members aren't English), so therefore they don't feel the same pride.\r\n\r\nI feel the Olympic anthem should be the chorus of Land of Hope and Glory. The lyrics of the chorus are what the Olympics are about. 'Make thee mightier yet!'. I myself have heard it many times and the hairs still stand on the back of my neck every time I hear it. Go ahead, search it.\r\n\r\nSo I propose that we leave 'God Save the Queen' to the English, and reunite Great Britain under the great anthem that is 'Land of Hope and Glory'!\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and spread this petition.",
