        "additional_details": "A field in the middle of Elgin Avenue is to have new building built there, starting within the next year or so. For generations and generations, children and families have played on this field, as it is a area where parents can easily watch there children as it is quite a confined area. Many street parties and celebrations have been held here and I think that the council should most definitely reconsider the planning of destroying this field and a safe environment for children to play. Elderly people enjoy watching the children play and I don't see why this should be spoilt for a few buildings, which would most definitely look cramped. My family would be devastated to see this field destroyed as they have many memories there from over 50 years.\r\nPlease help!!",
