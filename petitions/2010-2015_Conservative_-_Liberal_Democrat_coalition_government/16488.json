        "additional_details": "The muslin call to prayer is not part of our indigenous culture and would be viewed as an unwelcome and intrusive interference into the daily life of the residents of this country. I believe the People of the UK have no desire to be disturbed five times a day by loudspeakers calling a small minority of people to prayer because they demand it as their right as muslims. I feel we need to ban the call to prayer before every town and city in the UK has to have this intrusion forced upon them by a militant minority who will stop at nothing to impose their will on the rest of us.",
