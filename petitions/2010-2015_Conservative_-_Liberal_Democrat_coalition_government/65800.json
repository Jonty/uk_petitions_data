        "additional_details": "Alcohol causes around 40,000 deaths in the UK each year according to http://bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/broadband/tx/drugs/survey/. We have a population of around 65 million and according to the same website it say that around 40 million people use it which I think is too much.\r\n\r\nIf alcohol is dangerous and causing a great amount of damage and destruction, then it must be wrong that alcohol companies are allowed to advertise their products. There should also be health warnings on any products containing alcohol and any product containing alcohol should be kept behind the counter.\r\n\r\nBanning tobacco advertising, placing health warnings on tobacco boxes and keeping them behind the counter has dramatically reduced the amount of smokers, so putting in place similar restrictions with alcohol would reduce the number of drinkers and reduce the number of people dying from a alcohol related death.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
