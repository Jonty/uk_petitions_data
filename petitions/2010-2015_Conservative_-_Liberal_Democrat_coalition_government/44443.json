        "additional_details": "Whilst I agree that the State Pension needs to be overhauled, it is grossly unfair to penalise the middle person. I will attain State Pension age in 2015 and will have paid 40 years NICs but will not get the \u00a3140+ which is due to come into effect in 2017.\r\nYet people that have never worked or will have worked for only a short period of time will be entitled to the Single-Tier State Pension of \u00a3140+ and this to me is grossly unfair.\r\n         My local MP Mr Paul Burstow is recommending means testing the Fuel Allowance. Once again it is the people that have worked hard all their lives who are penalised and those on benefits and never worked are rewarded.\r\nMy wife and Iare disappointed with the Conservative party whom we voted for but it is highly unlikely that we will vote Conservative in 2015,more likely UKIP who will carry out their promises.",
