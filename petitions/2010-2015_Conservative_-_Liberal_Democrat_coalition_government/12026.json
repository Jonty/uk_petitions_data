        "additional_details": "<HTML>\r\n<BODY>\r\nFor more than a decade, one US company, the Microsoft Corporation, has supplied most of the software used by UK Government departments and schools and colleges.  The software is closed-source, meaning that the code cannot be debugged by UK programmers. This leads to security and functional problems. <p> <br>\r\nStudents in schools and colleges are taught how to use Microsoft programs, not how to understand them. In many areas there are no alternative courses for young people to learn computing skills.   Government departments and businesses have an enormous skills shortage in basic computing knowledge and find it difficult to move forward with computer projects. <p> <br>\r\nYoung people need courses that will give them computing skills in various operating systems and give them a grasp of file organisation.  In the long term, this change  would enable many young British people to contribute to the development of their society.\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML>",
