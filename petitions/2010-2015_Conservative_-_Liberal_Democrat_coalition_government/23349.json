No one has ever died from the ues of cannabis unlike tabaco and alcohol which costs the tax payer milions if not billions in NHS Paymerts, cannabis is a social drug, you don't read reports of stoners fighting and causing trouble on Saturday nights. Stoners are careing, conscientious members of our community unlike violent alcoholic's. Our children should not be made criminals for use of a harmless herb, god made cannabis man made alcohol.
