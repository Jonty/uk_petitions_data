He attacks straw men, uses red herrings and ad hominems all in an effort to spin the question and attack the opposition/last government.\r\n\r\nAs PMQs is important in our democracy for the people to know exactly what the Government is doing, the PM should answer the questions directly and honestly. If he hasn't realised that most of the time he answers with logical fallacies then he's too dumb to be the Prime Minister (which I'm sure isn't the case so he has no excuse).",
