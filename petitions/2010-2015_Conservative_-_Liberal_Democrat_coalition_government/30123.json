This I believe to be a cruel and unnessesary assault on the most undervalued and vulnerable members of society who have some of the lowest pensions and living standards in Europe.\r\nThese passes are important to the quality and enhancement of their final years!\r\nMinisters, with your \"gold plated\" pensions who no doubt will not require a bus pass when the time comes, keep your hands off !!",
