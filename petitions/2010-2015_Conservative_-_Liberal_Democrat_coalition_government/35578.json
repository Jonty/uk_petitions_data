        "additional_details": " We need GROWTH. We need to stop people avoiding taxes. The government needs to scrap all taxes and replace them with a 30% sales tax on new products and services. Anyone who didn't want to pay earnings taxes and NI would want to start businesses here; employment would escalate. No taxes means we can spend 100% of what we earn, when we spend, tax is collected. No one will be able to avoid paying tax. Pay a monthly prebate to all registered UK citizens to the poverty level to cover the tax on food and clothes etc. There is no other way to create growth quickly; within two years of implementation this country would pass the break even point. www.fairtax.org explains all.
