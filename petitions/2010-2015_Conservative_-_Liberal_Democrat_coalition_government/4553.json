        "additional_details": "Slaughter without pre stunning inflicts unnecessary pain & distress on animals . Whilst we respect every individual's religious choice it is illegal for slaughterhouses to slaughter animals without first stunning them unless the meat is intended solely for the Muslim & Jewish communities. In our view it is against the law for a company to sell or serve meat from un stunned animals to the British public. This meat should be appropriately labelled & we call on the British Govt to do this.",
