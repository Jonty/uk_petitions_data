        "additional_details": "At present BskyB enjoys 2 principle sources of revenue. 1- Commercial advertising and 2- Viewers subscriptions. This is unfair because the commercial terrestial T.V. channels only have advertising as their principle source of income and the B.B.C. subscription ( i.e. Liscense Fee ).\r\nI propose the Government should introduce legislation stating that if a T.V. company charges its viewers a subscription, it cannot also use advertising to raise revenue. It must choose one or the other.\r\nThis would create a more level playing field and allow the terrestial T.V. companies and the B.B.C. to bid for the rights to transmit particular programming which at present is financially out of reach.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
