Perhaps later? or never. How many more immigrant's will be allowed in during this time?\r\n\r\nThe government has not been able to look after the original residents of this island, services are stretched, not enough jobs, it must be asked how many more 100,000s of immigrants are going to be allowed into the country?  Destroying communties and cultures of our land, concreting it over as though there is 'no tomorrow'.   Basically it is coming towards the point of no return, so much damage has been done.\r\n\r\nAll my voting life I have been Conservative, not any longer.  This government is slipping and sliding around in the slime trail that the slug of a prime minister Blair left behind him and you can't stand up.",
