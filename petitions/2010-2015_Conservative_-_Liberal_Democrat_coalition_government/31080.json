        "additional_details": "This is a petition to encourage the government to make Britain a truly United Kingdom. We propose that internal borders be abolished, and that the terms \"England\", \"Wales\" and \"Scotland\" be retired. We propose that governments be sectioned into key catchment areas which liase closely with central government, and that these local governments are not geographically limited by the old borders. We propose that any person from any part of Britain should be British only, having no other internal nationality. We should be one country, striving together for better.",
