        "additional_details": "Animals that are defined as pets should be protected by similar laws to humans as they are, in many instances, equally as important too their owners, if not more so in some cases. Arguably this should be seen as a serious offence and more severe penalties should be applied to those that kill or seriously abuse their own or others pets. Other animals that are similar to pets are not only seen as essential companions, but provide much needed assistance and affection, especially with those that are blind or disabled. Ultimately pets  give their complete devotion and loyalty and to offer some protection and justice is not unreasonable as the qualities of some much loved pets are arguably far superior than those that would injure/harm them  ",
