        "additional_details": "More schools are introducing iPads, there is an understanding by parents that these are protected, however they are not.  The schools expect parents to protect the devices out of school by applying protection on their own Wifi, this only provides a basic protection (where parents know how to set it up), and doesn't protect against public Wifi.\r\n\r\nThe local police are complaining as are parents many of who have been affected by grooming; however the school continue to push responsibility back to the parents.\r\n\r\nI also find children are deleting the history and are installing locked folders to try and hide content, without management software there is nothing we can do about this.\r\n\r\nWe would like to see the government introduce regulation where the iPad devices are filtered outside as well as inside school, and that apps installed have a black/white list to protect our Children from grooming, additional time lock outs should be introduced so every child is treated the same.",
