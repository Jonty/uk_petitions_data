        "additional_details": "This e-petition has been created to address the issue of paying over the rate prices for food on a surveying trip organised by the civil engineering department at Imperial College London. During the course of the trip, students are being charged \u00a392.46 for 9 meals(5 breakfast, 4 dinner). This works out to over \u00a310 per meal, which could be considered acceptable if it was taking a girl on a date, but not for food which has been called \"average\" by older year students. We believe students should be given a choice whether to pay these high prices for food, or be responsible for their own food. ",
