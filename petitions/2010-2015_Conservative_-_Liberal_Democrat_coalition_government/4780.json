        "additional_details": "The BBC is an excellent broadcaster, but it can be better. At the moment the BBC asks for a licence so that we can watch television whether we are viewing a BBC channel or not. This is a disgrace when television sets are expensive enough as it is. If the institution was privatised then then it would receive commercial revenue from advertisers which would outstrip any revenue that they make from licence payers. Then they would be able to compete with Sky and other broadcasters for better programmes, sports coverage and film coverage. At the moment Sky seems to be taking everything in sight leaving nothing for the terrestrial viewers. Sign this petition and maybe the BBC can compete and become the world leader yet again.",
