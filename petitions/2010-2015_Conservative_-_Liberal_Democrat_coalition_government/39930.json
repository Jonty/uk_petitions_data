        "additional_details": "There are hundreds of adults out there, who suffer from a condition, and who are receiving benefits, primarily to support them on a weekly/monthly basis.\r\n\r\nMany of these adults can only afford to attend college, and feel the fear of university costs being a barrier to their higher education, also considering the cost of living, travel, daily essentials, etc.\r\n\r\nThe government should investigate support schemes for people who suffer with conditions. The support could even be a discount in university fees, along with financial support, or even only pay half price for higher education?\r\n\r\nRegardless of which benefits you receive, benefit types should not be a limit to university support, because in many places (ie; dental care, eye treatment, etc), incapacity benefit is exempt from free or discounted schemes.",
