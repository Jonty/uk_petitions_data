        "additional_details": "The UK police force are a citizen police and can only do their job if they are supported by the large majority of the population of the UK.  In the light of current events this support has broken down.  HM govt must retain control for it's subjects and citizens to retain the right to go about their lawful business.  In view of current riotous events in the UK we citizens are unable to do this.  Therefore the police must be enabled to use the severest non-lethal weapons in the case of widespread violence.  This would include the use of:  Rubber Bullets, Tazers, Tear Gas and larger batons.",
