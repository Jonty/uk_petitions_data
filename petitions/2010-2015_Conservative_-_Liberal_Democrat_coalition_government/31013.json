The Wars are not our cause and shouldn't be our concern. Most of us can't see why were Fighting for other Countries overseas anyway.\r\nThe People were Fighting for Overseas don't appreciate it or even want us there and when we leave it will all go back to the hell hole it was.\r\nNo More British Lives need to be wasted on these Pointless wars as far as Britian is concerned.\r\nThe British Army and the British people should focus on keeping our streets safe and keeping our Countries safe. Not pointlesly wasting their Lives.\r\nWe Want Our British Troops back in their Homes in Britian!\r\n",
