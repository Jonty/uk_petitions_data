        "additional_details": "Francis Maude should resign or be sacked for the idiotic advice he gave to drivers about filling up jerry cans. He contributed to panic buying of fuel and may even have had a hand in a woman storing petrol in her kitchen which then caught fire leaving her in a critical condition.\r\n He is also out of touch with the working class when he insisted that his loosing 10% of his huge income was the same as it was for a working famliy struggling to make ends meat having their tax credits cut. Although he does no volentry work he thinks simply being an M.P means he goes above and beyond to help those in need.",
