Was the customer service you received beyond appalling??\r\n\r\nHelp me make a difference!\r\n\r\nBT Group plc is the holding company for an integrated group of businesses that provides voice and data services in the UK and overseas.\r\n\r\nThey promise to provide a service, and then continually do not meet these promises. When questioned about this they just pass you from one CSA to another and refuse to help, refuse to put you through to a manager and do not fix the problem.\r\n\r\nI have been lyed to, promised call backs, told by numerous employees my service would work. Then it doesnt and absolutely nobody will help.\r\n\r\nBT are in full control of the market because of there position with the phone lines.\r\n\r\nthis does not give them the right to treat \"customers\" so badly!\r\n\r\n",
