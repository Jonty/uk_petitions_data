The taxpayers of this country are also paying \u00a3500 million for Appeals Tribunals by claimants appealing incorrect ATOS decisions. Then there is the cost of all the DWP call centres and the staff that work there. This is at a cost of either reducing or stopping claimants benefits completely.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for this Government to stop this insanity now and reinstate benefits to claimants.",
