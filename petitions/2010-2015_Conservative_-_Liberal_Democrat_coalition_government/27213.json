        "additional_details": "Drugs test : Written by British soldier.\r\nI work, they pay me. I pay my taxes and the government distributes my taxes as it sees fit. In order to earn that pay , I train for war and eventually deploy. I am required to pass a random urine test to detect any drugs, with which I have no problem. What I do have a problem with is the distribution of my taxes to people who don't have to pass a urine test.... Shouldn't one have to pass a urine test to get a benefits cheque because I have to pass one to EARN IT for them? Please understand that I have no problem with helping people get back on their feet. I do on the other hand have a problem with helping someone sit on their backside drinking beer and smoking dope. Could you imagine how much money the government would save if people had to pass a urine test to get a benefit cheque?\r\nPlease sign this petition if you agree with the above statement.",
