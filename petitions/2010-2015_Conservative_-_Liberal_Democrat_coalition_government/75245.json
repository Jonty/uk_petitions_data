        "additional_details": "I would like the rules to be changed regarding Service Charges & Buildings Insurance for Shared Ownership Tenants. They should be allowed to source their own buildings Insurance rather than be forced to pay it in the form of a service charge. Sourcing for themselves gives them the option to save money & find a better deal & policy that suits their needs rather than a generic & minimal policy that costs over the odds through the Landlord. All properties should require it, but it should be down to the tenant to decide whether they want to source their own policy.",
