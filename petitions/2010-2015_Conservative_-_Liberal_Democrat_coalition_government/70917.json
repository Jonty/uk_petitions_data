The ingredient to be removed or replaced with something that will not attract an animal to drink it. Countless family pets & wildlife are killed by this liquid that is either left out by careless humans or deliberately put out to kill. It is, in the latter case, premeditated murder of animals, namely cats who may be bothersome to some people who think the answer is just to hurt a family by killing their pet.",
