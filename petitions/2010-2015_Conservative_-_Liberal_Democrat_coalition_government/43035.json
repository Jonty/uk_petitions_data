        "additional_details": "We need faster broadband (IE Fibre access) in Ilfracombe, like ten years ago, at present our nearest biggest town (Barnstaple) is not yet even enabled for Fibre services, let alone other strategic areas and urban social hubs such as Ilfracombe.\r\n\r\nWe demand fibre internet access is installed in Ilfracombe by the first half of 2013, this is long overdue, we run way behind countries considered 3rd rate to ourselves, it is simply not acceptable.\r\n\r\nWe want fibre access, and we want it now, the public here have expressed subsidising such installation costs but no one is interested than the usual rabble of \"in the near future\". Well I am sorry, but 2020 is not good enough for us! Thank you.",
