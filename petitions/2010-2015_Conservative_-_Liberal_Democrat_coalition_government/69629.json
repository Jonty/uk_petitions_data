        "additional_details": "The Department for Education should make Government and Politics a compulsory subject for all school children. Better political education will encourage a higher voter turnout; an understanding of key policies, and how citizens can influence them; and it will also tackle educational disadvantage, which is a key reason as to why there is such high social misrepresentation in Parliament. Better political involvement will encourage more educated votes in General Elections, and less control and influence by the media. ",
