        "additional_details": "The laws on Sunday trading are outdated and do not take account of the modern multicultural British society.  This petition proposes that the Sunday and Easter Sunday trading laws be repealed.  This will mean that non-christians in the UK are not discriminated against and are able to shop around their own religious beliefs.  ",
