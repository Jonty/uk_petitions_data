        "additional_details": "Since the fierce riots of August 2011 have ceased, one will notice an increased Police presence, not just in major city centres, but in local areas too.\r\n\r\nI would like to see this sustained on a permanent basis as I feel it definitely improves public confidence at the street level.\r\n\r\nWhatever red tape has had to be put on hold I would not want it to interfere with their current strategy.  It is definitely working and quite refreshing for the law-abiding citizen to experience.\r\n\r\nPlease make the greater Police presence a permanent fixture in both city centres and local areas.",
