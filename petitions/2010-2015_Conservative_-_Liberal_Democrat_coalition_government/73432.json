        "additional_details": "Section 127: \"A person is guilty of an offence if he sends by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive.\"\r\n\r\nSection 127 makes it illegal to say anything offensive on the internet.  And because offence is a matter of personal opinion and emotional reaction this law effectively criminalises ALL speech on the internet.  Even this very petition would be considered illegal under the law if someone found it grossly offensive.\r\n\r\nBeing free to express your opinions and criticise the government is the cornerstone of a democratic society.  Our forefathers fought and died for us to have this freedom, will we give it up without a fight?\r\n\r\nAlready 20,000 people have already been investigated under Section 127.\r\n\r\n\"The young women of today can never know at what price their right to free speech has been earned\" Lucy Stone - Suffragette\r\n\r\n\"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it\" Voltaire",
