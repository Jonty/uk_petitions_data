        "additional_details": "We believe Greater Manchester needs to retain its present range of NHS facilities, including its A&E Units. The closure of any such units not only increases the chance of potential fatalities due to the additional travelling time of ambulances, but the existence of the remaining NHS facilities at the hospital concerned. In so doing, that also adds to the long term pressures on all NHS facilities at hospitals nearby.\r\n\r\nA&E Units closures would clearly add immediate pressure to those remaining. We do not believe ANY should close.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to provide sufficient funding to ensure all of Greater Manchester's A&E Units, local hospitals and NHS services are fully retained for the benefit of the people who need them, in keeping with Conservative Party general election Manifesto commitments to increase spending on health in real terms every year.",
