        "additional_details": "For far too long now, we the British public have become infuriated at the sentences being handed out by the Justice system.  The Judges hands are tied by sentencing guidelines, therefore those guidelines need a serious overhaul.  With the breakdown in society, and respect for others and property becoming ever more frequent, one way is to GET TOUGH ON CRIME again and start actually punishing people for those crimes.  Sentences given should be just that - if sentenced to 3 years - 3 years should be served : no time off for good behaviour; you come out at the end of your time served.  Life should mean life, and If you should 'misbehave' whilst in prison (for whatever reason) extra time is added on incrementally.  At the moment the justice system offers no deterrent.",
