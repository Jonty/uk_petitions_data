        "action": "Make an `Enterprise Training Week` compulsory in further and higher education.",
        "additional_details": "There are many further and higher education courses which lead to self employment/small business or even have the potential to be major job creators. This ranges from hairdressing courses in FE to construction trades to accountancy and many other areas in engineering, technology etc. There is no consistent and compulsory enterprise awareness raising or training included in these courses however and many individuals are left to find out for themselves or learn from their mistakes! A one week component in all relevant FE/HE courses could fill this gap and even encourage individuals who had not considered business as a route to do so. There is considerable research to show that small business is the key driver of economic growth and in the current economic climate this could be a low cost initiative (via Regional Growth Fund perhaps) with a big medium term impact.",
