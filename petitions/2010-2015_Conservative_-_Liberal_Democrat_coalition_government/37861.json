An example in question if the West Coast rail franchise, where despite over 150,000 signatures to date, they government is refusing to debate before signing the contracts.  This isn't good enough and makes this whole e-petition process worthless.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to ask the government to give more teeth to the e-petition process.",
