Could the good General please give us an example of when any captured British Service personnel were shown any lenieancy by the Taliban? We are fighting an enermy who show no respect for our way of life or sense of fair play. How can we expect our brave service personnel to play by the rules when these barbaric thugs do not. Shame on you General Houghton. As an ex-serving member of the Royal Air Force I am well and truely sickened by yet another kick in the teeth by a MOD puppet. Free our Royal Marine.",
