This has resulted in huge job losses, huge imports and paltry exports. A trade deficit tax should be levied on nations that import to us. Simply subtract the cost of exports from the cost of imports resulting in the trade deficit. Levy taxes equal to that amount on NEXT YEARS imports from that nation. The nation can avoid those taxes completely by importing more from us. If they retaliate by putting taxes on our exports this would reflect in even higher trade deficitr taxes the following year on that nation.",
