        "additional_details": "The recession has had a profound impact on every person in the country, and its impact has been disproportionate on young people.\r\n\r\nIn January 2013, the Education Select Committee reported on the careers guidance for young people. It reached a number of conclusions including. The transfer of responsibility for careers advice has led to a predictable \u2018drop in the overall level of provision\u2019. A more recent OFSTED report described careers advice as failing; presenting an unequivocal case for change.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the \u00a3196,000,000 funding which was withdrawn for careers advice to be restored. We do not believe that our children; nieces, nephews and grandchildren should have to pay for the financial and political irresponsibility that lead to the recession\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this petition calls for a debate about careers advice and how it can best serve young people taking full account of the recommendations from the Education Select Committee",
