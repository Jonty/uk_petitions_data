        "additional_details": "Advertising practices have become invasive and interrupt family life.  This ranges from companies generating automated fax and telephone advertising that target landline telephone numbers indiscriminately, and those that post large quantities of advertising literature through front doors.\r\n\r\nEveryone in the UK has a right to enjoy their home in peace, and legislation should be passed to require companies to seek permission before sending advertising into domestic addresses or post advertising through doors.   The added benefits would be to support the green agenda (less waste on paper) and allow uninterrupted family time in the evenings.\r\n\r\nLet's stop the position that says we need to request that we don't get harrassed in this way, and start with the default position that we should all have quiet enjoyment of our homes and family life.",
