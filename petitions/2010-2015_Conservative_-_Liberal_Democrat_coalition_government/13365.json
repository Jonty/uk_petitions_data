        "additional_details": "During the Riots of August 2011 we saw and heard Police commenting and often complaining of Police officers not getting support. Fair treatment for Police officers is always needed. Police often have their hands tied, we need to allow Police to use more force with criminals. Police should be allowed to use their batons more often.\r\n\r\n I know that when you taser, hit or gas someone it requires allot of paper work. This is off putting as officers should not have to do this. Officers should feel safe, free and not worrying about will they get sacked because the used their baton too much.\r\n\r\nThe community and I want to decrease as much paper work as possible when force is used. Better protection for Police Officers. Also we want you to give Officers the confidence that they can take appropriate force and not get abuse, inspected, investigated or framed.",
