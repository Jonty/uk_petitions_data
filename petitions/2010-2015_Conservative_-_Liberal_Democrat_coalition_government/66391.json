The eviction was said to be due to the dispute of the ownership of the Monastery where the monks were residing.  On 13th June 2014, they were  forcefully disrobed from their monkhood. They are currently  under arrest as civilians and said to be  imprisoned in Insein Jail Yangon, Myanmar.\r\n\r\nThe Myanmar community is very concerned about the safety and well being of these monks and urge for the urgent action from the Foreign Office.\r\n",
