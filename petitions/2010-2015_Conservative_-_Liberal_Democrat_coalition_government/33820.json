        "additional_details": "In 2010 the SDR cancelled the Nimrod anti submarine patrol aircraft, which for nearly forty years had been the worlds best aircraft in this role. Since then we have been pretending that 1 frigate and  helicopters can carry out this role. The UK is the only country in NATO and almost the world, that has no aircraft in this important role. This is a massive gap in our defence. I urge the Gov. to purchase a new aircraft even in very small numbers, such as the Boeing P-8, to carry out this very important duty.",
