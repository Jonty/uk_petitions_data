        "action": "lower the cost of  prepayment meters fior gas and electric",
        "additional_details": "this petition is for the government to force the energy companies to lower the  rates that they currently charge people who  are using prepayment meters for gas and electric.  At present it is generally poorer people who use prepayment meters .. these people are  charged a higher rate for the energy they use than those who are able to pay by direct debit or some other means. it is grossly uinfair that they have to pay a higher rate as they are actually paying in advance for their energy.  The cost of the meters cannot be used as an excuse for the higher tarrifs.  the energy companies are making millions of pounds in extra profits at the expense of those most in need.  i want the government to force the energy companies to either give a discount to those on prepayment meters so they pay less per unit of energy than those who  pay by some other means or at the very least be able to pay the same rate.  poorer people are being  taken for a ride.. it is time for this to stop",
