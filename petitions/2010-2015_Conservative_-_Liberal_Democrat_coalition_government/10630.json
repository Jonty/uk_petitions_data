Priority should be given to local citizens and young graduates, Unless, if the extrememly proffesional candidate is required and is absolutely neccesary. This is way the government will create millions of jobs within UK and can bring up the economy of UK. This is going to create a future for our children, otherwise how will they survive while there is no work? where will they utilise the degree they have worked hard for? BRING ALL THE JOBS BACK TO UK...! ",
