You also wrote to the Department for Education on 16 September 2010 following an earlier petition, which attracted 882 signatures, following the tragic death of your son, Tyler.\r\n\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to repeat the sympathies expressed in the reply from the Department. As you know, the Department is aware of the \u2018game\u2019 and the extreme consequences it has sometimes had. They have been playing their part in devising effective measures to respond to the dangers it poses to young people.\r\n\r\nI need to advise that the rules for submitting an e-petition disallow the posting of personal details / correspondence being addressed in any petition. I can understand that in your view the references to Tyler must strengthen your petition. But unfortunately the petition as it stands would be difficult to publish.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, you still wish to lodge the petition, I have to ask you to rephrase it in a more general way, perhaps with references to the fatal consequences of the \u2018game\u2019 but without details of your family circumstances. Many thanks."
