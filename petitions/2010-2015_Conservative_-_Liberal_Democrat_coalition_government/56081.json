        "additional_details": "Currently a lone parent who cares for a child who is sick and cannot go to school or childcare is sanctioned with no benefits if they fail to attend the Work Programme or Jobcentre Plus, even if they inform these advisers in good time.  The alternative is child neglect which will result in prison or child being taken into care. This is totally unfair and immoral. These sanctions do not get people into work nor will they make children safe nor will making families starve or face eviction.  Sickness in childhood is inevitable.  Making ill adults attend or face sanctions is also immoral and can spread diseases.\r\n",
