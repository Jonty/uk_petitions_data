        "additional_details": "This petition aims to prevent the removal and sale of future works of street art, and make these works part of our National Heritage, to be protected for all.\r\n\r\nThe removal of \"Slave Labour\" in February 2013 was met by widespread outrage among British people. Only after considerable media coverage was it restored to its rightful place. It was later sold at auction in June.\r\n\r\nThe first sale triggered a reoccurrence of the event: in July 2013, \"No Ball Games\" was removed from Tottenham.\r\n\r\nPeople are outraged. It is clear in the eyes of the British public that this is wrong and unjust.\r\n\r\nWe appeal the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to table emergency legislation preventing the removal and sale of any further works of street art. Until such a time as legislation is passed, no further removal of walls carrying street art should be removed and/or sold. Any such action will be deemed illegal, unless done so by the author of such art.\r\n\r\n",
