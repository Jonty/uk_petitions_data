        "additional_details": "Too many deaths of neonatal babies being caused by medically unnecessary transfers.  Lack of continuity of care resulting in undiagnosed illness and higher mortality rates in preterm babies. Babies being moved around like paperwork that needs to be completed and correct medical care being overlooked. The loss of a child at any age is devestating but to know that a death could have and should have been prevented by thinking of the child as a person and not a statistic, is heartbreaking. changes need to be made.",
