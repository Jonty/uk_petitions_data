        "additional_details": "Some vehicle drivers, do not safely pass horses and their riders; this can be in the form of:\r\n\r\n- Driving too close\r\n- Driving too fast\r\n- Beeping their horn\r\n- Hurling abuse at the rider\r\n- Stopping abruptly in front of a horse and rider\r\n- or a combination of the above\r\n\r\nThe highway code does offer some guidance on this, and there are details available on safe road etiquette on the internet.\r\n\r\nI feel the Government has a duty of care to provide a TV campaign showing the dangers of driving irresponsibly around a horse and rider.\r\n\r\nMany drivers do not seem to understand a horse is an animal with a strong flight instinct, and within a heat of the moment could possible injure or kill someone due to irresponsible driving.",
