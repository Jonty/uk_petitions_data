        "additional_details": "Request the Government acknowledges that this tax is basically using an outdated policy to steal people\u2019s wealth. This is enforced by law.\r\nInheritance tax is taking a percentage of wealth from families purely on the basis that a loved one has passed away... little bit disgusting.\r\nUnable to find a valid reason supporting the necessity of this tax.\r\nWealth that was initially taxed when accrued is being taxed again just because someone has died.\r\nWhether the inherited amount is \u00a31 or \u00a31,000,000, this should not be something that our country imposes on its people.\r\nThe Government should abolish this tax with immediate effect as it is a disgraceful policy which is both outdated and morally unjust.",
