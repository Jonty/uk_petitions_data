        "additional_details": "There are about 30m vehicles in the UK, this creates an enormous amount of pollution. Even more so when they're stood still. So WHY do drivers need to stop at red traffic lights to turn left. If there are no pedestrians crossing and no vehicles oncoming I can see no reason why, IF IT SAFE TO DO SO, they can't turn left. This would certainly improve traffic flow and reduce pollution. It works extremely well in Canada and USA where they can turn right on red. Why not here?",
