We have seen numerous deaths in the media as a result of this kind of weapon and it is time for it to come to an end.\r\n\r\nWe cannot live in a country where someone whatever their mental state or agenda can purchase potentially deadly weapons, to do with what they will, without any questions asked.\r\n\r\nThese items should not be sold to the general public and must be banned to all but those who are licensed according to strict regulations.\r\n\r\nWe must protect the general public from lethal weapons and make our streets safer.
