        "additional_details": "In light of the article from Sky News we the undersigned request the expedient removal of Paris Brown as Britain's \"Youth Police Commissioner\".  Working with any body of police, an employee must adhere to practices outlined in the Equality Act of 2010.  Miss Brown has contravened this Act repeatedly by using social media to post racist, xenophobic and homophobic comments at people designated as having protected characteristics and Kent Police failed to properly vet her prior to allocating her the post. We seek the removal of Miss Brown and the post allocated to a more appropriate candidate.",
