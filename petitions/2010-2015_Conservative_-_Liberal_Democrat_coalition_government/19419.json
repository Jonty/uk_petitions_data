        "additional_details": "Despite the DPS (Deposit Protection Scheme), Estate Agents have no actual legal obligations to tenants; they do not have to join the Ombudsman scheme, or subscribe to the 2011 ''Code of Practice for Residential Letting Agents''. This has given rise to a 'Cowboy' culture in which lettings agents have no obligations to the Tenants they serve and who live in the properties they are letting-looking after the landlords alone; those who pay their fees.\r\nLandlords can therefore deduct money from their tenants deposits with no regulation or control. With the lack of council housing, this issue is becoming more and more prevalent as more and more people are turning to Private Lettings as the ONLY available option for housing.\r\nJoin with me now in demanding that ALL Estate Agents, regardless of size, have to sign up to the Code of Practice for Residential Letting Agents, regulating what is now a lawless miasma, where the poorest (tenants) are ripped off by 'Cowboy' Landlords and Agents.\r\n",
