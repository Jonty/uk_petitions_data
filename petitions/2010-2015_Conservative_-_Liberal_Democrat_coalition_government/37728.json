        "additional_details": "The present government are intending or propose to pay your Universal Credit benefits in monthly instead to replace the current system of benefit payments. I do not think that claimants under the new benefits system should have to wait for their money on a monthly basis so therefore the idea of monthly payment of benefits should be scrapped. There are many vulnerable people who may not be able to manage monthly payment of benefits. This includes the fact the government say that benefit claimants rent will be paid monthly into a bank account so the responsibility of payment of rents move to claimants rather then under the present system where local councils pay rents direct to landlords. Again this is ill thought out and should be reconsidered as it some vulnerable people who cannot budget for themselves may not be able to accept responsibility of having to pay their own rent.",
