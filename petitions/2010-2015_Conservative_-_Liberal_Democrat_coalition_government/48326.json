        "additional_details": "The goverment needs to take in account that when being a single mum and you have a child in nursery that does not apply to the govement funding due to being under the age of 3yrs.  Work tax credits money i used for this and not to live on.  I was laid off of my job and I require to give the nursery my son is at 2 months notice, my work tax credits roll over for a further 4 weeks after being laid off.  I assumed this was to cover the notice period required to the nursery as most require 1 months notice but to my shock income support has refused to pay me any money during this period as I get too much money but the money doesnt cover the full amount of nursery fees, let alone for me to live on.  The goverment needs to take this situation into account whn mum wih young children are going into work or laid off of work and the notice of a nursery is still required.",
