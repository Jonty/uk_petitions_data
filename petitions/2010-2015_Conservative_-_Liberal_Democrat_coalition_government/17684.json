        "additional_details": "It is learned today (21-Sep-2011) that thousands of terminally-ill people have started to receive letters warning them that their benefits may get cut in the not-too-distant future.\r\n\r\nThis is a disgrace for a civilised nation. It is also a disgrace for the government who will not increase taxes on the wealthy but is quite prepared to take money off the terminally ill.\r\n\r\nWhilst it is recognised that this country needs to make savings and cannot afford to pay for everything we would like, this nation must remain compassionate  to those most in need.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to force the government to cancel their abhorrent plans to take benefits away from the terminally ill.",
