        "additional_details": "Our activity is the only factor we control.  Some initiatives are wasteful, stupid.     I installed Solar PV's in 2011 which pays 48 pence per kWh.  Output varies from less than 1 to 23 kWh.  Solar generation is the opposite of usage and hardly lowers the bill; however offset against FIT, electricity is free.\r\n\r\nWe cannot store electricity, it evaporates. UK solar fails to reduce carbon output. Power stations generate at 3p kWh and are slow to power up around passing clouds.   Solar at 50\u00b0N is expensive green window dressing.   If everyone had PV we would not lose a power station, just destroy our economy.\r\n\r\nMiliband\u2019s knee jerk in 2010 was an ill considered misuse of capital.    Solar PV is part of the solution under reliable sun across time zones.   We waste investment that should build DC networks and credible sustainable international solutions.    We need politicians able to look beyond sound bites.\r\n",
