        "additional_details": "The UK national anthem is uninspiring and boring. A referendum should be held to allow the British people to choose whether they would want a different national anthem. There are plenty of other options such as \"Land of Hope and Glory\" and \"Rule Britannia!\" which are rousing and uplifting which are what a national anthem should be. The people of England should also be allowed to choose whether they want their own national anthem such as \"Jerusalem\" as England also uses \"God Save the Queen\".",
