        "additional_details": "Diving is cheating but yet there is no real punishment for it. A yellow card if spotted by the referee is all the player in question recieves. I believe my suggestions could be a possible step in stamping out simulation.\r\n\r\n1. If the referee believes a player is guilty of simulation he should be red carded and handed a three match ban.\r\n\r\n2. If a player is booked or sent off for being accused of fouling a diving player, upon appeal the decision should be reversed and the player guilty of simulation should be handed a three match ban.\r\n\r\n3. If a dive has been missed by the officials during the game the FA should after give that player a three match ban.\r\n\r\n4. If a player is guilty twice in one seasion it should result in a six match ban.\r\n\r\n5. And three times in one season it should be a nine match ban plus a heavy fine.",
