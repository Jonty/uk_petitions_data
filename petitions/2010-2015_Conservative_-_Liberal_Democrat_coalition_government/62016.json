        "additional_details": "The following petition is to ban Ashley Young, Tom Cleverley, Michael Carrick, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones & Danny Welbeck from the England Squad.\r\n\r\nI don't know how Ashley Young, Tom Cleverley, Michael Carrick, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones & Danny Welbeck can get away with calling themselves \"footballers\", but WE(as a nation) have to put a stop to this.\r\n\r\nWe, the England fans, insist, that by banning Young, Carrick, Cleverley, Smalling, Jones & Welbeck from the National Team will benefit us now & in the near future.\r\n\r\nWe don't want players who duck & dive their way into the England squad. We want players based on merit. Players' selection should be based on merit and NOT the club they play for, because for the past few years, some of the players who were chosen to represent England were not up to par.\r\n\r\nI hope the FA & Roy will revise this method of selecting players for tournaments based on merit and NOT the club they play for.\r\n",
