The doors would close at say 5:00, but the doctor would stay until everyone was seen. The same doctor would be on call and turn out day, night & week ends.\r\nToday my wife tried to get an appointment to see any doctor in the practice. You have to phone after 8:30, but by 8:40 all appointments for the day were gone. I'd suggest that with one phone line this is just not possible.\r\nWhat's left but a visit to A&E ?",
