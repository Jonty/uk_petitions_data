        "additional_details": "As a British woman I believe it is my right to decide how I wish to dress my body.\r\nI can not accept that in 2013 \"Privileged\" Members of Parliament are trying to dictate that a woman's choice to veil her face is a sign she is oppressed?\r\nHow many of them have gone beyond Whitehall to ask women what they want? We certainly don't need State intervention on how to dress what will it be next what days of the week you can have your period?\r\nThe United Kingdom is a multicultural society where we welcome diversity and people from all different ethnic and religious backgrounds.\r\nThat is what makes us proud to be British. Respecting another persons faith and dress code is not a threat to our borders nor our national security.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you agree that aristocracy and a bunch of men can not tell women how to dress.
