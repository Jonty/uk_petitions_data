Currently if youngsters do not go onto college they cannot claim jobseekers therefore for 2 years they are in limbo. I joined a YTS when I left school and it set me up on my career path. I was paid \u00a325.00 per week and thoroughly enjoyed it as college was not the path I wanted to go down. Surely we can come up with a scheme that would give the youth skills for life and also money in their pockets and most importantly a sense of purpose. ",
