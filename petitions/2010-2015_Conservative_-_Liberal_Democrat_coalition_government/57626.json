        "additional_details": "A few days ago it was announced that 185 million pounds of tax-payers money would be used towards redeveloping the Olympic Stadium in order to make the stadium usable by West Ham United Football Club. As a fan of football the idea that one team will gain an advantage above all others to change the new stadium, using money not available to all other teams is highly unfair. This petition is set up to highlight the point that it would be gaining an unfair advantage through this, when otherwise it would not have been able to otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis is unsporting against all other teams and fans the country over, when some teams go out of business with tax bills of a few thousand.
