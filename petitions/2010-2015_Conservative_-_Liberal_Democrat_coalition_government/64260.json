The reality of it is that inocent people at these right minute are traped inside a building with no control over there life no hope, forced to take tratements which sometime kill them most of the time abused by the members of staff deprived of all there rights accualy those patients have less rights than real criminals in prisons. It is an outrage that such things are happening and for the protection of everyone in this country. We must put an end to it.
