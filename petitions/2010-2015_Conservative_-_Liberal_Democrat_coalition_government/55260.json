        "additional_details": "It is now known that in 2012 more serving or ex serving members of the British Army killed themselves than men and women killed in Afghanistan. PTSD is an under recognised issue and is leading to deaths and the government should aim to help treat those that are so badly mentally impaired by what they witnessed in the service of Her Majesty the Queen. There is no facility which is designated purely to help soldiers with PTSD and as it is clearly such a big issue leading to preventable deaths, more attention should be payed to the personnel who suffer with the condition to prevent further unecessary death. So the MOD should invest some of its defence budget (4th largest in the world) into creating a designated centre with people qualified to help sufferers from the military cope, be cured and reduce the death caused by war.",
