        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that Rail companies are wasting so much money on their expenditure. Eg, paying way too much to contractors who provide emergency transport and replacement in the case of engineering works etc. That the fares could be cut considerably.\r\n\r\nA situation occured recently whereby a double decker bus was contracted from a depot 30 miles away to replace a service which could have been sorted locally. This cost thousands of pounds and it need only have been a few hundred. Its the public who pays. The whole thing needs reviewing. They could save so much money and pass the savings to the customer. The particular bus company they used has a depot based at one of the stations it was covering. Instead they sourced the vehicle from  30 miles away. All the money that could have been saved on drivers wages, fuel etc.\r\nIts disgusting!",
