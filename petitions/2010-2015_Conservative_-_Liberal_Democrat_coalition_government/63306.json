(April the 23rd)\r\n\r\nWe are a proud country steeped in a rich history and we would like a chance to celebrate what it means to be English.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, the Scottish Parliament passed the St. Andrew's Day Bank Holiday Act 2007, which designated the Day as an official bank holiday.\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick's day is celebrated across the Republic of Ireland & Northern Ireland as a bank holiday.\r\n\r\nSt. David's day is recognised as a national holiday in Wales, but not as a bank holiday.\r\n\r\nWe your country men and women ask for this chance to celebrate.\r\n ",
