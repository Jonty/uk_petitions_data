        "additional_details": "Block the proposed charge for \"single use\" carrier bags. This cannot be justified as the reasons given for the imposition of the charge equally apply to ALL shops but the proposal is to exempt all but supermarkets & large stores. This is completely unfair & does not resolve the issue. If the bags are really an environmental problem then they should be banned altogether and a suitable alternative used.",
