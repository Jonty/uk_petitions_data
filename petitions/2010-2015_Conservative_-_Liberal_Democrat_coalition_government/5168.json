        "additional_details": "There are too many people getting NHS cosmeic surgery in this recession. Breast Augmentation / Reduction & sex changes should be funded through a student loan type system for the individual. 16 - 25 years free, 25 - 35 (50% cost), 35 - 50 (75% cost), 50+ (100% cost).  If the patient defaults on their loan, hormones are withdrawn. RLE assessment should be over 5 years with unannounced home / work spot checks. All candidates MUST be working in thier new role. Also, any male who wants to be female but dos'nt fancy men & (i.e.wanna be a Lesbian) & vice versa or have borne children are not accepted !. All this should save the NHS money for life saving surgery & stop people (especially having a mid life crisis) making a mistake !",
