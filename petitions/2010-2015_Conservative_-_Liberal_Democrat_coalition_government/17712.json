        "additional_details": "Organ/tissue transplants will enhance the quality of life & longevity of patients. Growing organs/tissues from patients\u2019 own stem cells is the medicine of the future and would effectively affect a complete cure, solving the problems on rejection by the body\u2019s immune system & the shortage of organs/tissues for transplants. Stem cell organ transplants are also likely to be more cost effective than non-stem cell organ transplants, as it is likely to affect a complete cure without immune rejection problems. Stem cell technology is potentially a technology that can be applied to various fields of medical science, ranging from organ transplants, pharmaceuticals to cosmetic surgery. Organs/tissues (like heart, liver, limbs, brain tissues, even teeth) developed from the patients\u2019 own stem cells will be the medical technology of the future where Britain (and patients of course) will do well to get a head start by HMG\u2019s encouragement and provision of adequate appropriate resources.",
