        "additional_details": "The EU has apparently determined that from January 2014 restaurants will no longer be allowed to serve olive oil in open bottles, dipping bowls etc.\r\n\r\nFor hygiene reasons, they will insist that olive oil is served in sealed bottles.  Clearly the smaller artisanal producers will be unable to carry out such an expensive process, and it will only benefit the larger, industrial producers.\r\n\r\nThis takes away the rights of the consumer and restaurant to choose for themselves.\r\n\r\nI propose that we overturn the ban.\r\n\r\nFor further background please read this article http://soa.li/4CloNBd\r\n\r\n\r\n  ",
