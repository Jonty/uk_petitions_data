        "additional_details": "The Union Flag is a symbol of unity of the people of the United Kingdom as well as those citizens from British Overseas territories.\r\n\r\nOver recent years Britain seems to have lost its pride in being British and has lacked an identity and symbol which will unite the whole nation. This has been used by separatists to their advantage, as in Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn nations such as United States, France and Australia the national flag is flown with pride by all, no matter what part of the country they are from.\r\n\r\nTherefore we ask the government to pass a law to make it compulsory for all taxpayer funded organisations and local government buildings, aswell as schools, hospitals, jobcentres, colleges and universities to fly the Union Flag all year round. Especially at a time when we face the single largest threat from Scottish Sepratists, who wish to break up our nation.\r\nFurther that this law extend to the United Kingdom as a whole - England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland",
