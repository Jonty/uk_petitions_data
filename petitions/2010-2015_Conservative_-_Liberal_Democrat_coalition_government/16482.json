If you are paying the maintenance of your children, able or not to pay the sums of money, and hence forcing you into poverty! Even if you are unemployed and desperate to find a job they still rape you of a chunk of your benefits! that are calculated how much you need to live on!! On their website alone they claim that ' every hour 25 new orders are issued to take money from wages\u2019! Surely a damning indictment! Shows exactly how desperate people are financially. Because of this system people's lives are destroyed when they should be getting back on their feet. I'm also convinced that this is a sound case as to why so many fathers (especially), are driven away from there children whom they desperately love and want to see them grow up. Scrap this system please! for all those parents who are struggling ..Desperately struggling!",
