        "additional_details": "We believe that \"speed camera gantries\" which advise of temporary speed limit changes on motorways are causing accidents, which we believe will eventually include fatalities.\r\n\r\nDrivers instinctively (and understandably) brake hard when they see the new speed limit advised if they believe that they are at risk of a speeding ticket.\r\n\r\nThis causes high potential for rear end collisions and multi vehicle pile-ups.\r\n\r\nWe would like the Government to debate:\r\n\r\n1) Removing speed cameras from temporary speed limit gantries on motorways in the UK;\r\n\r\n2) Repurposing the gantries to advise of incidents (e.g. \"Crash in lane 1 ahead, move to outside lanes\"), so that drivers take the appropriate action instead of braking hard to avoid a speeding ticket.\r\n\r\nWhether the speed cameras are active on the gantries is irrelevant. The threat of a speeding ticket (whether real or imagined) is resulting in this understandable driving behaviour which is putting lives at risk.",
