People can switch to electric heating and cooking no longer requiring gas and eliminating the greed of the energy companies. Surplus electricity can be sold to industry.\r\nWe would be the greenest country in the world. Electric cars / bikes may become the norm in the future being able to charge your vehicle for free.\r\nThe system should be no more than \u00a32000 - \u00a33000 due to the economies of scale of mass producing millions of units, the cost of a second hand car .\r\n Any remaining power stations would supply industry. Oil fired heating and Propane in rural areas would no longer be required, no more road repairs for laying gas pipes",
