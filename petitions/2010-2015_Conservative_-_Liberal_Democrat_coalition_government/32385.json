        "additional_details": "The Department for Transport should take action to lower bus fares for school children in York, as many students have to use the bus to travel to school everyday but the bus fares are just getting too high for parents to cope with.\r\n\r\nA typical family with two children attending secondary school spends about \u00a3624 on bus fares a year, just for their kids to get to school. Education  is supposed to be free but this is like an additional tax. If fares continue to rise parents will work out that it is actually cheaper to take the car to school therefore causing congestion on our roads.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate it if the goverment could help to lower the bus fares in York for school kids or at least stop the fares from rising again.",
