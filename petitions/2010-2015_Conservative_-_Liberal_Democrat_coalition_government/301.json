        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that the current blanket ban on MSM (Men who have had Sex with Men) donors is discriminatory and is based on out-dated prejudice rather than scientific evidence and that many gay and bisexual men would be low risk blood donors and remain an untapped resource that could be used to save lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to remove the lifetime ban on MSM blood donors and to introduce new evidence-based criteria to assess the risk of individuals who wish to donate blood without a blanket ban on MSM donors, either permanently or for a deferral period.
