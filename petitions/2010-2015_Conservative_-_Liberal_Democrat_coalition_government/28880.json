        "additional_details": "John Terry may not be a racist. He may not even be guilty of the charges of 'racially aggravated public order' offences brought against him. But while the case remains unsolved, he represents a very damaging figure head for English football and all that it stands for.\r\n\r\nThe FA is united in its fight to eradicate racism from the game, in all of its forms. To this end - no player that is even loosely suspected to be associated with racist activity should be able to represent the England international football team, let alone as captain.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for John Terry to be stripped of his status as England captain, banned from international football until his trial is concluded and, if found guilty, banned from international football for life.",
