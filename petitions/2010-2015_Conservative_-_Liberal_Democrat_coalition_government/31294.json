        "additional_details": "I would like tha law which doesn't name criminals of a certain age or because of other legal reasons, depending on the crime, abolished. If someone commits a crime, a serious crime, I feel that they should be named no matter what age they are. I feel the justice in this country defends far too many people on the wrong side of the law & 'children' or teenagers under 'a certain age' know that only lenient punishments is all that they will receive and I feel that this is wrong. If they are old enough to commit crime then they should be named and shamed no matter what age",
