        "additional_details": "This petition is to ask that the government will make 'Gay Marriage' legalized in the UK. Our neighbours in the USA have made it legal in states such as New York, Connecticut, Washington D.C. This makes it clear to us in the UK that the LGBTQ community deserve the right to have the option to be married in churches or religious places that agree with the proposal. We would like the government to make this legal and accessible to all. We need to take the correct steps towards equality.   ",
