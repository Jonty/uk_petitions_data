        "additional_details": "It is completely and utterly unacceptable that the name of Marine A has been released to the general public, as this leaves him and his family open to extremist violence and possible murder. The person who authorised this should resign or be sacked immediately, and Marine A and his entire family should be given lifelong anonymity and free identity change.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is very difficult to decide how harshly he should be punished for what happened, it is unquestionable that his name should have been released. This government protect such people as Baby P's mother. They protect rapists and pedophiles, but they do not protect people who have served this country loyally for 15 years? this is totally wrong, and underlines the serious problem that the current government poses to this country.",
