However, because rules and regulations are less strict in LEDCs people are paid as little as possible.\r\nThe Facts: (Taken from  http://www.waronwant.org/overseas-work/sweatshops-and-plantations/sweatshops-in-bangladesh)\r\n\u2022\tThe average amount a Bangladeshi makes is \u00a325 a month. This is far below the wage needed to have a decent standard of living which is at least \u00a345.\r\n\u2022\tWhile be forced to work 14-16 hours a day seven days a week.\r\n\u2022\tWomen account for 85% of the textile work force and are particularly vulnerable to discrimination and abuse.\r\n\r\nGoods produced in sweatshops also have a negative effect on MEDCs for example loss of jobs. This is because manufactures can get labour ten times cheaper in LEDCs in comparison to MEDCS. In the twenty first centaury we should ALL have the right to a living wage.\r\n",
