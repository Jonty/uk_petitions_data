If a dog is 'destroyed' for attacking or killing a human, why on earth should a human receive a custodial sentence for premeditated murder? Knife and gun crime is now a disease of our society the present custodial system is not a deterrent. The generous tax payer has a right to question why he or she is contributing towards the keep of a murderer for the remainder of the criminals life in prison.",
