        "additional_details": "Kevin Burgon aged 53 was last week sent to prison for 3 years and 4 months, for being in possession of a banned hand gun that is also a WW2 artefact. At the age of 17 Kevin lost an eye due to an accident which meant he could not join the army. Because of this he collected WW1 and WW2 items including a tank which he attended public charity events in. This man has not got a bad bone in his body and has never had a bad word said against him. All people that know him are setting up this petition to free him from prison as there are real criminals that get a lesser sentence or walk free from court. Please help us manage this an give this man back his life with a family that treasure him ",
