        "additional_details": "Kony is the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a guerrilla group in Uganda that has forced more than 60,000 children to fight in a murderous armed conflict.\r\nBorn in 1987 or 1988 from the frustrations against the government of Uganda's marginalised Acholi ethnic group, the LRA has since dropped its national political agenda but continued with its campaign of murder and terror.\r\nWe Want Kony To Be Captured And Stand Trail In The ICC But We Need British Military Help. Please be human and help our cause.\r\n\r\n",
