        "additional_details": "There has been a recent wave of atrocities against Shia Muslims in Pakistan and since last September, 1000s of Shia Muslims have lost their lives and livelihood in Pakistan, esp. in northern and south-western areas of Pakistan. Events of mass killings in Chilas and Gilgit have shaken the whole community, but at the same time, tyrants have acquired new strategies and coalitions.It was heartening to see that scores of you turned up on 13th April at Pakistani High Commissionin London to protest against Shiam Muslim genocide in Pakistan.
