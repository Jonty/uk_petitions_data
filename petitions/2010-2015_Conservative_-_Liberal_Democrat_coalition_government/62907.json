They face losing their holding fee, being unable to live with friends and severe difficulty in finding accommodation beyond the first year.\r\nStudents with parent home owners often face family disputes over the requirement and feel disempowered in their moves towards adulthood by having to be vouched for by a parent.\r\nWe request that research is conducted into alternatives, including a situation where the Student Loan Company acts as guarantor for students.  Any default would either be taken from the students' next grant amount, or added to the sum total of their loan. This would smooth the move from first to second year for undergraduates, whilst placing accountability with the individual\r\n",
