        "additional_details": "I wish to petition the government to scrap the VAT on Fuel. It is not right, fair, or just to apply a tax on a tax. Seventy one percent of everything we pay at the pump is tax and it is crippling us. The government apply a levy (tax) on fuel, and then apply VAT on top of it. (another tax) How can this be fair, and how can successive governments simply allow it to continue ? Unfair practices like this are what enforce the view of the general public, that all politicians are untrustworthy. The general public do not care about where the money comes from to replace lost revenue, we are sick to death of the people running this country thinking they have a god-given right to stick their hands in our wallets. SCRAP THE VAT NOW !",
