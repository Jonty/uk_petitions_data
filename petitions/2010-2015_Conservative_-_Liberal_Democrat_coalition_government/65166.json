        "action": "Make the covert selling of Halal meat illegal.",
        "additional_details": "Halal meat now consists of approximately 50% of meat production in the UK. The Moslem population consists of 5%. There is substantial overproduction of Halal meat in the country. Supermarkets and other outlets routinely buy up this meat and sell it with no labelling that this has been subject to ritual slaughter. Many people have objections to a ritual slaughter being part of the food production process. This includes Christians, Sikhs, Atheists and members of the public concerned with animal welfare. Supermarkets avoid labelling food as Halal by, among other things, the fact that once food has been handled by non Moslems it is no longer strictly speaking classified as Halal. This overides the right of the consumer to chose whether or not to participate in ritual slaughter.\r\nWe ask that inclusion of ritually slaughtered meat without informed consent should be classified as  a criminal offence in order to reduce this malpractice and allow equality of religious and/or ethical choice.
