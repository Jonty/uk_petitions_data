        "additional_details": "This is a petition to allow the UK to continue to enjoy the freedom of live music. All too often genuine fans of popular acts miss out on tickets due to inconsiderate, greedy touts buying out tickets in record times!\r\n\r\nThis issue has got a whole lot worse in recent years.... With sites such as viagogo supporting ticket resale without strict limitations on profit that can be made.\r\n\r\nA recent example I personally encountered were \u00a315 tickets for a gig priced at \u00a3128.\r\n\r\nThis has to stop before live music no longer reaches the masses! Please sign to make the government pass a law to protect genuine fans!\r\n\r\n",
