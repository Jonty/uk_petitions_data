It would be good to see these scooped up so that the basic subject is part of a consolidated count. A secondary topic (if such is used in the header) could also be treated in the same way. The search facility of this site is poor and uses no common sense nor a spell checking facility. There is also no general admin type department to choose for this type of subject which meant that The Home Office was used as a department.",
