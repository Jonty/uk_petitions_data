        "additional_details": "Only 4 months since the last, and another plane has crashed in Nepal, killing all 19 people on board.\r\n\r\nJust over 2 years ago, my friend Jeremy died in a very similar plane crash going to Everest.\r\n\r\nThe death toll of plane crashes in Nepal has hit 95 in the last 2 years (2010- Present); which reads as an alarmingly high rate.\r\n\r\nHopefully with this petition, we can start putting pressure on the government in Nepal to re-train their pilots to a better standard and put an end to these horrific atrocities that are affecting people across the globe.",
