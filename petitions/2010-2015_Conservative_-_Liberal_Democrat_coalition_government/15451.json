        "additional_details": "This petition seeks the mandate of Parliament to compel HM Government to bring about a programme of constitutional change to redefine the nation. Currently there are issues with no sole English parliament and devolution in the other 3 nations of the UK.\r\n\r\nThis petition seeks to correct this through the following steps. First the removal of all Scottish, Welsh and NI MP's from the House of Commons to create an English Parliament with the same remit and powers as the Scottish Parliament in Scotland. Further to this full devolution of fiscal, commercial and economic policy to the four national parliaments with monetary policy in the hands of national central banks.\r\n\r\nNext the abolition of the unelected House of Lords and the creation of an elected Federal Senate in its place. The Senate would be responsible for foreign relations, defence & national security, all other departments of state would be devolved to the four nations.",
