        "additional_details": "We the sons and daughters, granddaughters and grandsons of those who fell in WW11 in service of their country, and in all corners of Europe. Call upon the government to now waive the cost of passports to those born before 1935 so that they may visit their lost loved ones in all zones of war in Europe. The vast numbers who lost their lives lie in different parts of Europe, even individually in remote places that form the continent of Europe. This amounts to some 326,000 who gave their lives so that we may live.\r\nThe time has come for those entering their twilight years, who need to visit their heroes and who were part of the UK forces, to be given free passports. A gesture has already previously been made for some to get free passports now it is time that ALL those who wish to go should be given the price of a passport to do so.\r\nWinston Churchill once said about the need for Mulberry Harbours \u2013 \u201cdo not argue the point, the points argue for themselves.\u201d  That is so here.\r\n",
