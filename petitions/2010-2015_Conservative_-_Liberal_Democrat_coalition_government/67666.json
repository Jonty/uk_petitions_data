All across the nation smaller dog breeds are attacking our larger breeds and people because the owner doesn't put a lead on it.\r\nIf a bullmastiff bit someone  then they would be put to sleep. If a Jack russell bit someone nothing would happen.\r\nThis needs to change. Just because of the dogs size it shouldn't determine if it should be on a lead.\r\nThis is not a uncommon problem.  The government need to enforce the use of leads and have the same punishment for all breed owners not just so called \"dangerous dogs\".\r\n\r\n",
