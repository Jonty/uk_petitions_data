        "additional_details": "In the year 2000, Tony Blair's government introduced a new Local Government Act. This Act had the effect of focusing far too much power in the hands of a Council Leader and a few of his hand picked colleagues. The practice, know as the Cabinet System, denies the vast majority of elected Councillors on Borough and County Councils to be involved in what are often crucial decisions. The Cabinet System, which is often lucrative for members of the Cabinet, should be disbanded, and British Councils should revert to the democratic system that was in place prior to the year 2000. This would enable all Councillors to participate in the best interest of their constituents.\r\nPlease sign this petition to acknowledge your agreement.",
