Why is this important?\r\nA. World peace should be important to every man, woman and child.\r\n\r\nImagin this scenario:\r\nIn that 24 hours the waring factions withdraw and lay down their arms, a young child which would have been killed by an explosion instead, isn't.\r\nWhat if that child then goes on to find a cure for cancer or discovers a technology to end world hunger?\r\n\r\nThis is a possibility as a result of just 24 hours of peace.",
