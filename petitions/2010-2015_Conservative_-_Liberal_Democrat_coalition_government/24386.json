        "additional_details": "Parliament should debate the proposals put forward by the Occupy movement, recognising that many people who are not physically present at the occupation agree with the principles and objectives of the movement. The proposals to be debated are:\r\n\r\n1. to close tax havens and tax loopholes to ensure that company taxes accurately reflect company profits\r\n\r\n2. to increase transparency over corporate lobbying\r\n\r\n3. to increase the liability of individual company executives for the actions of their companies.\r\n\r\nThese are serious proposals and should be debated by Parliament, with individual MPs starting by making public statements about their own interests in these matters.
