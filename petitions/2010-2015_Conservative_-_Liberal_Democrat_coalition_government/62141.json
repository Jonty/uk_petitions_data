        "additional_details": "The Conservative Party's constant attack on the BBC is designed to weaken it and is the worst form of censorship. When they were first elected the were summoned to be told of comprehensive cuts irrespective of the need. It is there method of weakening an industry to the point where they then claim it fails. Because of their Murdoch links this should be resisted.\r\n\r\nThe BBC is not perfect but I for one believe change and not privatisation is the answer. I do not want adverts on the BBC. Nor is it expensive. Compare the \u00a340-60 per month for a Sky and what they deliver compared to the BBC's \u00a310-11 per month!\r\n\r\nIdeology is not a good enough reason for destroying a world respected TV corporation.",
