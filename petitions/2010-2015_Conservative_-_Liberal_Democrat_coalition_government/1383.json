        "additional_details": "The legal system for landlords to evict tenants who do not pay rent is obsene, the process can take months and months to complete, the landlord has already lost money through non-payment of rent and still has to pay legal costs and go through the courts to take possession of their properties back and potentially try and recover the unpaid rent. This is especially bad when the tenants claim housing benefits and still do not pay any rent. The law is always in the tenants favour, despite them breaching the terms and conditions of the tenancy agreement. The tenant can continue to ignore all notices of eviction, untll finally the court bailiff is sent. This procedure should be reduced  and re-evaluated so that the agreement is fair to both the landlord and tenant, thus allowing the landlord to take immediate action to take their properties back and made easier for landlords so that they do not incur any further costs at the expense of the tenant to recover unpaid rent.",
