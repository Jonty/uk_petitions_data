        "additional_details": "With the un-rest in Syria and over 2200 people murdered by Syria Authorities, the government should lead the way and petition The U.N and Nato to enforce a no-fly zone and institute a military blockade of all waters controlled by Syria and to protect further civilian deaths from Syrian Authorities both on land and via surrounding waters. It took far less before we acted against Gaddaffi, Why isn't the world doing something? the only reason that stands out to the rest of the normal people on this planet is that we only help oil producing countries. you can't have 1 rule for Libya and another for Syria. it's time to enforce equality on this planet.",
