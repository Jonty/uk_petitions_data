        "additional_details": "In the past few months, I have been let down on at least 4 occasions by northern rail. This has mainly been either because of trains being full, consisting of 1 carriage, or breaking down.  I propose to add newer and more efficient trains to the northern rail system, running from Nottingham to Leeds and vice versa. These trains would run VIA many stations including my home station of Dronfield. The current trains in use are the Class 142 and Class 158, however, I would suggest slowly phasing these out and adding the more efficient and reliable class 332. This would both save money on repairs and encourage more customers to board the trains. Many other northern rail areas already have newer and more amounts of running trains, Sheffield seems to have been left out of this upgrade. I seriously think that this upgrade would bring more profit and cause less expenses to northern rail. ",
