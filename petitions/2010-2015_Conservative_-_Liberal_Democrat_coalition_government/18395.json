        "additional_details": "Our economy at its worst it has been in a long time, low wages and high energy prices are putting pressure on every one. Something needs to be done to stop the rappid increase in energy prices. some people are struggling more than ever to cope with the ridiculous prices being charged. every year the energy suppliers in the united kingdom release growing proffits and its not justified for them to increase prices at such a large rate. there should be a cap on how much they can charge based upon the rate of inflation so that people from poorer back grounds dont end up losing out. wages increase by 2% yet energy prices rise in some cases by more than 20%. this is just not sustainable. We need change and need it before its too late!!!",
