Possible solutions.  For those that are not considered to be a danger to society, don't just tag them OR do (full time) community service but do both.  For those Category D prisoners already in an open prison, make them earn the roof above their head and the food in their stomach (like the rest of us have to) by undertaking full time community service.  For the Category A - C prisoners, make them work full time too by producing products that are in demand; everyday things that the public will want to buy (clothes / furniture / soft furnishings or whatever). I am sure that a great number of people in the UK want to see prisoners earning the keep they enjoy, courtesy of the tax paying, law abiding public.",
