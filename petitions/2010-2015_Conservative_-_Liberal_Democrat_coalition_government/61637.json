Unfortunately he has a rare brain disorder called PICKS disease and, we, his Family think he deserves to live out his last months/years surrounded and cared for by his loved ones. We are all Westminster residents and not residents of Bromley, so it would make more sense that he is able to return to Westminster where is he is familiar with his surroundings,and where his immediate family all are, we thank you for all your support",
