Not only are the conditions dangerous for players due to extreme heat, but also the lives of 900 immigrant workers have been lost to date in the process of building the infrastructure and stadiums.\r\n\r\nThere is also emerging evidence that the Qatari FA are paying workers to fill the stadiums, the passion simply isn't there, and by hosting the world cup in the winter, domestic leagues with decades of passionate following will be effected.\r\n\r\nIf the FA sets an example and refuses to bow to FIFA's unfathomable decision, other national FA's may follow suit, how can we allow the tournament to go ahead when the ethics of it are already in question with 8 years to go?",
