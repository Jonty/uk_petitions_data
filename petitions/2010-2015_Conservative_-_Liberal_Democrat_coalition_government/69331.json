        "additional_details": "The government and Opposition leaders are promising widespread devolution to Scotland in the event of them rejecting Independence. This is an important constitutional step which has not been debated to any extent in parliament and the rest of the British people have had no say in this. No more powers should be devolved to the Scottish Parliament without full and rigorous parliamentary debate and the opportunity for the people of Britain to voice their opinion in a referendum.",
