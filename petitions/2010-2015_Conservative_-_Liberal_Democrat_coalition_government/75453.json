        "additional_details": "The cost of parenting is an expensive one, as every parent knows, but your child's safety is paramount. Latest advice on car seat safety is that second hand seats should not be used and babies should be seated in rear facing iso fix seats for as long as possible. New rules and regulations are improving car seat safety but they are also driving the cost of car seats up. Many suitable car seats can cost in excess of \u00a3200; many reaching \u00a3350 or more. This is expensive for only child families and simply unaffordable for families with more children. VAT on car seats is currently set at 5%, I petition that it should be reduced to 0% and companies limited in how much they can profit from these essential safety items.",
