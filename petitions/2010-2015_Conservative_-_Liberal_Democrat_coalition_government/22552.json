        "additional_details": "Every year, thousands of gifted and talented students are put off from studying in the UK, as they are unable to meet the fees. For example, to study a clinical medicine course in Oxford University, Home/EU students only expect to pay \u00a33990 tuition, whereas in stark contrast, their overseas counterparts are expected to hand over a staggering \u00a327 550 on tuition costs alone each year; which would pay for 7 years of clinical study for a home  /EU student.\r\n As you can see, the educational costs concerning overseas students are absurd, and are in urgent need of change.
