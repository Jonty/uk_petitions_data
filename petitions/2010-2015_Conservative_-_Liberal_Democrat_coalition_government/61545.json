If he was good enough to be a spy (an employee) for Russia then Russia should be good enough to keep its employees in their dotage. Immediate deportation to Moscow is the absolute minimum that is necessary in this case.  How he fares once dumped on the runway in Moscow is a problem for him, not for the taxpayers of this country.",
