        "additional_details": "HM Government should not make changes to the terms and conditions of existing Public Sector Employees (that they have control over, for example those under Civil Service Pension Schemes) as it is inherently unfair.  Top bankers did not have bonuses stopped when banks headed were bailed out by the Government, and by definition the taxpayer, for contractual reasons.  For this reason changes to Public Sector Terms and Conditions (for example pension schemes and redundadncy packages) should only apply to new entrants to these schemes not existing staff who did not sign up to the new T&C being imposed.",
