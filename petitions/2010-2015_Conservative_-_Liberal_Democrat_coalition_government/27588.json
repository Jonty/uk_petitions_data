Why should there be this differential? Homphophobia should be treated within Criminal Law no matter where it takes place. Employers and their staff should not be protected from their homophobic behaviour because it doesn't come under Criminal Law. The Law needs changing to protect Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuals, and Transgendered individuals in the workplace. ",
