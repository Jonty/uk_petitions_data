        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to abandon its plans for an elected House of Lords and to replace it with a House for Posterity.  This would redefine the role of the House of Commons as the chamber that represented current interests whilst the House for Posterity would have a constitutional duty to make decisions on the basis of what is the best decision for the longer-term.\r\n\r\nThe chamber would be appointed on a random basis similar to jury service from a register of those prepared to carry out this role and an individual would be restricted to one term of office in their lifetime of 10 years.  Party group, whips and lobbying of any kind would be forbidden and there would be a Register of Interests to eliminate conflicts of interest.",
