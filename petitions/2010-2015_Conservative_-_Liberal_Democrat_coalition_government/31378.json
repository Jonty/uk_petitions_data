        "additional_details": "In the UK very few primary schools provide separate changing facilities for boys and girls. In most cases children have to change all together in the classroom before and after P.E.\r\nThis campaign wants to make schools that have no changing rooms provide alternative appropriate arrangements such as screens in classrooms or other viable solution.\r\nMany children feel uncomfortable changing in front of others of the opposite sex and at present very little is done to make them feel comfortable.\r\nPlease sign this petition now.",
