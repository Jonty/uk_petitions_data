All expectant mothers in finland that go to a doctor/midwife appointment before the fourth month of pregnancy receive a box containing everything they will need for the first montb of the babys life including vests, sleep suits, sleeping bags etc. In addition to the items received in the box, the box itself caomes with a mattress and fitted sheet so that the box can be used as a bed/moses basket. The contents of the box changes to meet current needs of parents and children.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the box offers every baby the same start in life no matter what background they come from.",
