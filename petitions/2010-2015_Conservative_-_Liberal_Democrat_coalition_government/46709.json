        "additional_details": "The National Escort Group (NEG) provide safety cover for cyclists racing on the UK roads. They have no power to stop vehicles so their presence is there only cover. Following the tragic loss of a cyclist on the Severn Bridge RR I would ask that it be considered to allow the NEG powers to stop vehicles whilst the race in progress for no longer than 4-5 mins much like they do in Belgium. This will provide safer racing on the road and reduce the risk for motorist and cyclist thus allowing the Police to continue on their daily duty as the risk is drastically reduced due to the presence of the NEG in an official capacity. The NEG work closely with British Cycling and have worked on the biggest races in the UK inc the London 2012 Olympics. Simple powers of stopping vehicles WILL save lives.",
