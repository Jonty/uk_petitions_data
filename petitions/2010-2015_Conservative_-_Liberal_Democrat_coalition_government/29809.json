        "additional_details": "Give Huddersfield it's identity back by becoming independant of the Kirklees authority.\r\n\r\nThe town currently struggle to promote it's identity to encourage growth and new business. The major reason for this is the Kirklees authority has to oversee many towns without any genuine focus. It's this lack of focus that leaves Huddersfield with little chance of standing tall amongst it's neighboors.\r\n\r\nHuddersfield has little or nothing in common with Dewsbury, Batley or Cleckheaton geographically or historically and this association only serves to dilute the reputation of Huddersfield.",
