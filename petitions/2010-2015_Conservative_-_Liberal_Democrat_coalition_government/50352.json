        "additional_details": "You are one of many thousands of people in England that love their country and want to celebrate St. George's Day with a bank holiday on 23 April. We are a group of unpaid volunteers that promote England's national day and lobby MPs and local Councils.\r\n\r\nEngland lags far behind the rest of Europe in the number of bank holidays we get. A bank holiday on St. George's Day would be a great opportunity for all the English (regardless of colour or religion) to recognise what binds us together.\r\n\r\nEverything from football to fish & chips, and cricket to curry could be celebrated on our national day",
