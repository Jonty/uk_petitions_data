        "additional_details": "Arts and humanities subjects are notorious for minimal contact hours, especially compared subjects such as Law and Medicine. Although after a messy night out we may be grateful for this. Contact hours have been compromised due to the digitalisation of the education system. With lectures being overly dependent on PowerPoint and digital communication, human interaction has been lost within teaching. Many argue we do not need a high number of contact hours, as independent learning takes priority over organised teaching. We agree with this to a certain extent; lectures are important and as university students we do not expect to be \u2018spoon-fed\u2019. However, the skills that we bring to the workforce need to be addressed and enhanced within the university education system. Technology should work to further academic ends, not replace and simplifying them.",
