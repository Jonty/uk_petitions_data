        "additional_details": "The NHS is being taken over by Wall Street. And Cameron won\u2019t stop it. The Prime Minister\u2019s refusal to exempt our health service from a deal that will make it impossible to reverse privatisation really is a matter of life and death. David Cameron could go down in history as the man who gave away this country\u2019s greatest achievement to Wall Street and enabled big American healthcare access to our hospital wards?\r\n\r\nWe call on the Prime Minister to make it clear once and for all that he will protect the NHS from the world\u2019s largest bilateral trade negotiations which is happening right now in Brussels. We ask the Prime Minister to save the NHS from being sold off and to ensure that TTIP (the transatlantic trade and investment partnership) will mean that reversing the damage done by this government isn't impossible.\r\n",
