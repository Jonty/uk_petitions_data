        "additional_details": "Stop the shameful and shocking criminal abuse of the elderly and vulnerable exposed  by the relevant Commissions and breaches the Health & Social Care Act 2008.  Following the trend of the last Government not content with inflicting the indignities, fear, stress to name a few of the tortures on these vulnerable people this Government is now suggesting to those who have worked & sacrificed all their lives in order to own their own homes without being a burden on the welfare benefit system to be encouraged (bullied) to leave their homes, are these people excluded from Article 8 of the Human Rights Act. Still taxed on their meagre pensions & exorbitant council tax, all the elderly should receive an acceptable level of care without discrimination.  Do you want to end your days like this? Government should review the billions they spend on welfare benefits, human rights for criminals, terrorists, asylum seekers, illegal immigrants, shameless families, bailing out banks, foreign aid.",
