We have already seen a youth taken to court and given 24hrs of a sentence for stealing 2 Tee Shirts, and because he had been in custody for 24hrs he was immeidietly released.\r\nYour court System is a joke, and we should have a Zero Tollerance System in place. If they are to young to take to court, take the parents, and make them pay,either loss of benefits are if they are solvent put an order on any property that they own until the fine has been paid, and stop pussy footing with them if they start to scream about their Human Rights, by informing them that WE have human rights and it is their responsability to teach their children about other peoples and their own.\r\nAnyone commiting a crime should automaticly lose all their Humon Rights.",
