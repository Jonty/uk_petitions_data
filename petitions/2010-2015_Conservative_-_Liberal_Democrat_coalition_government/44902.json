        "action": "Delay in the processing of Migrant Visa application is causing severe employment difficulties for immigrants",
        "additional_details": "Under this government, all immigrant visa applications take an average of 6 months processing time even though it cost on average \u00a31100/person/ application.  As a result of this delay in the renewal of immigrant visas, employers shy away from offering migrants applying for further leave to remain employment.\r\nThis petition Demands a cap of not more than ONE Month on application processing time for all categories of immigrant visa application, just as there is a cap on net migration into the UK. This will enable migrants to get on with their lives in or out of the UK, depending on the outcome of each application.\r\nPLEASE NOTE: That while migrants remain unemployed and at the \"mercies\" of the UKBA, they do not qualify and do not receive state work seekers benefits.  This is unjust, given that majority of migrants if not all, continue to pay taxes and National Insurance contributions.",
