        "additional_details": "The EU has asked for an increase of 5% to its budget for the year 2011/12. This comes at a time when the Government is cutting expenditure in all areas minus Health and International Development. There is no reason why we should consider the EU to be of greater importance than any of our own national institutions which are not seeing such a rise. As such Parliament should force the Government to withhold its signature from an EU budget deal which does not reflect the economic conditions which currently exist in the UK. There exists no mandate for such a rise and therefore Parliament on behalf of the British people should remind Europe of its National Sovereignty.",
