        "additional_details": "I wish to see a restriction in the use of the variable speed limit signs on the M25 between Junction 10 (the A3) to Junction 16 (the M40) in both directions. Anyone who regularly travels on this section of the motorway will know that the signs are illuminated more often than not and that when they are, serious traffic congestion results. The ensuing delays are damaging to business and crawling vehicles burn more fuel and produce increased emissions.\r\n\r\nAs I frequently travel on this stretch of the M25 (in both directions) I have noticed that the traffic flows smoothly on the (rare) occasions when the variable speed limit signs are switched off, even when there are a significant number of vehicles on the motorway.\r\n\r\nI therefore want the Government to take action to ensure that the signs are only illuminated on any stretch when there is an accident or incident.",
