        "action": "Replace the TV license with pay per progamme for BBC channels",
        "additional_details": "Many people do not watch television, watch television but only commercial channels or use their sets to watch videos on only yet they are by law expected to pay for a TV license which is very expensive.  Even those who do not have a TV set in their home can get hounded to pay for a TV license.  Now that the country has gone digital and the analogue signal switched off it would be feasible and more appropriate to replace the license with a monthly subscription to view BBC channels through a Freeview box or other TV digital provider with viewers able to opt in and out throughout the year as they please.  Anybody who does not want to pay the monthly subscription can still view BBC programmes paying a small fee per programme.  This will suit occasional BBC viewers.",
