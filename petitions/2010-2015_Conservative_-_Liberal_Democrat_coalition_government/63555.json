        "additional_details": "As the expenses/flipping home fiasco continues with recent news about Maria Miller this petition suggests the creation of an MP campus. 650 apartments on site, all identical, with one for each MP during their term. No personal profit to be made from taxpayer funding. As well as avoiding expenses scandals this would also provide a central and secure environment for MP's, along the lines of a University Hall of Residence.",
