        "additional_details": "We, the Undersigned, are actively coming together in one voice to make our objections to the cutting down of our rainforests heard. The rainforests of our planet house creatures that have not even been discovered yet, and if the rate of deforestation continues, these animals will become extinct. Deforestation also contributes to global warming by releasing carbon dioxide. Therefore, we believe that measures should be taken to reduce the harmful effects of cutting down the rainforests, such as limiting the number of trees felled and by planting two trees for every one cut down.
