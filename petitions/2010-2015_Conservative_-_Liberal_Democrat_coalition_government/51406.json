        "additional_details": "Following my own recent personal experiences with cervical abnormalities and early stage cervical cancer at just the age of 25, I feel passionate that the age for cervical screening should be lowered. Following other recent case studies has also made me aware that this is still something that is not being taken seriously. I was lucky but this isn't always the case. In a world where young people are becoming sexually active at a younger age I feel that it is particularly important that the cervical screening age is lowered. Cervical Cancer is the most common cancer in women under the age of 35 and every year in the UK 3000 women are diagnosed. Sadly 1000 of these women will die of the disease. I would like to see the cervical screening age lowered from 25 to 21 or at least the opportunity for those young women who are pro-active with their health to attend a cervical screening test if they are under 25 and wish to.
