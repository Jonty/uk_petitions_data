        "additional_details": "Abortion is a crime against the most vulnerable. It is killing an unborn child/murder who is innocent. Who gains from a woman having an abortion? Who looses out? The baby, the mother, father, their families, friends, communities, societies, nations, world. Do you know what that baby would have become  perhaps a politician, doctor, scientist, inventor, artist, entreprenneur, etc. We would like the government to Abolish Abortions for good because it causes mental health, other traumatic side effects, infertility, , and  which results in many women devestated, angry, bereved. Who picks up the pieces ?This is going on now over 40 plus years , its time to END ABORTION FOR GOD. PS. have you noticed that women are the only ones having abortions- lets wake up and say NO MORE ABORTIONS FOR GOD SAKE. Some women are having multiple abortions. STOP MURDERING OUR BABIES- THIS IS THE KILLING FIEILDS AGAIN/ HOLOCAUST. MP's ENOUGH WE SAY!!!!!!! ",
