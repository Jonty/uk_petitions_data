        "additional_details": "To demand RTI filings are made in absolute real time  when employees are paid is a draconian system with no allowance for processing delay, delays in payroll bureaus and accountants receiving information from clients and no allowance for staff non-availability on a given day or short time period.  The stresses that this places business owners, accountants and payroll bureaus is disproportionate to the benefits gained.  If the RTI filing deadline was relaxed to the 19th of the following month for ALL reports this would be in line with acceptable PAYE filing obligations in this country and would still provide HMRC with up to date information on a month by month basis.  This would also enable businesses to comply without any need for further extension to the delay in introduction of the currently dreaded penalties scheme. ",
