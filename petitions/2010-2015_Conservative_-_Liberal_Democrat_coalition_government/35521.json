Thus there is no way for the purchaser to check that the lenses are within the tolerances given in the British Standard Specification.\r\n\r\nThe Government is asked to amend the Opticians Act of 1989 (as amended in 2005) to require suppliers of spectacles to issue them with a note of the following measurements for each lens (multiple values per lens for bifocals and varifocals):\r\n\r\n- the spherical power to the nearest 0.01 dioptre\r\n- the cylindrical power to the nearest 0.01 dioptre\r\n- the axis to the nearest degree.",
