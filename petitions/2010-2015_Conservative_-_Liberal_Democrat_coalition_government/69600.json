        "additional_details": "St Chads stay and play is a non profit scheme which gives any monies made to St Chads catholic church. It is a brand new fantastic scheme bringing together local moms and children alike with a range of educational and fun activities and is being forced to close because it is not making enough money for the church. The room used is rarely used at the times we are there and it is a fantastic community project which thanks to its volunteer moms who run it is a safe and sociable place for local people who may not get to meet other moms from day to day. Please help to save this wonderful playgroup.",
