My friend was on crutches when he was knocked over by one of these \"Boris Bikes\" and was sworn at by the cyclist as he drove off. This is not acceptable. He did not have chance to see the registration number because it is too small and although he was in a busy street no-one else was able to read the number. The CCTV in the area could also not see it and the police have not been able to help.\r\n\r\nAs a car driver, my number plate is visible and I don't accept TFL's response that the Barclay's advertisment is more important than having a number people can see and trace. The bikes, rode safely, are excellent. But we do need a viewable number for those idiots who drive damn-right dangerously on our congested streets. My friend has recovered but I am not sure someone elderly or a child would have.\r\n",
