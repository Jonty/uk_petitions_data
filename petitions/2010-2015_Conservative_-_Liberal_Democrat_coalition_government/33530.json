Many people think that is unacceptable that our civil liberties must be curbed in the name of fighting terrorism.\r\n\r\nI and many others want the government to overturn this draconian bill to keep what is private, private. I do not oppose searching if there is a legitimate reason and a warrant,it is just searching through innocent people's emails is no matter of the state.  ",
