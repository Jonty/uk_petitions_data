        "additional_details": "The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority was founded to oversee the expenses system to prevent the systematic abuse carried out over many years, some of which has lead to criminal prosecution and potential much more could be.  The board and staff of IPSA should be completely independent, no current or former MPs or other people with parliamentary political ambition.  They should uphold the standards that we in everyday life are subjected to, even more so as it is public money they are claiming.  The staff and board members should be free from harassment, be it multiple audits or individual harassment of staff.  Any instances should be treated severely, with expenses privileges being withdrawn for the worst.  It appears that the worst \"harassers\" tend to be those that are trying to abuse the system the most.  The body should be subject to scrutiny, but this should be limited to a regular time period, yearly.  The Prime Minister should approve any ad hoc investigations.",
