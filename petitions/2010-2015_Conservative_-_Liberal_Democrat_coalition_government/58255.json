        "additional_details": "In January, the Government intends to make the possession of images depicting certain types of legal, consensual sex a criminal act, punishable by up to 3 years in prison.\r\nThis is because, although having and filming consensual sex acts is legal, the participants have chosen to pretend that one of them has little or no choice in the matter, for the duration of the scene.\r\n\r\nThis is known as acting.\r\n\r\nWe believe that it should remain legal to watch and possess recordings showing scenes which simulate this kind of coercion, just as it will remain legal to watch films depicting simulations of other criminal activities.\r\n\r\nMany people \u2013 women and men \u2013 enjoy participating in and watching this kind of sexual play. To call them criminals for wishing to explore their own sexuality safely, through images, rather than in person, would surely stigmatise and harm them.",
