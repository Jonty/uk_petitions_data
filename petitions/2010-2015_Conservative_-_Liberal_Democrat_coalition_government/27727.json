This should only be done when a person has come from a politically stable country, and when they have bypassed other stable countries to reach the UK.\r\n\r\nBy using court orders to prevent an illegal immigrant from leaving their embassy apart from when being escorted to a plane by embassy staff, we would save money on holding people in reception centres, and from releasing people only for them to destroy their passport and/or go missing, work illegally etc. ",
