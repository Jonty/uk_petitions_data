        "additional_details": "Everyone is fed up with on street parking .We put up with commercial vehicles parking out side our properties. Most of them are a wreck to to look at and the people who drive them never put them out side their own  property they put them out side someone ells-es so they can park their cars out side their house and someone ells as to put up with it.the same with cars we can never park out side our own houses because we get blocked out and if you are lucky enough to park out side your own property you go out and one of them take your place again.So why can't we have double green lines all around the streets making it cars parking only and let us rent the space out side our houses then we can have our own spot to park .This will create jobs and money for the country.And put a stop to all the problems we all have to put with when we ask them to move up or down a bit .Residential parking is no good it does not work properly ",
