We demand a democratic vote on this subject as it is unjust and somewhat tyranical . Our brave countrymen are being forced to fight dictatorship , in the name of democracy , all over the world . Have we not been controlled under our own dictator , royalty , for generations now . It's the Queens signature that sends our men into battle after all , and Scotland has never asked her to do so . We demand our right to have a vote on this ! ",
