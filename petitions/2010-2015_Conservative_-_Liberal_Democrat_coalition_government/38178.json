Furthermore, even if a Freedom of Information Act request for such information is made UKAD will refuse to release the data.\r\n\r\nFor the public to truly have confidence that British sport is not tainted by drug use it is essential that UKAD exhibits openness and transparency and publishes details of tests or at the very least releases such information to the public and the media when it is requested.\r\n\r\nMoving forward the Goverment should direct UKAD to publish the results of all tests. If this is not possible for whatever reason, the Government should reinforce to UKAD that when a Freedom of Information Act request is made which relates to information pertaining to drug tests which have been carried out, that UKAD must release this information.
