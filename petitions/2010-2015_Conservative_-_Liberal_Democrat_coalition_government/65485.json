        "additional_details": "I am convinced that we would have a more representative political system in the UK if we have access to online voting.\r\n\r\nThe turnout in UK general elections has dropped from 77.7% in 1992 to 65.1% in 2010. I do not believe that this is down to voter apathy as our ruling elite would lead us to believe. This just happens to have coincided with explosion of the internet and a tech-savvy young generation...\r\n\r\nIt is patently obvious that some key demographics would be better represented.  David Cameron realises this and this is why he has side-stepped it with some comment about the beauty of braving the elements to exercise our democratic right to vote. Do you believe this patronising nonsense?\r\n\r\nI urge you to sign this important petition. We have less that 12 months to make this happen and get the political leaders we want. ",
