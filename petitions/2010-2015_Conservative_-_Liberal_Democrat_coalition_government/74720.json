It was that of the financial services sector, which we bailed out for many hundreds of billions without so much as a thank you from the city.\r\n\r\nFollowing Austerity and cuts we now have a crisis looming in the NHS and many other services under funded by insufficient taxation.\r\n\r\nRather than trying to squeeze blood from a stone and taxing the poor and the disabled; then why not impose a small tax on a massive number, such as the fifteen trillion traded daily in currencies alone, to fund the public sector and clear the deficit.\r\n\r\nInstead of taxing pounds and raising pennies, tax the trillions and raise many hundreds of billions !
