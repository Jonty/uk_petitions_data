        "additional_details": "The UK Cop Humour Facebook Page is selling Thin Blue Line Patches & Pin Badges with a donation from each going to Care of Police Survivors. This charity provide invaluable support to those left behind when an Officer dies - not unlike Help for Heroes who support our Armed Forces. The design is a thin blue line on a British Flag - representing our Police & their allegiance to the British Public.\r\n\r\nHowever, a minority of Police Chiefs are voicing concern that this design may cause \"offence\". Strangely, no-one has said they ARE offended & no-one can identify who MIGHT be offended - but as a result, Officers are being asked to remove them.\r\n\r\nPLEASE, therefore, can the Prime Minister intervene to ensure that NO Police Officer will be penalised or chastised for wearing a Thin Blue Line Patch on their uniform - as this small gesture would be HUGELY appreciated across the country.",
