        "additional_details": "East Sussex fire service has proposed that The Ridge Fire Station either be closed or made into a retained station. This proposal will mean that the response to any fire will be delayed by at least 5 mins. Government statistics show that a fire doubles every minute that it is ablaze. We need to show our support for the fire station! rather then taking the money from local sevices that are needed like hospitals and fire etc and take it from places that don't need the money like the bounes that people are not entited to.\r\n ",
