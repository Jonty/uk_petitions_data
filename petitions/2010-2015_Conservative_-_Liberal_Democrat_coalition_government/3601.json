These exist in small quantities in other countries, but a development of them in the UK economy in areas such as currency transactions and derivatives, would produce an astonishing amount of money that could prevent the job losses and cuts to public services that the electorate is currently told is necessary. A tax of \u00a35 in every \u00a31,000 could reduce the reckless gambling of the banks that lead to the financial crisis, and go towards re-opening libraries, the EMA, reducing child poverty, providing aid and caring for the vulnerable.
