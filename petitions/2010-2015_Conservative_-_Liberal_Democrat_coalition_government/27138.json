        "additional_details": "I propose that the National Service Medal be recognised as a Official Military Medal and to be worn on Remembrance Day and other Parades, Because successive Governments have failed to recognise National Service between 1947 and 1961. The shame is that former National Servicemen have bought the Medal in their thousands with a percentage of each one sold going to the Royal British Legion. After a 7 year fight the Pingat Jasa Malaysian Medal had been recognised. It is now time after 65 years to recognise the National Service Medal for men now in their 70`s and 80`s and their next of kin. The Medal is a nil cost to the Government",
