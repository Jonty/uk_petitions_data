        "action": "Ban the use of zero hour contracts once the employee has completed 6 months of service with the company",
        "additional_details": "Zero hour contracts are widespread within the working world and are advantageous to both employees and employers.\r\n\r\nEmployers get the flexibility of staff as required and employees are not fixed to set hours, so can continue with any commitments they have in the home, such as childcare.\r\n\r\nHowever employers can use this system to their advantage.  This is because employers can simply offer zero hour contracts meaning that there is zero entitlement to holiday and sick pay.  This can lead to financial problems for the employee and can cause a high turnover of staff for the employer should said employee be offered better terms elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis petition is calling for employers to be obliged to offer employees a contract with guaranteed hours once the employee has completed six months service with the employer.  This way both parties can see whether they are a good fit for each other, plus this gives the business and employee stability.",
