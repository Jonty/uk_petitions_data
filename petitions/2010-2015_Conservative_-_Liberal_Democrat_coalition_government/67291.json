        "additional_details": "Secondments within organisations should be an opportunity for both parties to benefit, but as there is no limit to secondment duration within the UK then the business can utilise a performer for an indefinite amount of years and only pay a lower level of remuneration for equal work compared to a permanent employee. There should be a maximum length that can be termed as a secondment and after this the role should become permanent.\r\n\r\nBecause company policy is not always enforceable and jurisdiction can be argued at a tribunal, the law should support employees to obtain a fair wage for the level of work they perform. If organisations are allowed to decide duration for themselves it should clearly form part of terms and conditions",
