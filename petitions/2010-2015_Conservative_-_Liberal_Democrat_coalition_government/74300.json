        "additional_details": "With mental health cases increasing and waiting times for therapy being more than 12 months, preventative action needs to be taken.  Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave. CBT cannot remove your problems, but it can help you deal with them in a more positive way.\r\nSuch methods are so simple and beneficial that schools should provide mandatory sessions.  Helping people handle any mental issues early on in life will not only prepare them for the future but also take some of the strain off the already-overstretched services.",
