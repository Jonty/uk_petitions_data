        "additional_details": "When many small companies cannot afford to provide any pension for their staff our government is offering only small cuts to state employee pensions in the future. All our main trade unions seem to oppose even these small cuts. I would suggest that all state related bodies, who provide a pension based on a final or averaged salary scheme cut their payouts for anyone retiring after 2015 by 25%.",
