To show the tories and their supporters just how difficult these exams actually are, Dave, Micheal Gove and George Osborne should complete one GCSE paper each and the results beamed around the world to show just how difficult GCSE's really are. Cameron should do English Language because he needs to work on his speaking and writing skills, Gove should do History to find out what happens when tories mess with schooling and George Osborne should do Maths as he seems useless at it, his numbers never add up.\r\nHands off our future!\r\nLouis, aged 15",
