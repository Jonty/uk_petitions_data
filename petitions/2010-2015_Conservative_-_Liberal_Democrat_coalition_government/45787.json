        "additional_details": "The government should propose a vote for an English national anthem.\r\n\r\nThe current anthem adopted by the English people - \"God Save the Queen\" is the British, Commonwealth Realm and British Crown Dependencies anthem and should remain in use for British events (like the superb Olympics last summer).\r\n\r\nThe English national anthem should be used at English events including international sports games. I believe the anthem should reclaim the English identity without meaning to belittle Great Britain.\r\n\r\nCurrently the Scottish and Welsh have their own national anthems despite being as much a part of Britain as the English. This is a matter of equality.\r\n\r\n\r\nA shortlist of appropriate Hymns should be drawn up (I Vow to Thee, My Country / Jerusalem, etc) and a vote arranged. Failing this at least some discussion on this matter should be initiated in the House of Commons. ",
