It is far too easy for anyone to get a licence, there should be tighter regulations for applications, even something small such as a test will keep the scratchers* from opening shops and spreading diseases.\r\nTattoo kits have became a popular product for aspiring tattoo artists to buy online, when bought they can tattoo anywhere, even hold tattoo parties without ANY knowledge of tattooing or BLOODBOURNE PATHOGENS! This needs to stop! It should be a complete ban on Tattoo kits!\r\nThere should be tighter regulations on applying for a licence.\r\nIt should be compulsory for online tattoo suppliers to ask for a photocopy of a licence, this means only registered tattoo parlours can order supplies.\r\n\r\n*Scratcher is a well known term in the tattooing industry as someone who does not know how to tattoo. There is the threat that scratchers spread disease as they have no knowledge of cross-contamination",
