        "additional_details": "Ebola is on the rise, and if we don't do anything about it, the results will be catastrophic.\r\nWhat I am asking is that an awareness day is to be organised by the government through a health organisation e.g. NHS or other. This will raise awareness of the virus while providing information about it to the national community. The necessary feature being a donation box; donations i presume will go towards research on the virus in hope to provide a cure sooner.\r\nBy signing this e-petition you agree that a cure for Ebola is necessary and this e-petition could help towards it.",
