        "additional_details": "DUE TO EU PRESSURE RULES THAT HAVE KEPT OUR ISLAND RABIES FREE FOR OVER 100 YEARS HAVE BEEN DROPPED. MUST WE LOWER OUR STANDARDS OR SHOULD THE EU BE RAISING THEIRS? PETS NOW ENTER THE UK FROM 26 EU STATES (9 CLASSED AS HIGH RISK) JUST 21 DAYS AFTER RABIES VACCINATION. THE AVERAGE INCUBATION PERIOD IS 35 DAYS. THESE CHANGES AFFECT US ALL-YET THEY'VE SLIPPED IN UNPUBLICISED. PEOPLE ARE UNAWARE OF THE HUGE THREAT TO THE LIVES OF NOT ONLY THEIR PETS, BUT THEIR FAMILIES TOO. A GROUP OF VETS, PROFESSORS, DOCTORS & ANIMAL LOVERS ARE DESPERATE TO RAISE AWARENESS. OUR GOVERNMENT HAS TWICE FOUGHT & WON THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THESE NEW REGULATIONS. WE DEMAND THAT OUR RABIES FREE STATUS BE PRESERVED SO WE NEED TO ACT NOW BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. RABIES WILL COME.  IT\u2019S NO LONGER A CASE OF IF, BUT WHEN! CHANGE IS GOOD BUT THIS IS MADNESS. WE CALL ON OUR GOVERNMENT TO CONSULT ALL CONCERNED PARTIES, EXPLORE ALL OPTIONS & ENSURE THE PUBLIC ARE FULLY AWARE THAT THESE CHANGES WILL AFFECT THEM.",
