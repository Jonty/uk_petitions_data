During our investigation we were stoned walled by both parties and they refused to help us with our all inquiries. In view of this these actions are unlawful and need to be investigated properly. CPS or AiCPS wont investigate, but how would investigate themselves. The system isnt transparent and independent as they claim, and therefore should be reviewed by a trustworthy external body. It is their public duty to stay neutral and to serve the public. So help me combat this corruption.",
