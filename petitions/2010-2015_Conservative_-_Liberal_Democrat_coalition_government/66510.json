All 62+ are getting free bus passes.\r\n\r\nIt's really harsh for females born in 1953 and 1954 to have their pensions taken away, alongside their bus passes too. Please reinstate free bus travel for all those 60+\r\n\r\nLondon residents  over 60 are able to enjoy free bus and train travel. Good for them but all UK 60+ year olds should be treated equitably.\r\n",
