        "additional_details": "If income tax where abolished then low income and middle earners who are taxed severly would see an increase substantially in thier way of life.\r\n\r\nIt would boost the economy because income levels would be increased and people could afford a little more so it would have a significant impact upon the economy in a wider aspect.\r\n\r\nIncome tax has long been an area the goverment has neglected thier moral duty to protect the people of this great nation.\r\n\r\nThis Tax affects social mobility to it's highest degree because even if you progress to earn a decent level it is heavily taxed so overall middle income earners with family are hit the most because of the tax rate.\r\n\r\nWhile low income people are kept on bottom rung of wealthfare because of this tax.\r\n]\r\nThe Bankers income is not taxed as severly as what we the ordinary people are so join this petition and end this moral decedance and greed which has corrupted our goverment.\r\n\r\nThankyou",
