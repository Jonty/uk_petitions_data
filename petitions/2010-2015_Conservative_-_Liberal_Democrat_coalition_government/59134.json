        "additional_details": "Peadophiles should die for harming an innocent child. Even if they dont kill that child they have still taken their life. They should die a slow and painful death such as the electrocution chair.  Rapists should get the same done back to them to experience the pain they put their victim through and then be hung. And cold blooded murderers should lose a life for a life if its proved 100% that they are guilty of murder and not self defense.",
