        "additional_details": "Following recent European discussions HMRC have decided to charge VAT on pitches at Antique Fairs claiming that additional features of Promotion and Security are indivisible from the pitch. This will price the pitches over the level sustainable and is not charged on car boots nor general markets both of which have similar packages. Most traders are not VAT registered and work on very tight margins. We call on the government to reverse this decision.",
