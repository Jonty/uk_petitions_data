        "additional_details": "There have been many high profile racism cases in the new recently, such as Luis Suarex and Patrice Evra, as well as John Terry and Anton Ferdinand.  The reason that these evnts keep occuring is that there is not a big enough punishment if players are found guilty.  I believe that players should receive a life ban if found guilty, as this would reduce cases by a lot, and it would be a fair punishment, as we live in a multicultural society where racism is not acceptable.",
