        "additional_details": "The BBC has released proposed plans to remove BBC Three from all platforms on the TV including Cable, Satellite and Freeview. Great shows have come from this channel including Gavin and Stacey and Little Britain. The channel is supposedly a \"Youth\" channel when even though adults really enjoy the programmes, The BBC's plan is to save \u00a3100 Million as part of there target to save money. They are not completely eradicating the channel but to broadcast it only on BBC iPlayer which most people just wouldn't want to hassle with the service and would not save them a lot of money considering the expense of running the channel. So I believe that they should make the cuts on other channels including BBC One and BBC 2 as combined the budget comes to over 1.4 Billion. BBC Three is well established and I believe is here too stay whatever happens.",
