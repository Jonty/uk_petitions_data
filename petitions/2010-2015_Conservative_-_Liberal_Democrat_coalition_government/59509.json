This can be maintained with the introduction of an ID card which contains the following information:\r\nAge\r\nAlcohol limit\r\nAlcohol used\r\nSpecial circumstances such as a police limit included (due to drunk and disorderly)\r\n\r\nThis kind of system will aid all store and bar workers to prevent under aged sales. And stop drunk aggression, and accidents.\r\n\r\nThe card would only need to be used until around 25.\r\n\r\nAs a store worker I am intimidated by the younger generation that wish to buy alcohol, and had to call the police more than once due to their behaviour, this system will help prevent this fear.",
