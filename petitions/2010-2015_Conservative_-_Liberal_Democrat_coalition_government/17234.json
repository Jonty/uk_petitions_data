This is still the case should you be paying it back on a reduce amount agreement; if you do not make the originally agreed monthly payment, it will 'Default' and remain there for six years (despite you meeting the new agreed monthly figure), stopping you getting a mortgage etc.  This is too long a time to pay for bad judgement, considering the current sentencing for actual crimes.  This should be reduced to a maximum of 1 year from the date the account is 'Settled', if not removed immediately.",
