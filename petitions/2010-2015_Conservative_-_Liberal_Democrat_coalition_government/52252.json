        "additional_details": "Racism in schools still exists and it is affecting the educational attainment of ALL pupils. We need a Macpherson-style enquiry into racism in education/ schools. Schools and governors are loathe to find racism in their schools and so there needs to be an external and honest enquiry. Schools can then address racism in the education system, staff and schools - such as low expectations of certain groups, without feeling that they are the only school with such a problem.",
