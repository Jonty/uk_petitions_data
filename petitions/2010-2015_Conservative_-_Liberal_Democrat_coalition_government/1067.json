        "additional_details": "We want cycle lanes to be incorporated into town planning in all major towns and cities in order to: Increase the number of cyclists thus reducing the strain on our roads and public transport; reduce the number of cars on the road by reducing the number of short journeys traveled in a motor vehicle thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions; increase road safety in order to reduce road deaths and encourage more people to cycle; encourage cycling to increase fitness and exercise levels; reduce our country's dependence on oil. This must come from central government. The knock-on effect of increased cycling levels in our largest town's and cities would be massive for the well being of people and the planet.\r\n\r\nThe best example for the UK to follow is that of the Netherlands http://www.cycling-embassy.org.uk/node/226\r\n",
