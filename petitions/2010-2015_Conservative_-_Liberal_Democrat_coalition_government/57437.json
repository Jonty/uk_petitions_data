(http://www.tuc.org.uk/economic-issues/internships-london-out-reach-most-uks-youngsters)\r\nAlthough at times valuable, \"too often internships are about exploitation, staff being undercut, and employers benefitting from a huge pool of cheap and willing labour\".\r\nAlthough I would say its not about willing labour, many don't have an alternative choice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe naive recently graduated (who are heavily indebted due to Higher Education student loand) are perhaps the most vunerable.\r\n\r\nInterns are doing real work, for full-time hours for no money, is this not a modern form of slavery?\r\n\r\nThe government needs to start funding companies for internships to be paid, and BAN all unpaid internships effective immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
