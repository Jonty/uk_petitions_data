Some of these people have suffered torture, all have suffered upheaval and have risked their lives fleeing their homes, some do not make the crossing alive. The UN deemed these detention centres as 'cruel inhumane and unlawful'. Yet this policy remains. Call on the UK government to put international pressure on the Australian Goverment to end this barbaric and inhumane policy!!!\r\nAustralia is a commonwealth country and has ties with the UK. Please help raise awareness on this topic and show the Australian goverment that what this policy does is morally wrong and unjustifiable!",
