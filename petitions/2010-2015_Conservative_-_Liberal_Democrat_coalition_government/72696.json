        "additional_details": "British produced pornography has been severely censored due to an amendment of the 2003 Communications Act. The Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014 requires that video-on-demand (VoD) online porn now mirrors those of DVD sex shop-type porn by the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC). Acts such as Physical or verbal abuse, Urolagnia ( \"water sports\"), Female ejaculation, Face-sitting, Fisting\r\nWhile the above content can still be viewed in the UK, from now on, laws dictate that this content is illegal to be made in the UK and can only be viewed if filmed abroad.\r\nThis makes NO sense.\r\nWhat it DOES do however, is attack the livelihoods of those who produce adult content material in the UK .  ALL of these acts are perfectly legal between consenting adults in the UK, just not on film. We ask that these ludicrous yet harmful laws be repealed and that the AMSR work in tandem with porn producers in the UK to create more sensible and realistic guidelines",
