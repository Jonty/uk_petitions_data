This information should be supplied on the prescritption; at present it isn't. Why? To prevent people from buying specs online. I had an eyetest today and asked for my PD; I was refused, the optician saying \"NO. We don't give you that otherwise people will go online to buy glasses and we wouldn't make any money\" ! This attitude is disgraceful. I, along with millions of other spectacle wearers would like the choice of where to buy our specs and not be ripped off by HIgh St retailers.\r\n\r\nI would like to government to oblige opticians to supply a critical piece of information, which, after all belongs to the owner of the eys in question.",
