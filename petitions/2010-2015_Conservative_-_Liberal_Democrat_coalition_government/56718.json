        "additional_details": "The government wants to encourage the UK's exportation of music by awarding grants to artists/projects, however to meet the guidelines you need to be well-established and the application form is aimed at artists/projects with either industry expertise or managment. Where is the justice for the incredibly-talented small artists/projects, who have equally as much potential, but may not be academically gifted or represented? Let's not forget that UK bedroom producers introduced genres such as Dubstep, Jungle/D&B, Hardcore, Speed Garage, Grime (etc.) to the world, and the majority of them were underground producers/artists not academic or represented. How are they supposed to access the grants and play their part in continuing to push genuine innovation outside of the UK?",
