Attacks on soldiers have happened before on the homeland that they fight for, and will contuine to happen unless we as a nation do something. If off duty soldiers were allowed the option to carry a conclead firearm it would give them a way to protect themselves. As members of HM Armed Forces both men and women are entrusted as a matter of course to carry firearms in the course of their duty, they should also be trusted to carry a firearm on their homeland which they fight to protect so that they may defend themselves and their colleague as they would abroad.",
