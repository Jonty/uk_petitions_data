        "additional_details": "This petition is designed to set in motion a discussion between MP's and government across all party's to create an official \"Made in Great Britain\" seal of approval across all industries and business sectors within the UK.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind this is quite simple. A \"Made in Great Britain\" seal of approval will have and do many positive things for the UK economy:\r\n\r\n A) make the consumers/public aware of products across every industry that are made in Great Britain wether that be tangible or non tangible goods. The seal/mark will allow the consumer or person to make an informed choice wether to \"Buy British\" or foreign imports. The Seal/Mark will indicate the positive impact that buying \"British Made\" goods will have on the British economy, future economic growth and the economic recovery of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nB) Will be a standardised seal of approval for quality and standard across that can be issued by an official government agency.\r\n\r\n",
