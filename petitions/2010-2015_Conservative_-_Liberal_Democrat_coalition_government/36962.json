        "additional_details": "St Patricks Day has been a bank holiday in Northern Ireland for 100 years, St Andrews Day was recently made a bank holiday in Scotland. It is obviously unfair that the English should not be given an opportunity to celebrate their patron saint on 23 April. England gets only 8 bank holidays a year, fewer than most European countries. We call on the government to make St. George's Day a bank holiday in England.",
