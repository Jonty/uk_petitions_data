        "additional_details": "This e-petition is for students and people who think that it's better to have a wide range of subjects available to As and GCSE students. Why should subjects such as  home economics, human biology, performing arts and environmental science be axed ? Don't we have the right to do subjects that interest us?If for example a student took human biology (studying the human body) instead of pure biology (that covers more areas) would that be fair if that student just wanted knowledge on the human body and it's functions. Just because they are similar to mainstream topic doesn't mean they should be gotten rid off!  You have to decide! Do you want yourself,your children or your grandchildren to not have a wide range of choice on the subjects they pick for there A-levels or GCSE? ",
