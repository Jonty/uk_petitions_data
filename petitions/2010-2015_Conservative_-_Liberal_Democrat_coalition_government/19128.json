        "additional_details": "The government should apply whatever pressure is possible to prevent the oppression and murder of Coptic Christians in Egypt. Since the Arab Spring revolution attacks on Christians and churches in Egypt has increased markedly. This must be hated before it becomes a case of full blown ethnic cleansing or genocide. All overseas aid to the Egyptian government should be withheld and sanctions against those in power should also be used if these attacks continue.",
