        "additional_details": "Over the past few months some commentators have questioned the place of betting shops in our town centres.\r\n\r\nThe industry supports around 100,000 jobs, in particular offering flexible hours that attract a higher proportion of women and young people than other retail sectors.\r\n\r\nBookmakers pay nearly \u00a31 billion in tax each year, and are one of the few retail sectors which have the potential to create new jobs and support the local economy.\r\n\r\nLast year bookmakers contributed nearly \u00a33 billion to the UK economy.\r\n\r\nIt is a common myth that bookmakers are proliferating on the UK high street. Shop numbers have remained stable at about 8,500 for the past decade.\r\n\r\nBookmakers are proud to offer a fun leisure activity in town centres up and down the country, with 8 million customers viewing shops as an essential part of their local communities.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to show your support for the bookmaking industry and the thousands of hardworking and dedicated people it employs.
