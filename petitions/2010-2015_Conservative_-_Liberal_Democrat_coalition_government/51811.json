        "additional_details": "Pet shops are selling turtles when they are small and cute. People aren't told the truth about how big they get, most get to 12 inches in length. They require a lot of room. When they get too big, people ring places like sea life centres, aquariums, rescues etc but they are all full. We run a reptile rescue and have approx. 80 turtles, all of which have got to big for their owners. If they can't find somewhere to rehome them, they get dumped in our ponds which will eventually have a devastating effect on our wildlife.\r\nI was recently reading a wildlife magazine and was upset to see that red eared turtles are now considered as part of the British wildlife. We need to act now and stop shops from breeding and selling turtles before it is too late and all our ponds are just full of these animals. ",
