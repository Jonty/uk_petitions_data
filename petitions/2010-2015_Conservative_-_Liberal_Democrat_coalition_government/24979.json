        "additional_details": "Orange have recently sent a text message to customers informing them that from January their monthly mobile contracts will increase by over 4%.\r\n\r\nThis is a disgraceful and unjust price rise and should not be allowed. Customers agreed a price plan for a fixed period when they took out their contract and should not be forced to pay more than originally agreed.\r\n\r\nWith peoples incomes either remaining the same or not increasing by more than one or two percent many cannot afford this price rise.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition so that this matter can be discussed and looked into at Government level.",
