        "additional_details": "IT IS TIME TO LEGALISE THE COVERING OF SKY LIGHTS ON FACTORY ROOFS TO SAVE LIVES OF ROOFERS.\r\nTwenty years ago my Brother fell through a skylight - he survived with a smashed arm and broken bones - HE WAS LUCKY. In August my other Brother fell through a skylight whilst working on a roof - he was UNLUCKY and did not survive his fall.\r\nLUCKY?  UNLUCKY? There SHOULD NOT be an element of LUCK.  In TWENTY years nothing has been done for the safety of Roofers falling through skylights. I want legislation for ALL skylights to be covered with guards on all buildings so that we do not loose any more roofers and their families going through hell with something which could be avoided. Check the HSE site you will be shocked with the numbers of Roofers who loose their lives. Please let's do something about this NOW",
