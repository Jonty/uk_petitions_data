The message was clear - make a complaint against a judge (which is everyone's right, is supposedly private and confidential) and you will regret it.\r\nHow deep does this corruption go? Is it possible to get a fair hearing at Cambridge County and Family Court? How many decisions are based on revenge? How can a fair hearing be possible?\r\nSack them all without pay. Investigate them and prosecute at least the 2 involved. There is no way of guaranteeing an impartial ruling. No confidence in Cambridge Court! Bias is rife!",
