        "additional_details": "The removal of the \"anti-homeless spikes\" that were recently added to certain areas of London.\r\n\r\nThe addition of these spikes is quite frankly disgusting and those involved in the introduction of such a method should be ashamed.\r\n\r\nThe homeless are people who we need to embrace and not neglect. They're not on the streets from choice but because somebody has let them down in a time of need.\r\n\r\nSign this petition now!",
