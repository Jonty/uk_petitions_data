This means that British children won't be reading stories such as 'Of Mice and Men' and 'To Kill a Mockingbird' which are some of the greatest novels ever written.\r\nJust because a novel was written in another country, doesn't mean that it isn't good.\r\nPlease sign this petition to stop some of the best books ever written exiting the curriculum of future generations.",
