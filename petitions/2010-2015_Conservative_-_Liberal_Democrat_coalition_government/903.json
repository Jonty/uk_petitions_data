Most carers work very long hours looking after the person for whom they are caring.\r\n\r\nMany carers suffer from financial poverty.\r\n\r\nIf there were no carers it would cost the Government billions of pounds to arrange for those needing personal care to be placed in residential care homes.\r\n\r\nIt is not acceptable that carers should contimue to receive so little official recognition for all the many hours each week that they are caring for the person needing their tender care.\r\n\r\nBy increasing the Carers' Allowance to a minimum of \u00a3150 per week this will go some way in alleviating the financial distresses  of the carer.\r\n\r\nThis increase in the weekly Carers' Allowance should not be means tested.",
