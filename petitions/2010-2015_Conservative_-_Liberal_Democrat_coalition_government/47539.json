        "additional_details": "Since the relaxation of the Pet Passport system in Jan 2012 there has been vast numbers of bulk imports of very young puppies into the UK for resale via pet shops and online. The youngest that pups can legally travel on Pet Passports is 15 weeks old. But by 15 weeks pups have lost most of their resale value \u2013 they are normally sold at 8 weeks. Channel 4 Dispatches exposed that underage pups are travelling on fake documents. These illegally imported pups risk our rabies free status. We ask the Government to reverse the 2012 relaxation for bulk imports of pups as it has been proven that our passport system is open to abuse. We ask Government to change commercial Pet Passports back to the pre January 2012 relaxation to protect out rabies free status before we experience an outbreak.",
