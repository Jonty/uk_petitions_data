        "additional_details": "We are against any future development of the existing CMA site on Wilmslow Road, Cheadle.\r\nThe CMA is situated in a village on a main junction.\r\nThe plans to increase the existing site from 503m2 to 1535m2.\r\n It has a devastating effect on the surrounding areas with damage to pavements , grass verges and causes driveways to be blocked, noise disturbance and serious traffic congestion which affects residents and local businesses.\r\nThe area simply cannot cope. To increase this adds further to the current issues and will attract people from outside the area as the votes \"for\" show.\r\nTo add a gym, a cafe and classrooms means the site will be busy at all times of the day and week.\r\nHealth & Safety of other road users, pedestrians and cyclists has been ignored for years.  None of the solutions to the current issues have been addressed over the past 8 years so to add to this is not viable.",
