        "action": "Do not reclassify e-cigarettes as medicinal products.",
        "additional_details": "\"In December, the European Commission released new proposals including a ban on menthol cigarettes & large health warnings covering 75 per cent of packets. Packs of fewer than 20 cigarettes & slims would also be banned, while e-cigarettes, which contain some nicotine, would only be authorised as medicinal products.\"\r\n\r\nThe proposals concerning e-cigarettes are made due to a lack of knowledge. Whilst containing variable levels of nicotine, this is the only resemblance they share with cigarettes. They contain no carcinogens, no tar & none of the chemicals hazardous to health. Thousands of smokers are using these as a way to reduce their addiction to nicotine with the aim of quitting entirely or to simply maintain their addiction but having made the conscious decision to avoid long term health damage.\r\n\r\nWe ask that when the UK government is voting on this they either propose an amendment or refuse to agree to the new rules & allow smokers to make a healthier choice.",
