They are sent to the front by Humans, who are not-so-dumb and not-so-courageous.\r\n\r\n\r\nVehicles cannot experience fear or pain. Unlike horses, they are immune to crowd pressure and to missiles. They also provide a more solid barrier.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe pride ourselves on our animal welfare and our technology. Why not combine the two and develop a vehicle to replace the horse for crowd control?",
