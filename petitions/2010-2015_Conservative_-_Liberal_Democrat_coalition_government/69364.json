        "additional_details": "After 307 years the United Kingdom is now in danger of being broken up. The lack of engagement from the parties in Westminster is a form of negligence to the voters in the wider UK and Scotland. The Prime Minister has spent a great deal of time combating the unlikely event of a federal Europe whilst ignoring the more urgent politics north of the border. As the author of this petition I call upon the Prime Minister to resign in the event of a Yes result on the morning of Friday 19th September by handing his resignation to the Queen in London.",
