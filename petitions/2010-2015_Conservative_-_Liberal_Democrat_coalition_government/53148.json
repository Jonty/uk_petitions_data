His sentence and conviction of 'libidinous behaviour' should be quashed.\r\n\r\nHe should be given a new fair trial that fully complies with national and European law, in particular: he should be told specifically what charge he is accused of, he should be allowed to choose and have unrestricted access to a lawyer, he should be allowed to examine the evidence against him and he should be allowed to call and cross examine witnesses, including the police officers involved in his case, so that he can properly defend himself, present his case and prove his innocence.",
