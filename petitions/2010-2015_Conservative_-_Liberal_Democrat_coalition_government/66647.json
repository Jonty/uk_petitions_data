        "additional_details": "The recently issues consultation documents on the future of rail services in the North of England proposes The removal of Safety Critical Conductors (Train Guards) from the current Northern Rail Franchise and leaves the option open to a new operator to do the spake with the current Transpennine Express Franchise.\r\n\r\nIt is important that Safety Critical Conductors are retained on trains services on both franchises. They provide a effective security presence on board trains for all passengers, carrying out \"emergency protection\" on running lines in the event of a incident; further taking on the emergency protection duties of the driver should they become incapacitated in the unfortunate event of a incident.\r\n\r\nSafety Critical Conductors also hold the required knowledge to summons assistance and help in times of trouble.\r\n\r\nWe want Safety Critical Conductors to be retained on both franchises.",
