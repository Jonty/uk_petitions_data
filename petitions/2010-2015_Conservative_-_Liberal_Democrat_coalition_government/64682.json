People who do chose to wear a helmet can still be at risk because of poor design and quality.\r\nPlease sign and keep our cyclists, of all ages safe. There have been previous petitions about this, the government use the same reason against every time. \"there is already a petition on this subject\". None have amounted to anything.",
