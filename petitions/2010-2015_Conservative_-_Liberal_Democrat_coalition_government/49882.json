Only the company can.\r\nThe customer can continually complain to their bank, and as this is a 'retail dispute', their money will be reimbursed. But this is not a solution. If the company chooses to ignore the customer the money continues to be taken.\r\n\r\nThe companies should only be allowed to use the cards for the original purpose. If there is a mistake, and after the customer has made a complaint it is reused - it should be treated Fraud, not a retail dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
