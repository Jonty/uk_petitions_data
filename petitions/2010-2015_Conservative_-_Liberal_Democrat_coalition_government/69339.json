        "additional_details": "Each year, 200,000 people are estimated to be bitten by dogs including 6,000 emergency hospital admissions for dog bites (around 100 savage dog attacks per week).\r\n\r\nIt has been estimated that up to 28,000 facial injuries are caused by dogs each year and a significant proportion of children are affected. This does not even include the impact of dogs creating fear and apprehension in others.\r\n\r\nAlong with the impact on lives, these injuries are an unnecessary economic burden on the health system.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore suggested that ALL dogs, regardless of breed should be muzzled (at the owners expense) outside of the home including in any environment in which they may escape into a public area.\r\n\r\nThe loss of 'little rovers' mandible freedom seems a fair exchange for the cost (financial, physical and psychological) of the damage being done to humans.\r\n\r\nThe petition asks the Department of Health to put Children first and Dogs second and seek legislation to ensure this happens.",
