        "additional_details": "With the Emirates Air Line cable car gathering dust and enjoying sub 20 passengers  using the service regularly, perhaps the mayor and the department of transport should consider relocating the service to somewhere more useful and with better footfall. This petition suggests Oxford Street, so that shoppers can quickly travel the length of the street, without needing to navigate the crowds. Shops could also set up special disembarking stations for passengers to quickly jump off the cable car and enjoy their favourite retail environment.\r\n\r\nAdded benefits to the advertiser are better visibility, and to the city, better return on investment.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to make this a reality!",
