Some have very high powerd engines up 2.5 litre and that coupled with very light body is dangerous abve 100km. It would also reduce fuel emissions and make our roads safer for our children and older persons in our communites and will stop the people getting killed and will stop familys getting wreck by spped of these vehicle.  I have hel a PCV Licence for over 30 years and see these vans cutting people up. vans speed to much on our road\r\n\r\n",
