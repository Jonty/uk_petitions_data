When walking our dog on her lead along with our 9 month old baby on a children\u2019s park our dog was torn apart by an unsupervised dog. Over a 3 week period she has under gone 3 life threatening operations. I would like to emphasize any dog of any size can be dangerous in the wrong hands and it was NOT a Staffordshire Bull Terrier that attacked us. We want a host of measures to be implemented to tackle irresponsible dog owners including a dog licence, formal registry of owners and dogs, training for police to help them implement new law,more dog legislation officers and dog wardens, tougher penalties/prison sentences for dog on dog or dog on people attacks, DNA testing, sticker breeding laws. Please help us in our campaign to prevent potentially dangerous dogs attacking and to ensure irresponsible owners do not escape penalty or accountability. Thanks for all support.",
