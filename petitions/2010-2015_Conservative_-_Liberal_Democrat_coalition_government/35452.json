It is bad enough that the both the bus and train industry have increased ticket pricing massively in the past 3 years (example. Child return on a train used to be 1.35 now to the same destination it is 1.70 and probably more in the near future) it is to harsh for prices such as these to be set on students who make poor amount of money through part time jobs etc. I am not saying to lower the prices but please charge ticket types appropriately!",
