        "additional_details": "Currently anyone claiming for personal injury has up to three years to do so, I personally believe this length of time is over the top and should be reduced to six months.\r\nI work for a large car insurer and I work in the personal injury department paying out thousands of people who we are unable to prove if they where injured or not!!\r\nThe average personal injury claim costs car insurance companies \u00a36115 per claimant and our insurance is sky high because of our nations lack of tolerance towards this.\r\nIf we could reduce this length of time, we could reduce our car insurance premiums.\r\nThank you and please sign this petition",
