        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the government to ensure that legendary broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Frederick Attenborough is honoured with a state funeral in the event of his death.\r\n\r\nThere are very view public figures who do not divide opinion, but Sir David is most certainly one. In a career spanning over 60 years he has done more than anyone to advance the public's understanding of and passion for the natural world and its role in protecting it. Furthermore, as controller of BBC2, he commissioned Monty Python's Flying Circus and The Old Grey Whistle Test among others, and oversaw the channel's pioneering move to colour in 1967.\r\n\r\nSir David is a great British hero of the modern era and, whenever he tragically passes, the government of the day must ensure he is honoured accordingly.",
