Clearly visible NUMBERS or ALPHABETICAL identifiers MUST be provided so that the police organisation cannot mount the defence 'we can't prove which one of them did it' when somebody is illegally mistreated or killed by the rogue actions of one of the members of this organisation.  Recent history has demonstrated that this sort of event IS GOING TO HAPPEN, not 'maybe going to happen'.",
