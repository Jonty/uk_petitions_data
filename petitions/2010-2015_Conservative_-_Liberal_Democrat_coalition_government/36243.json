WHY? because this GOVERNMENT and their partner G4S have botched the security of the most prestigious\r\nevent in recent history, The OLYMPIC GAMES.\r\n\r\nAlso note our government taking its annual leave without a second thought.\r\n\r\narmed forces to cover the security of the games, OUTRAGEOUS\r\nARMED FORCES PERSONNEL BEING HOUSED IN A DISUSED WAREHOUSE,\r\nMORE TROOPS AT THE GAMES, THAN IN AFGHANISTAN,\r\nTROOPS LIVING ON ARMY RATIONS,\r\nEMPLOYEES OF G4S OFFERED HOTEL  ACCOMODATION,\r\nTROOPS LOSING  ONE OR TWO WEEKS LEAVE\r\nHAVING TO CANCEL HOLIDAYS, WEDDINGS, ETC.\r\n\r\nTotally unjust to expect our troops to pick up the pieces at such short notice.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT need to think seriously regarding a Bonus payment for the sacrifices being made by these service men and women.
