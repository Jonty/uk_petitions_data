        "additional_details": "Sign this e-petition if you believe that the jumps in price between different categories for road tax are too steep and should be lowered.\r\n\r\nFor example a 2005 Mazda RX8 is currently \u00a3270 for 12 months, and a 2007 Mazda RX8 with the same engine is \u00a3470 for 12 months. To double the price for a slightly higher CO'2 emission is not fair.\r\n\r\nSo please sign if you wish the government to make the costs more reasonably staged",
