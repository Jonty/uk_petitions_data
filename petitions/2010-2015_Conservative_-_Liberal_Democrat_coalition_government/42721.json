        "additional_details": "Mounting pressure on the Kenya Govt/IEBC to respect democracy and to do more that can be dimmed \u2018progressive\u2019 not to disenfranchise the majority Diaspora.\r\n\r\nKenya Cabinet ruling cited financial and time constraints as the reasons for denying the Diaspora their sacrosanct rights to vote. However, following the backlash from exasperated individuals and groups affected by this decision; their line changed to now allowing the Diaspora in East Africa.\r\n\r\nA lot of mischief can be read from these inconsistent government decisions passed within a week on such a serious matter of its citizen\u2019s right.\r\n\r\nThe idea of locking out Kenyans Diaspora outside Africa and in retrospect of the IEBC\u2019s promises to those in US and EU; it\u2019s damn retrogressive and thus represents a step backwards in marginalizing citizens whose contribution through their remittances greatly leverages the country\u2019s economy.\r\n\r\nDon't let Kenya turn back the clock on this revolutionary Diaspora right to vote.\r\n",
