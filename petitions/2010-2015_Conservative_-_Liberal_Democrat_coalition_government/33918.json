        "additional_details": "As the rate of climate change quickens and weather patterns are becoming increasingly uncertain, developing countries are facing extensive flooding, erosion of precious agricultural land and loss of water supplies.  It is these countries that suffer, though the activities causing such problems are centred largely in the western world.\r\nThough we can't all make global changes, we can help reduce emissions in our everyday life by travelling by rail rather than car.  However, people living in smaller towns are limited by the lack of rail journeys.\r\nThus, the government must improve the rail service outside of the major cities in order to encourage this public transport use to meet emission targets.  More frequent services are imperative.",
