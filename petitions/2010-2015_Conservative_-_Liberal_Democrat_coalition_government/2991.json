        "additional_details": "Despite the unprecedented post world war cuts that are now facing the country, the foreign aid budget is set to rapidly increase over the coming years.\r\n\r\nIt has been proven that this budget contains an abundance of waste. Why should we be giving money to India and Pakistan when they can afford the luxury of nuclear weapons research and development?\r\n\r\nOur over-stretched and hard worked military is facing scathing cuts to it budget which could leave our valiant soldiers, who are sacrificing their lives for this county in Afghanistan, facing redundancy. How can this possibly be fair?\r\n\r\nCharity starts at home, and this budget, at the very least, should be frozen over the coming years.",
