        "additional_details": "Joseph is originally from South Africa and has been in England for almost 10 years in October. He got married last year to Martha. They applied at the beginning of the year for a spousal visa as his current visa was due to expire. Mistakenly Joseph ticked a box to say that he was from a majority English speaking country. His visa application was refused to the devastation of his wife and himself, as he learnt, South Africa is not considered a majority English speaking country by the UK government. Despite English being his mother tongue and having an A-level, B grade in English Language and Literature, this was not considered substantial enough evidence that he had enough knowledge of the English language as it is not on the list of required evidence. They have lost their appeal and appeal to the Upper Tribunal.\r\n",
