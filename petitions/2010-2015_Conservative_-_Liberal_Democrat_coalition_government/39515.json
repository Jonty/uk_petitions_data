        "additional_details": "\r\nPlease consider the other key reason behind the Euro crisis besides debt - namely exchange rates, which have been \"fixed\" since inception within the Eurozone viz a viz each component country.  It is argued that the 17 members of Eurozone cannot co-exist with one single currency as events have proved.\r\n\r\nPlease consider freeing up member countries by creating a 3-tier Euro. It is proposed that the members be divided into 3 groups - (1) the strong, mainly northern countries; (2) the weak, mainly those commonly referred to as PIIGS; and (3) the remainder in between. It is proposed that over a weekend the Euro 1, 3 and 2 respectively be introduced with Euro2 having the current exchange rate against other currencies. For each 3 Euros presently held all holders will receive 1 of each new Euro. The initial rates for Euro 1 and 3 will be set by agreement and the market allowed to determine these going forward.\r\n\r\nThis will be to provide a structure with a chance of delivering stability\r\n",
