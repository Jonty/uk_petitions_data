        "additional_details": "The Petition calls for the return of Police Officers (as opposed to Community Officers or the like) to once again patrol our streets on foot, with Officers assigned to their own areas where they can once again re connect on a grass roots level to their communities.\r\nWith the Current situation our Police force is too attached to blazing through our streets at 90 miles an hour to the scene of a crime that might have been prevented had they been in the vicinity on foot in the first place.\r\n I think its not much to ask in a society such as ours to find the money towards this, we used to be able to do it i'm sure we can find a way again.\r\n We need to use our police force to PREVENT crime as opposed to just bringing perpetrators to justice , otherwise there just glorified CCTV and i think you'll agree in this country we've got that well covered. After the recent appalling riots , it was more than a small mercy to once again see our police patrolling the streets back where they belong.",
