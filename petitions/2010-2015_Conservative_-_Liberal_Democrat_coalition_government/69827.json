        "additional_details": "We object to the proposed development on the grounds that it does not comply with the Government's \"Planning practice guidance for renewable and low carbon energy\", in that it will adversely affect the adjacent Lake District National Park.\r\nThe development will be visible from many of the fell peaks within the Park and its environs, and will materially detract from the views. Tourism is a major employer in the surrounding area and inappropriate developments such as the large scale solar \"farm\" will adversely impact what is a heritage asset, visited by thousands. No amount of screening can mask the visual impact of so many acres of solar panels that can be seen from the fell heights.\r\nWhen combined with the adjacent wind \"farm\", this is an unacceptable development in all the terms of the Government Guidance, and should be rejected by Allerdale District Council planning department, and if appealed, by the Planning Inspectors.\r\n",
