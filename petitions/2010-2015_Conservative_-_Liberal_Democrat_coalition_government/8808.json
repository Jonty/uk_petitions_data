This is a lot more than the average person lives on.\r\n\r\nWe would like to see prisoners forced to work 40 hours per week whilst in prison. We need to stop offenders seeing prison as a badge of honour. If they refuse to work they should have all benefits stripped of them. The money generated by them will then be put back into the communities that they offended against thereby helping reduce the cost of their actions to society.",
