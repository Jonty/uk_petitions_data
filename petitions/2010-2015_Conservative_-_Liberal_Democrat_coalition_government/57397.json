        "additional_details": "By introducing a \"None of the Above\" option we would encourage those who were less likely to vote for any party or spoil their ballot paper to take part in the democratic process.\r\n\r\nThis would improve flagging voter turnout and reveal a much more accurate representation of the public's political orientation.\r\n\r\nIt would also nullify the basic premise that those who do not vote/spoil their ballot are simply apathetic, thus requiring no more analysis or discussion.\r\n\r\nOverall, it would strengthen the public's faith in UK democratic processes, inspire a greater voter turnout, and encourage members of parliament to feel a greater sense of accountability and duty to their constituents.\r\n\r\n",
