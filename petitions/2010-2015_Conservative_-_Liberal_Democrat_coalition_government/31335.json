That\u2019s less than half the adult population and just over a quarter of the total population of the UK.\r\n\r\nIs it fair that a Government produced from a Hung Parliament has so much power to make such drastic change to what belongs to Society?\r\n\r\nI put forward that a Ministry of Public Service be developed as a cross party board of ethics to Govern UK Public Services and produce policy and legislation that\u2019s best for society not just one Political Party\u2019s ideology.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry would be responsible for the commissioning of ALL UK Public Services.\r\n",
