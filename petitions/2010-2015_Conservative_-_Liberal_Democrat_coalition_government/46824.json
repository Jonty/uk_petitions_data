        "additional_details": "The European Parliament has debated a scheme called the Youth Guarantee. Similar to the Youth Contact this scheme would seek to make an offer of employment, training or education to any person under the age of 25 who has been out of work for four months.\r\n\r\nPart of the scheme funding will be supported by EU funds which will be reinforced by a new initiative making \u20ac6 billion available for the period 2014-2020. It will help regions with youth unemployment rates above 25 % to take steps to boost youth employment. Half of that amount will be allocated from the European Social Fund, the other half from a dedicated youth employment budget line.\r\n\r\nYour signature will make the difference to eradicate youth unemployment.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n",
