        "additional_details": "I dislike the idea of the TV licence. You are only paying to watch the BBC as the other channels make their money from advertising and sponsors.\r\nI think the BBC should be urged to do the same. That way we can watch the BBC without worrying about the licence.\r\nHowever I think that adverts should only be shown BETWEEN the shows (not during). If you are watching a film for example, you could (during the break) forget what has happened if the ad break is long enough. If there is no break it will be easier to follow what is going on.\r\nSo get all the channels to advertise but before and after the shows not during.  ",
