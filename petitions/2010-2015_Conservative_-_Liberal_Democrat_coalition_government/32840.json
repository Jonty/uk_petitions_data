        "additional_details": "It is common knowledge that many animals are being threatened with extinction including some that used to live here. In fifty years time, or even less, we may not have the oppurtunity to save them and their habitat. That is why I propose an experiment to see how foreign animals that used to be native to this country would cope living in some of the wilds and parks of the UK.",
