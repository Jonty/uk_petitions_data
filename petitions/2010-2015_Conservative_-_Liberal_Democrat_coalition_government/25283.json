In HG Wells's 1898 masterpiece The War of the Worlds, Mars is an older world than Earth that has been dying over time.\r\n\r\nI dont believe we should look further than 100 Million light years, at least until our technoligy develops. It's causing to much hastle and if we do find Extraterrestrial life, the world would panic and it would turn to chaos. Thanks you for reading.",
