        "additional_details": "We are facing closure due to the unfair termination of our funding contract. We have successfully worked with young people for years and have never been told we are less than good not only from our last OFSTED but also many people that we worked with,ex-learners, parents, awarding bodies, employers, police and others in the community. Many believe we provide an excellent much needed service to young people.\r\nThe policy put in place following inspection states private training providers that get an inadequate grading will cease to receive funding from the EFA. We have been victim of this; we are complaining about the grading ,before it is even acknowledged have been told we have no future contract.  A huge injustice and the beginning of a gloomy road for many young people.\r\nThis will have a huge impact on many disadvantaged young people,where mainstream education is not suitable. Please support us to challenge this unfair process that has far reaching consequences for our community\r\n\r\n",
