It has vested interests & malicious intent. It is disliked by masses.\r\nThe last nail in their coffin is telecasting disrespectful statements/sentiments against pristine religious personalities, values & entities which are immensely sacred to Muslim Ummah.\r\nThis is intolerable & unacceptable to all Pakistanis as well as muslims across the world.\r\nWe demand that all transmissions & publications of Geo & Jang be stopped with immediate effect.\r\n",
