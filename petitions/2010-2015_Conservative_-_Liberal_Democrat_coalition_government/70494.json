Can we have Canadian style privatly funded police force looking after dog fouling, groups of teens, illegal motor bikes(like the ones being ridden around our playing fields) drunken behavior, basically lots of those absolute offences we see daily without correction. We need a force to catch and punish the offenders with fines so the police force runs at a minor profit. This system works well in canada Medicine hat use this system leaving the POLICE to deal with major crimes. ",
