        "additional_details": "The government should introduce a penalty tax for any business operating within the UK which outsources work to foreign countries. The tax is to be equal to the Job seekers allowance times the number of employees in the non UK country. This is to encourage companies to keep their staffing needs within this country and cut UK unemployment. Where companies prefer to pay a tax outsourcing to keep departments outside the UK, the money should be used to pay benefits to unemployed people created by their outsourcing policy.",
