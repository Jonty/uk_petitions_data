I have faced constant battles with the schools and LEA getting makaton taught to staff and pupils, so my child is able to communicate and be included. I have constant battles & stress, when the statement is constantly ignored & my daughter does not receive the correct provision.\r\nMakaton is important for all children to enable them as they grow to be included in society & to be able to communicate. Imagine if we are all taught basic makaton, we can communicate every day in the shops, hospitals, restaurants with those less able and make sure that ALL are included ",
