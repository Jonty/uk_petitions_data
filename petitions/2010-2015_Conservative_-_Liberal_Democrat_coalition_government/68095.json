        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson has said on the Guardian (see link below) that 'Radicalisation should be treated as child abuse' and I concur. As I'm sure many others do.\r\n\r\nIn the article he argues, and rightly so, that Muslim children for example that suffer from radicalisation as a result of their parents should be removed from them taken in to care. In the same way that children sexually or physically abused, or neglected etc are taken into care.\r\n\r\nThis petition does not wish to single out specific religious groups but to eliminate specific behaviours by certain religious people that inflict harm on their very children that we should all want to strive to see protected. Support Boris's sentiment and make this happen and let's make Britain and the rest of the world a better place by reducing the net suffering for children.\r\n\r\nLink: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/03/boris-johnson-radicalisation-child-abuse\r\n\r\n",
