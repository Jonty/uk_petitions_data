I strongly believe that to play for your country should be an honour and not a paid.job! To this end i suggest any football player chosen to play for their country ,  taking into account their very large salaries at club level, should do so as unpaid(notwithstanding reasonable expenses). Performance related pay does not justify their performance!!! ",
