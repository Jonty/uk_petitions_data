Leave the system that's in place for free school meals as it is. It's getting rediculous, we already have breakfast clubs! Next we're be providing their evening meal before they leave the school gates!  What's this going to cost the taxpayer, particularly in times of austerity? When I was at school, parents would be ashamed to allow their child to go to school without breakfast. Now people are boasting about the amount they receive in money and subsidies just for having children.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time and trouble to read this.",
