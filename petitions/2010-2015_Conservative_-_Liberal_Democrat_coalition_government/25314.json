        "additional_details": "Many patients seek much needed help from their GPS for mental health issues. Most of the time, they only prescribe tablets rather than treat the route of the problem as thats all they are qualified to do. If a patient is lucky, they may be given a number for Talking Therapies. Much of the time, patients desperatly need secondary care for this, not primary care.\r\nGPS get four weeks training in mental health out of all thier years of study. Many do not understand how vital it is to refer their patients for the appropriate care at the first instant to prevent further problems and illness. Tablets shouldnt be handed out as light heartedly and patients have the right to get the correct referal. The majority of the time this does not happen. This is because all the GPS know what to do with their knowledge is to prescribe tablets.\r\nFurther training needs to be carried out for GPS on mental health so patients can get the care they are entitlted to",
