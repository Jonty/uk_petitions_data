        "additional_details": "When one reads about people suing the over stretched NHS for large sums of money one tends to feel that the money that is awarded is taken away from the genuinely needy, vital operations and life saving drugs. Leslie Ash winning \u00a35million compensation is a good example of a high NHS pay out awarded when she contracted MRSA in 2004.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to suggest a maximum that can be awarded by the NHS for damages during surgery and /or a hospital stay, and a sliding scale for less serious outcomes. To balance this people could take out additional hospital insurance, like travel insurance, before going into an operation to cover any mistakes and to receive a higher payout than a maximum that should be set by the NHS.\r\n\r\nI would like your support for this petition to take the financial strain off the NHS, but still to protect the people affected by any accidents.
