Benefits should be earned by those who are physically able to work but are not in employment and claiming assistance (even those with children).\r\n\r\nDuring the normal working week, those claiming benefits who do not have jobs should have to spend a set amount of hours working towards making Britain a better place. Community projects, street cleaning, charity work, caring for the elderly, building affordable housing, community police work, helping with Olympic events, etc...\r\n\r\nIf they won't do the work - they shouldnt get any financial assistance.\r\n\r\nWorking within the community whilst actively searching for work will also help benefit claimants build up their CV's and self esteem and get them back on the road to full time employment.\r\n\r\nEverybody wins.",
