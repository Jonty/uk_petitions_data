        "additional_details": "The most dangerous environment which most citizens encounter is use of the public highway. Every year people are killed and injured in road traffic incidents caused by caravans overturning. The only approach to improve road safety is to MOT test caravans, linked to a tax charge as thier use causes large increases in pollution. Any driver of a caravan towing vehicle which is involved in an incident must surely also be required to take, or re-take the caravan towing section of the driving test.",
