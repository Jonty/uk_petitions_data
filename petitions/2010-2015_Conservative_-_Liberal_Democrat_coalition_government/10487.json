        "additional_details": "Too many TV shows, news articles etc. show that those arrested for drunk and disordely offences tend to spend a night in jail and get off with a warning and/or an \u00a380 fine. This does not come close to covering the cost of policing that incident, does not act as a deterrent for inappropriate behaviour and ultimately costs taxpayers millions in Policing and NHS bills. There is also the issue that officers dealing with these yobs are taken away from dealing with other issues on our streets\r\n\r\nIf arrested for drunk and disordely behaviour, a harder and less tolerant example should be set and a minimum fine of 500 should be handed out for every offence. If the person can not pay then the bailiffs should be sent in",
