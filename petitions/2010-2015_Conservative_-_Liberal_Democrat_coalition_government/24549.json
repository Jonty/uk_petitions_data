        "additional_details": "The Public Sector and Unions are demanding that the rest of the country HAVE TO continue funding their unaffordable Pensions.\r\nThis petition is aimed at giving a voice to the unheard majority and ask, through a referendum, whether the Private sector is happy to pay for these pensions. The Public Sector do some of the most valued job roles in this country but should the status quo be maintained. Let the majority decide and democracy take place.  If the majority decide one way or another then each side has no argument to either not support the Public Pensions at current rates or go on strike.  Use a referendum to draw a line under this and move on as endless strikes punish all and solve little.",
