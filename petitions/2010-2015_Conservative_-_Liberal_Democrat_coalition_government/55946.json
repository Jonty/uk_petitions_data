        "additional_details": "Hip Dysplasia, is the medical term for instability, or looseness, of the hip joint. Approximately 1 in 20 full-term babies has some hip instability. 2-3% will require treatment. Persistent hip instability is a silent childhood condition that frequently causes disability and arthritis in adults. Early diagnosis and simple treatment is the best solution, but many cases go undetected. Undetected Hip Dysplasia can lead to complicated, invasive, surgical treatments, costing the NHS thousands of pounds. Hip Dysplasia can be detected by routine examination, but is often missed and an ultrasound scan or x-ray is then necessary to confirm a diagnosis. Please support this e-petition to ensure every baby is scanned at birth for Hip Dysplasia \u2013 regardless of family history. Scan every child at birth. It will save the NHS money and make treatment simpler. It would save thousands of children the heartache of traumatic, complex surgical procedures which may have been avoided by this early detection.",
