        "additional_details": "For the sake of every sexually abused person who has had to live with the shame of being sexually exploited. The UK need to give tougher sentencing to reflect this heinous crime. To forcefully take a young persons dignity and virtue is a serious crime that needs to be sentenced with clear hard consequences. The victims are not expendable, they are a son or a daughter that should have the right to be safe from sexual predators. Rolf Harris used his position of power to exploit these young victims and the UK needs to ensure that sentencing these criminals must reflect that as a nation we are there to protect our children. Rolf Harris's sentence should be extended for the crimes he has committed.",

If you believe a sentence given in a Crown Court appears to be very low, or unduly lenient, anyone can contact the Attorney General's office asking for the sentence to be reviewed as long as it is within 28 days of sentencing. It also only takes one person to make such a request.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Rolf Harris Gill the Attorney General\u2019s Office has already requested the papers from the Crown Prosecution so one of the Law Officers can decide whether or not to refer the sentences to Court of Appeal as being unduly lenient."
