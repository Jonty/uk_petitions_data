        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, believe that innocent people are being convicted of serious crimes using the law of Joint Enterprise and are receiving life sentences for crimes they did not commit, played no part in, and had no foresight or knowledge to prevent them happening.\r\n We believe this law is now being misused against hundreds of innocent men, women and children. They are not guilty, so this law must either be abolished or alternatively seriously amended before it starts to affect even more innocent people. In the interest of Justice, past Joint Enterprise convictions need to be urgently reviewed so that the innocent no longer need to suffer.",
