As a mental health sufferer, I am examined by someone who is trained by ATOS as a healthcare professional. These peope are paid extra money to take people off benefits. I feel it would be better if proper doctors were to do the examinations. My own doctor knows me, better than a person who meets me for 15 minutes. So my petition would be for a person's own doctor to do the medical examination.",
