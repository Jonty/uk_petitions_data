        "additional_details": "Since approx the 1960s, there has been a decline in respect from school age children. Reports of increased aggressiveness, bullying & a trend towards selfishness driven by the commercialisation of society (e.g 2011 riots).\r\n\r\nAlso, pupils may only have 2 weeks work-experience. How can a child at a relatively immature stage of their life be expected to decide (& know!) what would be a good career choice?\r\n\r\nI propose a change to the typical schooling (week) system, split into 4 parts. These can be varied by time, depending on needs.\r\n\r\n(1) Core subjects (Numeracy, Literacy, Eng, Maths,\r\n                           Science, etc)\r\n(2) Sport\r\n\r\n(3) Spiritual Living (esoteric values, service to others,\r\n                            manners, family life etc)\r\n\r\n(4) Work place experience (skills valuable for the\r\n                           workplace, guest speakers from\r\n                           industry, time spent on weekly\r\n                           basis in a job)\r\n\r\n",
