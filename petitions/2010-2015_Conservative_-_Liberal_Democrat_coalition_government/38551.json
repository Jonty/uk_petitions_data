        "additional_details": "Enough of the nail bars, phone shops, hair salons and strip clubs! Bring a cinema back to the deserving people of Ripley!\r\n\r\nThe Hippodrome in Ripley, Derbyshire once served as a cinema. It closed and became a night club that, quite frankly, is just not needed. There are lots of bars and clubs in and around Ripley, but no cinema. This leaves a lot of would be customers having no choice but to travel elsewhere to view the latest blockbusters and, more often than not, at a high price too. (Bus costs are not cheap these days.)\r\n\r\nBring Ripley a cinema again and the town and it's economy will have a wonderful boost. Not only will more people stay in and around the town more, it will also make use of the space that is appearing from all the disused shops and buildings popping up everywhere.",
