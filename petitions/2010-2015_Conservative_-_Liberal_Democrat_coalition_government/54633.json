        "additional_details": "This petition calls for parliament to pass a motion to approve funding for large infrastructure projects only if the cost to benefit ratio of a particular project exceeds all other alternative projects. Where a similar competing project delivers greater value for money and or achieves the same return to taxpayers for a lower initial expenditure then this scheme should be given priority. The aim of the petition is to ensure that the government delivers the greatest possible return  for tax payers money and this should apply to infrastructure schemes with a cost in excess of \u00a310bn which are already approved by parliament in addition to new projects.
