It is shameful of our society that people exhibiting this type of behaviour are at present not accountable for their actions. There is adequate cctv to hopefully identify offenders who should be prosecuted for 'goading' or actively aiding a suicide by verbal means, as there are now laws about 'trolling'  No form of bullying or crowd coercion to persuade a desperate suicidal person to kill themselves should be tolerated in a humane society",
