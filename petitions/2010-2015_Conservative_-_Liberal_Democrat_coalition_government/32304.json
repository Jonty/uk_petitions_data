        "additional_details": "The recommendation by Frances Maude that people should store petrol in jerry cans in case of a petrol tanker drivers strike and shortages of petrol as a result, caused not only panic buying of petrol, but put people's health and safety at risk.\r\n\r\nSuch a contemptuous attitude towards health and safety, and lack of responsibilty and judgement; is not the behaviour expected from a seniour government official.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the serious injuries suffered by a member of the public as she decanted petrol at home, only 2 days following his statement, is a further endictment of Maude' statement.\r\n\r\nWe therefore call for him to do the decent thing and resign. If he does not, we call on the Prime Minister to sack him.",
