        "additional_details": "I see no reason why cannabis would not be legal. It has been proven that is is less harmful and addictive than the three most commonly used legal drugs (alcohol, nicotine and caffeine). It should be made legal and taxed just as cigarettes would be. Allow companies to make and sell a packet of 10 cannbis cigarettes, the government could tax it exactly the same as they do with cigarettes , and (despite what most think) provide another healthy alternative to smoking regular tobacco products. Think about it, if cannabis was legal, and if not already, it could be one of the richest industries in the world. And this way, we could bring in more money for schools, hospitals, fire and police services and so much more. Please, just strongly consider this.",
