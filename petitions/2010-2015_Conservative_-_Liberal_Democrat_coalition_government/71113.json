        "additional_details": "A change in the law for failure to stop. Many bikers are hit and killed by car drivers who then flee the scene of the accident, The law needs a mandatory starting point of 5 years for these dangerous individuals who have no regard for other road users and many times flee because they are drunk, uninsured, unlicensed,driving un roadworthy or stolen vehicles the list is endless. With this charge more drivers may stop and give the vital help needed to their victims instead of driving off and hiding like cowards.",
