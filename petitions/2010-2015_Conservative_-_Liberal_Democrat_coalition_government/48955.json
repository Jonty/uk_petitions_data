The particular issue with this arises in the lack of a regulatory body or ombudsman to oversee their relationship with UK citizens.\r\n\r\nAs it stands PayPal are able to freeze accounts, block transactions, hold personal data after permission is withdrawn, take money at will, financially link unrelated parties and more. No other financial institution, business or operator is given such power without regulation.\r\n\r\nAt a minimum their should be an independent dispute resolution committee established.\r\n\r\nProtect your rights, your money and your data.",
