        "additional_details": "Whilst country's such as America, Russia, China etc. Invest in space programs the UK is sitting on the sidelines. America has built the first spaceport intended for commercial use which companies such as Virgin Galactic can use which creates jobs, other countries such as Sweden and the United Arab Emirates are showing interest in hosting the next spaceports which can take away chances of the UK getting chosen meaning job opportunity's will be lost, also building a spaceport will futher reinforce our role as a leading, important nation if we are able to embrace the space age.",
