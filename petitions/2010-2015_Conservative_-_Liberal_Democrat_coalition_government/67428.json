        "additional_details": "Reverse the amendments to the term time family holiday rules under The Education came into force on 1 September 2013\r\nWhy the government have such control over what we can and cannot do with our children. Families should be able to enjoy time together whenever they desire and not be criminalised for wanting to enjoy an annual family holiday. Holidays can be educational, experiencing new cultures and emotional bonding.\r\nTake Action:\r\nBring back the 10 day allowance which I believe to be an amicable decision to accommodate and support children and their family\u2019s needs. I agreed that fines may be applicable for poor attendance, truancy and anything over the 10 days allowance.\r\nProvide evidence for the stated belief that \u2018pupils are most successful when they follow an uninterrupted programme of study\u2019 I don\u2019t find this decision acceptable on beliefs alone. One word \u2013 strikes!\r\nWork on lowering holidays prices.\r\nOUR CHILDREN, OUR DECISION\r\n",
