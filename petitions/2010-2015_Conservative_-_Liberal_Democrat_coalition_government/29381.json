        "additional_details": "Responsible department: Foreign and Commonwealth Office\r\n\r\nAs British citizens of Syrian origin, we are concerned about the pressures exerted on the British government to expel Syrian diplomats.\r\nTo start with, we believe that dialogue and proactive engagement are the best means to influence events in Syria and not isolation or expulsion of diplomats.\r\nOver the last seven years the current diplomatic mission have proved to be the most successful in bringing the Syrian communities in the UK (over 12000) together and still support all Syrians in the UK regardless of political affiliation and hence we believe any expulsion will have negative effects on any efforts the Syrian communities are making to build bridges and dialogue channels with Syria.\r\nWhat Syrian needs is British expertise regarding governance and sustainable reforms.\r\nWe hope your department will continue to adopt a path of dialogue and engagement with the Syrian people and their representatives.",
