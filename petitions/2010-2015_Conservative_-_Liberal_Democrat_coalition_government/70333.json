        "additional_details": "\r\nTransport for 16-18 year olds has been axed including disabled students. However it is a legal requirement that young people stay in education until their 18th birthday.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of these new transport funding cuts it is going to cost  a family  \u00a3600 per year to travel to the education venue.\r\n\r\n Many parents are transporting children themselves impacting on them economically  and on their own employment as well as impacting on the independence  of the young person and practising this skill during the transition to adulthood.\r\n\r\n This is  discriminating against young  people  who cannot physically get on a bus or walk to school as other students do.\r\n\r\nIf education is free and compulsary then transport to it should be funded.\r\n\r\n We are asking for the same opportunities to access education as all young people of this age. Transport directorates are operating within government guidelines, therefore we submit this to central government. ",
