        "additional_details": "Her Majesty's Government should introduce legislation to combat the ever growing problem of e-waste. As the rate people replace electronic goods increases.\r\n\r\nI suggest we do this by making it mandatory for every electrical or electronic good sold in the UK to have clear labelling of what it contains and the most efficient ways to recycle them.\r\n\r\nFor example fluorescent light bulbs need to publish which vapours are in them.\r\n\r\nI propose something akin to the nutritional values table on food containing percentages of valuable feedstocks, ores and other chemicals that can be viably extracted.\r\n\r\nBacked up by a open central database where every model of device has a unique identifier and manufacturers can upload schematics of safe dismantling and where the higher concentrations of valuable and dangerous chemicals are and recycling companies can share the best most efficient methods of extraction.
