Around 2500 people will die this year alone in the UK from mesothelioma.\r\n\r\nUnlike many other cancer diseases, mesothelioma and the other asbestos diseases, have received negligible amounts of public money for research purposes.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the Government to:\r\n\r\nProvide dedicated long-term funding for research into the causes, treatment, and potential cure of those diseases related to exposure from asbestos.",
