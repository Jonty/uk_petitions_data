With the current pay freezes/cuts, high inflation, recent VAT increase and the general squeeze on household incomes, this will have a significant negative impact on young families who are already paying for the failures of the banking sector and the excesses of previous generations. A minimum household joint income should be used and I would suggest this is set at \u00a3100,000. ",
