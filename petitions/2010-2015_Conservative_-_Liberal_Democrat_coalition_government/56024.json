        "additional_details": "We have THOUSANDS of convicted criminals who have contributed nothing and continue to contribute nothing to their wonderful way of life.  No daily trudge to the food bank for them, no angst over whether to put the heating on or buy something for the kids to eat.  Present day pensioners will be the last to fully contribute towards the pension they receive so they should NOT be persecuted so that more can be handed over to those who have not contributed.  The budget for care of convicted prisoners should be slashed to cover the wages of prison guards and nothing else.  Prisoners should NOT be kept in comparative luxury at the expense of pensioners.",
