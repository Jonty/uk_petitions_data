        "additional_details": "Thanks George Osborne for announcing the long awaited stamp duty reforms on 03/12/14 as part of the Autumn statement. This was long due.\r\n\r\nI'm happy for the prospective new home buyers, but as a home buyer who exchanged contract in September 2014 & paid a hefty & unfair stamp duty fees of \u00a39060, I am also furious! Like many home buyers, I have been robbed off \u00a33960 for excess stamp duty fees.\r\n\r\nDo you have a plan to refund me this money or do I have to get into a long legal battle against this unfair system of retrospectively changing the stamp duty fees overnight!!\r\n\r\nDo you buy a house overnight to change the stamp duty fees overnight? I do not enjoy a fat salary like most MPs would do. \u00a33960 is big amount for me.\r\n\r\nObviously you were planning this for months, why did you have to keep all the home buyers in the dark? Autumn statement needs to come in Autumn & not in Winter!\r\n\r\nPls refund overpaid stamp duty.\r\n",
