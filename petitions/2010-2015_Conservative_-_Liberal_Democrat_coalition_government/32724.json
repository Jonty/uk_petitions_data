        "additional_details": "Loud  music or effects on TV programmes totally spoils viewing pleasure. It is absolutely unessersary. It is particularly unpleasant for the hard of hearing. Dialogue or scenary on their own are sufficient to convey pleasure of the programme. The number of complaints to the broadcasters over the past year, amply demonstrates the unpopularity and nuisance value of such music or sound effects.",
