The free bus pass enables pensioners and disabled people to play a full part in their community, getting out of the house, shopping, seeing families, getting to their voluntary activities in the 'Big Society\". Isolation means depression and more use of the NHS.Means testing may mean trouble for couples, people with occupational pensions and savings, non car owners, car owners who can't afford to drive,rural  dwellers. Pensioners are voters too! Keep the free bus pass non means tested!",
