        "additional_details": "We call on the government to lead an initiative to ensure that all public bodies and agencies, whether national or local, are required by law to provide a deaf person with a registered communication professional\r\n\r\nIn their daily lives, deaf adults and children depend on good communication support from qualified, registered BSL/English interpreters and other communication professionals. Ensuring deaf people are included in all walks of life saves taxpayers\u2019 money by avoiding misdiagnosed illnesses, reducing unemployment, lessening demand on services and by ensuring their ability to contribute to the workplace and the wider community\r\n\r\nToo many public bodies, including schools and hospitals, are either using unqualified communication workers, or relatives, or not using anyone at all. This wastes money and must stop\r\n\r\nRegulated communication support is vital for deaf people. By signing this petition and supporting our campaign you will be ensuring full access for everyone",
