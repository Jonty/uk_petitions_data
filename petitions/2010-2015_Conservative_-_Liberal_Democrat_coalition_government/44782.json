        "additional_details": "Stop Landlords abusing the Deposit Protection Service\r\n\r\nWhile the DPS is a step in the right direction, it is still loaded in favour of landlords.\r\n\r\nThe problem: Landlords face no penalties for creating spurious claims for deductions from a tenant's rental deposit.\r\n\r\nThe required modification is small and simple, changing only one step in the DPS system. Everything else remains the same:\r\n\r\nIf all or part of a landlord's claim is rejected by the DPS and is deemed to be without basis (so not when the outcome could have gone either way), they should face a penalty.\r\n\r\nTo avoid costly interpretation and adjudication, I propose that the penalty should be an amount equal to that of the fabricated claim.\r\n\r\nA proposed secondary change would be to keep all such penalties on file and available for prospective tenants to view ahead of taking up a new tenancy.",
