How are people supposed to survive and look after their family's when they get statutory sick pay of \u00a380 PW, that doesn't even pay for the shopping bill in some households. There should be some sort of support that cancer patients receiving treatment can receive to help them look after themselves and there families. When you have paid tax and national insurance all you life and then to be told you are not entitled to anything when you need it most is kick in the teeth. ",
