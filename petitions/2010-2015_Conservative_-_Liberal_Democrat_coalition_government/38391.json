        "additional_details": "Following months of severe cutbacks in funding for many departments including education, I believe David Cameron is guilty of mis-use of public funds by doubling the aid to Pakistan to \u00a3680m. By saying that it will make Britain safer appears to be a coward talking by claiming if we give Pakistan money they will leave us alone. David Cameron must be seen to be using taxpayers money sensibly and for the benefit of the UK first and foremost ",
