Loosing ten valuable points and then goes on to loose overall by ten points.\r\n\r\nTen years ago I was a contestant on the CBBC show Get Your Own Back and lost due to a miscount of petals. My barbers fate was never sealed and he avoided the gunge because of it.\r\n\r\n* Count the petals at the start and the end of the game and you will see he miscounts, costing me the game!! My mates decided I should share this with the world so here it is. Ten years ago, and no one believes my story so heres the proof.\r\n\r\nPlease help Chris get over this traumatic moment in his life and help him move on by giving him another go! This time however he should gunge Dave Benson Philips for his costly error.\r\n\r\n@chris_stark  @BBCR1 @scott_mills\r\n",
