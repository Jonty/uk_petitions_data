        "additional_details": "Too many children are being exposed  to innapropiate games via consoles. The footage in these games involves swearing, violence and sexual references.\r\nSome games can be played 'live' which allows  the player to interact with others. There is no assurance that people are who they say they are and children could be tricked into passing on personal details. Parents and Carers have to be accountable and responsible for what their children are taking part in. Whilst it cannot be totally eradicated the threat of a fine may deter some.",
