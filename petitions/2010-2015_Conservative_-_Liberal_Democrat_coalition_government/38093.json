        "additional_details": "We were stopped having BT Light User when we took out Broadand. We only have 2 or 3 calls per quarter so we pay a fortune for nothing. People who cannot get Cable etc are normally stuck with paying excessive costs for Landlines just so we can have the use of Broadband. This should be altered and people should be able to have a landline on Light User with anyone whether they use Broadband or not.",
