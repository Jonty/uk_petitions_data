We urge Government to bring regulation up to date to protect individual privacy & prevent the\r\nrelease of a person's image with malicious or salacious intent or those images which will be damaging to an indivdual's emotional or physical health.\r\n\r\nHuge invasions of privacy on social channels in 2013 include:\r\n\r\n-A victim of the Boston bombing with a limb hanging off, what should surely be considered a private, vulnerable moment shared without consent.\r\n-A young girl being 'slutshamed' en-masse for behaving inappropriately when intoxicated.\r\n-A young man committing suicide for being misidentified as a killer of James Bulger and thus being the target of vigilantism.\r\n\r\nMisuse and abuse of social media is ruining individual privacy and doing more harm than good.
