For too long the banks have indiscriminately taken money from customers accounts in the form of charges, which affects the poorest in society as rich people don't pay them!\r\n\r\nThe OFT badly let us down when they failed to protect bank customers from excessive charges and nothing has been done about the robbery people are experiencing at the hands of the banks every month.\r\n\r\nI propose that the government puts in place the ability for people to live their lives without the requirement of a bank account which would include a way for people to be paid by their employers and the abolishment of penalty charges levied by companies for customers not wishing to use direct debits as a payment method.\r\n\r\nThe poorer people in society should not have to pay charges for the rich to earn their interest!",
