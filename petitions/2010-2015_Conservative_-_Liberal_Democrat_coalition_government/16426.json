        "additional_details": "MP's salaries should be linked to median UK annual earnings and reviewed annually. Serving MPs need not take a severe pay cut as their pay can be worked out using a formula.\r\n\r\nFor example according to the BBC (http://bbc.in/8E3m3M) in 2008 the median wage was \u00a320,801 therefore it could be proposed the MPs are paid 3x the national median salary (3 x \u00a320,801 = \u00a362,403) a number not far from the current salary of \u00a365,738.\r\n\r\nAs a result of such a change MPs should be more concerned for those earning less than average as it directly effects how much they themselves are getting paid.\r\n\r\n",
