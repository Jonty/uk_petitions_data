This would give MPs the same life experiences of those people they represnt. It would be fair and transparant when considering that the Prime MInister is on record as saying that Social Security Rates are generous.\r\n\r\nBring Member of Parliaments Pensions in Line with the Policies that they are setting in Process. It should be a case of Parliament leading the way in pension reform not lagging behind.\r\n\r\nAbolish Allownces for Local Councillors.\r\n\r\nWe as a nation have been lectured by The Government on the Big Society.\r\n\r\nPoliticians should again take the lead and remove allowances for Local Councillors and they should receive payment of out of pocket expenses only.\r\n",
