        "additional_details": "Many of the super rich hold much of their money in offshore accounts to avoid paying as much tax as they should. This practice is very difficult to stop. This petition proposes a way to make the super rich *want* to pay at least their fair share of tax.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that *everyone* should be given the option of voluntarily paying a new special type of tax. For obvious reasons this option would mostly only be taken up by the super-rich, but the fact that, in principle, anyone can pay means that there would be no feeling of unfairness towards anyone based on their wealth.\r\n\r\nThe individuals paying the new tax would have some degree of control over where their money goes (community projects, education, research etc). They would also have the option to make their voluntary tax payments public. In this way it is hoped that these payments would become a status symbol among the super rich.",
