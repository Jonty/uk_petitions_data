Israel is building settlements on Palestinian land, which is illegal under international law. They kill Palestinians and try to wipe them out from their own land. Breaching UN conventions and human rights daily, why does the US still give aid to the Israeli military? It is time the US stopped funding this blatant illegal activity. ",
