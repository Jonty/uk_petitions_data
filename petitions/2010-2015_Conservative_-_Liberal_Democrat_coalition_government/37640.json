        "additional_details": "The EU is planning to make modifications on cars illegal. That means if the original manufacturer didn't approve it, it is illegal. This affects things from body kits and exhausts all the way down to window wipers. You will require a new MOT to sell your vehicle.\r\n\r\nPeople who modify cars are not all boy racers. We are enthusiasts and modifying our cars reflects our individuality, personality,and skill.\r\n\r\nCountless people will suffer, or even be put out of work, from shops like halfords down to the self employed guy in the industrial estate fitting body kits.\r\nSpecialist mod shops will close, car shows will be pointless, food vendors will lose out on annual events.\r\n\r\nPlease stop the EU interfering with our livelihoods and hobbies.",
