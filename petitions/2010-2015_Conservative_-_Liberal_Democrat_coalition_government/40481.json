        "additional_details": "The petition's title pretty much says it all. Even if CCTV cameras deter drug-taking, this is not a valid justification for their operation in public toilets (I'm thiking specifically of those in public houses). Why not go all the way and have them in cubicles? The claim that they don't point at urinals is lame as they will invariably be pointing at a mirror! Is it not enough that barmaids (a justifiable anachronism given the context) must contend with them pointing down their cleavage? What is it with Britain? Why are we by far the most heavily surveilled country in the known universe? Other countries haven't self-destructed without them. I appreciate their value on public transport for public protection, for instance, but toilets? Enough is enough. ",
