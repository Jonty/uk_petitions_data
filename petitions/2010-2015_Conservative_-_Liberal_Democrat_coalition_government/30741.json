        "additional_details": "Two Police Forces (on behalf of all forces) have invited bids for contracts from private security firms to undertake certain aspect of police work. This is said to be a necessary response to a 20% cut in police budgets over the next four years.  These contracts could be worth between \u00a31.5bn - \u00a33.5bn over the next seven years.\r\n\r\nIt is wholly deplorable and wrong that work that should be undertaken by the Police is to be farmed out to any private security concern whose only motivation, as with any other commercial concern, is working for profit.  Such action will only serve to undermine yet further the relationship and confidence between the Public and the Police Service. Available funds should instead be fully utilised to support and enhance policing by Police.\r\n\r\nThe Home Office should urgently review any budgetary considerations that would lead to such action being taken by any UK Police Force.\r\n ",
