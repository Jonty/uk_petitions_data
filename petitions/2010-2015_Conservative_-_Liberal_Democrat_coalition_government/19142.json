She delivered the same petition of 129,387 signatures to 10 Downing Street in 2006 by hand and in 2003 with 92,835 signatures. See www.fireworkspetition.co.uk.\r\n\r\nWe the signatories of this petition request the government to protect the people, animals and property of England from danger and nuisance by taking fireworks out of the hands of those who abuse them. Teresa spoke to members of the Emergency services and Hospital A&E departments who made similar statements. We believe this can only be practically achieved and economically enforced by restricting the sale of fireworks to licensed displays only. We ask this to happen now as we have asked before.",
