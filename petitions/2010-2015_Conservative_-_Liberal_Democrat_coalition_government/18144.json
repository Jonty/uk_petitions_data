By starting at grassroots level and teaching both boys and girls the basics of nutrition and elementary skills of cooking, we can give them a fairly good idea of how to eat healthy, nutritious meals.  We can also enable them to balance their intake of the basic food groups, the best methods of cooking them and encourgae choice of local, in season produce. An elementary household budget and menu to prevent wastage would also be a part of the plan",
