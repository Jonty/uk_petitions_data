We are tired of Sheffield City Council needlessly bulldozing our heritage and urge you to intervene\r\n\r\nGrade II listed buildings should, by law, only be demolished in exceptional cases.  We applaud plans to build a new Engineering complex and welcome all this will bring, however this development does not hinge on the small amount of extra space gained by demolition.  There is no exceptional case.\r\n\r\nSheffield City Council should have asked the University to revise their plans to integrate the Edwardian building.   The University bought the building in full knowledge of its listed status.  If unwilling to maintain it they should have investigated selling it to someone else.  This option has not been pursued and Sheffield City Council has failed to properly enforce planning law and its own policy.",
