        "additional_details": "We are overcrowded with dogs in this country.  Poor breeding gives financial gain with no regard for the animal.  Puppies are imported and we are at great risk of rabies and other diseases.  We petition the Government to:-\r\n\r\n1.  Enforce tighter restrictions on breeding.  Dogs are bred past the stated 5 litters, which is unlawful and produces deformed or very ill puppies.   Bitches are abandoned, ending up in rescue shelters, already at breaking point, placing huge burden and financial cost.\r\n\r\n2.  Put in place the ability to track a dog's past and present owner.  Dogs are passed on for breeding, baiting, fighting or status.  Authorities such as the RSPCA cannot prosecute as there is no direct proof of ownership.\r\n\r\n3.  Stop the sale of dogs on the internet immediately. This fuels the industry for cruel gains as item 2 and allows buying or selling without any regard for the animal's welfare.\r\n\r\n",
