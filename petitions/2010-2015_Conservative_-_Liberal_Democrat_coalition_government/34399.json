        "additional_details": "The Syrian Government, led by Basshar al-Assad is commiting the worst imaginable atrocities against peaceful protesters who are simply demanding democracy. Innocent men, women and children are being slaughtered, yet Syrian officials say that their country is \"peaceful\" and that brutal attacks, such as the one in Houla, were executed by terrorist groups. The protesters of Syria are not terrorists. They deserve the dignity of human beings; therefore, we must support them and demnad that Syria does not compete in the 2012 Olympics. The International Olympic Committee have said that \"Ultimately it is for the UK authorities and/or the EU to decide who is or is not allowed into the UK. We would respect any such decision.\" We must hold the IOC to their promise and implore the UK Government to take strong action against Bashar al-Assad. ",
