        "additional_details": "In January 2013, it was reported that horse DNA had been found in Tesco beefburgers. Since then, horse meat has been found in many meat products, ranging from suppliers of state schools, to Findus beef lasagnes as well as Burger King hamburgers.\r\n\r\nHowever, in Germany, the government's development minister Dirk Niebel called for the meat to be given to the poor, saying that 'we can't just throw away good food'.\r\n\r\nIt seems simply wrong that in the 21st Century, we are throwing away decent food that could be given to families who are either struggling to pay for household bills, or starving.\r\n\r\nHence, I call upon the government to give all contaminated meat products, which are perfectly safe to eat, to those in Britain and in impoverished countries in the developing world who are struggling most to feed their families.",
