        "additional_details": "Saturday morning sessions at the Hull Arena are promoted on the council's website to have their in house DJ, Gary Clegg, on hand to play all the latest hits and requests, this is no longer the case, yet it is still promoted like this on their website. This session used to be one of the best, most popular sessions of the week. Now the session has very old and bad music, in some cases no music at all, the disco lighting is not correctly used, and doesn't work how it should due to council staff not knowing how to use them. It would bring extra money into the arena if Gary was back on Saturday mornings bringing us 'The Best Tunes In The World' as Gary would say!",
