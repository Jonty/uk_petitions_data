        "additional_details": "The english resident has to pay the most for university tuition fees despite being a taxpayer that pays into the UK pot. They are not able to have access to Scottish free tuiition fees even though other EU  members are entitlted. The englsh pay into the UK tax fund and are members of the EU BUT for the convenience of the scottish to stop having the english resident have access to free tuition they exclude them. This is discriminatory when england pay the same taxes. Education should be equal to all be it financial and based on ability not abillity to pay. The education and financial investment in the england student is being discriminated against whilst the other UK resident students are able to gain a degree education on the back of the England taxpayer.",
