        "additional_details": "Sir Jimmy Savile had his knighthood revoked for his heinous activity and that activity pales into insignificance when compared with what Sir David Nicholson has done.  Sir Jimmy Savile never killed anybody and he has been villified in death.  Sir David Nicholson was the cause of death of hundreds, if not thousands, of NHS patients entrusted to his care - as has been recently reported.  Both were encouraged and supported in their activities throughout the highest echelons of affluence, corporate management and political activity.  To their utter shame (though those who are involved see it more as being loyal to one of their own) Sir David Nicholson, in life, continues to receive encouragement, support and succour from a huge number of our political and affluent elite.  SIR DAVID NICHOLSON IS NOT AN ENTITY TO WHOM ANYBODY ON THIS PLANET SHOULD HAVE TO REFER TO AS 'SIR' AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY REPREHENSIBLE THE WAY HE IS BEING PROTECTED BY OUR GOVERNMENT.",
