        "additional_details": "In January 2012 the Post Office changed their terms and conditions relating to business post. This prevents small businesses claiming compensation where items sent using Royal Mail are lost. My proposal is that where post is sent using Royal Mail and it can be shown that the item entered the Royal Mail system then the company should offer businesses some form of compensation where the company fails to deliver the item, the item is delayed or damaged whilst in their care.",
