        "additional_details": "Animals are constantly cut open, being shaved, going day through day living in pain. If you couldn't do it to your own pet, how can you possibly do it to another? In many cases, an animal dies from an experiment without the scientist even gaining an ounce of information. Do we really need more lipstick, or hairspray? Puppies, dogs, kittens, cats, pigs, rabbits, primates, mice, rats, and birds are all used in animal testing. How can you help? By helping me start a petition to STOP animal testing for good. Please spread the word to your friends and have everyone that cares sign this petition.  So please show you care. Give a voice to the little animals that cannot speak for themselves. Save them from abuse!",
