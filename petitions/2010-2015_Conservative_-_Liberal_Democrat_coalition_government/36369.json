Having completed active tours of duty in Iraq and Afganistan, it is the least this country can do for him. Refusing his application for Citizenship, over a common assault charge, while on active service, is a disgrace. Refusing him Leave to Remain shames us in the world's eyes and is totally deplorable. We seriously need to review immigration Law and Policy regarding Foreign and Commonwealth Soldiers.",
