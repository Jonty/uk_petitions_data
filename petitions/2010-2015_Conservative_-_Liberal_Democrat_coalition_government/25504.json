        "additional_details": "There is a need for an informed public debate on the purpose of education. No expansive debate has taken place in recent years. Significant global, environmental and socio-economic conditions make such a debate vital.\r\n\r\nPolicies are set by dominant political parties representing a minority of the electorate. Ministers often have no professional background in education. Numerous organisations and individuals holding significantly different views exist. Existing debates and policies are limited by party political arguments. Broader informed and diverse debates incorporating alternative perspectives are required to ensure vested interests are not over-represented.\r\n\r\nGovernment should ensure there is an extensive national and public debate around the purpose of education. An independent body should be established to explore varying perspectives and utilise mechanisms and media to ensure such perspectives inform wider public debates. Government should pledge to act upon outcomes.\r\n",
