        "action": "End Free Council Housing in Central London",
        "additional_details": "The housing crisis is particularly concentrated in London to the extent where working people cannot afford to live within a reasonable commuting distance! These are the same hardworking people that fuel the vibrant city's economy with their spending power - they not only deserve to live in this city, they are valuable to it.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, those who don\u2019t work have no need to be housed here and don\u2019t have the same spending power. Yet all over potentially great areas of London are council flats and houses, their occupants oblivious to location with no need to be situated in the hustle and bustle with which they do not interact on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nI propose the government swiftly phase out free council housing within the sought-after Zones 1-4 of London in an effort to increase the supply of housing to those who will pay for it. Let\u2019s make London truly vibrant - inhabited by those who spend their days working hard in the capital and their evenings and weekends spending and socialising.",
