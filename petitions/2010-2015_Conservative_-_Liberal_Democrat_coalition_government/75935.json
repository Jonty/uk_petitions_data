More and more young people are suffering from mental health conditions and there is not enough education in schools.\r\n\r\nIf schools were to educate young people 12+ about mental health then we could save hundreds of lives every year and help even more get the help that they deserve.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and get the government to make it part of the national curriculum so every single young person can be taught of the affects.\r\n\r\nThis should of been done years ago so stand up for the young.
