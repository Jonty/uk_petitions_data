        "additional_details": "I wish for all Students to be able to access a Professional Councillor at their own school. Recently I discovered that some of my fellow students are unable to access a Councillor at their current Schools due to the schools reluctance to allow such activity. In this day and age I believe it is unacceptable that such actions can be taken. As Children we have a right to access these facilities and the school has a responsibility to provide care and ensure their students safety and good health.\r\n\r\nNot only does this aid the child but it also aids Behaviour at schools whilst also helping to reduce the amount of people in need of Mental Health Care in the future and thus saving the area significant funding on what is already a pretty much non existent budget.\r\n\r\nI hope for this to be discussed in Parliament and for it to be made a necessity for EVERY school, whether it be an academy or even a private school.",
