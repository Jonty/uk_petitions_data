        "additional_details": "The recent announcement of a cull of English badgers flies in face of scientific research, which has shown that a cull is not the most effective way to control bovine TB. We call upon the government to find an alternative to the proposed cull and to listen to the vast majority of the British public, who are against it. We do not wish to see our badgers (a protected species) destroyed for the sake of such a small reduction in bovine TB. Please find a more humane, long term solution to this problem.",
