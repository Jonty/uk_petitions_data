If Housing benefit only paid 90 percent of their rents they would have to pay the other ten percent out of their JSA. This would act as a stick making them more likely to find work. At the moment we have Somali's getting 100K a rent paid per year. Those with mortgages only get mortgage interest paid yet rent money goes to landlords who pay the mortgage off on rich properties.",
