        "additional_details": "i am doing this petition to raise awareness for miscarriage as there is a lack of information and support for women like me who have been through such a traumatic experience. i have seen myself from going doctors,walk in centres and hospitals that there is no information up or very little of it so this makes women and men feel alone which needs to change. This means most women and men dont know the true extent of miscarriage.\r\n\r\ni want the government to create support groups all over the country so women have the same amount of support and get to speak to other women who have been through the same thing. I also want them to produce more literature such as posters and leaflets so hospitals,doctors and walk in centres get all the information needed out there because its not nice seeing a lot of baby posters etc when you've just been through the worst thing ever. Everyone needs to fully understand miscarriages and the lack of information isnt doing anyone any good.",
