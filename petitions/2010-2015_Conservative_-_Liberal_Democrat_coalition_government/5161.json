        "additional_details": "The changes to DLA and to introduce PIP are disgusting. The government claim they want to reduce the cost of DLA by 20% - that would leave many people like myself with no DLA, meaning no much needed care and will probably cost the NHS more. Or is it acceptable for a disabled person to go without basic needs through no fault of their own?\r\n\r\nThe new system won't save any money all - in fact, it'll cost more - due to medicals and people needing to appeal.\r\n\r\nThe government claim they want to help disabled people who need it the most - there are people out there who, whilst their only care need is cooking a meal, they STILL need this help a lot - or is living on microwave meals acceptable?\r\n\r\nThey want to remove lower rate care - why? Or is the government now denying that these people need help?\r\n\r\nAll the government is trying to do is save money - why take it away from the people who need it the most?",
