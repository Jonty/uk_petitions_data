Lets stop Hypocrisy and lets tried to answer few question like: 1. From where people like KONY buy the weapon?\r\n2. Who are the people selling weapons to persons like KONY?\r\n3. How does KONY finance his war INDUSTRY ?\r\n\r\nWe all know that none of the Countries in Africa where people are dying has the weapon manufacturing industry, We also all know that person like KONY uses the wealth of Africa as main mean of exchange to buy weapons ( Diamond, Cobalt, Copper, Gold, Uranium, Coltan ...). It has been more than a decade now that people are dying in CONGO due to the simple fact that the WORLD doesn't care pretending of not being informed despite all the Intelligentsia and Technologies that they have.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4MnpzG5Sqc",
