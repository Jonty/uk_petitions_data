        "action": "Revoke the right for tax exiles to play sport under the British flag",
        "additional_details": "Some UK nationals engage in sporting activities as being British while living in tax exile. This means that they fly the flag while not paying tax along with the rest of us. This petition argues that to fly the flag you must be one of us in tax affairs too and not shun your responsibilities to your country. Many of these people owe their wealth to the support of people who do pay their tax, so why not honour this support by paying the fair dues themselves? This petition wants the government to prevent UK nationals who live in tax exile or do not pay their full tax from representing Britain in sport",
