We have welfare acts for animals such as cats and dogs, so why do we not take the welfare of the horses into consideration. 'more than 370 horses are raced to death each year in the uk' - http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/CAMPAIGNS/horse/\r\n\r\nApproximately 12,000 foals are born into the closely-related British and Irish racing industries each year, yet only around 50 per cent go on to become racers. Those horses who do not make the grade may be slaughtered for meat or repeatedly change hands in a downward spiral of neglect. Of those horses who do go on to race, around 420 are raced to death every year.",
