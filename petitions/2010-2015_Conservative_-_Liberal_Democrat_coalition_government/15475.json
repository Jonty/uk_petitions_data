        "additional_details": "This years Public   Expenditure Statistical Analysis shows that last year, total public spending per head in Scotland was \u00a310,212, compared to \u00a38,829 per head in England - it means that Scotland received 10% of Whitehall money, for only just over 8% of the U.K. population . Wales received \u00a39,829 for the same period , It is hard to figure out why this \"temporary measure\", some  30 years ago, has not been adjusted, as the facilities & self-government it was drawn up for, have long been achieved . Lord Barnett, the former Treasury chief Secretary, who drew up the formala,  also warned that it is now \"grossly unfair\" . The free services existing now in Scotland - university tuition, prescriptions & long-term elderly care & to some extent in Wales, are all being subsidised by England . This cannot be right, In these times of budget cuts to quite a lot of essential services, I urge the Government to correct this imbalance . Please sign this petition. Thank you,",
