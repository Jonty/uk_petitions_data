        "action": "Make self-defence mandatory in schools",
        "additional_details": "There are various self-defence classes around the country, but people don't usually have the money or the means of getting to them, so I am calling for self-defence to be made part of the school curriculum so the youth of today are better prepared. You could run away if somebody pulls a knife on you, but that doesn't  if they are faster than you are. I'm not encouraging violence, I'm just calling for the education sector to step in and make self-defence something that should be taught in schools.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and I hope this petition gains some success!\r\nStay safe.",
