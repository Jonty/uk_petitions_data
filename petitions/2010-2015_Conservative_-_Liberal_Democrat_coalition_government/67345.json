        "additional_details": "The rules for eligibility for DLA/PIP changed such that anyone being out of the UK for more than 13 weeks in a year would lose DLA and have to reapply for PIP on return. ( Previously this was 26 weeks) At the same time the requirement to have resided in UK for 26 weeks out of the last 52 was changed to 104 weeks out of the last 156.\r\nThis means that a retired person cannot go on an extended overseas holiday lasting more than 13 weeks. This would prohibit a retired, disabled person from going on a world cruise or spending the summer with relatives in places such as Canada and Australia. DLA/PIP is supposed to help disabled people enjoy the quality of life of non disabled people as much as possible given the high extra costs of having a disability and as such these changes are highly discriminatory against disabled people who rely on DLA/PIP to maintain a reasonable quality of life.",
