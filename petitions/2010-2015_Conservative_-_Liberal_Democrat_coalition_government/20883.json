Anymore then three? No thank you. Help us abolish the misuse of Alcohol. Help us put a limit on the amount people drink in a pub, or how much they buy. Lets place a 3 unit limit in how much alcohol is served in a pub or bought in a shop. Please, stop and think... It could be you next.\r\n\r\nHelp Britain drink safely.",
