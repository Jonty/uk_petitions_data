        "additional_details": "The failure to resolve the West Lothian question, which can only be addressed by the introduction of an English Parliament, denies people living in England their right to equal representation and allows Scots MPs unfair influence on English affairs. The Barnett Formula compounds this unfairness by channeling more money to Scotland. The Barnett Formula has been described as outdated and unfair by its creator, Lord Barnett.\r\n\r\nThis petition seeks (i) the creation of an English Parliament, with the same powers and mandate as the Scottish Parliament and (ii) the replacement of the Barnett Formula with an updated system that allocates public spending on a fairer, needs based, calculation.",
