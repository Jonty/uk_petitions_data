Politicans would be relocated to a tempary place for a 5 year period starting from 2015, the plans would cost the \u00a33 billion. I propose for the Government consider selling the building and to move premently into Buckingham Palace. Also a yes vote in the independence referendum in 2014 will save people in Scotland that enormous cost and move all decisions to a modern, progressive Parliament at Holyrood.",
