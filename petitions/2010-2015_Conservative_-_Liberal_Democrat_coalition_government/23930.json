        "additional_details": "All illegal immigrants should be imprisoned. . Illegal immigration should be treated as a serious crime requiring to be kept in custody until they are actually deported. An illegal immigrant by definition already had a history of absconding and will surely do so again if let out at large. Commissioning a fleet of prison ships will serve the dual purpose of having extra prison places for holding foreign prisoners & all illegal immigrants, as well as transporting/deporting the prisoners back to their country of origin. Most illegal immigrants arrested by the Borders Agency are released/bailed on the condition that they report regularly to the Borders Agency/police. This is mostly due to the lack of detention places. Surely, illegal immigrants will abscond again by failing to report to the Borders Agency & remain illegally at large in UK again, until they are actually deported.",
