        "additional_details": "An entire generation is being locked out of the property market by high house prices. It has become increasingly difficult for first time buyers to get on the property ladder, partly due to wealthier people buying multiple properties as an investment.\r\nThe government should discourage the purchasing of multiple houses by charging VAT (or another suitable tax) on houses bought by people who already own at least one home. This would reduce demand for houses and therefore reduce house prices, so we all have more chance of getting on the property ladder.",
