        "additional_details": "The Conservative party has indicated it will not only continue with its pilot badger culls if it is re-elected but roll them out to many more areas of the country.\r\n\r\nBadger culling is being imposed as an act of political belligerence against three clear votes against in parliament and a recent ComRes poll showing public opposition at 90%. Nevertheless, the government continues to distort the facts around culling and overstate the seriousness of TB in cattle, which its own data shows has been reducing significantly for four years without culling and is now at a 14 year low.\r\n\r\nThe Conservative party is pursuing this policy in response to a powerful landowning minority that funds them.\r\n\r\nBy signing this petition you are sending a message to David Cameron that you will not vote for the Conservatives unless they publicly drop the culling policy in favour of proven science-based measures such as vaccination which preserve our wildlife rather than destroy it.\r\n",
