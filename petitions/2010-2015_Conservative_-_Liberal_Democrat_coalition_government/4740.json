Why should we tolerate people hiding their identity in our own country? This is not their religious right, as we do not implement Shia law in the UK. It IS our human right to feel safe and to know who passers-by look-like, in case anything where to happen.\r\n\r\nHow do we know men who are hiding their identity (which has been seen in airports)?\r\n\r\nHow do you know there are not any weapons under the Burka?\r\n\r\nDo you feel safe?
