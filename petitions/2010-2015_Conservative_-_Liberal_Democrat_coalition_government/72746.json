        "additional_details": "I am a single mum of 5 and have recently been in touch with child maintence positions to get help receiving any support from my children's absent parents, I was told that I would now have to pay an admin fee of \u00a320 and also any fees on top of any money I may receive... I asked them why they told me they are now trying to get parents to sort their own support issues out, I cannot get any of my children's fathers to have there children let alone ask  them for any support... Please help stop these fees and make absent parents pay for the children they refuse to keep.\r\nThe government wonder why they are loosing money and are making it easier for parents to have children and walk away without giving support then make more children and do the same....
