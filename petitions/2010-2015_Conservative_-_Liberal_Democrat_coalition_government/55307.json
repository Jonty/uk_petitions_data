        "additional_details": "A recent campaign in Sunderland called 'Hands off our libraries' has posted an image of a child crying at the closure of his local library.  This has prompted me to start this petition.\r\n\r\nThe local council is not to blame as it has to make massive cuts.  The library closures are a direct result of cuts from central government and this petition asks that Sunderland receive some funding back to save our children's education.\r\n\r\nAs a child I lived in a household with domestic violence and my head was always in a book.  Reading and regular visits to the library with my mother gave me respite from other issues at home.  The libraries are a lifeline to many people of all ages... Please sign this petition to help to save them.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
