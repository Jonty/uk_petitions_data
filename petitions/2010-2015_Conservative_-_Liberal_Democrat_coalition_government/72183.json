        "action": "Petition to lower the age limit on mamograms",
        "additional_details": "I am creating this petition in memory of my amazing friend Lisa Staniford who sadly lost her battle against breast cancer on 14/11/14.\r\n\r\nLisa had obvious signs of breast cancer which were repeatedly missed by GP's and hospital Drs over a 6 month period. In this time the cancer spread from Lisa's breast to her back and liver.  The cancer later spread to her brain. Lisa fought hard against her cancer and was in no doubt that had she been given a mamogram like she requested it would have shown the cancer to the Drs. Because Lisa was 31 when she was diagnosed she was deemed too young as you need to be 35 or older. Lisa did have a petition but unfortunately it closed so I am opening this new petition in her memory.\r\nLisa left behind 3 young children.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and share xx\r\n\r\n",
