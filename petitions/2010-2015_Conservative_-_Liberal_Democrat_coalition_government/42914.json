        "additional_details": "This petition has been created to get the subject of Cannabis legalisation debated in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n\r\n- By creating a legal marketplace you are better able to control cannabis use(Drug dealers don't ID)\r\n\r\n- Tax revenue gained* would be a significant boost in the economy, and could in part be spent on proper cannabis education\r\n\r\n- Legalisation would result in reduced profits for major crime organisations as more users will get cannabis from legal sources, thus having an adverse effect on their activities.\r\n\r\n- Police would be able to reallocate resources elsewhere.\r\n\r\n- Legalisation would reduce the market for \"legal highs\"\r\n\r\n- Quality control would allow for a safer product to be supplied to the end user by regulating cultivation methods\r\n\r\n\r\n*Washington State, having legalised recreational cannabis, has estimated a potential gross sales figure of $1.021 Billion.
