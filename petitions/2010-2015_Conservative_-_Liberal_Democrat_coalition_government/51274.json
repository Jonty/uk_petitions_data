Gas and Electric prices are becoming ridiculous and the amount of non-renewable energy that is being used in the world is high. Every change starts small and if this brilliant change could happen in the UK, others may follow.In any country, Government money and taxes would be better spent on supplying homes and businesses with energy derived from sources that do not use up natural resources or harm the environment, starting with solar panels. Lowering prices for the people and using less non-renewable sources. The UK Government need to use the money they have for this country on solar panels for homes, to begin the change to better our country and help the economy. ",
