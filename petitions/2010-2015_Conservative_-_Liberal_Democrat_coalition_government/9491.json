        "additional_details": "Whilst we all condemn the riots its is important to move past the knee-jerk reactions (send in the army, rubber bullets etc) and understand why these people are rioting.  It is a multitude of reasons, from discontent with government, feeling of racial profiling by authorities, feeling of no understanding from authorities alongside plain thuggery and desire to loot.  Therefore it is these issues that should be the focus of our attention.  Proposals, such as restricting social media websites in times of riot, can only serve to undermine the most basic freedoms we base our country on.  This is alongside the fact that we condemn countires such as Syria for restricting social media to deal with civil unrest, whilst proposing to do the same ourselves.   ",
