        "action": "Save Historic Hamble Village from threat of Gravel Extraction",
        "additional_details": "Since 2007, residents of the historic maritime village Hamble have been fighting the threat of gravel extraction on Hamble Airfield.  The Airfield is surrounded by 2 schools, a college, a health centre and 2,000 homes and is next to the Hamble River which is one of the largest yachting centres in Europe with over 4,000 boat moorings.  Gravel extraction will cause congestion, constant noise and dust with pollution to the river.  Roads running alongside the Airfield could be at risk of flooding due to high water tables.  The Airfield is close to nature conservation sites and the proposal will have major adverse affects on local businesses and tourism.  We want the Government to listen to the concerns of the local population, carry out in-depth impact surveys and do a thorough investigation into alternative sources such as marine aggregates before going ahead with this plan.  Please sign this petition to help us save Hamble!",
