        "additional_details": "All renters and home owners should be provided a spare room for their own personal use.\r\n\r\nNumerous households of all sizes across the country are affected by the lack of spare rooms. Some of these householders and renters work over 40 hours a week and can't afford to pay the rent even on a slightly bigger property.\r\n\r\nThe government should provide a spare room for all applicants. A charge of \u00a39 per week is to be levied for all successful applicants, which should be more than sufficient to provide return for the government investment.\r\n\r\nAs this typical householder says :- 'I struggle to pay the rent and bills these days much as I'd love an extra room for when my children come to stay. Still we manage just fine, I don't mind sleeping on the sofa bed once a week. I'd love a garden for them too but we manage going to the park on a Saturday.\"\r\n\r\nA separate e-petition is to be raised based on the provision of a garden for all householders",
