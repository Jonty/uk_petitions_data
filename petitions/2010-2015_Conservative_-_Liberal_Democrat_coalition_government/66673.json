The main culprits are the Chief Executive and his senior management who presided on athat MESS- The buck stops with them and they should be prosecuted to stop SCAPEGOATING. We appeal to the HEALTH SECREATARY to start an immediate INQUIRY in the ABUSES of ELDERLY RESIDENTS at SHAW HEALTH CARE HOMES starting with the home in Bristol where the recent death occured.",
