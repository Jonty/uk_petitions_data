        "additional_details": "Michael Gove is the man in charge of the education system but he doesn't have that much hands-on experience. I invite him to take part in a job swap - he teaches my Year 3's for one week and I spend a week doing what he does.\r\n\r\nI teach in a deprived part of Kent and in the spirit of mutual understanding I think it would be a good idea for him to experience the reality of day to day life in a regular school. On the flip side, we all criticise him for his apparent ineptitude but how many of us have been Education Secretary? This is a golden opportunity for democratic balance.",
