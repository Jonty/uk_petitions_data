        "additional_details": "Gas & electricity is sold in an incomprehensible way that no one understands, the pricing and the tarrif systems are far to complex.\r\nI propose the government force the utility companies to simplify the system and sell there gas & electricity by the unit in exactly the same way petrol, oil and food is sold.  Scrap the tarrif system and make it so simple that we can all easily compare prices from each company.  Force the utility companies to be clear about how much each unit of power costs. We but petrol by the litre so why cant we buy gas and electricty by a unit, lets see exactly what we are buying and for how much.\r\nThis has to be addressed as currently the market is so complex it's very difficult to work out who is offering the best deal..\r\nI would ask the government to look at this as a serious alternative, it would make so much sense for every one and would be so simple to implement.",
