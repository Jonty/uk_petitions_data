        "additional_details": "A few years ago, the policy for collecting an item from the Post Office was changed so that rather than proof of address, ID of the addressee is required for collection. On numerous occasions I have seen where this fails the consumer.\r\n\r\nIf someone were present in the house at the time of the delivery, the post man would not request ID for the addressee - it is assumed that their presence in the house indicates their right to sign for the item, so why should the policy be different for collection.\r\n\r\nI propose that the rules be changed so that either photographic ID proving address OR ID of the addressee become suitable forms of identification for collecting a package from the Royal Mail collection office.",
