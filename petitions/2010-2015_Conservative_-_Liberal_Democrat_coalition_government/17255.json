Trolling can be regarded as intentionally posting on blogs provocative material, outside of an online context. Trolls (sometimes with multiple IDs) on the web spread malicious, rude, falsehoods, character assassinate other internet users with unfounded libelous accusations & innuendoes to cause dispersion amongst contributors on blogs. Meaningless name and swearing by trolls calling do not forward a discussion any further, except to reduce its quality.",
