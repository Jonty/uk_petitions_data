        "additional_details": "Currently the Government have said that there is 'NO NEED' to have PIP implants removed unless they rupture.  The reason, because they do not want taxpayers to foot the bill and understandably so.\r\n\r\nHowever, they should NOT say that something that is actually toxic and poisonous should remain in the body to save themselves the cost.  They should be using their powers to force those Private Companies  to cover the cost of removing and replacing the PIP implants that they have put into women as they have effectively placed poison into their bodies and these women have had to pay for such a 'privilege'.\r\n\r\nMy petition is to get the government to get those Private Companies who took our money and supplied us with 'faulty goods' to replace or remove at a cost to them.  I do not expect the government to pay for anyone who had them done privately but the NHS should replace those PIP implants that they fitted and force the Private Companies to follow suit.\r\n\r\n",
