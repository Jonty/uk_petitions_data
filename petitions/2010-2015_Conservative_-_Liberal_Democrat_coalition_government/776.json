        "additional_details": "We believe that the British Broadcasting Company do a world class presentation of Formula 1 and it would not be of the same quality under Sky Television. Jake Humphreys as well as Martin Brundell, Eddie Jordan and David Coulthard are all brilliant presenters that host F1 at a standard never seen before in over 60 years of the sport. We believe that Sky should not take the rights away from the Britich public.",
