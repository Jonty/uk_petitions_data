        "additional_details": "I am the mum of a five year old girl who has just received proton therapy in the USA, referred by and paid for by the NHS. We and many other families who have undergone the same process, or are yet to undergo it, wish to campaign for a Proton therapy institute in the UK. We have had the priveledge of receiving the treatment but know of the difficulties and financial/family burdens it causes when having to travel to another country for medical treatment, and how much it costs the NHS to send patients and their carers overseas. The benefits of proton therapy over existing UK treatments surely warrant further, more detailed discussions and consultations by governement with medical professionals from the UK and overseas Proton institutes, and moreover with the families who have benefitted from the treatments.",
