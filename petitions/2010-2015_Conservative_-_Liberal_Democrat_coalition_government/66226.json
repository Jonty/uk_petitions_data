        "action": "End state funding of faith schools",
        "additional_details": "In our modern, secular and multicultural United Kingdom, faith schools should no longer be funded by the tax payer.\r\n\r\nA child is not born religious and a fundamental human right is freedom of religion. By facilitating parental and institutional indoctrination of children through faith schools, this right is being breached. Exposing children predominantly to one faith taints this choice and inadequately prepares them to integrate into our multicultural society.\r\n\r\nSchools should always facilitate the cultural and religious needs of their pupils. Schools should do this from a secular and balanced standpoint.\r\n\r\nParental choice is understandably a limiting factor in this argument. For of course, many tax paying parents wish for their children to be educated under the umbrella of their chosen faith.\r\n\r\nThank you and please do consider all logical arguments before signing.",
