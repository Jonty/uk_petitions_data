        "additional_details": "All the urban leisure centres in Trafford are being closed down. Urban leisure is a youth sport for children where they can do sport or hang out. Adults incourage children to eat healthily and be active. Urban leisure incourages children to be active and shutting them down just incourages children to stay inside and play on their gadgets. I want the government, or the local MP of Trafford, to keep them open as they stop children hanging around the streets and the parks.",
