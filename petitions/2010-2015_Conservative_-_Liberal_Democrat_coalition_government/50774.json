        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the English Defence League (EDL) to be listed as a terrorist organisation.\r\n\r\nTerrorism:\r\n1. the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes.\r\n(Dictionary.com)\r\n\r\nThe EDL fulfil this criteria.\r\n\r\nLeaders and supporters make statements that incite hatred and violence.\r\nE.g. Alan Lake has discussed the murder of David Cameron.\r\nSome have alleged links to Anders Breivik.\r\n\r\nEDL member, Simon Beech has been jailed for 10 years for an arson attack on a Mosque.\r\nJudge, Mark Eades said the purpose of the attack was, \"to get at Muslim's in general...purpose can only have been to destabilise community relationships\".\r\n\r\nWe believe that if the EDL is allowed to continue as it is, it will continue to cause fear, divide communities, spread hate, and radicalise.\r\nIf the EDL is not listed, attacks that have been mentioned will become all to common, and we believe that an Breivik scale incident could happen in the future.",
