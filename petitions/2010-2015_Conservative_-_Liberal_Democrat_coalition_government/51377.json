        "additional_details": "Potential cuts are threatening the National Media Museum in Bradford, The National Railway Museum in York and the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester with closure. Each unique museum provides the north of England a cultural platform that celebrates our industrial heritage, highlights the benefits of science and technology to our country, while also bringing specialist exhibitions from across the world to museums outside of London. The Government must ensure that none of these cultural jewels close in a short term bid to save money.",
