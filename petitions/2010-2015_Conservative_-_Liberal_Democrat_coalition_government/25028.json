        "additional_details": "I believe that all schools should educate their pupils on how to communicate with people with special needs. Infant schools should teach their pupils how to sign, simple things like good morning, yes, no etc. This can be done easily by using videos and interacting with eachother. Then as they develop through their schools they will be taught more in depth sign language and also about specific conditions, ie downs syndrome, autism, mental health etc.\r\nI believe that this is the only way that people with special needs can be integrated fully into society and be seen as equal and to stop discrimination.",
