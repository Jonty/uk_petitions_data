        "additional_details": "Dog owners are required by law to clean up after their pets after their pet has fouled. On many occasions I have challenged owners for not cleaning up. The normal response is to say \"sorry but I have no bags\". If peope are penalised for not carrying bags MAYBE this could help deter bad owners. Wardens, PCSO, Police ECT would have the power to challenge any dog walkers to produce a bag, if no bag a fixed penalty notice can be issued. Powers are already in force to fine for not cleaning up but the dog owner has to be caught in the act. Responsible owners would not mind being challenged mainly due to the fact we clean up",
