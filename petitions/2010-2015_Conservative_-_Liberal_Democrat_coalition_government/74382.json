        "additional_details": "Bromley Council is proposing selling The Priory, Orpington, which houses Bromley Museum.  It is the oldest building in the borough, dating back to the 11th century and the local authority has owned and maintained it since 1947.  Despite government cuts, Bromley Council has considerably more reserve funds than the cuts they are considering.  The government must prevent the loss of heritage sites owned by local authorities and valued by their communities.  Once sold, they will be out of local authority control forever, to the detriment of community amenities.",
