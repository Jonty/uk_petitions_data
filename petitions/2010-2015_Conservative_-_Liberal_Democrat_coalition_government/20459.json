        "additional_details": "This petition seeks the introduction of national Code of Conduct that would prevent overt marketing of Christmas until Remembrance Sunday and/or Remembrance Day has passed.\r\n\r\nWe believe that retailers have more than sufficient time to market Christmas between Remembrance and Christmas and that premature marketing is not only counter-productive in terms of impact but also disrespectful to our servicemen and women who must be given appropriate recognition for their sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe Government should support retailers to come to an accord and introduce a Code of Conduct in respect of the subject of this petition.",
