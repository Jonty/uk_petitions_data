        "additional_details": "Police officers are being treated inhumanely and unfairly by what is expected of them by the government. During August 2011 riots the goverment claimed police had 'readily available resources'. This was the cost:\r\nHave all days off cancelled; Have all leave existing leave cancelled; Re-called into work when not due to work; Have hours extended between 12-22hours shifts, often with little or no break; Reduced time between shifts to sleep and recover; Work up to a 16 day/night without a any time off; Part time officers with child care issues are given no prior warning and expected to return to work, increase hours and days with no consideration for who will look after a child; Voluntary Special constables arriving for duty had been made to work a 17hour shift for no pay\r\nProposal:\r\n-No cuts to police officers. Numbers increased.\r\n-Abide by the working time directive for recovery hours between shifts, and a maximum 7 day working week by law.\r\n-Assist those with child care\r\n",
