        "additional_details": "An increasing number of people in the UK are becoming overweight, and yet there is still widespread discrimination against overweight individuals. Statistics collected in the US show that size discrimination can result in wage disparity, affect hiring and promotion at work, affect academic options and advancement at school, and of course create medical and psychological problems.\r\nFrom playground bullying to inappropriate jokes on the Internet, size discrimination can be just as hurtful as sexism and racism, and yet isn\u2019t treated nearly as harshly; given the images thrown at us daily by the media of thin, \u2018beautiful\u2019 people, this kind of discrimination almost seems to be encouraged.\r\nSeveral cities in the US, and the entire state of Michigan, have laws in place to protect against discrimination based on weight, and it is high time the UK considered putting similar laws in place.",
