        "additional_details": "I am asking that the government force local councils to either return to weekly refuse collections or collect extra refuse sacks left alongside bins at each collection every fortnight.\r\n\r\nIt is unreasonable to expect all size households to fit 2 weeks refuse into the bins provided by local councils. Even after recycling, larger households in particular still have extra refuse sacks that councils are refusing to take.  We then have to have these extra refuse sacks outside our homes for 2 weeks rotting and attracting vermin.  This is a health risk and environmentally unfrierndly - the opposite to what council's claim to promote. ",
