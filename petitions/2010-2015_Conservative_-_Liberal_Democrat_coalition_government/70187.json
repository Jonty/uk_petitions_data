        "additional_details": "We call on the British Government to use a small part of the FCO, DfID or British Council budget to send a shipment - 1000-5000 - of umbrellas to the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nThe movement needs moral support from around the world in their struggle for the real universal suffrage that has been promised to them in the past.\r\n\r\nThis act would be a profound symbol of Britain's ongoing support and commitment to the democratic values it hold so dear; in a place where Britain has an especially important obligation to assist because of its historical and cultural links with the city.",
