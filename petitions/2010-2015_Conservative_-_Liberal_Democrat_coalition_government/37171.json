        "additional_details": "In January 2013, the law for which individuals obtain their motorcycle license is due to change!!\r\nBut the following will give you some idea of just how much motorcycling is under threat.\r\n\r\nAfter January 2013, at 17, after passing your test you will be restricted to a 125cc bike, with no more than 11 KW. At the moment (2012) after passing your test at 17 you can buy any bike you want, as long as it has no more than 33bhp/restricted to 33bhp, after 2 years it is then automatically upgraded to a full license(any power motorcycle).\r\n\r\nFull details of the changes here:  http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/new-driving-licence-rules-for-mopeds-motorcycles-and-tricycles\r\n\r\nThis new \"law\" may have the adverse affects of which the EU is trying to achieve. Many young riders will not take further training after their CBT as there is no motivation of being able to ride a bigger bike after passing their test.\r\n\r\n\r\nHURRY, WE DON'T HAVE LONG!\r\n",
