Young people whose productivity and skills are not yet worth the national minimum wage are finding it almost impossible to find employment; hence why youth unemployment is so high.  Jobs do not grow on trees; each and every job in the economy is created by an employers, they will only create these job if it is profitable to do so; the minimum wage raises labour costs for all companies, forcing upon them to employ less labour or go bust.
