But they enjoy a \u00a35.8 million subsidy in the bars and restaurants in the Houses of Parliament. There is a clear argument that our service personnel are more worthy of a subsidised drink than our politicians! Keep the military subsidy and increase the amount spent on military family welfare by \u00a36m.",
