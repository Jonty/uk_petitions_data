        "additional_details": "The State of Israel has a long record of abuse of international law, its position of protection by the USA and above all, of human beings.\r\n\r\nIsrael illegally occupies land recognised by 68% of UN member states as falling under the State of Palestine, ejecting its Palestinian citizens through a sustained campaign of violence and terror.\r\n\r\nIsrael's legal violations, apartheid-esque control of wider Palestine, persecution and execution of Palestinians, and disproportionate use of military power, are an affront to basic human decency and must be condemned in word and deed.\r\n\r\nThis article then petitions Parliament and the Government to discuss and vote in favour of:\r\n\r\n- The expulsion from the UK of all diplomats representing the State of Israel pending its own recognition of the State of Palestine along the 1967 borders.\r\n- The UK's immediate recognition of the State of Palestine along the 1967 borders.",
