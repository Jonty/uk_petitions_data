        "additional_details": "Meriam Yehya Ibrahim Ishag of Sudan, was raised as an Orthodox Christian, her mother's religion, because her father, a Muslim, was reportedly absent during her childhood.\r\nOn 15th May 2014, a Sudanese court has sentenced Meriam to hang for apostasy - the abandonment of her religious faith - after she married a Christian man. This is clearly an appalling and abhorrent act. It should not tolerated by the UK and the wider world.\r\nThe epetition is to call on HMG and specifically the FCO to act. I believe the HMG should:\r\nInstruct the British Embassy in Khartoum to provide all necessary support to Meriam and her family.\r\nProvide her and family (including the unborn child) with British Residency.\r\nIncrease sanctions and embargos on Sudan.\r\nFreeze the assets of and raise travels bans against all the members of Justice Department and other members of the Sudanese Government that support the hanging of Meriam.\r\n",
