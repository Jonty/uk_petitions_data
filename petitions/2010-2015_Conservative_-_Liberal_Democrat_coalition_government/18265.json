        "additional_details": "That the present Government for the British recognise that there will be no resolution to the difficulty in Ireland unless and until the desires of the Majority in Ireland for a United Country are reconciled with those of the Minority for the maintenance of a Union of some sort between and within the Islands.  A Mechanism for doing this now exists and if it is accepted will produce for the People of the British Isles as a whole a different kind of Union.  It is for a Union of the British based on the Principle of Equality of Status and Relationship for the Four Countries in the Islands, embracing therefore all the Irish, on the model of the European Union, in a Republic and with an Irish Presidency to initiate it.",
