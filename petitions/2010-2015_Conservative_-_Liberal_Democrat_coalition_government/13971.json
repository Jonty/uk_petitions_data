In 2011, the government cut corporation tax whilst cutting benefits - and brought Phillip Green, a known tax avoider, into government to advise on waste.\r\n\r\nThis petititon calls for the full disclosure of salaries and taxation paid by the entire population, in the spirit of both transparency and egalitarianism.",
