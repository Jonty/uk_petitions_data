Non-residents are in a no win situation. The more you earn then the more you pay. Yet every family receives the same amount in Child Benefit.\r\nChild maintenance payments are crippling non-resident parents. This payment comes before all others! Not all parties are willing to set up private agreements so the agencies help to mediate. Now we are told they are going to charge 20% to take money from paying parents.\r\nThis has to end! Where is the justice? Why can't child maintenance payments be the same as those for child benefit?",
