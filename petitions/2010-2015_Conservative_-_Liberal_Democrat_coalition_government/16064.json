        "additional_details": "At considerable cost to the UK taxpayer, Gaelic is now a compulsory subject in Scottish schools and is an obligation on Scottish local council signage and pamphlets. The language is being used as a political tool to divide Scotland from the rest of the UK, despite its never having been the national language of Scotland. Whereas their is merit in keeping Gaelic alive for historical purposes, it is pointless to promote the use of a language that is of no practical use elsewhere in the world and of little use within Scotland itself. The political promotion of Gaelic should be stopped.\r\n",
