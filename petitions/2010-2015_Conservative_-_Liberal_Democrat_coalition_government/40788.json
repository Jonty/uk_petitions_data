This is quite a big investment which improves safety and reduces risk of accident and claim in winter and should cause premium to be lowered. Moreover, please make the law which will allow a victom of accident to make a claim WITHOUT using a solicitor. This will save lots of money for insurance companies and should lower the premiums and will reduce hassle made by spam text messages/calls/letters from accident claim firms.",
