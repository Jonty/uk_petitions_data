If you believe a sentence given in a Crown Court appears to be very low, or unduly lenient, anyone can contact the Attorney General's office asking for the sentence to be reviewed as long as it is within 28 days of sentencing.\r\n\r\nIt also only takes one person to make such a request. This office cannot review cases that were sentenced in a Magistrates Court. Full details on this scheme can be found on our website www.gov.uk/ago."
