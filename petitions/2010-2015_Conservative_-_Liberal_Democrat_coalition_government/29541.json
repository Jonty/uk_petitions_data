        "additional_details": "England has a substantial legacy of chemical contaminants in soil, much of it caused by industrial and domestic pollution. Land contamination can pose a threat to the environment and the health of humans, animals and plants. Policy in this area addresses:\r\n\r\n\u2022Measures to find and deal with existing contaminated land.\r\n\u2022Measures to prevent more contaminated land being created. These include policy and legislation on pollution, waste, water and chemicals.\r\nMost soils have some small presence of contaminants (eg caused by natural geology and diffuse pollution) but levels of risk are usually very low.  However, some land has the potential to pose unacceptable levels of risk to human health or the environment, including water pollution, in particular some ex-industrial sites and ex-landfills.  Land is only considered to be \u201ccontaminated land\u201d in the legal sense if it poses an unacceptable risk.",
