We have to counteract this trend of the wage gap between lowest and highest incomes becoming ever bigger. Bonuses over \u00a3 50,000.00 need to be subject to a special tax.\r\n\r\nThe governement needs to ensure, that no wages - including boni - of top executives exceed 12 times the lowest wage in any enterprise.\r\n\r\nA progressive tax system for any boni exceeding \u00a3 50,000.00 needs to be introduced.\r\n\r\nBonuses need to be linked to sustainable growth. No boni to be paid, if an enterprise has not grown. The increase in boni payment is to be restricted to the increase in effective, bottom line growth or growth in shareholder payment. Furthermore boni need to be in relation to bottom line profit growth, not to turnover growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
