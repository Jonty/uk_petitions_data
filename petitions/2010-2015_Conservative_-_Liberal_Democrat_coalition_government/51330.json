        "additional_details": "We feel that the government should  make insurance a compulsory requirement for users of mobility scooters in the UK.\r\n\r\nMobility scooter accidents and thefts are a daily occurrence. In order to protect scooter users and the general public at large, we feel that all mobility scooters should be subject to insurance in the same way that cars and motorcycles are.\r\n\r\nThere are now 300,000 scooters in the UK. In order to keep the roads and pavements safe for all users, mobility scooter insurance is a must.",
