        "additional_details": "Like the Greens, Respect have more MPs in Westminster than UKIP. David Cameron should therefore extend the invitation, given to the Greens to join Nigel Farage in the leadership debate, to George Galloway.\r\n\r\nThis is not a petition just of interest to Respect supporters (which I'm not) but for a third of the electorate who now believe UKIP to be a xenophobic and/or racist party.\r\n\r\nUKIP's lies and scaremongering are not being vigorously challenged by the three main party leaders and the BBC is now giving Nigel Farage and other UKIP leading figures an almost daily platform.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence a third of the electorate have no voice on this issue and George Galloway is one of the few MPs who can provide this.",
