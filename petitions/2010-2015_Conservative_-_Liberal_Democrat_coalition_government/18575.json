        "additional_details": "At present if you work in a profession with a position of trust (e.g. doctor, teacher), and you are arrested, the police may inform your employer of the arrest and the circumstances, even if you are never charged or convicted. Many people can and do lose their jobs just because their employer has been informed of an arrest, even if no further action is taken and you are found to be completely innocent.\r\n\r\nThis is grossly unfair to the people in positions of trust who are wrongly arrested and/or found not guilty in a court of law of the crime for which they were (wrongly) accused. This has to stop now. We the undersigned demand that police and other authorities may notify employers of such people ONLY in the event of a conviction - anything other than this goes completely against the principle of innocent until proven guilty.",
