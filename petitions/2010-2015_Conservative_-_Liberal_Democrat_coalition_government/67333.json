A log cabin SHOULD be included if it has two or three bedrooms.\r\n\r\nThey say movable - what if I hire crew with a 1 million pound crane and truck to move it ? In making the law akin to this the government has sold the determination of private property ownership's capabilities -'the owner'- and within a democracy, to be bound by what co-orperations allow them to hire (if rich enough) rather than what the INDIVIDUAL is capable of doing solely as the owner. This is dictatorial legality and jurisprudence not democratic individualism. IT'S TREASON as it is an attack on democratic rights. ",
