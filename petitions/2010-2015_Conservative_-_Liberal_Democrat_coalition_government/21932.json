        "additional_details": "Fire brigades risk their lives to save others. When fires and other accidents occur and people are in danger, only the fire brigades save people, the police are not responsible for saving people\u2019s lives. Without them, more lives would have been lost.\r\nJobs that tend to have lower monetary rewards are jobs that provide more non-monetary rewards e.g. Leisure time & less risk-taking; hence more people are willing to take those jobs. But for fire brigades, their jobs are demanding & high in risk; yet, they still get salaries that are only slightly higher than the average UK salary. Research has shown that shift work increases the chance of health risks, and the shift work causes the fire brigades to sacrifice times that they could spend with family. I think fire brigades should have higher salaries to compensate for the opportunity cost. They deserve more credit for what they do & they certainly deserve a better salary. Please raise the salary for fire brigades!",
