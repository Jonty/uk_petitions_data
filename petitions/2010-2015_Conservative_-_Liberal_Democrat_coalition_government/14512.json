        "additional_details": "We have a chronic accumulation of litter and flytipping but nobody can legally intervene on private land unless it is a health hazard. Furthermore, nobody can be forced to remove waste from their property or nearby public spaces even when it is an eyesore to others unless they can be proven to be the culprits. This is unsatisfactory because it means it may remain there forever and undermines the authorities from sufficiently strenuous interventions even where they can act. (There is a slick of waste in the South Pacific, not the only one, half the size of France.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law must be changed to oblige people to remove litter from their property and the immediate vicinity regardless and for local authorities to enforce it with a limited period, of say, two weeks when they receive a complaint. Unfair? What other measures will allow us to clean up Britain keep Britain tidy?\r\n",
