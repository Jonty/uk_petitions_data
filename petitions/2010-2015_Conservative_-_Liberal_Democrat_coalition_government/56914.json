        "additional_details": "In the light of this week's news that India has launched a mission to Mars, we should question why their government thought it was a greater priority than to feed and house their own citizens.  In a country where a third of the population live in poverty is it right that they receive aid from other countries and charities before they have exhausted their own recourses first. Surely a space mission to Mars is a luxury they cannot afford.",
