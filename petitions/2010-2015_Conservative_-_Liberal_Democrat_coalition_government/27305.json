        "additional_details": "Single parents should not be made to work until their child is mid teens. In Junior school the child is at an age where their educational stage is crucial for their future success within society. Therefore support at home is vital at this time to assist with academic development. In addition to this the child at this age is in an important stage of development socially and emotionally and relies upon the parent to provide support in this area also.\r\nIn addition to this single parents cook clean take care of finances.. etc etc.. They do NOT lie in bed all day... There is ALWAYS something to do either for child house or planning. It is akin to being a 'company director' for if the single parent did not do anything at home or for the child then there would be  breakdown. A closure of the 'company' .  WHY? are single parents being singled out when addicts and people on 'illness' payments are left alone....",
