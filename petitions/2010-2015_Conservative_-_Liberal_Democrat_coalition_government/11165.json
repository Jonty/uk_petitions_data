It makes perfect sense to include those from 16 to 20 years old. The \"Bad Lads\" programme tested this theory, and turned round about 70% of its offenders and some even signed up for the services - that can't be a bad thing. I believe the officers who made the programme even agreed it would be a permanent benefit.",
