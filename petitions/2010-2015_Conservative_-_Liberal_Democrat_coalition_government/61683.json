        "additional_details": "Due to recent budget cuts, the Ebbw Fach Valley (Brynmawr to Aberbeeg) has had its waste disposal site at Bournville, Blaina closed. This has led to an increase in fly tipping which is not only a danger to the public but an unsightly blemish on an area of Wales that is trying to establish itself as a tourism hot spot, to boost the local economy of this already deprived area. The Local council have also began applying compulsory charges for collection of waste which is not affordable to a lot of people in the Ebbw Fach Valley - this  accentuates a need for a sufficient waste disposal site, locally.
