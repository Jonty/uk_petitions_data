        "additional_details": "Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Campaign Director, Dual the A1 Campaign:\r\nWe have achieved the reclassification of the A1 north of Morpeth to the Scottish Border. We are now on the map.  This is a great start. Now we must lobby Government for funding to dual the road.\r\nWe are putting together the economic case for dualling the A1. We need your help.\r\nThe current single carriageway leaves the North East out on a limb.  As a result of this missing road link, we are losing out on inward investment opportunities and on maximizing our regional exports. The North East relies on public sector employment. We need more private sector investment, to stimulate jobs and growth despite government cutbacks.\r\nThe North East could flourish. A dualled A1 would provide a vital base for jobs, growth & new business.\r\nPlease support our campaign to Dual The A1 by signing this e-petition. Go to www.dualthea1.com or email me anne-marie@dualthea1.com if you can help us build the economic case with your experiences.",
