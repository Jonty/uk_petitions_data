        "additional_details": "There is a growing problem within the UK with the number of \"clinics\" practicing dentistry illegally and without the correct cross infection procedures.\r\n\r\nThese are clinics and shops offering tooth whitening services.\r\n\r\nThese are unregulated, and do not have to comply with the correct safety and sterilisation requirements for the provision of dental services. This is putting the general public at risk of cross infection.\r\n\r\nWhile the illegal practice of dentistry is under the remit of the GDC, I would like ANY clinic which offers dental services to be brought under the remit of the CQC and subject to the HTM 01/05 requirements that the government has decreed as the minimum standard for hygiene for dental procedures.",
