The conditions under which they are expected to carry this out are totally unacceptable. Our brave young men, at short notice, some having just returned from Afghanistan, are expected to forego long awaited for family holidays and to live in London (our capital) under very poor conditions (derelict warehouses/schools/tented camps etc). I maintain that this is an unacceptable situation for our brave and courageous young soldiers. The allowances and conditions that are afforded for our other public servants ( the police) should also be afforded to our armed forces. ",
