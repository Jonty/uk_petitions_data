It may support what was deemed to be a poor performance by a ref and show the public why they made the decisions they did. It would also put a stop to cheating and referees who are not up to standard to ref in the football league.\r\n.----------------------------------\r\nThe FA and the Football League should make these reports public in the same way that OFSTED reports of schools are made public and highlight failing schools. It is in the paying football supporters interest to get answers from the person making what can prove to be VERY costly decisions.\r\n\r\n",
