        "additional_details": "A simple idea to make using the London Underground a better experience for all.\r\nAt the moment all the 'Stand On The Right' signs on the Tube's escalators are in English, which is of limited help with the many international tourists who use the system.\r\nIt would make a lot of sense if some of the signs were in other languages as you proceed down the escalator.\r\nPossible languages could include French, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, German and Polish. Then the tourists will be less likely to obstruct busy and, let's face it, often impatient Londoners trying to go about their day.",
