        "additional_details": "The BBC have announced that there will be a Christmas Special Jim'll Fix it with Shane Ritchie hosting the programme. This is clearly an attempt to gain ratings by exploiting the death of a much beloved individual. Sir Jimmy stands for far more than this, in his life he carried out charitable work for no personal gain and only ever used his celebrity status for good.\r\n\r\nThis is insensitive to the feeling of this nation and especially to those of us who grew up watching every Saturday night.\r\n\r\nIt has also been announced that Shane Ritchie, an actor who plays a Southern, Cockney character constantly involved in immoral plot lines and who's personal life has been subject to much controversy is to host the show. I feel that it is an affront on the character of Sir Jimmy Saville.\r\n\r\nI would like to see this programming scrapped, shame on you BBC, these are the tactics of a tabloid not a national broadcaster.",
