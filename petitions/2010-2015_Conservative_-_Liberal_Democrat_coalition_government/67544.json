Publicly condemn the targeting of civilians and the disproportionality of attacks by Israeli forces relative to those of pro-Palestinian groups.\r\n\r\n2. Take steps toward bringing to justice the war criminals of this on-going conflict especially those within the Israeli forces and those in positions of power within the Israeli government.\r\n\r\n3. Take steps in parliament toward putting sufficient pressure on the state of Israel that they may cease their violent endeavours in Palestine. Such steps may include embargoes, sanctions and banning Israeli government officials from visiting the country.\r\n\r\n4. Urge our allies in the USA to join us in our condemnation of Israel and to cease funding their illegal activities.",
