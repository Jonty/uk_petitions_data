Reducing crime rates on the street, increasing the strength of our forces and giving money back the the victims of crime, from half of the wage of the criminal. Also freeing up prisons and saving the TAX payer money. We need our country to be strong and we need to show the criminals of this country, that CRIME DOES NOT PAY. A fine is not enough, remember BAD LADS ARMY. It works now lets put it into use for the benefit of this wonderful country.",
