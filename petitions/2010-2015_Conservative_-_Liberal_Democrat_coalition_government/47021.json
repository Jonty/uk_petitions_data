        "additional_details": "Customs is paid to protect British interests and businesses.\r\nAn understandable argument as to why people should be charged customs on imports from outside the UK/ EU, when the good purchased are purchased from another country purely to save money - An item available in the UK, but cheaper off our own shores.\r\n\r\nBut why should we be forced to pay customs charges on goods which are not available in our own country? Businesses are behind trends for a lot of people and they are therefore forced to buy from outside the UK where they can find these goods.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to ask the government to redefine what a customable good is for private buyers. If an item is proven not to be available in the UK/EU then it should not be charged.\r\n",
