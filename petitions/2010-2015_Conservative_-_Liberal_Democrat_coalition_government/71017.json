        "additional_details": "I want the government to fund for vulva patients or any type of skin cancer to have full body scan on there check-ups every 3 months to see if the cancer has reoccurred. i know it cost nhs but it will save the cost of future treatments if detected early. and it will save on more deaths of vulva patients each year. my mum died on 29th august 2014 from vulva cancer and if this was detected earlier by a scan then she would still be alive. the facts are that if this vulva cancer is detected early then its curable .please sign if any of your close relative has died from the same thing. if this is signed then we can save lives of those who are suffering now",
