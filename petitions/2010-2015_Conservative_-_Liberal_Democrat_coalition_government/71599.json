        "additional_details": "The Conservative leader of the Commons announced on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show \"The UK will help jihadists returning from Iraq and Syria to recover if they have \u201cgood intentions\u201d about stopping others joining the conflict.\r\n\r\nBy joining the \"Islamic State\" they have chosen to forgo their rights to British Citizenship in favour of an Internationally recognised Terrorist Organisation. Therefore removing passports etc will not make them stateless as they have willingly joined a \"state\" and all that it offers in return.\r\n\r\nWith the ever increasing threat to anyone in a uniform as demonstrated with the recent burning of an Army Cadet, it is clear that the Government is failing the people of this country with this course of action. This e-petition wants the Government to re-think its security strategy on returning Jihadis and take positive steps to ensure our nations security.",
