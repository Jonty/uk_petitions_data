        "additional_details": "Our politicians have yet again swept this issue under the carpet. The EU is deeply undemocratic, however, every government since Edward Heath has allowed us to slide further into the control of this flawed construct. To allow an unaccountable, unelected elite to continue to control our lives is an abuse of democracy. The present global economic problem would not be as acute were it not for the single currency debacle. A referendum on repatriating the CAP and Fisheries policies, health and safety, employment laws and the power of our courts, to name but a few, should take place asap.",
