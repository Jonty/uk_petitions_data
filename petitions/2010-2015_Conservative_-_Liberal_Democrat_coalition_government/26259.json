It is actually the case that we didn't vote for him - he was allowed to be Prime minister due to the actions of the Liberal Democrat party, to whom David has shown no humility but only contempt. Again, we can only say sorry and hope that your new plan and treaty will work for you. Your's sincerely, your friends on the ground \"the people\"",
