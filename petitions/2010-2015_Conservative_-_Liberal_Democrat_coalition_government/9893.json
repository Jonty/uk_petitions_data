This would allow for those complaining they can not find work, a paid job  (at minimum wage) for two years and also learn the life skills and respect that would make getting work in the future easier. I do not suggest unless they decide to 'sign up to the services' that they be sent to front-lines. They could however back up the Police in this country and learn to respect their own country and areas.",
