Hard working people are constantly having their utility bills increased; the small amount of disposable income they have is systematically being eroded, whilst the utility companies make obscene profits per customer (\u00a315 -\u00a3125 in 3 months!)\r\n\r\nTogether with general rising living costs (food, clothing, fuel and transport etc)  the 'little people' are being bled dry!\r\n\r\nPlease sign up if you agree that action needs to be taken ",
