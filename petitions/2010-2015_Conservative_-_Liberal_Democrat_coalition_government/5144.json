        "additional_details": "I think it's disgusting that over 65's have to pay a daily standing charge on their utility meters and also the line rental on their telephone line. Some of the utility meters have been in homes for years and years and have earned the greedy utility companies hundreds if not thousands of pounds in daily standing charges.Also anyone over 65 should not have to pay a telephone line rental because in the majority of cases the rental more than outweighs the actual call charges,i personally have had my phone line for over 35 years and have never had cause to call out BT to repair it,so how many similar cases are there. The utility companies and Bt make vast sums of money off these charges and to give pensioners relief of these charges would be a charitable course of action.",
