        "additional_details": "Michael Gove is suggesting getting the Queen a \u00a360 million+ yacht for the diamond jubilee. We, the undersigned think this would be an insult to those suffering in these times of great austerity. We propose that the Government follow the Great British tradition of us all pulling together in tough times by presenting Her Majesty with the same gifts her subjects receive for long service, namely A Chrome Carriage Clock from H Samuels, a  \u00a320 WH Smith voucher and a pair of microwave slippers.",
