        "additional_details": "Its coming up to 25 years since the bus services were taken out of council control and left to the private sector to manage. This has led to only profitable routes having good levels of service/none for less popular ones.  In addition this has meant lower patronage with higher fares. The only place where bus patronage has increased is London, who still have the old system!\r\n Lets get every other part of the country having the London system, and out of the mercy of the big operators.",
