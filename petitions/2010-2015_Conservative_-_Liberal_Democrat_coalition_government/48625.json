        "additional_details": "I was very dismayed by the position of  the group called Friends of Zimbabwe,which recently held a meeting here in London on the pretext of trying to normalise realtions with the dictatorship government of Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe.There has been no change in the way Mugabe`s governmnet behaves and treat people,people are still being brutalised day in day out ,no  basic freedoms as enshrined in the Human Rights Charter.Mugabe should return the rule of law allow free and fair elections,stop harassing and torturing human rights defenders both lawyers and activists,stop making Zimbabwe a police state.The just ended referendum which many foreign governments said was free and fair,does show that they were haste is saying that. The information coming out shows that it was rigged. I kindly ask the British government through the foreign office to consider their dealings with the rogue regime in Zimbabwe.",
