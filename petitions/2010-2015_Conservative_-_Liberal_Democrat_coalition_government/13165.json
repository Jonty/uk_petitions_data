Achieve this through increased investment in Britain's railways and subsidising season tickets for workers.\r\nRail travel costs commuters thousands of pounds each year, which in the current ecomomic environment is not sustainable. Planned increases demonstate a disregard for the financial hardship this will cause to thousands of families and will exclude many people from jobs in our cities. Stop them now. ",
