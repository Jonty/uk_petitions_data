Huge broadband capacity:\r\n-\tallows transmission of data for any purpose between millions of points.\r\n-\tshrinks communication time to virtually zero\r\n-\tcan be built in a few years with cables, masts and satellites minimising political opposition\r\n-\tallows emerging technologies like 3D printing to be used to revolutionise the distribution of goods just as  current capacity has revolutionised the distribution of services, with benefits to the depressed regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
