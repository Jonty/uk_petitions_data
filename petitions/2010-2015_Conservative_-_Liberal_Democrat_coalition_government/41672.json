This will destroy remaining wildlife habitat, like grass lands, ponds, bogs and woods.\r\n\r\n-Since 1930, 98% of wildflower meadows, that are bumble bee habitat have been lost to farming, and development.\r\n\r\nWe urge the government to reduce immigration into the UK as wildlife has a right to thrive here.",
