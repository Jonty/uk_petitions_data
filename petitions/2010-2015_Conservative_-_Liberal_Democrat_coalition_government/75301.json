        "additional_details": "The fact that ritually-slaughtered meat is being inadvertently sold and consumed, unbeknownst to the general public, is deeply worrying.\r\n\r\nInhumane methods are necessitated by ritual-slaughter which contravene established animal-rights' legislature. However, an outright ban on ritual-slaughter is discouraged by the Government in an effort to uphold the religious rights of Muslim and Jewish populations.\r\n\r\nRespectively, the Government must also acknowledge that certain religious doctrines (Sikhism & Hinduism) PROHIBIT the consumption of ritually-slaughtered meat, in addition to irreligious individuals who would presumably object to the idea of consuming ritually-slaughtered meat on principle.\r\n\r\nThe notion that ritually-slaughtered meat is being 'infiltrated' into supermarkets is something we consider absolutely unconscionable. Therefore, our proposal is that all meat-packaging should accompany a clear indication regarding whether the animal has been ritually-slaughtered or not. ",
