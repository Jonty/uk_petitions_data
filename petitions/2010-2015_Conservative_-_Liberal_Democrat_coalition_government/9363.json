If people are gonna have children, they must take on the responsibility of bringing them up to be decent members of society.\r\nDumping your kids out there, as soon as they reach secondary school, is not an option.\r\nIf you are going to have children, you must bring them up properly, or pay the price.\r\nCutting benefits, or evicting families from council housing will not fix the problem. The threat of jail for the parent(s) will focus their minds' on the job!",
