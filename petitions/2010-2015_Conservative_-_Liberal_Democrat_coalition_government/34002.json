        "additional_details": "In May 2012 it was learned through the media that a double agent infiltrated Al Queda and prevented a potential terrorist attrocity through an \"underwear bomb\".  This person, who it is alleged may hold a British passport, clearly took massive personal risks, but also has probably saved hundreds of innocent lives - quite possibly many of them British.\r\n\r\nClearly, for the safety of them and their family, this person's public anonymity must be preserved.  However, we ask that the British government identifies the individual, and if they are deserving, make an appropriate award on behalf of the British people, for their bravery, selflessness, and saving of lives.\r\n\r\nWe also ask, having done so, that our government tell the British public what has been done on our behalf.",
