        "additional_details": "On Friday 23rd September 2011 British Transport Police in association with Avon and Somerset Special Constabulary, set up Metal Detectors/Body Scanners at Bath Spa Railway Station. We the undersigned believe that the police have adequate powers as they can arrest someone for being dunk and/or disorderly and, in addition they have stop and search powers of anyone they believe is carrying an illegal item. We therefore petition that due to their intrusiveness, inconvenience, cost and unjust/unfair nature that body scanners/full body metal detectors are not to be used on any other transport passengers than those boarding an aeroplane.",
