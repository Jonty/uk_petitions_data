        "additional_details": "I want the government to set up a missing child alert system, similar to the AMBER Alert in the states where when a child is reported missing, alerts are sent via SMS to mobile devices giving all the details of the missing child and any supporting information such as if the child was witnessed being abducted, car reg dets etc. These alerts can also be sent to motorway electronic signs, electronic billboards, networked display points such as lottery terminals in supermarkets. Anything that has a display and can be changed centrally. The first few hours of a child going missing are by far the most important, and if getting the information out there early helps track a child down, especially if they have been abducted surely can only be a good thing.",
