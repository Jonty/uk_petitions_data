        "additional_details": "Do not let this man go free, humans will die.\r\nGregory Davis is a killer who was convicted of the double manslaughter of Dorothy Rogers and her son Michael Rogers in 2003. He is currently serving an indefinite sentence in Littlemore Hospital.\r\nIt was at a Mental Health Tribunal at the beginning of the month when the conditional discharge of Davis was agreed, despite only serving seven-and-a-half years in psychiatric institutions.\r\nIn a random, frenzied attack with no apparent motive he took a knife and a hammer to the Milton Keynes home of Dorothy Rogers in 2003 and stabbed the 48-year-old 31 times.\r\nHer 19-year-old son Michael tried to escape but was chased to a children's playground where Davis stabbed, bludgeoned, then disembowelled him.\r\nA third victim, Dorothy's boyfriend Mick Cowles, was also attacked with a hammer and seriously injured.  Afterwards, with his victims lying in pools of blood, Davis calmly picked up his girlfriend and took her on a date.\r\n",
