        "additional_details": " Unicef UK has received a letter from Dr Dan Poulter, Minister for Public Health, turning down their request for funding to maintain the National Infant Feeding Network. This means that the Government has now abdicated all leadership responsibility for infant feeding in England as is recommended in the WHO Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding. This, together with closure of the Infant Feeding Survey, means that protecting, supporting and promoting evidence based infant feeding practice for mothers and families is marginalised and made more difficult.\r\n\r\nPlease sign if you would like to protest this decision.\r\n",
