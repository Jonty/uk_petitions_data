It is vital in early development to expose children to a variety of situations and life events outside of formal education.  Although educational attainment is of high importance, life skills and confidence can be gained from a plethora of activities, ventures and events, which in turn can aid and encourage formal learning.\r\nCurrently the education system does not recognize important life events as authorized absences.\r\n\r\nParental graduations, family visits (from non residing countries) short breaks and outings can be as educational and informative as a day in school. Not to join the holiday argument, but a foreign holiday, culture and language are more influential and informative than a week of phonics.\r\n\r\n",
