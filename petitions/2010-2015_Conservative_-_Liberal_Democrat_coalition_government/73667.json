Bonymaen Family Centre was established in 1999, for over 15 years they have worked with Children, Young People and their families within this community, providing lots of services, support, advice and friendship. We would like to invite all friends, colleagues, partners and supporters to sign the petition in the hope that they can sustain what we believe to be a vital service in this area. Please share your support.",
