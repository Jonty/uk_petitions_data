        "additional_details": "We petition the government to stop the closure of Remploy Factories and the privatisation of Remploy Employment Services.\r\n\r\nSince its inception following the second world war, Remploy quickly developed into the biggest and most important employer of disabled people in Britain, and still continues today to provide sustainable employment for those men and women returning from active service. Employees now face the threat of closure.\r\n\r\nWe therefore urge the cessation closure of the Remploy Factory sites and instruct the DWP to enter into meaningful discussion on the structure and future of Remploy and the whole of supported employment programme in Britain with a view to introducing a new vision based on public procurement work.\r\n\r\nWe also petition to stop the privatisation of Remploy Employment Services which will lead to the deterioration of the provision of employment opportunities for disabled people now and in the future.",
