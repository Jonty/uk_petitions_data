        "additional_details": "Allowing cycles to pass through red traffic lights will help visibility for all vehicle drivers especially high sided vehicles. It will also eleviate the problem of clusters of cyclists waiting for traffic lights to change. Cyclists are safer in motion and ahead of cars.\r\n\r\nA cyclist must give way to pedestrians and other vehicles and then only proceed if safe to do so.\r\n\r\nOn safety grounds this idea is already in force in many parts of continental Europe.\r\n\r\nThis petition is not anti-car or pro-cyclist. This makes sense for all road users to make roads safer and traffic to flow more fluidly.\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition :-)\r\n\r\n",
