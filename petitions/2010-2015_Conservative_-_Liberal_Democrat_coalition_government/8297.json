It would help direct the crowd, and also provide a way for much smaller police teams to disperse much larger crowds where they are confronted.\r\n\r\nThis is a much less aggressive approach, and as long as research is invested in to ensure that these devices can minimise the possiblity of serious ear/hearing problems, I think the sacrifice overweighs the anarchist scenes we have seen in the past few days.\r\n\r\nI hope that our Government have a serious look at this, and also this petition recieves the support that it deserves.\r\n\r\n",
