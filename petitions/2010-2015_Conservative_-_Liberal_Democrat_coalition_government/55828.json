        "additional_details": "An increase in vegetarianism and veganism would benefit the health of the nation by reducing consumption of red meats, and reducing the amount of money spent on the NHS.\r\n\r\nMillions of pounds from tax payer's money is spent on helping people suffering from countless diet related problems, and the health benefits of cutting down on animal products is undeniable.\r\nMany people are concerned that removing meat from their diet would mean spending more money, which is simply not true. If knowledge of vegetarian recipes became more widely known, it may attract more people to the diet and improve their general health.\r\n\r\nIf the government promoted vegetarianism and veganism as a cheap and positive step to improve lifestyle, it would not only improve Britain's growing levels of obesity-it would save lives.",
