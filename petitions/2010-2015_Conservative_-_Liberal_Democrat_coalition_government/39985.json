Stand up for fairness and equality and force the coaliation to back track!\r\nAfter all is it fair to tax a single member of the family rather than the whole family. This means from Jan 2013, if one adult earns more than \u00a350k the benefit will reduce, and if you earn over \u00a360k it will stop!\r\nBut if 2 adults in the same family earn \u00a349k each they will retain the benefit is this fair!\r\nRemember as a government this country wastes billions a year on over seas aid to countrys whom potentially do not use properly. The small saving this change will make is minimal compared to other areas.\r\nIt is time to tell this government it is about fairness and we are not all in this together!",
