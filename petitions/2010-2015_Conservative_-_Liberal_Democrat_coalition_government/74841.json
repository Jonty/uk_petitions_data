        "additional_details": "The United Kingdoms and the Commonwealth community must condemned the  Malaysia authorities continued violation of the human rights and demand the Malaysia authorities immediate release of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. The conviction of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim after seven years of politically motivated proceedings under an abusive and archaic law is a major setback for human rights in Malaysia. On February 10, 2015, the Federal Court of Malaysia upheld a lower court ruling and sentenced Anwar to five years in prison for violating Malaysia\u2019s sodomy law. Prime Minister Najib Razak\u2019s government has persisted in its politically motivated prosecution of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim at the expense of democratic freedoms and the rights to non-discrimination and privacy for all Malaysians. Allowing this travesty of justice to stand will further undermine respect for rights and democracy in Malaysia. ",
