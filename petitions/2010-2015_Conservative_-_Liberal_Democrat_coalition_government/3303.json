Many irresponsible pet owners take little interest in their animals and allow unfettered roaming and fouling nuisance day and night.  Abadoned cats and dogs fill our sanctuaries throughout the country.  The dog licensing system should be reintroduced to include the domesticated cat.  A sensible 3 figure annual rate would be accepted by any dedicated pet owner, but deter the irresponsible.  Guide dogs exempt and a rebate for pensioners.",
