        "additional_details": "The previous campaign, Lighter Later, in 2011 outlined the potential benefits of not moving the clocks back to Grenwich Meantime and leaving an extra hour of daylight in the evening. Dr Garnsey from the University of Cambridge found that an estimated 450,000 tonnes of CO2 could be saved annually, 450 road accidents could be prevented which could also save the NHS \u00a3200m a year in treatment and there would be a potential reduction in crime and a greater possibility of outdoor activities in the evening may help to reduce obesity.\r\n\r\nPlease consider these benefits once again and take the debate to Parliament. We need 100,000 names on this e-petition to do this. Thank you\r\n\r\n\r\n",
