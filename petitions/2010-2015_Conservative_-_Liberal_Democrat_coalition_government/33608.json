It must be, therefore, that at the very least he MUST NOT be elevated to the House of Lords.  To put him there packs the House with people who failed to perform while they were being paid with taxpayer pounds.  That is tantamount to theft and to reward him by lifting him to the House of Lords is a dreadful and devastating insult to those people now suffering directly as a result of his self admitted failure to merely to the job he was being paid for.",
