        "additional_details": "Amend the Housing Acts of 1988 and 1996 to provide a minimum guaranteed term of two years for all residential lettings.\r\n\r\nIn order to accommodate tenants who do not require a property for the full two year term, all tenancy contracts should include a clause allowing for the tenant to assign their interest in the property to a third party.  Such an assignment would require the agreement of the landlord, which agreement should not be unreasonably withheld.\r\n\r\nShould the landlord wish to sell the property during the term, he must assign his interest in the tenancy to the new owner who would then become landlord for the remainder of the term.\r\n\r\nRemove the right of the Landlord to terminate the tenancy before the expiry of the contract except where the tenant is in breach of their contractual obligations. No amendment would be required in relation to the tenant as they do not have such a right under current legislation.\r\n",
