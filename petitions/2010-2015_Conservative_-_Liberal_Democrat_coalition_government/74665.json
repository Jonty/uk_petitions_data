        "additional_details": "Since forever, hair colour, tattoos and piercings have been considered \"un-professional\" in the workplace.\r\nYet in the past, sailors and soldiers had tattoos to pride their line of work.\r\nIt's time to stop discrimination and start providing equality to everyone. Hair colour, piercings and tattoos have no effect on the persons work, and their ability to complete their tasks. It does not effect how they raise their children, but it's effecting how they bring home the money to provide for them.\r\nSome people express themselves through modifying their body, and we should respect that, and encourage it, not force them to remove parts or change themselves just to keep their job. You wouldn't ask a redheaded woman to dye her hair black because you thought ginger was unprofessional would you?\r\nPlease share to anyone you know who has any body mods and has had to change for work!",
