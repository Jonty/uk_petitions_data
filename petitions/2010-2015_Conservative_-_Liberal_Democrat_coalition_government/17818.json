        "additional_details": "I believe it should made illegal for any company in the United Kingdom to refuse to sell a product or provide a service because the buyer has a BFPO address. At present it is the case. For example, banks will refuse to open accounts without a different address. Some companies will currently refuse to ship to BFPO addresses. And more besides.\r\n\r\nMembers of our armed forces - as well as civil servants from a range of government departments - who are serving overseas are separated from their friends and family. The BFPO is an essential lifeline. A soldier in Afghanistan, Germany, the Falklands for example may not have a different address while there. UK companies should not be permitted to disciminate against these men and women while they are serving their country. ",
