If that transpires the chance of a 'Too Big To Fail' mentality is indeed very high. It is imperative therefore  that any government intervention in the 'Saving of liquidity' is made only for the benefit of ordinary/business account holders, not Bank shareholders, not Bank Directors, not the defaulting Bank in any shape or form.In other words 'COMPENSATE' the account holders only and let those Banks that are clearly negligent go to the wall.Such a policy will not only concentrate the 'Banker/Casino mentality mindset but will ensure ordinary citizens are not unduly penalized by those that wish to gamble with 'OUR ALREADY TAXED INCOME' .\r\n\r\n",
