        "additional_details": "Making politics a mandatory subject in all secondary schools may increase public participation and we may see the voting age reduced to 16 in the near future, therefor making the UK significantly more democratic.\r\n\r\nIt will increase the knowledge of the subject throughout the country and create a generation of educated citizens on a subject which is critical to their lives and the country as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe government should take action by making students receive one hour of education a week in politics. This will make it clear how politics works in the UK and on a international scale.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as a student, I understand that the majority of my peers are disillusioned about politics, and very few fail to understand how the government works.\r\n\r\nIf they understand the subject, they may also develop an interest which could increase the number of candidates running to be a Member of Parliament, therefor making voting more contested.",
