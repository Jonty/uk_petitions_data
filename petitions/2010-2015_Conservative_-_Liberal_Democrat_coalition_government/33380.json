If the vehicle is not taxed/MOT'd then the sale of fuel should be prohibited. Obviously this wouldn't prevent offenders from filling petrol cans but will certainly make it more difficult for them.  The system should be \"Closed\" so that it can not be used by a third party to look up details about the driver. ",
