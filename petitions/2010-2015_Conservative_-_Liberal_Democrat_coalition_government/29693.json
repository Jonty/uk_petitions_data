        "additional_details": "\u00a3100 is in circulation in the UK. An apple costs \u00a31. The Government needs to build a road. It will cost \u00a350. The Government takes \u00a350 off us as tax. The Government builds its road. We can now buy 50 apples with our \u00a350.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the Government prints \u00a3100. Because the money supply has doubled, \u00a3100 is now worth \u00a350. The Government builds its road. We can now buy 50 apples with our \u00a3100.\r\n\r\nWhy do it the second way? We can throw out 99% our convoluted tax laws. No need for a tax collection bureaucracy. No need for 99% of companies or individuals to file any kind of tax return, ever. No need for tax lawyers or accountants. A pure efficiency gain.\r\n\r\nWhy sales tax? I'm a smoker. Smoking is bad for people and costs the NHS. The price of smoking needs to be high to discourage usage. A sales tax achieves that.\r\n\r\nNo throwing money from helicopters though. Hyperinflation sucks. Independent experts would calculate how much could healthily be printed. The limit would be binding.",
