Additionally the detailed rules and operating hours can be difficult to read without stopping your vehicle and carefully examining the writing on the sign.\r\n\r\nDrivers who visit a  strange town or city  may not be familiar with the specific and unique operating hours in that town.\r\n\r\nIt is unreasonable to have bus lane  regulations operating 24 hours a day and 7 days a week,  when there are very few busses on the road.\r\n\r\nSo, please consider restricting the proliferation of new bus lanes.  And ask Local authorities to cut down on the current bus lanes.\r\nThey are counter productive.",
