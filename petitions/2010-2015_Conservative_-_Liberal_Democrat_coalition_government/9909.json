        "additional_details": "While visible speed cameras arguably provide a deterrant to excessive speed with a financial consequence of speeding past them, there is ample opportunity for the driver to see the camera and slow down,  acheiving the desired effect: safety.  Unfortunately some camera vans are operated using an \"ambush\" method which, rather than creating safer road conditions, cause surprised drivers to react in a panic, creating dangerous situations.  Stricter regulations should control the positioning and methods used by camera vans.",
