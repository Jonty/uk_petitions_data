        "additional_details": "The economic and social crises which have been visited upon the vast majority of the people of Great Britain are direct results of centuries old greed and corruption of the few, universally acknowledged as the very corner stones of the entity known as the City of London. We demand the repeal in it's entirety of Clause 9 of Magna Carta, which gives to the City of London an untenable and unmerited position in a modern, democratic & accountable society, together with guarantee that no common laws or statutes will be countenanced, now or at any time in the future, which perpetuate, preserve, or foster a preferential position for the City of London, in fact or in spirit.",
