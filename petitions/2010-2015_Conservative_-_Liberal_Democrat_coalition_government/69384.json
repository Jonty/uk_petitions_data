        "additional_details": "It's about time the Mental Health Services on the Isle of Wight were given more funding.  The rate of suicide on the island has dramatically increased recently and mental health workers themselves have said there isn't the funding available to help people living with mental health problems.  You have to wait until you are in severe crisis to get noticed and this is completely out of order. People are in crisis all over the island and they can't access the help because it's not there.",
