        "additional_details": "In view of the fact that Prime Minister Thatcher remains such a devise and controversial figure with the British people, it would be wrong to give her a state funeral, but by the same token, it would also be wrong to give her same funeral quite rightly afforded to The Queen Mother and Princess Dianna.\r\nFurthermore, I believe she would prefer the market to meet the costs; not our society - since society does not exist.\r\nShe has had afternoon tea with the war criminal Pinochet; destroyed communities in Great Britain and prolonged the conflict in Northern Ireland.\r\nAs for the below blasphemy, that is now in the hands of a higher authority.\r\nWhere there was love, let me sow hatred;\r\nWhere there was pardon, injury;\r\nWhere there was hope, doubt;\r\nWhere there was light, darkness;\r\nAnd where there was joy, sadness.",
