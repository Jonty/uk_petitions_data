        "additional_details": "Most vehicles, including HGV now have electronic fuel injection. The government should legislate that as each vehicle comes up for testing, and all new vehicles, are fitted with a GPS speed restrictor working via the electronic injection system. This would mean that the speed limits at almost any location in the UK could not be exceeded.  It would also mean that advisory speed limits would be effective in situations such as fog/roadworks/accidents etc. For example, as a vehicle passes a 30mph sign the vehicle would be unable to exceed 30mph irrespective of the drivers wishes.",
