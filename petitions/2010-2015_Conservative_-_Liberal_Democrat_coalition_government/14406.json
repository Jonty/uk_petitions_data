        "additional_details": "The fact is that the turnout of voters is decreasing, and the youth feel alienated from the system. Whilst a 16 year-old can be fully-employed and contribute to society in taxes, they can simultaneously have no say on the government. As a 17 year-old I am frustrated I cannot vote, so I am appealing that the age limits are lowered. Not only will it restore rights of equality, it will encourage teenagers to take a keener approach to the way our country is run, instead of feeling entirely dissociated.",
