        "action": "Devolve Environment Agency's regulatory role to local councils",
        "additional_details": "The Environment Agency has a budget of \u00a31.3bn with responsibility for protecting the environment, property and human health. We have witnessed over many years the failures of this QUONGO in administering its duties. It is becoming more apparent that the regulatory roles and relevant responsibilities it posses should be devolved back to the local councils and people, who are in a far better position to know what their 'local' environment and industry requires. Having worked inside the Environment Agency, I have further witnessed the contempt for the ordinary tax payers and licence payers, large scale abuse of working time and holiday entitlements by staff, with full support of management, and excessive pay scales. This is during a time where the budgets for health, pension, defence and local councils are being cut by large amounts. An indepth review of the Environment Agency, it's working practices and the abuse tax payers money should be opened up. Please sign this petition.",
