        "additional_details": "The corruption in the Sierra Leone government had become too much but Britain keep providing aid and support to Sierra Leone. As a Sierra Leone National with British citizenship, I cannot stand by and see my countrys government pocket the money that is given to them to help people. From education to health care, the country is not doing well and this Ebola crisis has highlighted the problem further so I feel something must be done. ",
