        "additional_details": "The public sector spends an inordinate amount of money on expenses.  School's pay huge amounts of money for equipment, the NHS spends huge amounts of money on equipment.  Why are these such huge amounts?  Why can't the public sector be ran more like the private sector does?  A business owner would shop around and try and get the cheapest possible deal for supplies.  The public sector doesn't have the time or the resources to shift, and try to curb the huge amount of spending.\r\n\r\nThis petition is targeted at making the government aware that running the public sector more efficiently could save huge amounts of jobs, keep people in work, and probably help the economy recover in a less harmful way.",
