It's not as rare as you think!\r\n\r\nChildren lose their ability to walk, breathe, eat and speak, eventually they die an agonising death often before they reach the age of 20. Their minds are unaffected so they know whats coming.\r\n\r\nThe government need to fund research to FIND A CURE and put an end to this horrific condition.\r\n\r\nPlease help us PETITION THE GOVERNMENT for funding for RESEARCH into this terrible condition.  PUT DUCHENNE IN THE HISTORY BOOKS WHERE IT BELONGS!!\r\n\r\n",
