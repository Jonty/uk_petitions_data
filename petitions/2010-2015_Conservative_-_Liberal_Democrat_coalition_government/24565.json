        "additional_details": "The Chancellor's Autumn Budget Statement has announced that public sector pay will only go up by 1% per year for 2 years when current pay freezes expire in either 2012 and 2013, but that core benefits payments will go up by 5.2% in 2012/13. In a time of austerity everyone should share the burden of necessary public spending restraint to bring down the deficit. This petition asks that the Government keep benefit increases capped to the 1% yearly increases in 2012-2015 that public sector workers are facing.It also asks that any savings are used to increase the personal income tax allowance, taking more people out of tax, benefiting the after-tax incomes of all workers and increasing the incentive to work.\r\n",
