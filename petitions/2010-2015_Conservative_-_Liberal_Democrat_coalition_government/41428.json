        "additional_details": "Serving one of the most densely populated areas of the capital, Whitechapel Fire Station has been protecting the community in the heart of East London since 1874.\r\n\r\nThe fire station's ground contains a large section of the City of London's commercial and business areas. These include the Royal London Hospital & Air Ambulance, the tourist areas in and around the Tower of London and the cosmopolitan area of Brick Lane.\r\n\r\nThe station also serves one of the largest mosques in the Uk which can accommodate up to 5000 worshippers.\r\n\r\nWhitechapel Fire Station is currently earmarked for closure along with 16 other stations in London due to savage cuts to public sector budgets. This will result in a 40% reduction in fire cover for Tower Hamlets.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to reverse the decision to close Whitechapel Fire Station.\r\n\r\nIf implemented, these cuts will inevitably threaten public safety.\r\n\r\nThank you for your support.",
