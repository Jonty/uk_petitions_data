        "additional_details": "Amputees should have access to the latest technology when being supplied with prosthetics on the NHS. Sadly it seems that only the basics are offered, and although they do provide a service of sorts it falls far short of what is available. Merely having a  replacement limb to fill a sleeve or trouser leg is not good enough, they should be as functional as possible. Medical engineers have dedicated their time to developing wonderful prosthetic limbs to give the patient the maximum amount of mobility. This technology should be available to all, not just those who can raise the tens of thousands of pounds for the privilege. It's fundamentally and morally wrong.",
