Nowadays the term is often tossed around, a lack of respect which according to the ONS, 2013 has resulted in a 42% rate of divorce.\r\n\r\nConsidering that almost 50% of these Divorces in 2012 left more than 236,000 children in a position where there family life's were ultimately disrupted, the matter is no more a joke than it is a myth.\r\n\r\nIt is the belief of those who sign this petition that the Government should introduce an alternative process thereby making the process of obtaining a more strenuous, but earnest process.\r\nA realistic approach where the traditional values of love are the most potent inhibitions for the taking of such important vows.\r\n\r\n It is these vows that should be are embedded throughout the duration of a Couple's life regardless of age, race or gender to the benefit of the both the self and family.\r\n",
