I saw three separate doctors who all turned me away knowing I wouldn't be given a smear test due to my age. It wasn't until I told them, I am fortunate enough to have private medical insurance that they were keen to refer me.\r\nI'd like to raise awareness to help get the age of smear tests on the NHS reduced to 18 where circumstances indicate abnormalities.\r\nI have been very fortunate and the cancerous cells have been caught early but if I had to wait until I am 25, this could have been a very different story. I am currently getting treatment to remove all the affected cells.",
