        "additional_details": "I believe the continued use of a term from thousands of years ago is a cornerstone of sexism and inequality. We are not all kinds of 'Man,' we are all kinds of 'Human.' Even the term 'Human' is gender biased, but it is culturally considered a neutral and positive name for our species.\r\n\r\nThe term 'mankind' is one the most fundamental, and one of the earliest examples of conditioning that we are exposed to.\r\n\r\nWe are also, finally, beginning to accept that nature is not as clear cut as we are led to believe, and that there are indeed more than 2 genders. Yes male and female are both needed for reproduction, but not for life. You can be any 'gender' and live. If you are alive you are part of the same system as everything else that is alive. Logical progression states that we are all, therefore, born equal.\r\n\r\nEven with the increased connectivity in the world, we are becoming more isolated. We need to eradicate those things that condition us to feel unequal within our own species.\r\n",
