        "additional_details": "I would like the government to get the police service to remove minor cautions after a period of 5 years of no re-offending, it is unfair that a person issued with a simple caution should pay for it all their lives by it showing up on CRB checks. It restricts their ability to forward or better themselves as people are excluded from all but the best jobs. Teachers for example cannot teach if they have a simple caution. Not right im afraid, for something so minor that it doesnt warrant the crown prosecuting over - people should not pay for it for life!\r\n\r\nIf people do not re-offend in the 5 year period, then delete their record for the purpose of CRB or enhanced CRB",
