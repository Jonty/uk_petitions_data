        "additional_details": "Currently there is no real price competition on the railways, in spite of privatisation.  Different energy companies don't have their own wire and pipe networks.  They compete for the right to bill you.  The same should apply to train operators.  Even if Virgin don't run trains to Newcastle, there;s no reason why they should be able to sell you a ticket to go there.  Opening up ticket prices to real competition can only benefit travellers.
