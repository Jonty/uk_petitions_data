        "additional_details": "Newly created legislation always goes further than initially intended and this often goes unnoticed. So a law to help regulate the press could be the start of a very slippery slope. The idea may seem well thought out and non intrusive now, but in five years time after small amendments and alterations that happen with time who knows where we will be.  The idea of a state controlled press may seem farfetched, but to say yes to this law is one small step down that road. A road that is very hard to get off.\r\n",
