        "additional_details": "The recent break-down of law and order in London is explicit proof that the police are currently powerless to defend the law abiding majority. The starkest proof has now been provided that liberalism has failed on a massive scale.\r\n\r\nI propose empowering the police to use all necessary force to control and destroy public disorder. The deterrent is currently not sufficient as evidenced by recent events.\r\n\r\nAnyone carrying a potentially lethal weapon, such as a petrol bomb, knives and guns are legitimate targets. Such disregard for the rule of the law and the lives of others must result in the loss of human rights for the perpetuators.",
