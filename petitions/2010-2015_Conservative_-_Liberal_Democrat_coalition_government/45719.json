        "additional_details": "To the House of Commons. The Petition of Citizens of Hull declares their belief that Hull has been hit by an unfairly large share of the cuts imposed on local councils by the Coalition Government.\r\n\r\nWe note that these cuts have so far amounted to \u00a3163.50 per person in Hull \u2014 more than double the national average of \u00a374 per person. We further note that Hull is due to lose 7.2% more in the two years until 2015, and that Hull City Council would have millions more to spend on local services and to keep the council tax down if Hull was given fairer funding.\r\n\r\nWe ask the House of Commons to urge the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government to give Hull a Fair Deal. The Petitioners remain, etc.\r\n",
