        "additional_details": "We are signing this petition in hope that UK government will realise that instead of participating in military exercises in Ukraine, instead of arming the Ukrainian Armed Forces, instead of continuously trying to put blame onto Russia for destabilising the situation we should be sending our own humanitarian aid to citizens of Eastern Ukraine. Those people are not rebels, they aren't 'terrorists' and yet they have been under bombardment for many months. Ordinary citizens of Donetsk and Luhansk are suffering from the lack of food, water and medications.\r\nBritain must act now.",
