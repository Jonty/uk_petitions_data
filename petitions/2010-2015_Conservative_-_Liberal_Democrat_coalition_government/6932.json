        "additional_details": "The war on drugs, in a whole, has worsened many problems. Damn Nixon. I believe you can become what you believe you are, like most people, and this immature war on drugs has turned us into whining little children who think they NEED someone to ban all drugs, the better drugs if I may add, instead of giving them the FREE HUMAN RIGHT to indulge in WHATEVER they choose to indulge in. And I don't even need to mention the murder and incarceration of hundreds of thousands in favour of this stupid war, because we've been conditioned to find it humane, and 'civilised'... Decriminalise all drugs, EDUCATE, and invest in help centres for those who abuse them, instead of branding them junkies and criminal degenerates. Prisons should be left for violent offenders and those unable to co-operate with the majority of society. Thank you for reading, sign the petition because you know it's a step in the way of maturity.",
