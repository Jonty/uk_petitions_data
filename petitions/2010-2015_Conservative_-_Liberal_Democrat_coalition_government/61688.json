        "additional_details": "My name is Robyn Newport and I am the Schools Workforce Health & Wellbeing Coordinator for Cornwall. Before this role I was a Primary School teacher, teaching across Plymouth and Cornwall and therefore I am very aware of the ever increasing and unquie demands placed on teaching staff.\r\nThe effects of teaching on ill health and mental disorders is well reseached and documented, however little has been done to change this neagtive and expected norm within the teaching profession. The cost of ill health within teaching is also vast, thousands are lots each year.\r\nHappier and healthier staff will make for happier and healthier children, with the potential in creating healthier performance and results for schools, whilst potentially saving  huge amounts of money for the school. Therefore I would like to pose that the Health & Wellbeing of school staff should form part of the OFSTED inspection,with a section dedicated to school staff health and mental wellbeing.",
