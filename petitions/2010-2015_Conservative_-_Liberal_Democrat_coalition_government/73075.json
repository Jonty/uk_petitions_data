        "additional_details": "The public expectation of the NHS is extraordinarily high.  \u00a3150 billion pounds will be spent on healthcare in 2015. The NHS is however a world leading service provider in many fields of medicine and healthcare. WE in the UK are extraordinarily lucky to have such an outstanding FREE service at every point of care.\r\nThe current burden of ill-health and pathology in our expanding and ageing population coupled with social and conventional media, driven criticism and 'hearsay' is putting unrealistic demands on a astonishing government funded charity 'THE NHS'\r\nThis e-petition proposes that a Receipt totaling the cost and expenses of a treatment period should be sent to all patient s upon discharge. This would serve as an education tool and demonstrate to the public the value for money they receive in the NHS. It may also help NHS trusts address areas where they could improve and reduce costs effectively.\r\n",
