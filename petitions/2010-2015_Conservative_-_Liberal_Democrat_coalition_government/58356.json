        "additional_details": "The use of mobile phones in cars & vehicles is supposed to be banned but still are carelessly used by irresponsible drivers.The use of walkie talkies or one to one radios as the driver is still not concentrating on the road.I think at the M.O.T stage all cars should be fitted with a electronic blocking box that blocks the phone signal once in the car & works when out of it.Every car that is fitted should be listed on the dvla database & box whereabouts should be kept secret.No data from phones should be taken for intel etc only to cancel out phones signals,reducing costs & police time.Alot of drivers hide the phone below window line so unseen,still using at junctions & queues.There are too many illegal drivers just being fined or getting points on non existing licences,not learning anything.More rigid rules on D.U.A & longer prison time.The attitude of younger drivers are not looking at rd safety,but having fun & being irrisponsible.",
