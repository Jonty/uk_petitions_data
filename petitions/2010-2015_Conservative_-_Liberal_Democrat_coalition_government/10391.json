        "additional_details": "Convicted prisoners upon their release can get a \u00a346 Discharge Grant, and the Community Care Grant (\u00a330-\u00a31000+). They also get free Subutext and Methadone which costs the taxpayer countless millions per year. Upon entering a prison they are on \u201cStandard\u201d regime and have access to a TV and Playstation. If they misbehave they get downgraded to \u201cBasic\u201d regime and lose their TV, on the other hand if they behave well they get upgraded to \u201cEnhanced\u201d regime. Prisoners should start off on \u201cBasic\u201d regime and should have to earn their TV\u2019s and Playstation\u2019s by consistent good behaviour and only receive access to them by getting themselves on \u201cEnhanced\u201d regime. Should a prisoner smash up their cell they should be made to pay the bill and not the taxpayer who pays for the repairs. Similarly, if they smash the TV in their cell they should be made to pay for it and not be given another one. The current systemm rewards bad behaviour and doesn't encourage good behaviour. This must change.",
