Most of us did not enjoy equal rights or pay. We did not receive maternity benefit.  These are historic differences which set our generation apart from younger women. The law was different then.  It feels like \u00a315,000 and 6 years has been looted from my life.  To save money for whom?  My children?  My grandchildren?  This pension bill is ill considered and unfair.  It is not advertised so a lot of women don't even know.",
