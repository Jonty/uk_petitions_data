        "additional_details": "New drivers need time to learn, even after they have passed their tests.  The test is a minimum level to show that they are safe enough to use a motor vehicle on a road.\r\n\r\nThat learning process is marred by an attitudes by male and females, by buying a powerful second hand vehicle or modifying another vehicle so that it appears to be in a racing style.\r\n\r\nThis may show the mental attitude to be competitive and may cause an unsocial incident that may have devastating consequences.\r\n\r\nPlease debate where our young drivers get the time to learn properly using a safe unmodified vehicle.\r\n\r\nPlease debate about new driver vehicle specifications .  If that is not possible then a restriction of what type of vehicle can be bought or bought for a new driver and pass levels like motor cycles.\r\nHopefully this will reduce the amount of deaths and accidents by new drivers and allow a sensible amount of time for a new driver to learn the rules of the road properly.",
