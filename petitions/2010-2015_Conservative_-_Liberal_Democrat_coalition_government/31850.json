However, with 20 miles between me and my office that's not realistic, and parking on someone else's road in order to then bike in 3 miles or so doesn't seem like a good idea either.\r\n\r\nGiven the huge expansion, and popularity of Park & Ride schemes, how about expanding them to Park & Cycle. The general idea being that you park your car, then borrow a bike in a similar fashion to the Barclays Cycle Hire scheme in London.\r\n\r\nNot only are there obvious environmental benefits but significant health benefits too.\r\n\r\nSurely it wouldn't cost much to install the cycle hire equipment at existing park & ride schemes, plus I'm sure local companies would be willing to sponsor these schemes to assist with funding.
