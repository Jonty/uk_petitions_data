        "additional_details": "Received a fixed penalty notice through the post for a speeding offence? Why is this the ONLY offence for which you do not have a right to silence? If you are stopped by police they have to give you the formal caution the first part of which states ' You do not have to say anything unless you wish to do so'. If you are arrested it is the same.  It seems for speeding offences caught on camera you lose this right. Why?\r\nThe Government created a loophole so as to exclude this RIGHT for speeding offences caught by camera. Let's stop this abuse of everyone's legal right's!\r\nThe Right to Silence should incluse all offences including speeding caught by camera's!",
