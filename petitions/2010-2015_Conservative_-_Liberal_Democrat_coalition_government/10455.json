        "additional_details": "Withdrawing these aids is not the answer. This is not to say they should go without punishment! The punishment should fit the crime and they should be punished to the full extent of the law.\r\n\r\nIf we think about this intelligently, how does withdrawing these benefits and evicting them help? Is it punishing them? Maybe but its also punishing ourselves as if this is passed then they really will have nothing to lose. What will they fear? The answer, nothing. There will be more criminal activity because they will feel they have to, to survive as they wont have any help,  any finances, a roof over their head, they will not have the basic and vital human needs\r\n\r\nThis will lead to more homelessness and as a result more criminal activity which we do not want. We as the tax payer will have to pay to have resolved. It will cost us even more money to correct this mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
