We deserve more funding as we are the future of the NHS.\r\nStudent Nurses and nurses are continually being blamed for shortcomings within the NHS. Long hours, less pay all for the love of our career. Student nurses are the future of the NHS and should be supported at all costs. We work 37.5 hours a week free of charge in order to reach our goal, that is providing care for all.\r\n We have the potential to change the NHS for the better, Provide dignity and quality healthcare that is patient centred. Help us stop these prevalent reports of NHS failings, given the correct support WE CAN CHANGE!! Student Nurses still care! ",
