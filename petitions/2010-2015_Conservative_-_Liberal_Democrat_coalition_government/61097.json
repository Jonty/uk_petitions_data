        "additional_details": "In this day and age more young people are ''coming out'' as either Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual or Trangender and yet there is still no real education within the schools, whether than be sexual health or mental well-being.\r\n\r\nI'm calling for more education in schools from Primary to College level to ensure that children have an understanding of what it means to be different and that it is perfectly acceptable to do be different.\r\n\r\nAnother matter is the lack of sexual information provided at schools during sex education. I myself a gay man aged 17, was never taught at secondary school about homosexual sexual health and had to rely on the internet, which has obvious risks.\r\n\r\nAlthough, equality was taught at school it is mainly focussed on racism of skin colour and religion. Again hardly any information of homophobia and what it drives people to do, such as social issues, bullying, self harm and in the worst possible outcome suicide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
