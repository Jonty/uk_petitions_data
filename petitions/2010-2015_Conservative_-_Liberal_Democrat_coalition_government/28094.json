        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the British Government to offer a peaceful settlement in the South Atlantic by ceding the uninhabited territories of South Georgia and the South Sandwich islands in return for Argentina dropping her claims on the Falklands.\r\n\r\nBritain has a dispute with Argentina over the sovereignty of various Islands in the South Atlantic. This dispute has already escalated to war on one occasion with the loss of over 900 lives. The dispute is ongoing and weakens Britain's relations with Argentina and to some extent the rest of Latin America.\r\n\r\nCurrently all the disputed islands are under British control, the Falklands are inhabited and their residents wish to remain British. But South Georgia and the South Sandwich islands are uninhabited and therefore could be disposed of by the Government.",
