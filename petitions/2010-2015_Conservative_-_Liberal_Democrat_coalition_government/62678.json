        "additional_details": "I would like the government to consider adding tactical driving to the test so drivers learn to read traffic flows ahead of them whilst they drive. I am sick of inconsiderate, thoughtless drivers on our roads which clog up routes and cause delays for everyone just because they cannot wait 30 seconds to let traffic through before they decide to advance into ridiculous spaces in the attempt to get where they are going quicker. THEY SLOW EVERYONE DOWN!! Also more stringent reversing testing should be done at the same time.",
