        "additional_details": "On the 7th January 2013 Child Benefit is set to become a grossly unequal system. Families with significantly lower income than others will suffer great reduction in benefits they currently receive - an outcome, which flies against all that the Government professes to stand for.  A single income family with an income of \u00a360,000 a year will be considerably worse off than those on a double income of  \u00a399,998. This e-petition calls not for one group being treated better than any other but for all families to be treated on the same sliding scale.",
