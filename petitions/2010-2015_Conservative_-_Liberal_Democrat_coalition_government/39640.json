        "additional_details": "Can't Pay, Won't Pay!' is a campaign group for those protesting against the new changes to council tax benefit. We want\r\nthose effected and those who sympathize to join us in a boycott of the 20%+ payment of council tax by those who can't afford it. In 1990 the Conservative government was brought down through the refusal by the working class to pay 'poll tax'. We can bring down this government by refusing to pay this tax also. Disclaimer: this group is not run by an individual, or a group of leaders but is a autonomous group acting on a common cause, all actions taken by individuals are of there own accord.",
