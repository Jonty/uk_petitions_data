        "additional_details": "BUILD the A14 southern bypass for Huntingdon but HAVE NO TOLLS on this road. MAINTAIN THE current road, including the bridge planned for demolition\r\nThe A14 needs an increase in capacity so support the general scheme proposed. However the existing bypass road should be kept\r\nA: to provide an alternative route when the new road is disrupted by an incident\r\nB: to provide additional capacity for future growth\r\nC: to maintain a direct and shorter route from the A14 to the A1 northwards\r\nD: to allow traffic to + from local villages to bypass Huntingdon, rather than be forced through it or on long diversions\r\nThere should be no tolls on the new road. Drivers of cars and lorries pay far more in motoring taxes than is spent on roads, and the A14 scheme would be one form of pay back. The tolling system would be inconvenient for users, and unfair on those without Internet or phone ways to pay. Tolls would reduce or negate many benefits of the scheme and be a wholly unjustified new tax on driving",
