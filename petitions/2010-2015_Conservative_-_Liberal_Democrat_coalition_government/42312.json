        "additional_details": "Put the UK at the forefront of international co-operation in the fight against tax evasion and avoidance by setting-up an International Tax Issues Watchlist. The data contained within it could be flagged using a traffic light system.\r\n\r\nOn the international stage, the government should then encourage other countries and jurisdictions to join and contribute data to the Watchlist.\r\n\r\nIn time, the List would grow into a large database of very useful information on individuals and business entities, which would be instantly accessible to the tax authorities of countries which have signed up to it.\r\n\r\nOf course, every member state would have to be compliant with its own data privacy laws, and also would have to pass primary legislation to establish membership of it.",
