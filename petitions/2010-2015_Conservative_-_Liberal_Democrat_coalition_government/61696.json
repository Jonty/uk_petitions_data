        "additional_details": "On 26 May 2011 the EU \"Cookie Law\" came into force. Created without regard to whether such a law was necessary, it requires all EU websites to gain consent from visitors before using cookies.\r\n\r\nGiven 99.99% of visitors have little care about cookies but do care that they have to repeatedly approve use, we call for the EU Cookie Law to be abolished on the following grounds:\r\n\r\n1. It serves no useful purpose.\r\n\r\n2. With consent not required for some cookies the ICO has made the law subjective.\r\n\r\n3. It is impractical for a website to explain what a cookie is and how it is used before gaining consent.\r\n\r\n4. Accepted practice is to notify cookies are being used until such time as the visitor confirms, thus desensitising visitors to cookies.\r\n\r\n5. From Apr-12 to Dec-13 just 886 concerns were raised to the ICO. This to be taken in the context of the millions of web pages viewed every day.\r\n\r\n6. Persons concerned about cookies have options within their browser.",
