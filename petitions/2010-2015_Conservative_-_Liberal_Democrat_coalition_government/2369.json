        "additional_details": "This petition calls for a review in the way in which science is presented in the media.\r\n\r\nScience articles in the mainstream media often are written by journalists with no previous science expertise or the necessary skills to interpret a scientific paper and assess its flaws. This leads to confusion amongst the general public and can cause an undermining of belief in science and even cost lives (see the MMR vaccine).\r\n\r\nWith tighter regulations on all media outlets, so that all science articles are carefully reviewed and processed, we would have a more understanding and informed general public.",
