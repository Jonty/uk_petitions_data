        "additional_details": "Please equip all armed officers of the Metropolitan Police service with personal video cameras. Given the concerns that the public have over unlawful use of force my Met officers it would benefit all those concerned if we could have permanent recorded video evidence of officers point of view while on duty.\r\n\r\nIdeally all officers including those unarmed should carry personal video cameras. The mere knowledge that they are being recorded would I suggest affect the manner in which the two parties interact, police and the public.\r\n\r\nVote for this petition to see all armed police officers equipped with personal video cameras.",
