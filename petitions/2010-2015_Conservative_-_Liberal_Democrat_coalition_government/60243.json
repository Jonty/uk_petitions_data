        "additional_details": "UK Sport has removed funding from British Basketball, despite the sport sitting in the top three for youth participation across the United Kingdom, international results which have consistently improved over the past eight years, the nurturing of leading players like NBA All Star Luol Deng, and a favourable review of the way its elite performance monies have been spent.\r\n\r\nTaking away the funding will damage the aspiration of young players for compete on the world stage at Olympic Games and World Cups, while allowing role models to reach out to their communities, particularly among inner city youth.\r\n\r\nWhile too much Lottery finance is being put into individual sport with the benefits of team sports, hockey excluded, being overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned request that a review of UK Sport's strategy, which targets short-term medals over long-term potential, is undertaken.",
