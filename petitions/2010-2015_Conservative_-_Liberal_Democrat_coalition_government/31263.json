Our once proud industrial heritage lies in tatters - neutered by the likes of Tesco's and Sainsbury and other super stores.  Give Britain back to the British small business, allow them to flourish, allow them to be innovative and competitive.  Allow them to trade with the minimum of administrative and taxable burden.  Reward success. Small Businesses will turn the tide of the current economic depression.  Make Britain Proud allow it to happen. Signed Ruth Waterson - Age 10.",
