        "additional_details": "GCSEs should be 100% exam where appropriate and should NOT include a controlled conditions coursework element. Where this is not appropriate, have a coursework element which is completed in the traditional manner i.e. at home with little or no input in the classroom. This would be far preferable for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1) Controlled conditions coursework seriously impacts on the students' learning as is takes up a huge amount of lesson time (up to 1/3 of the Y11 course)\r\n\r\n2) In a lot of cases, it is purely an exercise in remembering by rote and does not require any independent thought whatsoever\r\n\r\n3) It disadvantages less able students who do not have the capacity to remember large chunks of information\r\n\r\n4) Students are poorly prepared for A-Levels and vocational courses\r\n\r\n5) The burden of paperwork on teachers is unreasonable\r\n\r\n6) It invites cheating and unfair conduct, which disadvantages able students who play by the rules",
