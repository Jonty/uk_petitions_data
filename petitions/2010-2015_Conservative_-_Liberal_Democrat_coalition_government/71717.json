        "additional_details": "The Potential Harm\r\n\r\nThe first reason that children should not be given homework is that they need time to relax and take their minds off work. The pressure of having to complete homework every night is quite daunting for most children and they need time to refresh their minds and bodies.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it reduces the amount of time that children could be spending with their families. Family time is especially important to a growing child and without it social problems can crop up and a family unit can be compromised by a lack of time being spent together.\r\n\r\nThirdly, homework can cause conflict between children and parents when the parent wants to the child to do their homework but meets resistance from the student to do an overwhelming task.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, a lot of teachers don't often have time to grade papers as they are too busy. So by the time students are getting their papers back, the class has moved on to a new topic.",
