        "additional_details": "A new 'Garden Tax' is being brought in by the Conservatives on Mid Devon District Council.\r\n\r\nFrom October this year, garden waste will only be emptied if \u00a350 a year is paid to have it collected. People who do not wish to pay the \u00a350 will either have to compost all of their garden waste or take it to a local recycling centre.\r\n\r\nThis policy will result in more fly-tipping in our beautiful countryside. Rubbish will be increasingly dumped in gateways and over hedges - we will all see a significant escalation in this anti-social practice in our area thanks to the Conservative\u2019s decision to introduce this extra tax burden.\r\n\r\nPlease help make the Council think again on this unfair garden tax by signing this petition- for years this has been part of the council's service to you, paid for through the Council Tax.",
