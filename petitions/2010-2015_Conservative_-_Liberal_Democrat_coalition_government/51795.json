        "additional_details": "I am against the public funding of Faith Schools across Britain.\r\nCharles Clarke, was Education Secretary at the time faith schools were given the go ahead. In the past, however, Clarke was very much against faith schools. He opted to back faith schools due to 'votes', he put his morals and the good of the country aside for votes! Even though a later poll showed that the public held the opposite view.\r\n\r\nI am an atheist, I went to a Catholic Primary school, I am not saying all faith schools should be banned, but only 'public' funded ones. Why should I, along with many others, have to pay for things which I believe to be a form of child abuse.\r\nI am calling for a reform of this system.\r\n\r\nThank you",
