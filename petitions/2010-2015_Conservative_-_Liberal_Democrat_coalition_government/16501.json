        "additional_details": "Making British Sign Language (BSL) part of the National Curriculum would have a positive impact on:\r\nMental health,(statistics show that 1 in 4 D/deaf people will develop a mental health problem compared to Hearing people which is only 1 in 6.\r\nCommunities could come together and it could enable D/deaf people to teach hearing people to communicate effectively, D/deaf people can feel they belong to their community and feel less isolated.\r\nThere would be money saved on benefits because D/deaf people would be able to communicate with people and interpreters would not be required.\r\nPeople who have problems with English and who do not have a linear way of thinking, but a visual understanding of the world would benefit.\r\nIt will give hearing people an insight into how Deafness impacts on people\u2019s lives; not only the Deaf person, but those around them.\r\nIt would create a wider range of jobs for Deaf people.\r\nFor these reasons and more; please make BSL part of the National Curriculum.",
