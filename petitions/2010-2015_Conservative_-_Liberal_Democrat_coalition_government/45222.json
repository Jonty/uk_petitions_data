        "additional_details": "Romford Ice rink is due to be demolished  April 2013 and made into a Morrisons supermarket and flats. A new rink is possibly being built by the end of 2015. The council promised the clubs that use the current rink they would provide a temporary rink with no disruption to the season. There is no sign of this happening. 350 figure skaters and 150 Ice hockey players will have no where to train and play the sport the love so much.\r\n\r\nHelp us get these kids voices heard and get either to stay in the current rink till the new one opens or a temp rink is provided. Or at the very least get us ice time that we can use as Romford club funded (to compensate people having to travel so much further) somewhere as local as possible. ",
