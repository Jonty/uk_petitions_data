It is important to remember that to increase employment rates, often young people have to travel and commute further than before. It is also an environmental benefit to encourage people to use public transport over private transport. Additionally, in some cases, young people can only ever use public transport as running cars and paying for fuel (and insurance), is seen as a large burden. With the government aiming to reduce unemployment especially amongst the youth and graduates, it is imperative that train prices become more affordable for younger people who are often given lower paid jobs. With life expectancy rising, why should the age range of \"young\" and \"youth\" not be raised proportionately? In any case, if you make transport more affordable, we will eventually get jobs quicker and be able to pay it all back in taxes. Hurrah!",
