        "additional_details": "We are calling for a systematic review of the legitimacy and validity of CTO's (Community Treatment Orders) as an evidence-based intervention to reduce readmission within the Mental Health Act (1983). CTO's were introduced to reduce unnecessary readmission into hospital. 3 RCT's (Randomised Controlled Trials) have demonstrated that CTO's do not reduce admission rates despite restricting autonomy (Rugkasa and Dawson, 2013:http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/203/6/406.full). Where CTO's do work this is perhaps due to increased community support.\r\n",
