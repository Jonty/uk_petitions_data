        "additional_details": "We the undersigned urge the government of the U.K. to actively lobby for a one-state solution to the Israel/Palestine problem. All territories currently controlled by Israel or Palestinian authorities should be encouraged to become one state, without internal borders. The state should be fully democratic and unbiased towards one people or another in its law. It should have freedom of religion, freedom from religion, and freedom of movement, as basic tenets to its constitution. We understand that this is an ultimate goal, and that very many steps need to be taken to reach this end, but we also believe that, in the year 2014, all who presently reside on this land should be allowed to share it, and the present situation is grossly unfair and untenable, and merits neither support nor inertia from our government. We would like the right of return of Palestinian refugees abroad, and the right of Jews across the world who may be subject to persecution, to be seriously considered. ",
