However, I feel there should be limit to these numbers of people. The reason that I feel this is because immigrants take up lots of our jobs and therefore British people end up with no work here in Britain, and so they have to go and work in other countries where there is work and leave their families in Britain. Surely the people of Britain should be the priority? ",
