        "additional_details": "I would like the government to raise the personal allowance to the level which income-based benefits currently lift incomes.\r\n\r\nSince the money not being taken would be similar to that which is currently paid out, I would expect to see a net-saving as administrative costs - and errors - would be slashed.  This saving could amount to billions of pounds as, according to the NAO, administrative errors cost the country \u00a31-1.3bn a year.  The sums saved could then be used to off-set other cuts such as those to community services.  In addition, the increase in personal allowance would directly benefit tax-payers and drive the economy towards recovery.\r\n",
