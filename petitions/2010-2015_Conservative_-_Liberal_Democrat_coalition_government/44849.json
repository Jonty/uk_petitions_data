        "additional_details": "There are numerous main roads in the Greater London area bordered by homes where the maximum speed is 50mph or more.\r\n\r\nThis causes unnecessary levels of danger for the elderly, children and pets living in these areas, who also suffer from exhaust and noise polution at all times, day and night.  Short bursts of acceleration, followed by rapid braking, also lead to higher fuel consumption with no material decrease in journey time.\r\n\r\nFor the safety of residents and road users, and to reduce exhaust and noise polution, the government should legislate to reduce speed limits on all main roads within Greater London to a maximum of 40mph.",
