The welfare system is vastly overburdened by those already draining it and can not afford more.  Deport those persons immediately who fail this criteria.  Deport them with their families too so they can not abuse the Human Rights act to stay in this country.  Deport all the illegal immigrants regardless of how long they have been here",
