        "additional_details": "The wearing of the burkha in public should be banned. It is not acceptable to hide one's face. It creates distrust and security problems. (Motorcyclists have to remove their helmets in Banks, etc.) Islamic law does not insist on it. This is the United Kingdom and a Christian Country. Those who choose to come and live here should adapt to the British Culture and not try to change it. If they do not like it they should return to their own Country. Human rights should favour the indigenous population and not an immigrant minority.   Freedom of speech to discuss such concerns should not be 'Politically incorrect' and/or illegal. France and Belgium have banned the wearing of the burkha in public. We should follow suit.",
