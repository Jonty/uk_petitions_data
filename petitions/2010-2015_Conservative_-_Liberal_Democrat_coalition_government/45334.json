        "additional_details": "Elected Mayors have too much power and can and do ignore the wishes of those that elected them. They rely too much on Council officers for in some cases biussed information. Where there is a very large majority of one political party in the Council a Dictatorship can easily occur and with the elected Mayor being of the same party he or she can personally control any position designed to safeguard the electorate from policies and rulings which would be detremental to the electorate. Public money can be wasted on schemes which serve little or no purpose or are aginst the majority of residents wishes as little or no debate is applied and the Mayor gets whatever he or she decides. This must end therefore we call on the Government of this country to abolish the office or position of Elected Mayors and return councils to the full control of elected council members.  ",
