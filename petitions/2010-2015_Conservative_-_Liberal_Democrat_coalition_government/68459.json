        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to stop Royal Mail from closing local Post Offices and putting a vastly sub-standard service in local shops.  Also to stop collections being reduced which would effectively mean a 2nd class service for 1st class charges.  The Government were responsible for the sell off and the sub-standard service we have been left with so now please take some action to protect this vital service to the community.",
