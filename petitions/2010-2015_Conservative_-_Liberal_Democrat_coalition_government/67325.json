But there is another country ive missed out, another country which is a big part of Great Britain and which its history and traditions are of great importance to the United Kingdom as is the historys and traditions of the rest of the UK, That country is Wales!                                              It seems wrong that Wales is discluded from the union jack, if wales is a part of the United Kingdom then it should be reconised along with the other countries on the union jack. I purpose a change is needed for wales to be equally reconised with a new design to the Union jack to incorporate Wales.",
