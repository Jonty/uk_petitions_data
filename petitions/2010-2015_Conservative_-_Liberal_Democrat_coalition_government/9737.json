This should encourage claimants to actively seek work full time.\r\nThis new process should also be the only trigger to other benefit entitlements.\r\nIn order to enforce work ethic hours of work should be clearly defined between 6.00am and 6.00pm, as for the majority of the working population, Monday to Friday.\r\nNo work, no money should be the slogan.\r\nLet's get communities working again.",
