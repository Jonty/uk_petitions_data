        "additional_details": "I and many others will agree that woman wearing a burka should not be allowed to drive a vehicle this is highly dangerous as you do not have full vision of the road and things surrounding you. This had recently been brought to my attention as I was hit by a car and the woman driving was wearing a full Burka and claimed she did not see me. I believe this to be due to lack of vision caused by the Burka. I understand this item of clothing worn is a sign of religion. This does not take away the fact of how dangerous wearing this is whilst driving. This has been recently banned in France and I think the UK should take action against this to prevent very serious accidents or even death happening. ",
