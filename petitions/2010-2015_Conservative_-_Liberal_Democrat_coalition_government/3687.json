        "additional_details": "The issue of abortion is largely devoted in dealing with the rights of mother's and the unborn child. However, the rights of father's largely goes ignored and by law discriminates against the father's own wishes.\r\n\r\nThis petition would require by statute of law to make it legally binding that father's of an unborn, but unwanted child of the mother's part would be given legal rights to adopt the unborn child. Father's would have legal rights to the unborn child if he wants the child but the mother does not, she deceives him by saying she does not want the child and/or she aborts the child to deliberately hurt him. Fathers who want the child and promises to have sole responsibility would be allowed to prevent an abortion and therefore raise the child on his own.\r\n\r\nFixed penalties would be granted to the mother who commits an abortion in breach of the father's right or compensation would be reward to the father.
