        "additional_details": "Although the NHS has recommended treatment programmes for Borderline Personality Disorder, actually accessing them is close to impossible for a majority of patients.There is also concern about lack of care,compassion & respect that many Borderlines receive during a crisis.\r\nAction we would like the government to take:\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that NICE guidelines recommended for the treatment of BPD is implemented by all professionals involved in the care / treatment of someone with BPD.\r\n\r\n2.Improved training to be available to ALL health care professionals,including G.P's,involved in the care/ treatment of someone with BPD.\r\n\r\n3. BPD patients to be told of the treatment options available and not be excluded from accessing any of them due to lack of availability in their area.\r\n\r\n4. A complete overhaul of the 'crisis team' structure including the time it takes to respond to someone in a crisis and the way they deal with people in distress.\r\n\r\n5. More PD specialist centres & support groups.\r\n",
