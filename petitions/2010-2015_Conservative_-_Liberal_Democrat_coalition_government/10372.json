This view is also substantiated by the teachers\u2019 unions.\r\n\r\nWhat can be done?\r\nThose pupils whose persistent misbehaviour results in them being fixed period excluded, the state benefits applicable are withdrawn for a period of time.\r\nThose pupils whose persistent misbehaviour results in them being permanently excluded, the state benefits applicable are withdrawn until such a time as the child returns to mainstream education.\r\nThere has never been a more pertinent time for adults to review their parenting skills. Where children are been raised devoid of the social and moral fibre to contribute in a positive way to society, then the responsible adults need to be held to account.\r\n\r\n",
