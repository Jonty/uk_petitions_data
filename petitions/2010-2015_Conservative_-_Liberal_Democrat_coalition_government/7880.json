        "additional_details": "The break out of riots across London and other parts of the UK has highlighted the fact that a great number of our young people are directionless, and unmotivated to make a meaningful contribution to our society. They are looking for acknowledgement in mindless violence and theft - their 15 minutes of notoriety more life-affirming than any contact with the adult world they have had previously. We need to re-establish youth services, from drop-in youth clubs to one on one mentoring, in order to raise educational aspiration and sense of belonging. The government MUST fund essential youth services in every town in Britain. Any other strategy is a false economy.",
