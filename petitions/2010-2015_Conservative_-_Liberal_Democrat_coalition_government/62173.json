        "additional_details": "Around 30-50% of food is thrown away (source http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/10/half-world-food-waste).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, food poverty is on the increase in the UK, and food prices are rising accross the world.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for a law obliging all food retail companies to offer food for free to the public as a last resort before throwing it away. This would reduce food waste dramatically, and would contrast with the supermarkets' current practice of injecting dye in their wasted food and locking their bins.\r\n\r\n",
