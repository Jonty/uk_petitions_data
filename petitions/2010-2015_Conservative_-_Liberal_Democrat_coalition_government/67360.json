        "additional_details": "The Conservative led coalition Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland putting restrictions on airline flights, departing or arriving from the UK, due to low or empty phone battery-life. This is a clear impact and infringement on our civil liberties, once again.\r\n\r\nThe reason this new legislation is being passed following suit of the US Government, is to make sure mobile phone data access and monitoring ( this can not take place whilst a mobile phone battery is empty)  can take place when going through a screening process at passing airport security. If you don't want this repeated physical and physiological infringement to your human rights and civil liberties then speak out now before the problem becomes a lot  worse and a lot more intense. Look to the future and ask yourself what kind of Government activities you want your friends, family and yourself to be subject to. Not just not but in the future. ",
