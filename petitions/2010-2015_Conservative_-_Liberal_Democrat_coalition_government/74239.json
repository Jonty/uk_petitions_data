I will graduate from university around the same time. As a student, I do not earn \u00a318k per year.\r\nI am a British citizen and I will be forced out of the UK, because I do not meet the official income requirement to support my spouse, even though she is working here already and is able to support herself, this income is not considered.\r\nEU citizens can bring their spouses into the EU with no income requirement at all. Please get the government to reconsider this barbaric law that is tearing families apart.\r\nIt is not the place of government to tell me to leave the UK or leave my partner.\r\n\r\nJoin me and make them reconsider.",
