        "additional_details": "Public owned NRAM increases consent to let fees from \u00a3100 PA to \u00a3700 - \u00a31250 PA.\r\nExisting consent to let customers are now crippled by NRAM's unreasonable fee increases. If this action was taken by a credit card company, there would be consumer protection against such increase. The current complaint organisations and financial service authorities system fails to protect mortgage borrowers in these particular circumstances. This petition is against the extreme fee increases to consent to let customers  at NRAM where in some case customers will be seeing a 1000% rise to their current annual charges. We ask that this be addressed by the House of Commons.",
