Due to Harrow council making cuts to their funds there are proposals to close Children\u2019s centres within the borough. We are a charity run, committee based Pre School and have found this news very upsetting to discover that due to their cuts we may have to close. We need as many signatures as possible to present a case to keep our Pre School open.\r\nPlease take part in signing our petition and spreading the word in helping us reach our goal of 10,000 names.\r\nThank you for your support.\r\n",
