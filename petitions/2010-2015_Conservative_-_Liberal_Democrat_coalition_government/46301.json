        "additional_details": "I amongst a growing number in Britain are currently being exploited by the zero hour contract trend a lot of business' are seem to be using now in which entails you are not guaranteed work but your guaranteed to be stuck in the middle of unemployed and employed the bit where you start accumilating debt and finding life hard to get on with! An example my work place sports direct the full time workers are contracted to 40 hours p/w and reguarly work 60+ and zero hour contracted people like me are lucky to get 5 hours per week! Don't get me wrong some people get 20 hours on zero hour contracts but a lot of people don't even get shifts like me. These kind of contracts where you have to be availible all day everyday but never know when your in is a disgrace and the goverment allowing there people to be exploited like this just for the sake of statistics of people being employed is disgusting! Please back this cause and help us get them illegal!",
