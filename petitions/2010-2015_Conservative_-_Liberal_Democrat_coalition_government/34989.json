He is unworthy to present our nation's most loved beautiful game.\r\nWe have ensued his coverage for more than 2 years and what a long 2 years they have been. We ask his services be repudiated and also that Gareth Southgate follows him out the door.\r\nHis previous employment as presenter of Daybreak seems a far more fitting option. Far less of the population watch Daybreak and those who do deserve to be punished anyway as ungrateful drains on society.\r\nChiles ruins football, he knows nothing of the sport, and as an unpopular figure amidst an already tense viewing population, it is for his own safety that the man be eradicated from peak-time television.\r\nHis banter irks all. His only virtue is the way he unites every football fan through a mutual feeling of monumental disdain.\r\nPlease sign this petition so we can do something about this overweight cretin. Football deserves better.\r\nChiles out.",
