Increasing the exposure of all our tremendous athletes' should be a key goal in helping the fulfill the 2012 mantra to 'inspire a generation'.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we petition the government to significantly expand the list of sports on Ofcom's Listed & Designated Events code of sporting events which must be available on terrestial telvision (including events such as; all tennis grand slam events, all Premiership football matches, all F1 grand prix races, all cycling grand tours, IAAF championships, rowing world cups, and events from as many other Olympic and Paralympic sports as possible)\r\n",
