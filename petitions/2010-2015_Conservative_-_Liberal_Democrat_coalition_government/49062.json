        "additional_details": "In Wiltshire, you may have received a care service from a trusted company for several years. You are likely to have formed strong bonds with the provision. When you reach the end of your life your care will be funded by Continuing Health Care. However as Wiltshire council nominates only four care companies to fulfill their contracts, all those who were previously receiving a service through a company not holding a contract, will be moved to an entirely new service, with no direct payment opportunities. How is this person centered? How is this considerate to the views of service users? At the most vulnerable and traumatic time in anyone life Wiltshire Commissioning bodies feel it suitable for that individual to lose the bonds and trusting relationships which take precious time to create.I  am petitioning to allow CHC funding to be allocated via direct payments, regardless of Local Authority contracts",
