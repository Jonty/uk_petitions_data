        "additional_details": "We want a new inquiry into historic child abuse at children's homes throughout the United Kingdom and we believe this should be led by an independent body. This independent body should be separate from government and its influences. We believe a new inquiry is required as in the past a group of individuals were protected by each other's power, enabling the abuse to continue.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry should be led by professionals experienced in investigating allegations of child abuse and collating evidence to bring offenders to justice. Those leading the inquiry should have no connection to government to retain impartiality\r\n\r\nThe inquiry is required to bring about justice for those abused within care homes in the UK and to restore public confidence in our justice system.",
