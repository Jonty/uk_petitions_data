        "additional_details": "That the Public Wearing Of Any Face Covering Is Banned in Public in the United Kingdom. There has been a public banning of the wearing of the niqab in public now in Belgium and in France, and, shortly, very likely in Italy It is our opinion that this has no place in a Western civilised society, nor in a society that considers women as equal, nor is there any religious obligation in the Islamic faith to do so. Equally this petition seeks to make it illegal for any person to have their face covered in public by means of a mask or material designed to obscure their image. Exceptions to the previous paragraph being those involved in occupations, e.g.Cash Security Guards, who may require visor protection from potential attack. or such sporting activities that require facial protection and occupational safety requirements. We ask that this matter be addressed by debate and free vote in the House of Commons at the very earliest opportunity",
