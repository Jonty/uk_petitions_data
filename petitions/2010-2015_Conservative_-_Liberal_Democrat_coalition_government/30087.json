Our MET. have a metal detecting scheame where they have portable metal detectors which members of the public are asked to step or walk through, it enstrikes fear into those who carry knives as they feel they are obligated to walk through and they are likely to stash or throw away  the knife. If this procedure is more established the ammount of muggings via knives and guns will be decreased as well as knife and gun related incidents.  ",
