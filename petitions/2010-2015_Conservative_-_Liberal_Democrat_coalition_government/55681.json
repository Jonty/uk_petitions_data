        "additional_details": "Sylvester Stallone thrilled us in the 80's and 90's with his collection of musclebound action heroes, including John Rambo, Judge Dredd, John Spartan, and of course Rocky Balboa.\r\nIn recent years, action movies have moved away from pure fantasy escapism in favour of overcomplicated plot lines and puny actors with 'feelings'.\r\nSylvester Stallone has brought back the true Action movie, as they used to be. Muscles, explosions, one liners, and shoot first, ask later plots.\r\n\r\nBy also pulling together other past Action heroes such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris, Dolph Lundgren, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Bruce Willis, he has given hope to a generation brought up on true action films, that we still can have great films again, like they used to be.\r\nIf you are over 35, I defy you to not feel an immense sense of reverent pride, seeing Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger shoulder to shoulder, carrying machine guns.\r\nI petition for Sylvester to be given an Honorary Knighthood.",
