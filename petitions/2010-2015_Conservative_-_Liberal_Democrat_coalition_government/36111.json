Sadly the last reported street bearing the name was in 1561, so it would be a wonderfully patriotic gesture to reinstate this extinct relic of our cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nJust imagine the joy you'd feel when you found that you no longer lived on Magpie Lane or Parsons Street, but instead you lived on Gropecunt Lane.",
