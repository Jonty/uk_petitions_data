        "additional_details": "It is my view that if people are going to start voting at 18 they should know exactly what they are voting for and why. I believe there should be a system in place to educate 17 year olds in our country, however briefly, on the main political parties and their basic ideals. Such education may encourage more youths to vote, and when they do to vote for what they actually believe in themselves rather than what their parents believe. I say mandatory in the title because I believe it should be mandatory to help overcome apathy within the youths of Great Britain and perhaps help us to push past our current participation crisis. ",
