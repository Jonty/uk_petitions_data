        "additional_details": "In the early years of education, more focus should be put on teaching moral values and personal and community responsibily. This should reduce the tendancy for us to commit crime. It should also teach us from an early age that entitlement culture is morally wrong and that we should not rely on the state to do everything for us, we must help ourselves. Teaching young people about parenting, and how teenage pregnancy is normally a bad thing, should also be encorporated into education since parents are hugely responsible for their children's behaviour and it is therefore important future generations are equiped.",
