        "additional_details": "We Note:\r\nRussian President Vladimir Putin signed into law one of the most draconian anti-gay laws on the planet. Russia plays host to the Winter Olympics in 2014, Sochi. The law permits the detention of foreigners for up to 14 days and expulsion from the country for promoting the rights of the LGBT community.\r\n\r\nWe Believe:\r\nThe UK has to uphold the rights of individuals and maintain safety of athletes representing the nation abroad. We as a nation enjoy the continuing friendship and cooperation with Russia, but is simply too dangerous for us not to act.\r\n\r\nWe Propose:\r\nThe signatories beseech ministers to look into boycotts, persuasion of the Russian government to suspend the law in lieu of the games and to petition the IOC to suspend Russia's future bids for game hosting until the law is revoked as they curtail the rights of participating LGBT athletes and their treatment. To warn LGBT athletes attending of the dangers and potential for harm they may come to if they participate.",
