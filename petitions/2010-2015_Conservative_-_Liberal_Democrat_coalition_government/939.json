        "additional_details": "\"No win no fee agreements\" are nothing more than legal blackmail.  Far too  many of them are used to support spurious claims.  Even worse, the solicitor has a  vested interest in putting forward a spurious claim  because he not only gets his ordinary costs he also gets a \"mark up\" or \"bonus\" if he wins.\r\nA person who receives a demand backed by a \"no win  no fee agreement\" has a choice.  He can either pay to settle a spurious claim or pay to defend it. He can never win because he must always be out of pocket.\r\nThe system should be scrapped or changed so that if any party to an action is backed by a \"no win no fee agreement\" the advantages as to costs and mark up are enjoyed by all the parties to that action.  If there is more than one party who has a \"no win no fee agreement\" the best parts of all the \"no win no fee agreements\" should be given to all the parties.  Hopefully that would deter many of the spurious claims which are being made.\r\n",
