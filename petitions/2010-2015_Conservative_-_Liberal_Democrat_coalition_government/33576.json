It is easily possible that the rest of the UK may disagree with the subject, but have no ability to pronounce this disagreement other than creating an opposing petition - a laborious and cumbersome method of showing negation which most people are unlikely to do.\r\n\r\nThis petition moves that the government allows users of this website to add their signature directly opposing the contents of a petition, as well as in support.",
