        "additional_details": "Say no to people out of work getting luxury council homes for nothing. Everyone needs support at some point in their life, however it is senseless to be providing homes with glass balconies and video intercoms for those who have no job, and have paid little taxes.\r\n\r\nMoreover, those that sign petition the government to have stronger regulation on those in council homes. Take a drive through a primarily council house area and you will see people driving expensive cars, how is it fair that they should have these things when they are being supported by those who work hard and still cannot afford these things.\r\n\r\nNeed an example - Brand new development in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, glass balcony's, video entrance phones, price to one tenant? \u00a30 PCM.\r\n\r\nSay no to a hand out state! Sign and say no to those that con the system and take advantage of those that work hard and still struggle!",
