When someone claiming jobseekers goes to an interview they bring their book with them, in that book is contact information for someone at the job centre. The interviewer submits a one-paragraph description of the interview. If it's deemed the jobseeker is not actively seeking jobs or is not putting effort into making a good interview, ban them from claiming benefits for 12 months.",
