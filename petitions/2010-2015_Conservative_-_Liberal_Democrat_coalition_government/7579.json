However, the members of the Voluntary Aid Societies (St.John Ambulance, the Red Cross and St.Andrew's Ambulance) are not to be considered for the Medal.\r\n\r\nThey frequently support and work in partnership with the statutory ambulance services facing similar challenges with no remuneration for their services.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, respectfully request that the Department of Culture Media and Sport reverse their original decision and award the Diamond Jubilee Medal to qualifying members of the Voluntary Aid Societies listed above.",
