        "additional_details": "At 23 yrs old my life was just beginning then was cruelly taken away by an instant second caused by a knife in an unprovoked attack!\r\nThe knife penetrated through my heart and caused me to have a significate stroke, brain damage, epilepsy. Still I have remaining holes in my heart.\r\nKnife crime is not controlled and tough measures need to be in place to prevent a child from dying.\r\nThese following three laws should be changed-\r\n1.Schools need educating in knife crime of what the penalties are and that a single knife wound can cause death.\r\n2.prison sentence should be clear with a sentence and adhered too.\r\n3.Knifes and offensive weapons should have to require a licence.\r\nThe prisons will soon be overflowing with young murderers but if a sentence was carried out when caught with a knife then there would be hope that they would learn by this in the future.\r\nIf you carry a knife you have it for a reason and at some point that knife will be used.\r\nSave lives!! Prevent knifes!",
