It's is done by a withdrawal statement. This process wastes the police and courts time and allows the offender to be released. The majority of these instances the offender will reoffend against the same victim and a similar pattern will follow thus stopping the police from positively acting.\r\n\r\nThis proposal aims to stop that process. If a victim wishes to change their story they can do so in front if a judge at the trial and provide a legal reason why it should not be used. Most victims have been subject to years of abuse and are often controlled by offender.",
