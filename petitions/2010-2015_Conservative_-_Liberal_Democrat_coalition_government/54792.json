        "additional_details": "From the questionnaire for work capability assessment, through to dealing with ATOS Healthcare and the DWP and Jobcentres, genuinely disabled people are being treated unfairly, unreasonably and nobody cares.\r\n\r\nFiles are being reviewed months after they should be due to a national backlog, so people are having payments stopped.  People are routinely put into the wrong group after assessment by ATOS staff not doctors or the medical profession.\r\n\r\nThe whole system for disabled ESA claimants is stressful, and for many mental health patients worsens their conditions.  With benefits cuts, we need to stop taking off those who already have nothing and fewer opportunities than able bodied people, whilst leaving richer people untouched. Please this is criminal.",
