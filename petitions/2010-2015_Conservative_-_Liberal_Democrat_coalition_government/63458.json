I don't think MySpace or Twitter do.\r\nHow are you supposed to meet anyone new? If it is really that wrong then why do Facebook allow you to recommend friends and even recommend friends themselves? I have even been blocked for adding recommendations.\r\nHow do Facebook know someone is telling the truth? I heard one day that someone got blocked for adding his cousin.\r\nWhat if you find an old friend here?\r\nIf you agree that this law is unjust then please sign.",
