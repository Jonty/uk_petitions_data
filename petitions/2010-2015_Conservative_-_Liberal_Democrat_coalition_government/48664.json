        "additional_details": "The aim of this British and Irish Tombola Suggestion (BITS) is to refocus Ireland's national conversation on strategic cross-frontier infrastructural projects in a way which de-politicises the debate and makes it about the work, relationships, sustainability and building for a shared future. The development of a causeway bridge between Scotland and Ireland more than any other project could encapsulate the national and intra-national debate between the islands of Britain and Ireland. Meanwhile the fast-tracking of planned transition related infrastructural projects across the North West Carboniferous Basin cross-border region - of South Ulster - will serve to stabilise and integrate and otherwise dislocated and volatile border region now subject to the controversial shalegas debate.\r\n\r\nFor full details visit:\r\nhttps://secure.avaaz.org/en/petition/The_Britain_Ireland_Tombola_Suggestion_Build_a_Bridge_and_Get_Over_it/edit/",
