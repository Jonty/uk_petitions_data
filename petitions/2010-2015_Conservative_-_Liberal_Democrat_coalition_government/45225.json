        "additional_details": "Capitalism is the basis upon which western society is founded.\u00a0There are numerous legal entities in order for business to operate. Legal frameworks which set out how the business will operate, be governed, protect the consumer, the environment, etc. There are regulators, watch dogs and ultimately free speech which serve to highlight irregularities, breaches of conduct, exploitation; control the primative traits of human nature.Which brings me to my point. I believe there needs to be an overarching set of business ethics established which embarks upon the monumental task of defining how businesses interact. We have witnessed this in Financial Services and more recently The Press.If you agree with me that the establishment of a moral framework, code of ethics to which business can be held accountable be established, then I urge you to sign this petition.",
