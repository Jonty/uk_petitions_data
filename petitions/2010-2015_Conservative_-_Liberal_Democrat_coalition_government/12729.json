This would make a once great channel, responsible for \"The Road to Coronation Street\" and \"The Thick Of It\", just another \"repeats channel\". Satalite and Freeview are slaready littered with pretty much nothing but these channels already.\r\n\r\nBBC 4 must remain in a position to provide original content of the wide variety it does today and not simply documentaries restricted to a single discipline and repeats.",
