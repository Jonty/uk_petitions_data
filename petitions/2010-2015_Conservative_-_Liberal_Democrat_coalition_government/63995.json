        "additional_details": "Death by Dangerous Driving in the UK can net those found guilty of the offense up to 14years in prison.  This though is not happening.   Often those who are found guilty are sentenced to 4-7years, a driving ban and an extended driving test.  This is not giving the UK population a sense of Justice and does not provide an adequate deterrent.\r\n\r\nOn 16th April 2014 Alexander Walter pled guilty to several driving offences including causing the deaths of two cyclists.  He received a sentence of 10 years 3 months for causing death by dangerous driving and 12 months for each of the other charges to be run concurrenty, despite previous convictions.  Looking at the CPS sentencing manual this seems lenient.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, call for\r\n- a tougher stance on sentencing those who cause deaths whilst in charge of a motor vehicle,\r\n- mandatory handing of consecutive not concurret sentences,\r\n- a set minimum sentence for repeat offenders.",
