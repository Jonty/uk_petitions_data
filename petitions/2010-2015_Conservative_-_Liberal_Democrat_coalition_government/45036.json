Yet, this government are searching for initiative ideas from students to boost the UK's economy. This has lead to demotivated students going to university which potentially will have a huge debt. Within Europe we - England where this has occurred- are ranked 1st in terms recieving higher education at this kind of valve. As a student I believe this is awfully wrong.\r\n\r\n",
