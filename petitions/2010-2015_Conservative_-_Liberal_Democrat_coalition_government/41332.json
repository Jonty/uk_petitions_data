Current Pensioners not qualifying for government top ups, will receive \u00a3107.45 pw even though contributing for 40 years +. Pro-rata, thousands of current pensioners will be 70% worse off than new pensioners. The government should make the new pension proposals fair and equitable to ALL pensioners. The distribution of the state pension so that one group of people will be worse off than another even though they have contributed more, is against the main principle of welfare distribution that advocates that it must be Fair and Equitable to ALL. The current proposals break this rule and it would be so simple to fix, but no-one in Parliament is listening to me.  ",
