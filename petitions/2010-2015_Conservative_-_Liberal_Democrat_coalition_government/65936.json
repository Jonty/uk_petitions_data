Builders have failed to build enough small houses.  Affordable housing should be defined as 4 times the median wage. Builders seeking to build > 5 houses should be made to build  4 small homes for each larger one.\r\n2. Land prices have soared  A tax should be placed on land sales, so that over a certain price 15% should be used,  rising 15% annually to 90%..\r\n3. Tax anomalies make it less viable to build on brownfield sites. This position must be reversed..\r\n4. Average earnings are declining.
