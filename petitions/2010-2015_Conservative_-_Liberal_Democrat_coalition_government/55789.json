As other students will know, being a student isn't easy finance wise, so car sharing is a huge necessity, if this new law was to be put in to place, I would not be able to carry someone under 30 in the car with me, so would be unable to do this, also after 22:00, when my university course rehearsals usually finish, or returning home from work, would not be able to commute home without a guardian over the age of 30. Yes, the law is good for preventing accidents in young drivers, but it's simply not practical in most cases and needs to be seriously considered.",
