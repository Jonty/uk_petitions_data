        "additional_details": "Car insurance costs have been on the rise for at least 5 years, especially for young people.\r\nFor the past 2 years the cost of insuring a vehicle for a young driver is near on impossible without the aid of parents to pay for it as most young drivers are either in education or a part time job, which makes it hard for a young person to insure a vehicle, let alone run it.\r\nSome young drivers have had quotes for a small vehicle in excess of \u00a33000 a year!\r\nSign this E-petition to help to try and put a stop to the rise of car insurance and even help to reduce it.",
