Fast and appropriate action needs be taken against these parents.\r\ne.g.\r\n-back payment compulsory whilst on JSA.\r\n-JSA stopped when behaviour pattern is established\r\n-court fines\r\n-compulsory attachment of earnings without consent from absent parent.\r\n-develop a system that can red flag and monitor those that abuse the system.",
