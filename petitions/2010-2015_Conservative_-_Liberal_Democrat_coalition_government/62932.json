        "additional_details": "Under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, employers have a general duty towards its employees and members of the public, to ensure so far as is reasonably practical their health, safety and welfare.\r\n\r\nThis is regulated within a place of work but the use of a cash machine (ATM) seems to have either been overlooked or ignored as a responsibility of the banks. It seems that they assume that outside their premises is public space and not under their jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nI believe that banks have a legal responsibility when offering a service to ensure the health, safety and welfare of their customers, even when the transaction is being conducted outside of their premises.\r\n\r\nIf a bank or retailer wants to encourage custom by using cash machines (ATM) which in itself creates a potential hazard, then they must also accept the responsibility for ensuring, where ever possible, the safety of that user.\r\n\r\nI would like to see the ATM providers comply to regulated standards of practice\r\n",
