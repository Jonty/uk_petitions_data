By encouraging drink-driving they run contrary to Government policy, health recommendations and Police advice. Suppliers of these drugs claim that they will not improve the performance of a driver who has been drinking. So they are merely a tool to pass a breath test and avoid the penalty for law breaking; and they decrease the safety of other road users and pedestrians.\u201d\r\n\r\n",
