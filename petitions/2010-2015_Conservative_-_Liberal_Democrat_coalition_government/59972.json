HABINTEG\r\n         ACCESSIBLE HOMES\r\n       INDEPENDENT LIVES\r\n\r\nI feel this is an invitation to any passing thief or conman and therefore compromises the safety of vulnerable people.\r\nFurther more I strongly object to being \"labelled\" as different,raising a discrimination element.\r\nPlease sign if you agree. Thank you.\r\nI believe government should legislate to protect vulnerable people in such accomodation.",
