        "additional_details": "Right, the HS2 project is the new project that is going to make it quicker to get from London to Birmingham and then Birmingham to wherever. The entire project is expected to be completed in 2026 which means, by then the whole system may be obsolete, thus wasting over a billion pounds in the process.\r\nI am a 16 year old boy from North Lincolnshire and even I know what damage that could do to the economy and the people's opinions of the government and the choices they make.\r\nMy idea is that instead of wasting billions of pounds on something that is clearly a waste of money, and spend it on, lets say; upgrading the already existing main tracks from London to the major cities so that better, more efficient and faster trains can run on them... Surely that would cost less than creating an entirely new track, relocating hundreds of people and yet once again ruining Britain's countryside.",
