        "additional_details": "The coalition government have chosen to abolish Business Link and replace it with a remote online service.  Millions of people have used Business Link and have benefited from the huge amount of expertise and knowledge it provides free of charge. I have personally encountered over 4,500 Start Up hopefuls who have expressed, through testimony and feedback, the enormous help Business Link has provided.\r\n\r\nGiven the poor economic climate and depressed job market, there is an even greater need to encourage business enterprise. The government have elected to abolish the only, universally recognised, support service for people considering self employment.\r\n\r\nYes, the offer can be improved and streamlined but the government must reconsider their decision and not axe this valuable service.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition today and help save this critically important service.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your support.  Best wishes,\r\nKen Horn, Business Start Up Expert,\r\n\r\nwww.kenhorn.co.uk\r\n",
