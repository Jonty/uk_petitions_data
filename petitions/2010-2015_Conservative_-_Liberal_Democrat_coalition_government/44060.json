Therefore very few positions are actually listed with the Job Centre.\r\n\r\nBy making it compulsory for employers to list any vacancies with the Job Centre, workers have one national website to find work. Thus making the search for employment far more simplified.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence to suggest the wide array of job listing websites contribute to the economy, or provide any meaningful number of jobs.\r\n\r\nOne website, every job in the country, and suddenly, the search for employment has become a lot more simple.",
