        "additional_details": "I am a working mum and object to the idea of extending the schools daily hours. I feel so strongly about this subject. My child spends six hours, five days a week receiving an education. If this bill were passed, Children would be working an eight hour day!! Leave our children to be children. Leave the parents to parent as they deem fit. Not all parents want to work till 5.30pm. We would like a balanced family life too.\r\nIncreasing a school day will not increase the amount they learn and will not increase academic results. A smaller class size would though. Maybe the government could reduce the average pupil count in classes.\r\n We would like the government to stop the bill being passed.  ",
