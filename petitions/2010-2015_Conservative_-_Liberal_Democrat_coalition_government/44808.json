        "additional_details": "Recent years have seen an increase in police focusing on catching those who avoid paying car insurance, which is fantastic!\r\n\r\nHowever, we often see that once these people have been convicted, they still seem to be in a better position financially, as the fine is less than their insurance would be!\r\n\r\nWe generally see these criminals being fined around \u00a3200, nowhere near the maximum \u00a35000! By avoiding expensive insurance costs, some of these criminals are saving themselves money even when they are caught breaking the law! How is this fair!?\r\n\r\nCan the government look into a new and fairer way to discipline these people for the crime that they commit?\r\n\r\n(It would be a great if a fairer system could be introduced, such as fining them TWICE the amount of a realistic insurance premium that they would have paid for the one year... This information is easily accessible within minutes via online compare sites.)",
