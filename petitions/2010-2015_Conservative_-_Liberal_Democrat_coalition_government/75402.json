        "additional_details": "The Palace of Westminster will purchase a large building and establish within dormitories. MPs who feel the need to stay in London, working late etc. Can stay in the MPs hostel. The purchase, conversion and running of this hostel would be considerably cheaper than 'buying' each and every MP a second London home, as We do at the moment. No mortgage interest, household insurance, telephone bills and hotel bills on expenses, plus Us the people of this Island would still own the hostel regardless of who was voted in.\r\nMPs who are unhappy with this arrangement need not stand for election.",
