Terrorist organisations such as Al-Qaeda, ISIS and the Taliban have prompted western intervention, but it is not enough. The vile global attacks must be addressed.  A rise in the frequency of terrorist attacks across the globe, demands a rise in defiance against it.\r\nProposition to the House of Commons for discussion is to work with the UN and other countries to assemble a unified body, wholly committed to ending these attacks once and for all; no half measures.\r\nFull-scale military intervention to end terrorism. Humanitarian missions to be conducted, with the full scale and scope of the Armed Forces. Working with NGO's to give people across the globe their humans rights, with funding from the UN to support this objective\r\nIt's time we stood up to the actions of sickening extremists, will the unity of every man, woman and child, to be free from terror. It\u2019s not a privilege; it\u2019s a basic right. ",
