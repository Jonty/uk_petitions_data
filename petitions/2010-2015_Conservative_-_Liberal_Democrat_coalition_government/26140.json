        "additional_details": "There is a proposal in Parliament to put the clocks forward two hours in the spring but only put them back one hour in the Autumn. This will mean during the depths of winter sunrise will be as late as 10.00am. All children will then go to school in the dark. We are told that there is no greater risk of accidents BUT be wary that if this proves not to be the case then maybe schools will revise their start times to avoid the darkness to keep children safer. If this happens working parents will be very much affected. Additionally this means that in the summer sunset will be as late as 10.30pm maybe good for some businesses but studies have shown it has a negative impact on health in general.\r\n\r\nIf you feel that getting up in the dark up to 10.00 o'clock in the morning and making children go to school in the dark is unnacceptable then please sign this petition so we can show the government the people do not want the change.",
