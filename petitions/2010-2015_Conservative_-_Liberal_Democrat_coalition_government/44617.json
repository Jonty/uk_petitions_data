        "additional_details": "Please refuse Camelot permission to double the cost of a National Lottery Ticket. The lottery has already been doubled in original cost with the introduction of the Tuesday draw. Doubling the cost too \u00a32.00 per ticket is going to prove a costly expense to the lower paid, struggling families who see a lottery win as a bright light in the economic gloom we are all suffering. Most players have a set of favourite 'lucky' numbers. Camelots greed will now cost them double for this hope. Camelots argument that there has not been an increase in line with inflation does not wash, the prizes are not in line with inflation, IT IS A LOTTERY!\r\nPlease keep OUR national lottery as it is!",
