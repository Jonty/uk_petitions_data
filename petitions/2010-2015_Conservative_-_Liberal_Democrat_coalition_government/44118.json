I propose more information, leaflets, adverts to promote awareness and make people not feel so alone, get it recognised. More groups, advertise numbers to phone when your feeling at your absolute wits end, or encourage them to seek medical advice. It would be nice if someday it was more understood by both suffers and friends/family of the sufferer. It would also be an idea to give out questionnaires on your mental well being out to be filled in and returned to your doctor, it's so very hard to explain the exact feelings your having so this could give doctors a clearer picture of what you're going through so you can get the suitable treatment and support.
