        "additional_details": "Secondary schools require improvements ensuring the inclusion of information surrounding pornography as part of Sex Education (SE), starting from Year 7.\r\n\r\n Children and young people are naturally curious at a time in their lives when they are becoming sexually aware. More adequate coverage is needed in SE, informing the children of the dangers surrounding online safety, what pornography is as well as the impacts it can have on real relationships. SE needs to be angled towards modern problems and debates, as well as presenting it in a way that neither alienates nor isolates young people. Young persons should be reminded that the people acting in pornographic material are acting, and are neither a substitute nor realistic representation of real relationships.",
