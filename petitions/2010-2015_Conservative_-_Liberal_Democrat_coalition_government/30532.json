        "additional_details": "Someone created a page on Facebook called 'The Ultimate Dead Baby Joke Book', and despite all of the reports from people who are outraged about this page, Facebook has not done anything. This page is filled with disgusting, horrific jokes about 'dead' babies, including survival tactics, recipes, sex tips, storing tips, eating tips and what to do when the police find you with a dead baby! This is outrageous and completely inappropriate. They have now hit an all time low and a few members have aimed jokes at outraged girls who have lost their child. we need to stand up for these girls and babies for the sake of our friend, family and children. It is now being sold on amazon and play.com\r\n\r\nour aim is the get the page removed from facebook and to get this book off amazon and to stop it from being published !",
