        "additional_details": "The country we lve in is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. We have a democratic tradition. It cannot be right that only about 10% of the people of the UK (i.e. those living in Scotland) are allowed to vote on whether the UK should be broken up. The Government should ensure that all the electorate is given a vote in a referendum - including consistency for 16 and 17 year olds. Parliament would then be bound to take account of the results of a UK wide referendum before pasing any legislation that changes the very basis of the United Kingdom.",
