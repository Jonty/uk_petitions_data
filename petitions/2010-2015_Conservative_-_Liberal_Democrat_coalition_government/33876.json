        "additional_details": "Can we increase the import Tax to companies that now produce in countries like China, Pakistan etc, that are outside  EEC. Especially if they have taken their production from our country adding to the big increase in unemployment. It might help to even out the playing field throughout Europe. I am sure this would gain support from all European countries. We need to get manufacturing back. Also can we increase tax paid by migrant workers coming to this country from outside the EEC. This is another area where we have lost jobs and should make coming to this country less attractive.  All countries should put their our citizens first.",
