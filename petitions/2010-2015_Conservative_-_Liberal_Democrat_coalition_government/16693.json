        "action": "No taxpayer funding of political parties without a referendum",
        "additional_details": "This petition recognises that the funding crisis of the Westminster parties is due to the distrust and alienation of increasing sections of the British public from official politics. Any attempt to shore up this funding gap with taxpayers money, as recommended by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, without the explicit consent of taxpayers would be a fundamental breach of the cardinal principle of 'no taxation without representation'.\r\n\r\nThis petition strongly opposes any such measure and demands that it should be subject to a nationwide popular referendum before introduction.",
