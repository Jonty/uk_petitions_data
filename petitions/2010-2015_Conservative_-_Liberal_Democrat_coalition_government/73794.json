        "action": "Stop GM-crops in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Once we start growing GM crops in the UK there is NO way back, they cross-contaminate other crops because GM pollen is effectively an invisible pollution that can reproduce. Canada can't grow organic oilseed rape anymore and Spain is losing its organic sweetcorn because all these crops have been contaminated. GM seeds are also patented, neighbouring farmers are being sued by the biotech companies if their seed stocks get contaminated with GM. This has led to many American farmers buying GM products simply because they can't afford the risk that their land might have picked up GM 'traits' from contamination. All I ask is that you at least educate yourself about GM crops and the risks and effects to environment AND human health. I recommend looking at: http://www.stopgm.org.uk/ and if you, like me don\u2019t agree with GM crops in the UK and want the government to ensure it doesn't happen please sign this petition. ",
