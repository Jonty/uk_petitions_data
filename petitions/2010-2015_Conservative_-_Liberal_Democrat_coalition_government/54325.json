The dogs also attacked my other cat smudge and left her with one eye. It is illegal to have out of control dogs but not illegal if a dog kills a family pet. This is a disgrace because family pets can suffer. I am calling for Daisy and Bella 's law because it was through out of control aggressive dogs that they died.",
