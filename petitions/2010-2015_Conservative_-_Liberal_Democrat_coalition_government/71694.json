        "additional_details": "On November 6 2014, Allen Lambert of Norfolk, a gamekeeper, will be sentenced for killing 11 birds of prey. Gamekeepers are the number 1 killer of these beautiful creatures. The killing of them is ironically to facilitate people then going out and shooting birds such as pheasants \"for sport\". There should be a much higher penance for people who murder these regal and protected creatures that will help discourage such events in the future. The real crime is that they walk away having paid only small fines with no jail time.",
