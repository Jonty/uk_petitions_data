        "additional_details": "We wish the government to introduce legislation in the UK and lobby for adoption in the whole of the EU, that no air travel shall be permitted for routes under 200 miles, except where they cross substantial stretches of water. For example Dublin to Liverpool would be permitted or Helsinki to Tartu as they are over water but not Birmingham to London or Bristol to York.\r\nThis is in recognition that take-off and landing use proportionately more fuel than cruising at altitude and that air transport is a major contributor to global warming which now seems unlikely to be possible to contain at 2 degrees rise due to excessive CO2 emissions. The distance should be increased as and when possible, for instance when high speed trains are introduced.",
