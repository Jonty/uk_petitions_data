Let him die and let it be.\" regarding the colour of Fabrice Muamba's skin, he has also tweeted \"One less jiggaboo if you ask me.\" He has tweeted out many more offensive tweets, some much too offensive to display on here. His abusive tweets have also targeted the UK and The Royal Family. Please get this monstrosity off Twitter please.",
