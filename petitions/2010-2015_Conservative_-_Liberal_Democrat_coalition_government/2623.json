The people who live there have made the ultimate sacrifice for Queen (or King) and Country and have contributed to the economic well being of the UK.\r\n\r\nWe should invite the Overseas Territories to join the United Kingdom with the same status as England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This would be put to a referendum in each territory.\r\n\r\nIf a territory votes to accept the invitation then they would be accepted into the United Kingdom as equal partners and enabled to send MPs to Westminster. They would also be able to keep their own Executive Bodies as precedent as been set for this with the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
