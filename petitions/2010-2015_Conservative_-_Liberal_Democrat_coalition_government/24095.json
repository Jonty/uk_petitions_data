        "additional_details": "Many clubs in Britain (Premier League especially) are now subject to foreign investment and, while some prospective owners are well-intentioned, countless others are in it purely for the publicity and higher profile awareness for their business.\r\nCases include: Portsmouth F.C, Notthingham County, Liverpool F.C, Blackburn Rovers and many others.\r\nWhile I admit Football isn't the be all and end all it does affect many things in the community. For example if a club goes into administration due to poor management then jobs are lost, fans money is lost on local businesses such as pubs etc.\r\nOften a football club is the beating heart of a community, fans work hard all week so that they can afford the now extortianate price of a ticket and for what? To see their club run by people who could not care less and who have not got a clue what a massive responsibility owning a football club entails.\r\nIf you care about football at all then please add your signature, YOUR CLUB MAY BE NEXT!",
