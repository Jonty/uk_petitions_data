        "additional_details": "Personally as a teetotaller, a minimum price (say \u00a30.50) for each unit of alcohol is acceptable. A bottle of whisky (70cl) would therefore cost \u00a314. However this would result in higher profits for distillers, breweries, pubs and off licences, unless HMG tax each unit at a fixed amount (say \u00a30.25). Such extra alcohol (& tobacco) duty received by HMRC should be used to fund medical research of high importance and need (but not necessarily of direct relevance to addiction to alcohol & other drugs); like funding research into utilising stem cells for diabetics & organ/tissue transplants, cancer, etc.",
