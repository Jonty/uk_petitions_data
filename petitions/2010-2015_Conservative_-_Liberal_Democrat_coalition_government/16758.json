        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that libraries within educational institutes are a vital part of the education system and that they should be protected from any form of closure. Due to budget cuts within educational funding, schools are starting to target there library services and some are even closing them. I believe that any school that get\u2019s government funding should be required by law to have a library that is fully accessible by students and staff. Within County Durham, Durham Johnston School got a brand new site under the BSF (building schools for the future) scheme and have just recently decided to close their brand new library within the new school due to funding cuts. This is an example of what is to come and we could see more libraries closing within the education sector. It is vital that all schools have a library because they provide a central location for student to obtain reliable and accurate information.",
