Currently we have a mini-army which is a laughing stock, a navy that has ships scattered throughout the world and an air force that is no longer is no longer the envy of the world.\r\n\r\nIncrease MoD budget by stopping tax avoidance by removing all loop holes, chase companies who avoid corporation tax and have them back pay to the UK government what they owe. Remove restrictions on trading with all commonwealth nations, which has a bigger economy then the EU; to improve trade and therefore revenue and those who are convicted of benefit fraud to repay all monies.",
