        "additional_details": "Ban the joint sales and rentals of properties because of the inherent conflict of interest.\r\n\r\nThere is no incentive for estate agents to lower house sales during a recession because they can fall back on rental incomes. This is complicated by the fact that high house prices keeps people renting thus reinforcing their gauranteed income base making them less concerned about lowering sale prices in order to make sales.\r\n\r\nSeperating these two business interests will make the sales business competitive in the public interest.",
