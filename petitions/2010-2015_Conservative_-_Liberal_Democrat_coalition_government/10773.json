        "additional_details": "One of the problems we have had in dealing with the recent riots is that magistrates do not have sufficient powers or flexibility to deal with local situations.\r\n\r\nI suggest we need a new Riot Act.  A magistrate should have the authority to \"read the Act\" as in the past - and, having done so, assume wide additional powers for up to, say, 28 days. Powers could include the ability to prohibit specific acts by individuals or groups, declare curfews, give binding orders and to state the penalties for non-compliance in advance. The powers of punishment of magistrates should also be increased - say, maximum period of imprisonment up to 2 years from 6 months currently, during the period of the declaration.\r\n\r\nI petition that Parliament should consider the need for a new Riot Act under the control of magistrates.",
