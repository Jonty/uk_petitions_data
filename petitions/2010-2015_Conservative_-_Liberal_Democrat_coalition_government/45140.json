        "additional_details": "Trans fat (which means trans fatty acids) is the worst kind of fat, far worse than saturated fat. Partial hydrogenation is an industrial process used to make good oil into bad oil. The process is used to make oil more solid and provide longer fry-life for cooking oils. The big problem is that partially hydrogenated oil is laden with lethal trans fat.\r\n\r\nTrans fats cause significant and serious lowering of HDL (good) cholesterol and a significant and serious increase in LDL (bad) cholesterol; make the arteries more rigid; cause major clogging of arteries; cause insulin resistance; cause or contribute to type 2 diabetes; and cause or contribute to other serious health problems.\r\n\r\nThe British Heart Foundation are calling for a series of measures to reduce industrial trans fats including:\r\n\r\n- targeting levels of trans fats\r\n\r\n- labeling trans fats on food packaging.\r\n\r\nHowever, I the undersigned propose that we dump the half measures and remove trans fats from the market.
