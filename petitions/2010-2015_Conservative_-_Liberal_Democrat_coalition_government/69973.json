Scotland will allocate money to Westminster to cover an appropriate share of defence and foreign affairs costs.\r\n- The Scottish Parliament must be made permanent\r\n- all powers devolved must be made permanent\r\nDevo Max must be granted, as promised, according to the timetable and is NOT dependent on any constitutional change elsewhere - otherwise the indyref result must be held null and void, having been won by false promises.",
