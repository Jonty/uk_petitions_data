        "additional_details": "Surely many members of the public agree that the salary for a nurse simply does not match the duties, responsibilities and competencies that each nurse must meet and undertake in daily work.\r\nThe salary for nurses should be increased since there is an ever growing change and need for nurses  to show advanced technological and clinical expertise. Why do the wages for nurses not reflect the nature of the work that they perform?\r\nThe nurses are responsible for the 24/7 care that each patient will receive in a hospital ward area.\r\nA drastic salary overhaul is needed to keep students like myself interested in future job prospects regardless of the reason they wish to become a nurse.\r\nThe cost of living is increasing by hundreds of pounds each year, and by offering an unattractive salary for front line healthcare staff such as nurses, the public will suffer by the falling number of people willing to register as nurses in the future.\r\nSomething has to be done!",
