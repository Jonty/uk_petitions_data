        "action": "Make Faith Healing Illegal in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Faith \"healing\" is damaging. It has both ruined and claimed the lives of men, women, and children around the world. Faith \"healing\" should never fall under the banner of religious freedom. Faith \"healers\" prey on the ignorant for profit, and fly around the world on private jets while their victims suffer by not seeking professional medical help.\r\n\r\nIf a doctor claims to have healed an individual when in reality he/she has not it's malpractice. When a faith healer does the same it's religion. We live in the 21st century and this needs to change. This petition asks that faith \"healing\" be made illegal in the United Kingdom, and that those who take part in this form of charlatanry pay back what they've taken from their victims and be sent to prison.
