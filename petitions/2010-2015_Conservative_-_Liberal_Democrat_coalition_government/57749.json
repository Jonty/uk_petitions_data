When their home benefit ran out they had a choice- fund themselves or go home.\r\n\r\nThese rules allowed EU nationals to look for & work in the UK but stopped them from being a drain on the host nation.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the current rules allow people who will always be on some form of benefit (traditional benefits or tax credits) or whose home country doesn't have such benefits (such as disability) to come to the UK & drain UK taxpayers.\r\n\r\nThe government should re-impose the old rules immediately, insist that all costs (such as NHS care) are recovered from their home nation and tell the EU that unless they are willing to pay these bills (instead of the UK taxpayer), they cannot tell us who, or what to pay for.",
