        "additional_details": "Companies should not be allowed to place defaults on people's credit files, without first obtaining a specific court order, and also notifying the individual of their intent to place a default.\r\n\r\nBy allowing companies at present to place defaults 'as they see fit', they are systematically destroying the economy of this country. The government have recently tried to make more money available to lenders, however this money will not be lent out to those who need it due to some gross negligence from a company.\r\n\r\nLikewise, an appropriate system should be put in place to allow people to appropriately defend the accusation when made. Therefore by going to court to obtain an order to place a default, gives a chance to the public to defend against the action. ",
