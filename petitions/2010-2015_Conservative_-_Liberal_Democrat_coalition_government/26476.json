        "additional_details": "It is rumored that the BBC is set to bring the Football League Show to an end for bugetory reasons. The signatories to this petition believe that the show is important to many sports fans and that the BBC would be forced to reconsider if ratings massively increased and believe that the best method to achieve this is for the government to pressure the BBC to remove Steve Claridge as a pundit and replace him with Rob 'npower' Collins. Claridge is regarded by many viewers as one of the worst football pundits but Mr Collins would keep the viewers hooked with his limitless knowledge of obscure facts and figures, the fact that Ray Stubbs is a Tranmere fan and the alarmingly long list of football personalities that are 'ex-Tranmere'",
