The very thought that convicted criminals should have money spent on them to protect them, is just atrocious. If they have committed such awful crimes, surely they should have to live with the consequences of their actions?! If you take this right away I believe this would make people think twice before committing such awful offences. It has been put forward that all convicted criminals in the future may not have the right to Anonymity, I am putting forward that ALL criminals that have Anonymity now have that right immediately taken away!!
