        "additional_details": "To counteract the \u2018unfair advantage\u2019 held by online retailers the Government should implement a two-tiered system of Value Added Tax (VAT). For example online retailers may be subject to a 25% rate whilst those which have a physical presence on the \u2018high street\u2019 may be subject to a reduced rate of 15%. This will help to preserve numerous jobs and improve the vitality that the High Street offers as well as potentially generating additional tax revenue to help ease the current national debt crisis.",
