        "additional_details": "The electorate in Northern Ireland are not able to change their Government. They are stuck with a system which only permits a mandatory coalition between the two largest parties. There is no prospect of loose or informal coalitions, single party Governments or minority governments. This system was instituted by the discredited Blair Government in 1998. Many of Blair's 'achievements' are being questioned now and it is time a searchlight was shown on how he created this rigged power-sharing set up. Urgent legislation is needed at Westminster to restore democracy to Northerm Ireland.",
