        "additional_details": "Electricity and gas utilties companies supplying homes in the UK have used coercion to force customers they supply, into higher charges and tariffs, such as letters stating a non payment of bills from decades past.  when you contact the company concern, they immediatley suggest that a security deposit should be made usually the same amount as on the letter, plus that you are treated as a new customer, this means higher charges and tariffs. This is one of many such tactics used.  Should the customer agree to this, they will then not proceed with further action.  I would want such coercion, made illegal and unlimited fines for the company, and charges and tariffs lowered for the customer.",
