        "additional_details": "We are calling for an INDEPENDENT inquest into the role of the current West Yorkshire's Chief Constable Sir Norman Bettison throughout the Hillsborough cover up.\r\n\r\nGiven that he was at the very least implicated, and at the very worst involved, in a deliberate and despicable cover-up by South Yorkshire Police, we believe that his current position, knighthood and pension should be called into review.\r\n\r\nWhilst his retirement from the force in March 2013 is welcomed, this should not mean that he does not have to face the consequences for his actions.  It is counter-democratic to allow him to continue to lead a privileged life at the tax-payers expense.",
