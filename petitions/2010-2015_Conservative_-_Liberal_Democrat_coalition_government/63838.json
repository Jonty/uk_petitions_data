        "additional_details": "The UK has a chronic and acute housing shortage, particularly for low-income and first time buyers. This applies to both the sale and rental markets.\r\n\r\nToo many properties are bought by foreigners (often off-plan) purely as investments, buy to lets or second/third/fourth homes) or by foreign companies. We should follow the lead of other countries and make it a requirement that to be able to buy (or sell) a UK residential property you must either be a UK citizen OR if a non-UK citizen then you must have legal residency and BE UK resident.\r\n\r\nIn addition the FULL amount of tax should be levied and collected. No discounts or loopholes for UK resident foreign buyers or foreign companies.",
