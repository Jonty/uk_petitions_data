These murders often involve rape and torture of the victims, who are mainly the elderly, women and children.  Genocide Watch have currently placed SA on level 6 on a scale of 1-8 (8 being the worst).  However, white South Africans believe that Europe and America will not grant them asylum.  Please prove them wrong by offering them asylum. http://www.genocidewatch.org/southafrica.html",
