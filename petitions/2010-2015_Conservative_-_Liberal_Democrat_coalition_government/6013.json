Many drivers do not appear to know how they should drive and use the lanes on the motorways as they are not required to do any practical driving on motorways for their Driving Test.\r\nIdeally this test should be renewed every 10 years as the road conditions change.\r\nThis could cause less congestion; decrease road accidents; decrease pollution; be income generating for the government.\r\n",
