        "additional_details": "We the British public wish for our government to consider tightening our sentencing laws. If someone is convicted of murder we expect LIFE SHOULD MEAN LIFE!! All too often murderers are released on license early or at the end of a very SHORT sentence (between 8-20 yrs). We feel that ALL murderers should be incarcerated for the REST of their lives and a life without limitations order NEEDS to be the minimum expected for anyone committing MURDER! There is no justice for the loved ones of their victims at present and all the emphasis is placed on their HUMAN rights, This needs to change as until it does the murder rate in this country will not decrease significantly! No PAROLE should be granted and any extra convictions against them whilst in prison need to be sentenced and ADDED ONTO THE END OF THEIR MAXIMUM SENTENCE not served alongside meaning in effect that LIFE WILL MEAN LIFE IMPRISONMENT! Thank-you.",
