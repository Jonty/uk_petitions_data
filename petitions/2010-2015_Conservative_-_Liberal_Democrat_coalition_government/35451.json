        "additional_details": "LOCOG has a clear agreement with the Musicians\u2019 Union (MU) ahead of the Olympics \u2013 that all professional musicians involved would be paid.  The MU has now gathered countless examples \u2013 some during the last few days - of LOCOG actively flouting this agreement and asking professional musicians to work for no money. The latest example is Unsigned Band Review (with LOCOG) looking for 80 acts to perform to hundreds of thousands of visitors over the course of the Games in the Olympic Park \u2013 for no fee.  If they want musicians to entertain thousands of people then they should pay for it.  It is difficult enough to earn a decent living as a professional musician these days without being asked to work for free.  Who else would?\r\n\r\nThe MU is calling on all musicians who have been asked to work for free at the Olympics to refuse to play, and we are asking the Government and the London Mayor to condemn LOCOG\u2019s policy of not paying professionals.",
