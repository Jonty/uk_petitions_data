        "additional_details": "We do respectfully request that additional traffic speed flow reducing measures be put in place during school hours, and particularly for school coming in and out and 9 am and 3 pm.\r\n\r\nDespite the speed limit being 30 MPH and a reduction to single lane for traffic calming, many drivers speed along the main road past the school when children are disembarking from the school bus.\r\n\r\nThis presents not only an issue of child safety but also a driving hazard. For the safety of children and motorists, we urge that flashing lights and a 20 MPH speed limit, during school arrival and departure times, should be provided. In addition, providing a crossing patrol officer on the main road would greatly improve safety.\r\n\r\nWe request that the situation be risk assessed, and action be taken to improve it, before a child is hurt.",
