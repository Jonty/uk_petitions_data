        "additional_details": "Since we lost heritage route 9, it would be nice to add a new one, especially as it is the 60th anniversary of the routemaster.\r\n\r\nOxford Street is London and it really feels like London, it would make Oxford Street feel even better if we had a routemaster running through it, tourists would love it and if it only comes every 20 minutes or something like that, it wouldn't really affect the congestion.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I say RML instead of RM, is because we already have an RM on heritage route 15, but we don't have RML's. RML's were built for London just like the RM.\r\n\r\nI know we have the new bus for london, but it wouldn't hurt to add one more heritage route using original routemasters.\r\n\r\nIt would also be nice to keep the bars silver and keep the floors wooden, to make it look and feel classic, as that would be special.\r\n\r\n",
