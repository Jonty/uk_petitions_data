        "additional_details": "If a person currently dies in the UK without a will, the estate is currently \"up for grabs\" for Heir Hunting companies who try to contact sometimes distant relations, most probably unknown to the deceased, to distribute the estate. They also make large sums of money in commission. It is a proposal to instead keep the proceeds of the estate by the Government for spending on the NHS. The money must be ring-fenced for this purpose and not spent on general government funding. If a person does not make a Will then the assumption should be made that they do not have any clear idea of who should benefit.",
