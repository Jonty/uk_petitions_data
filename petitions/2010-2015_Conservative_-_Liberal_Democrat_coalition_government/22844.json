        "additional_details": "Eastern Congo's minerals are considered to be the equivalent to Africa's blood diamonds. The shocking reality is that this is an issue few people are aware of, yet it is our consumer needs that has led to the plight of the Congolese people.The electronic devices we use contain minerals (e.g. coltan) mined in the Congo; unbeknown to the world, these have caused a bloody battle - armed groups are fighting over them, leaving behind a trail of human destruction:6 million reported deaths, women have been raped and communities destroyed. Their reasoning: to exert authority through violence, thus profiting from the mining. The UK Government must take the following initiatives: (1) Adopt \"Dodd-Frank\" style regulations. (2) Protect Congolese civilians from the violence. (3) Ensure the provision of a scheme that offers credible traceability for companies to guarantee their products to be conflict-free. It is the responsibility of OUR government and electronics companies to ACT NOW.",
