        "additional_details": "Buchan park is a haven for wildlife and a site of scientific special interest. Crawley borough council own land adjacent to it and consider the land to be the \" only proposed site in Crawley for a permanent Travellers Site\" This would be detrimental to the protection of the Night jar bird which is living 50 metres away from the\r\nProposed site in developed heathland. Access to the site would also be a problem as approach very steep and what is already a busy road will increase in traffic volume not only due to this but also as another 2500 new houses are currently being built just further along the road making safety an issue.\r\n          Please keep Buchan park a beautiful place for all to visit and keep the natural wildlife safe by not developing this land\r\n               ",
