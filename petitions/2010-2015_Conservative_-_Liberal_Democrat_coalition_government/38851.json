        "additional_details": "Public bodies are subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act, so that the public can access information surrounding decisions and plans, and can hold those making the plans to account for them.\r\n\r\nThe government is making it increasingly easy for private providers to bid for, and win, contracts to provide public services - but these companies are currently not subject to the FOI Act.\r\n\r\nThis deprives the British people of the right of access to important information, removes transparency and allows companies to make their decisions about public services without accountability to the public.\r\n\r\nThis needs to change. Please sign this petition and get others to do so.",
