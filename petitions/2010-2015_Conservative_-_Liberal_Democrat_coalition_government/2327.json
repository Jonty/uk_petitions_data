        "additional_details": "The undersigned ask that the House debate the notion that David Cameron should apologise for misrepresenting incapacity benefit claimant figures by not including results of successful appeals or those who have been excluded from the process because it is either too distressing for them or because they cannot physically attend an assessment.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also ask that the debate considers whether French private IT company, Atos' role in assessments should be ended and the process handed over to British medical professionals who are not driven by targets or profits.\r\n",
