B: Re-open Llanrumney High School or C: Put in to place a security team to protect our children.\r\nWe need smaller classes, longer lunch break so that all children can eat and a secure enviroment for our children. We would like a parent/council meeting to discuss issues raised in the 14 days since the school has re-opened. ",
