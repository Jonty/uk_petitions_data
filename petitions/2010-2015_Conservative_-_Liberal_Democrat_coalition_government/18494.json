        "additional_details": "Approximately 3,000 people per year are dying in UK hospitals due to Adverse Drug Reactions. The major problem is that drugs are being prescribed to patients without telling them about how many people died using the given medicine. This is why people do not have an awareness about the extent of health damage prior to taking the drug(s). Therefore they cannot make a choice about whether to use the drug before consumption. We call for a debate about whether it is ethical to prescribe drugs to patients without providing mortality statistics that is associated with any drug.  Patients should have a statutory right to receive information about the mortality statistics of medicines along with their prescription. Doctors should have a legal obligation to provide such information to patients. Such a policy will save healthcare budgets and many thousands of British people's lives every year because many people may choose to live without being a victim of the adverse drug reactions of medicines.",
