        "additional_details": "The e-petitions site is already cluttered with many petitions stating opposition to the aims of other petitions rather than making any policy suggestion. This creates an incoherence which damages the effectiveness of the site.\r\n\r\nA option to 'sign in opposition' to any petition should therefore be introduced. Where consideration for parliamentary debate is currently triggered by positive signatures, it should instead be contingent on the difference: supporting signatures minus those in opposition.\r\n\r\nThis will tidy-up, streamline, and enhance the utility of the site and the sensibility of debates which may stem from it.",
