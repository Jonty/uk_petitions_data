        "additional_details": "For years now Waste 4 Fuel have blighted neighbours illegally hoarding thousands of tons of waste that spontaneously combusts threatening the lives of those living nearby.\r\nThe 20,000 ton pile of waste towers over neighbouring houses threatening avalanches, denying quality of life, decreasing house values and plaguing the area with toxic fumes, vermin and filth. Wasye 4 Fuel were ordered by the high court to clear all waste from the site a year ago and still have not. Furthermore a recent court case has quashed the last ruling and so Waste 4 Fuel are now free to keep hoarding their mountain of waste whilst deceiving their customers who think their waste is being responsibly recycled.\r\nPlease clear and close the Waste 4 Fuel site in Oprington, Bromley.",
