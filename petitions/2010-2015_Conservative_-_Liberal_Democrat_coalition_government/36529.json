        "additional_details": "I don't think all forms of harrassment should be considered illegal. Some are done for very good reasons and have good intentions.\r\nAlthough I don't think what I did was harrassment it was treated like that. I was contacting someone who did not want to reconcile her friendship with me, but this was because Bible law says you have to forgive others. If she does not, how can she call herself a Christian? She could also be liable for Armageddon destruction. I was just trying to warn her this but it was treated as harrassment and the Police have treatened to arrest me if I persist. Thus my reason for petition. Her life depends on heeding my good advice.\r\nCompanies are allowed to harass their customers for outstanding payments. This likewise is an outstanding payment, of forgiveness. ",
