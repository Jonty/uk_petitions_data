        "additional_details": "\"Kinship Carers\" struggle to receive recognition by Local Authorities as 'Foster Carers' and as such receive very little or no financial assistance from them.Foster carers receive a sizeable sum on a weekly basis for 'caring' for \"someone else's children\". EXACTLY what Kinship carers do - but the fact remains that we are penalised & all because we are related! \"Kin\".\r\nFoster care is a 24/7 job.Kinship care=24/7 job. Exactly the same, only in most cases is harder as there is emotional involvement & added stress & pressure because of it. Local Authorities \"expect\" Kinship carers to 'get on with it' and fail to help, support, train or offer any sort of assistance.A change needs to occur to give Kinship carers equality with external Foster carers and the discrimination we face needs to be eradicated. A Government ruling disallowing Social Services to Police their own financing of this matter, needs to be enforced.\r\nPlease sign if you agree!\r\n\r\n",
