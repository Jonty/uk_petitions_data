        "additional_details": "One only needs to glance at motorists as they pass you to notice that there is a fair proportion of them breaking the law by operating a hand held mobile phone or by smoking - both of which mean they are not in complete control of their vehicle. Any death or serious accident caused by these drivers who have no regard for other people is criminal. I call upon the government to enforce the law. Clearly the police do not have the manpower to cope with the situation so I call upon Central Government to make Local Govt' responsible for apprehending those who violate the law.",
