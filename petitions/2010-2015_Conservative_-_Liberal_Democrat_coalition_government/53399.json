        "additional_details": "Ban the sale of all fur products in the UK and European Union. This week the Guardian runs an article entitled \u2018Fur is Back\u2019. We have banned fur farming on ethical grounds in the UK so why do we still allow businesses to sell it? The clear evidence that fur farms are universally cruel is widely accessible across the internet. Furthermore in China and other SE Asian countries where there are little or no anti-cruelty laws animals are still skinned alive. Much of this fur actually comes from dogs and cats.\r\nWe have no way of regulating or controlling this industry - the overwhelming probability is that any fur product for sale in the UK right now has come from an animal that has suffered great cruelty. If we can\u2019t do this without the permission of the European Union then on behalf of the people of the UK put pressure on the EU to ban the sale of fur products across the whole of Europe.",
