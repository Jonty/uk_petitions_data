        "additional_details": "As I approach 40 it's depressing to realise how much less is permitted in Britain now than when I was a kid, often because someone whinged about something and said \"Oooh, it shouldn't be allowed, there ought to be a law against that sort of thing\" and the government then passed one. Ban this, ban that, ban the other - in a country of more than 60 million people almost nothing will be met with universal approval, and if it continues to restrict things because some people don't like them Britain will become a mean, unpleasant land.\r\n\r\nPeople must accept that life is not a bed of roses and that it's simple not possible or desirable to ban everything that someone somewhere dislikes. The law must revert to the necessary functions of preventing harm and restoring justice rather than restricting people's liberty for the sake of keeping someone else happy. Bans must be banned.\r\n\r\nThe nature of this petition is that it is inter-departmental. It is NOT a joke petition.",
