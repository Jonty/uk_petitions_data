This works out I get paid 41p an hour. This is my \"job\". Why when my husband died last year & I claimed bereavement benefit my carers allowance was taken away from me for the year? If I had any other job & earned ANY amount of money the benefit would've been paid regardless.\r\n I want the government to recognise carers allowance is a pittance but is still our wage & we should granted the same benefit as everybody else.",
