Currently you can not watch your own team live on TV unless it's one of a handful allowed to be shown on SKY or ESPN.\r\n\r\nI feel it's unjust that we're not allowed to watch our childhood teams as according to a \"media blackout\" we should be supporting our local teams... This is a move to show all sports no matter what sport or team live. It's wrong we can log onto the internet and watch it in Greek yet I can't watch my team when I live 15 minutes away from the stadium. If we want to support our teams/players let us do so, LIVE!",
