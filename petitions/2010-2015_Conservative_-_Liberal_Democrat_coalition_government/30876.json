These tasks should be done by highly trained officers, not handed over to private companies who will make a profit from fighting crime. We therefore call on Parliament to debate this matter urgently and to bring forward a new bill to ban the privatisation of core police services.\r\n\r\nSimon Burgess, Helena Dollimore, Deborah Gardiner, Karen Landles, Martin Phillips",
