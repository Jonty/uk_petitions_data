        "additional_details": "\r\nMany local youth schemes which were previously run in deprived areas have since been disbanded or are underfunded and I believe that this may be a contributory factor in causing many young people to feel alienated in their communities. The responsibility for young offenders eventually falls to local youth schemes and charities which help youths who have resorted to crime. Such programs are invaluable in order that these young people feel that they are indeed wanted in society. It would appear that these vital institutions are already underfunded and by further slashing there cash-flow we will render them incapable of providing an effective service. The government should increase funding given to these youth organisations not decrease the amount. It has been shown that in areas where these institutions are financially secure, that it can decrease re-offending numbers for young people and reduce the numbers of youths resorting to crime initially. We can't abandon those who need us.\r\n",
