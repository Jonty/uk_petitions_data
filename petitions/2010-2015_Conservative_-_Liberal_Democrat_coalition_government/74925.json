        "additional_details": "I want the government to abolish hospital car parking charges as I believe that patients or people visiting patients in hospitals should not have to pay to park. Not only this, but the hospital parking charges are ridiculously high, with a fair amount of hospitals averaging at charging \u00a33 for 1 hour. This needs to be stopped and the government should look at Scotland and how they don't charge. ",
