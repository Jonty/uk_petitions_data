        "additional_details": "Before his child was born, a father only earned enough money each month to pay his mortgage and household bills, with a bit left for food and petrol. Then his relationship ends, his child is born, and his ex purposely makes it unreasonably expensive for him to have contact with his child, but does not involve the csa to start with. The father struggles to survive, but manages to see his child, and to give his ex anything that was left in his bank account at the end of the month, which his ex complains is not enough. Then the father is laid off, and goes on benefits, so he can no longer give his ex money on top of what it costs to see his child, so she involves the csa, and is shocked to only get \u00a35 a week. However, the fact that the father had nothing left in his bank account when he did work, and that the csa takes 15% of his wages regardless of bills if he does work, makes it impossible for him to get another job. TAKE ALL THE FATHERS CIRCUMSTANCES INTO ACCOUNT.",
