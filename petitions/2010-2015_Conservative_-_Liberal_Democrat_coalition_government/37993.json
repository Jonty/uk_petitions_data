        "additional_details": "The Border Agency's recent decision to withdraw London Metropolitan University's ability to sponsor students from outside the EU has led to potentially thousands of legal foreign students, who bring a lot of funding to UK, facing the threat of deportation.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the withdrawal of the licence should not apply retrospectively, allowing all current students to complete their courses, and that the Border Agency's actions should be targeted only at those proven to be abusing the system.\r\n\r\nFailure to do so will affect the confidence of foreign students in the UK's higher education system, leading them to take their fees to other countries.",
