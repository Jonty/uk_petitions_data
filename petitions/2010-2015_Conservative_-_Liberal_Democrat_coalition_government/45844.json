Is this right that the next generation is forced to suffer as a result?\r\n\r\n *I propose making the C.R.B checks for non sexual and similar offences remain 5 years on any records anywhere ( just for police and other agencies)\r\n\r\n* Any offences commited before 21 yrs unless of a sexual or attack on vunerable persons should not be shown.\r\n\r\nSome people can be sucked in the wrong crowd, Children living in poor conditions contributing to acting out in a criminal way.\r\n\r\n",
