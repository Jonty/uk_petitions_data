It should be capped to no more than \u00a380000 per year to pay for staff etc.\r\n\r\nMPs should not be able to claim for food as all workers throughout the country pay for their own food throughout the day they work.\r\nTravelling expenses should be the same as workers 40p per mile, this should be documented ie reason for visit, to and from and the distance. Air flights to places MPs should get basic air travel if they wish to up grade it should be paid by themselves.\r\nMPs should only have staff that are needed ie 1 admin and 1 Personal assistant and their wages should be what an average person doing the same job.
