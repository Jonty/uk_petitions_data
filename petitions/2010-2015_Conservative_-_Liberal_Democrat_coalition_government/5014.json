        "additional_details": "For far too long, individuals and families have been burdened with unrealistic and extortionate prices for car insurance. There is no valid justification for such high prices and what is more worrying, is that insurance companies do not need to lower prices as it is legally necessary to have insurance before you can drive.\r\n\r\nI propose to make car insurance optional, eliminating any unfair pricing of insurance, increasing competition within the insurance industry and ultimately lowering the prices of optional car insurance policy prices, which will prove beneficial for everyone.",
