We need an anthem that can unite all English men and women, unite a nation - singing for hope, glory, and England.\r\n\r\n\"Land of Hope and Glory, Mother of the Free,\r\nHow shall we extol thee, who are born of thee?\r\nWider still and wider shall thy bounds be set;\r\nGod, who made thee mighty, make thee mightier yet,\r\nGod, who made thee mighty, make thee mightier yet.\"",
