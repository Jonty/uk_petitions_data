        "additional_details": "There is a growing number of violent crimes happening in the UK. Only recently we have heard on the news about innocent teenagers having their heads stamped on, people being beaten,stabbed and robbed in their own homes and children being abducted to name but a few. Knife crime is now a major issue on our streets and gang violence is blighting city life for many people. We need to show violent offenders that this type of crime is the worst and that it is taken extremely seriously. We need to make the streets of Britain safe again and we need to come down very, very hard on violent offenders. No more soft sentencing and lack of deterrent for these thugs. Please sign this petition for everyone's benefit and safety. Thank you.",
