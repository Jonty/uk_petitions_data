I think you should bring back the death penalty as it would put fear back in to society. This would stop people carry such weapons as the consequences are not bad enough. An eye for a an eye was the saying. Now people are not feared to do time in prison as its a holiday. 3 meals a day. Get to learn a excellant trade while at her majesty's pleasure. And it costs me and you and all the others who pay tax just to keep them there with the life of luxury they live. All this just for failing to comply with the law. How is this justice? Bread and water worked century's ago? human right's should have no say in this matter as when you have commited a crime you have your human right's stripped from you. Is it me or am i missing something here? ",
