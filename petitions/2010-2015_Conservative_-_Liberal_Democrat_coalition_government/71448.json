        "additional_details": "Most dementia and Alzheimers disease patients are self funding. Care costs are being met from the patient's savings. Shares have to be sold regularly to meet costs. This generates a capital gains tax liability. Therefore selling shares not just for care but for paying CGT. All affected patients should be granted amnesty from CGT and first degree relatives paying for care should be allowed tax releif on their payments. This instead of payment to GPs who are already well funded.",
