        "additional_details": "I feel that our country has got to a stage were it is too expensive to go to university. It is no longer an opportunity to develop and prosper but it has become something that can hinder your future and leave you in tens of thousands of pounds worth of debt.\r\nI believe that the government should cap the fees once more. Also, they must change the student loan system. Currently, before we have even left university are loan is growing. There should be no interest on student loans. Otherwise, I can not see how they are any different to normal loans.",
