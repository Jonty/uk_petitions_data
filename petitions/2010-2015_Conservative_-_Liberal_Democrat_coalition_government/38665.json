        "additional_details": "On every occasion \u201cGames Makers\u201d were mentioned in the stadia, in the many speeches, and just out and about, there was massive support and appreciation from the public for what they as individuals, and together as one of the largest groups of volunteers ever assembled, had contributed to the splendid festival of sport during the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.\r\nThe \u201cGames Makers\u201d were generally ordinary people who just wanted to make a difference .. and they did, brilliantly. Whilst they are sure to go away with memories and mementos, it is believed that the friendliness,   helpfulness and other skills that they exhibited should be recorded in some lasting way.\r\nWe the undersigned call on the Government to take the necessary action to implement a one off award  \u201dLondon Games Maker (LGM)\u201d with an appropriate medal, so that all those \u201cGames Maker\u201d volunteers can present themselves with a formal, lasting and visible thank you.\r\n",
