        "additional_details": "Planning apllication reference number- 0111/F\r\n\r\nPlanning permission has been put forward to build an ' anaerobic digestion plant' in Sion Mills. This is basically a waste treatment plant. However not all residents of sion mills were given sufficient time to have their say on this issue. The building of any treatment plant can have serious consequences for the areas in which they are built; there is a possibility of pollutants from noise, air,sound,water and ground.\r\n\r\nIn a time when the government claims that the public are no longer interested in the governing of this country, show them that you do care about how things are done by taking action to delay the deadline for closing of public debate on the issue of the plant.\r\n\r\nDelaying will allow the people of Sion Mills and the Strabane area to have an open, informed and public debate about the proposal and how it will affect them and their future.",
