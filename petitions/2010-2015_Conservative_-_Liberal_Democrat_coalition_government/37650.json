        "additional_details": "Countless animals which have been bred in terrible conditions, for profit mostly, are being sold online via online free ad sites. I believe that this is not helping the problems in society with dog behaviour in particular, but in wider terms the issues around animal welfare. I am in favour of the Government making regulations around the sale of puppies and kittens, as well as exotic and other animals impossible on these online sites, as it is not helping the rescue centres around the UK. Please sign this petition if you want to see animals rehomed in a way where their health and welfare can be ensured.",
