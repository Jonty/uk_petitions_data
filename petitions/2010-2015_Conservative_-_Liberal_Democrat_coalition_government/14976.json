        "additional_details": "It not only that a high speed railway (HS2) connecting London to Birmingham would save journey time by about 20 minutes but infrastructures need renewing occasionally to incorporate the latest technology and to ensure it is fit for purpose decades into the future. Sometimes it is better to construct a completely new railway connection than doing it patchwork. Such ambitious pioneering forward looking attitude are the ones needed to incorporate future inventions and developing them. The envisaged cost of the railway line will be around \u00a332bn but considering the possible usage of over hundreds of years, it will be money well spent and would help to stimulate British economy and not only when the HS2 project are being constructed. Possibilities of HS2 are countless, like developing new IT systems, machines, signalling systems, improving capacity of UK's railway networks, future HS connections like towards the NE and Scotland, etc.",
