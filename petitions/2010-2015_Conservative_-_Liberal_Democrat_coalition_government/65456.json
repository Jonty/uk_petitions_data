Currently as it stands some individuals get an extra 8 days off whilst others get none and have to use their allocated annual leave to take time off .  This practice is unfair and certainly outside the boundaries of equal opportunities at work.  What is the point of bank holidays if you never get any?  The government should enforce a mandatory that every individual who goes out to work benefits from the bank holiday system and not face a disadvantage depending on who their employer is.",
