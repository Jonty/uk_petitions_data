        "additional_details": "I believe that after the Olympics is over the accommodation that was used for the Olympians and Para-Olympians should be used for the accommodation of the members of parliament as a second home close to their place of work. This would mean that they could have homes to move into once they are out of parliament and that they don't claim ridiculous expenses on second homes as everything they would need is provided for them. The Olympic village is in London so there would be good transport for them to get to the houses of parliament; there are also places to get food, which could be supplied to them for free so expenses aren't claimed on food items (if they want to go out to restaurants then that is their choice so they cannot claim expenses) and finally this opens up housing in London as MPs aren't trying to buy houses close to their place of work.",
