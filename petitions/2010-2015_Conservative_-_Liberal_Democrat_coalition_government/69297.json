It is believed that Luke had been involved in an incident, followed by a barbaric and inhumane beating by multiple Spanish police offices. Photographic evidence has been provided by shocked on-lookers in sheer disbelief at this heinous and preventable act of Police brutality.  We aim to make a formal and justifiable complaint against the Spanish Police and ORDER an Independent enquiry to establish the facts of the case in view of \"JUSTICE FOR LUKE\"    Please support us by signing our petition!!",
