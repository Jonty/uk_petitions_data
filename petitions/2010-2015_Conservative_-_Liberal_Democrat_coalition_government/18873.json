In any other profession, anyone who consistently failed to perform for this length of time, would be fired. If his mandate has been changed then it is the public's right to be told under government transparency. As we are unaware of any change to his mandate, we petition the government to replace Mervyn King (and put the MPC on notice) with someone who will do the job.",
