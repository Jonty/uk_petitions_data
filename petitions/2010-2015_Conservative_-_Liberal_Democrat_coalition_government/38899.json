Extra new flats will be built on the site to be sold to fund the proposal.  This will destroy the existing vibrant community & affect every user of the beautiful Brockwell Park.\r\n\r\n*CG is a mix of families, elderly, social tenants & respected professionals, complete with edible gardens and a regular newsletter. If demolished tenants will be relocated & leaseholders evicted under Compulsory Purchase Orders, thus likely pushed off the property ladder.\r\n*More flats = increase in crime. CG has one of the lowest crime rates in the borough.\r\n*New build will affect the views within Brockwell Park.\r\n*CG is a successful design by architect Ted Hollamby \"responsive to topraphy & local conditions\" - invisible under trees, staggered building heights & green areas - creating a highly livable, 'village'-like community in urban London.",
