        "additional_details": "The ethnic Kurdish peoples live mostly within three nations today: northern Iraq, northwestern Iran, and southern Turkey. The Kurds were one of the only ethnic groups formerly under the control of the Ottoman Empire that did not manage to eke out a nation for themselves after World War I when the empire collapsed.\r\n\r\nIn Iraq they were violently repressed and persecuted under Saddam Hussein's regime for years, but since the first Iraq War of 1990 and the American enforced no-fly zones, they have thrived in quasi-independence.\r\n\r\nIn Iran they are a persecuted minority. Some Iranian Kurds have formed militias which have engaged in guerrilla actions against the Iranian government.\r\n\r\nIn Turkey they are a persecuted minority who have waged a violent struggle for independence for decades.\r\n\r\nThe action I want the government to take? To not create, but give back their rightful Independance.",
