        "additional_details": "There is nothing more dangerous in the water than a sharp propeller spinning at a huge number of revolutions as it comes into contact with human or other flesh in the water.  It is a simple matter to install a propeller guard cage to prevent this contact happening.  It is vital, however, that the legislation includes confiscation and destruction, without appeal, when boats are found not to have a guard fitted when it is on the water. ",
