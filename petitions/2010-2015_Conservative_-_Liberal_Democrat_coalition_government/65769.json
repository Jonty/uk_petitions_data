This category of young people are most vulnerable of becoming homeless due to not having family support that is sometimes needed, if they become unemployed or whilst they are in full time education.\r\nThey are scrapping the access to learning fun this year, which has been a helping hand to such students in the past and also some young people 16-18 are unable to receive job seekers allowance.",
