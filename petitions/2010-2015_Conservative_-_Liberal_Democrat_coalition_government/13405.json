        "additional_details": "The reason for this petition is that by evicting some of the poorest people in society from their homes is not going to solve anything. What this will do is create homeless people and families who not only have nothing but who are also angry at society.\r\n\r\nI am not saying that these people should not be punished but I believe that the punishment should try and prevent further riots, not make the situation worse.\r\n\r\nThis may not be the easy or popular option but issues raised by these riots are not simple. We have to understand that society is made up of individuals but as a society we are stronger when work together. The people involved in the riots should be shown that they are part of a society which includes them and not one that excludes them.   ",
