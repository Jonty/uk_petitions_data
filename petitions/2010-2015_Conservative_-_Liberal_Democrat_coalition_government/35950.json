        "additional_details": "Due to the continued Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip, the situation is growing worse by the day. With malnutrition on the rise and even depression being reported in children, the Israeli government continue to deny the Palestinian people of Gaza the most basic of Human Rights. The situation has become even more dire since the Israeli bombardment of Gaza in late 2008-2009. Save the Children, in June 2012, noted: \u201cInnocent children are living in inhumane conditions after five years under a blockade. They are now forced to drink dirty and dangerous water that will make them weak and sick. Diarrhoea which is easily treated here in the UK can be a killer in these conditions. Gaza children are living in prison-like conditions, trapped and unable to dream of a better future. We must end the blockade...\" Spending 2 minutes of your time in signing this petition could make a huge difference in the lives of the people of Gaza. Please make our voice be heard.\u00a0",
