        "additional_details": "I want the government to take action to ensure that all GP's have to immediately refer all those diagnosed with MS to a MS Consultant & MS Clinic / Therapy Centre.\r\nI was diagnosed with MS 30th Oct 2008 (nearly 3yrs ago)& since then have not had any sign posting to anywhere by my GP, although I have visited him every 3months & he has been made well aware of how the condition has & is affecting me & the quality of my life.  By chance I went to see another doctor 2 wks ago & he immediately referred me to an MS Consultant at the Royal Derby Hospital. Please sign this petition so others diagnosed with MS will get the support they need & deserve as a right & a lot more quickly than me",
