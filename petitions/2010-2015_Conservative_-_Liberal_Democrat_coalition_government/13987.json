        "additional_details": "\r\nDespite the state of our economy essential services companies (gas, electricity, water) continue to report huge profits yet are set to increase prices on average 26% in 2011.  Given the accepted volatility of prices now is the time for the government to examine the success, or not, of the decision to privatise these industries. There is a need to question how these industries can best serve the many millions of households who now realise that these Companies are putting the needs of shareholders above that of their customers.\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t need a competitive environment for essential services, it is the need to make massive profits and please the shareholder that drives the need for competition.\r\n\r\n2011 figures: Price increase - energy 26%, water 4.6%. 2.49 million people out of work. 2.5% average salary increase. Average annual household income \u00a3 30,000.00. I in 5 households live in fuel poverty.\r\n",
