We therefore, propose that the Government overturn the decision of the Minister of State for Trade in exempting BOEN from being named under the disclosure requirements under Section 27(9) of the Companies Act 1976 , because; \u201cit was considered undesirable that the disclosure requirements should apply to certain categories of shareholders\u201d.
