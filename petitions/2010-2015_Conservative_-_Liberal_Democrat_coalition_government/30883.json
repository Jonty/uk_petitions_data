        "additional_details": "HMG should prioritise adequate resources (like funding, human resources, training, supervision, new procedures, technology, etc) to control the important function of controlling immigration (which affect UK\u2019s demographics forever).  Border Force made separate from UKBA is cosmetic, unless HMG ensures retrospective correction of blunders - like frequent unauthorised suspensions & downgrading of border checking on Eurostar passengers & migrants with student visas, as well as passports, fingerprints, etc. Over 500,000 Eurostar passengers are not checked against index of suspected terrorists & those with adverse immigration histories. The agency had been working through a backlog of 450,000 asylum seekers claims since 2006. Out of 403,000 processed claims so far, just 38,000 (9%) have left UK. Due to such backlogs, 160,000 (40%) asylum seekers were GIVEN AMNESTY to stay (with indefinite leave to remain in UK) & 74,500 untraceable. Another 129,000 claims have been recorded as \"errors\u201d.",
