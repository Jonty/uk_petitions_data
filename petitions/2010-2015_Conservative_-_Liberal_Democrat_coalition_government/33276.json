Despite being told how Maria hadn't eaten for days, was struggling to walk and was nearly completely blind, Kirklees Council took 24 days to visit her address, by which time it was too late.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.\r\n\r\nKirklees currently allow themselves 28 days to act on information. Please sign this petition to reduce this to a more acceptable 21 days. By doing so we can prevent tragedies like Maria's from ever occurring again.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
