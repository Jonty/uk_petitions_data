I think that anywhere where development is suggested, a petition or vote should go out before hand. Maybe starting with UK development with trial of 12 months?\r\n\r\nI agree a little with the current Plans for Grapes Hill however why does another lane need to be created? Cannot the just make one side of each lane for buses and bikes and increase their hours?http://www.norfolkchamber.co.uk/news/policy-news/grapes-hill-start-heralds-norwich-city-centre-changes.\r\n\r\nThere are also a lot of single buses during this disruption and not enough Double Deckers in use so they are often full.\r\n\r\nSEE: http://www.change.org/petitions/members-of-the-elk-rapids-village-council-consider-all-redevelopment-options-slow-down-and-involve-the-public\r\nIf you are going to reject or close this, at least please provide a good reason.",
