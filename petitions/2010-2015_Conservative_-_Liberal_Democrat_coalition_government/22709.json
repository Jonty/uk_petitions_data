        "additional_details": "We would like to see a reduction in fuel VAT and duty to pre-2007 prices, taking the value of a litre to less than \u00a31.\r\n\r\nIn making this adjustment, though the government would have a reduction in direct revenues, the public would take more trips and UK based holidays, transport companies and businesses would create journeys for meetings and distribution.\r\n\r\nThis would provide increased footfall in petrol stations due to more trips and thus extra spending on non-essential items.  Members of public on trips or holidays would have more money in their pocket to spend on accomodation, and other extras.",
