        "additional_details": "Thousands of expats in Greece are being penalised for their houses being illegally built by Greek builders, together with illegal contracts being created at the\r\noutset, by Greek Notaries.\r\nExpats are unable to sell their houses because legislation now decrees that although the contract was acceptable in 2006 for example, it is not now in 2014 and new contracts are having to be created before houses can be sold.  These new contracts, dependent upon the size of the house and the plot are costing the expat up to and in some cases above 3,000 euros.\r\nWe need the Government to investigate and force  the Greek government to reimburse the expats for something they have had no control over since the crash of 2008.",
