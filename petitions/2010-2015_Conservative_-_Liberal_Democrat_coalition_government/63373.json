        "additional_details": "Today we had a case where a government minister was described as needing to pay back FORTY THOUSAND POUNDS of taxpayer funded expenses after an investigation by the Independent Commissioner charged with ensuring the probity of the MPs expenses scheme.  After consideration of the position by the government ministers friends and colleagues in the House of Commons the amount to be repaid was reduced to less than SIX THOUSAND POUNDS.  This has obviously been a case where MPs have conspired to defraud the taxpayer and MUST be fully investigated by the Serious Fraud Office to re-establish  bounds of probitive behaviour being undermined by MPs who so obviously consider themselves and their friends and colleagues to be outwith the laws of this land",
