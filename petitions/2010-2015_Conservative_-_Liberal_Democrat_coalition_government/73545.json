        "additional_details": "I have recently had to have my four year old cat and much loved pet put to sleep after he was shot 3 times with an air rifle, one of the pellets hit his spinal cord. This is my 3rd cat that has been shot with an air rifle. His mum was shot 4 years ago and one of the pellets meant that she lost a kidney. And 2 years prior to that my cat, who is no longer with us, was also shot. This has caused us as a family a great deal of heartache as these animals are our pets and members of our families. Goggling the same subject and its quite shocking how common the shooting of cats with air rifles is becoming. Action needs taking to ensure that it is harder for people to get hold of these firearms and that the people using them are doing so for the purposes intended.",
