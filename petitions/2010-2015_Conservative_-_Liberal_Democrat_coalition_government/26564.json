That upon re-examination of evidence that suggests the implants have no impact upon women's health, they consider numerous accounts to the contrary by women who have the implant and by other countries governments that have fronted the cost for these implants to be taken out. That they accept that these implants are faulty and a danger to women's health, and should be removed as soon as possible. ",
