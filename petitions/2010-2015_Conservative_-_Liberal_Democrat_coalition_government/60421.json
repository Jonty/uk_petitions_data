This should be stopped as it is wrong and regardless of religion background the Birth, Registry and Death Office should have the power to stop and give details of people who are already married and make it easily accessible to the public to avoid heart break. The Government should clamp down on people especially men who refuse to do a registry despite doing a religion ceremony.\r\n\r\nThis should be compulsory as this allows a person to walk away with dignity.
