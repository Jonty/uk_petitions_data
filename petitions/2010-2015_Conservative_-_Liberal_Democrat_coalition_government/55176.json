        "additional_details": "Recently Take a Break Magazine (issue dated 26/09/2013) posted a misleading, scare mongering and damaging headline stating \"BREAST FEEDING KILLED MY BABY\".\r\nThe headline was misleading because sadly the baby died from a genetic disorder called Galactosaemia, which unless diagnosed, whether fed formula or breast will have the same sad outcome.\r\nThe headline is damaging to breast feeding which is already an ever dwindling community, which the government, NHS and elective bodies are struggling to promote.\r\nWe believe Take a Break Magazine need to print a public apology explaining the condition and all the benefits etc of breast feeding to it's readers.\r\n\r\n",
