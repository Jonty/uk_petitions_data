        "additional_details": "We believe that benefits from the state where currently cash is given should be replaced with vouchers or pre paid cards which prevents money being used for inessential items. With a similar idea in mind to milk tokens, we believe that benefits which are there to help people's welfare should only be spent on items that will do this, perhaps with only a small allowance each month for \"luxury items\" such as alcohol or cigarettes. If vouchers also had an expiry date, for example 12 months to allow people to save for special occasions, we believe that this would save the  taxpayer money in the long run, whilst making the public feel better that their money was not being spent on items that are not linked with general welfare.",
