        "additional_details": "Mr Cameron is planning to spend \u00a350 million  to commemorate the start of WW!. In this day and age of welfare and other government spending cuts I feel this is immoral use of public money. We have rememberance sunday every year and do not need to celebrate the start of any war, let alone one that started one hundred years ago. Will we have to fork out another \u00a350 million to celebrate the end of WW1 in another 4 years time ? Stop this useless waste of public money and please sign this petition.",
