        "additional_details": "We, the Young Campaigners, want education to change for autistic children. Children with autism should be involved in decisions which affect them and have the same opportunities no matter who they are or where they live. Teachers also need a better understanding of autism in order to provide the right support.\r\n\r\nTo do this we recommend the Government ensures:\r\n- that all teachers have effective autism awareness training.\r\n- school councils are accessible to students with autism.\r\n- all students with a special educational need have a personalised plan.\r\n- the local offer proposed in the Green Paper should lay out the support available for children with autism.\r\n",
