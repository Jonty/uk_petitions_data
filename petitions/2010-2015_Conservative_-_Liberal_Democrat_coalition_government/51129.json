        "additional_details": "The government is proposing four key changes to the Freedom of Information Act:\r\n\r\n    Authorities can currently refuse FOI requests if the estimated cost of finding and extracting the information exceeds certain limits. The government wants to allow them to also count the time they spend considering a request.\r\n\r\n    Lowering the cost limits themselves (These are currently \u00a3600 for government departments and \u00a3450 for other authorities).\r\n\r\n    Charges could be made for appealing to the Information Rights Tribunal.\r\n\r\n    Authorities would be allowed to refuse unrelated requests from the same individual or organisation if their combined effect is too time consuming. T\r\n\r\nThree of their core proposals would make it easier for authorities to refuse all Freedom of Information Act claims, while the fourth has already been dealt with by new guidelines from the Information Commissioner.\r\n\r\nPlease write to your MP today to ask them to take action",
