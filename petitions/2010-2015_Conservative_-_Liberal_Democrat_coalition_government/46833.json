        "additional_details": "It has been nearly 50 years since the UK officaly went metric with most thing being metric by law\r\nyet the road signs are still in Miles and yards.With even the USA moving to metric signs the UK is quickly becoming the only country not to have metric signs. Metric signs give more options on limits as well as being easier to work out distance and speed .\r\n\r\n In Australia all road signs where changed within a month with few problems. While the Irish example showed it can be done at little extra cost although it took a decade.\r\n\r\n With most people in the UK learning only the metric system at school making it harder for them to work out\r\nspeed and distances.Still people don't like it because the change was never explaned to them.\r\n\r\nIt is not an EU plot it just makes the UK look awkard and old fashioned It is time we don't sideline this issue and at least give it more publicity .
