        "additional_details": "Facebook is an unmoderated website that allows people to set up pages that promote illegal activities such as hate crimes, pedophilia and racism.\r\n\r\nOn Facebook you can set up a page or group dedicated to promoting violence towards specific races or religious groups, photos and personal information are posted along with requests that people are physically attacked or even murdered because of their skin colour, religion, sex, sexuality or political opinion.\r\n\r\nMany pages are also dedicated to spreading explicit photographs of children with links to underage profiles on Facebook with the focus on grooming these children for sexual activity.\r\n\r\nThough Facebook does have a process for removing these pages it is very rare that Facebook actually acts on this, content is not checked unless a post recieves over 100 complaints.\r\n\r\nWe propose that Facebook should be blocked in the UK to protect children and people from physical abuse.",
