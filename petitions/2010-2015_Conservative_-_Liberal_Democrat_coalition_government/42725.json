        "additional_details": "The proposed EU Data Regulation (EUDR) seeks to protect data held by organisations on each of us \u2013 our personal lifestyle, purchasing habits and financial details need to be treated with respect and security.\r\n\r\nBut at work we do not function as an individual, we are part of an organisation. Our purchasing habits do not satisfy our personal needs, they satisfy the organisation\u2019s needs. Our work email address belongs to the organisation, not to us.\r\n\r\nThe EUDR states that in the future you will not be able to store a prospective customer\u2019s name, contact details or online activity without their prior consent.\r\n\r\nIncluding business-to-business (B2B) data in the EUDR will severely limit the ability of UK companies to send direct mail, email and even telephone prospective B2B clients. This will damage the marketing of UK companies and their ability to sell.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we ask the government to ensure that business-to-business (B2B) data is removed from the EUDR.\r\n",
