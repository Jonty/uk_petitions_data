        "additional_details": "The capital raised by the FTT would support national deficit reduction.\r\nThis in turn would return confidence into bond markets as they can see solid returns will be possible, thus reduce interest rates.\r\nWith a stable bond market, the currency markets would become stable as the currency itself is stable, i.e. the US Dollar & Euro.\r\nNow having a stable deficit reduction plan & a more secure currency market, the investment/trading markets will stabilise as well, as they can see stability in the countries they are trading in.\r\nIn summary, the FTT is the Golden Arrow which would stabilise markets & support government deficit reduction plans. I also hope China will be a great supporter of the FTT as they need stability & strength in the US Dollar & not look too favourably at banks which try to escape it. The banks that do try to escape the FTT are their own worst enemy.",
