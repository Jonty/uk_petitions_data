We are based in Formby and David Wilson Homes have had a public exhibition informing us that they are going to build on our green belt land whether we like it or not.  The laws need to protect our green belt land for the future before we all end up living in a concrete world.  STOP BUILDING ON GREEN BELT LAND NOW or lose your countryside and heratige forever.  STOP IT OR LOSE IT FOREVER - HANDS OFF OUR GREEN BELT",
