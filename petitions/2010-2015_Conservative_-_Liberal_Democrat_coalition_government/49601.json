        "additional_details": "Their can be any number of campaigns to increase cycle safety and awareness, however, these just don't work. I believe the reason for this is because the driver has not been in that situation. People learn by experience.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a cycling test should be incorporated in the driving test, so people are aware of distances and dangers - stopping, overtaking etc.\r\n\r\nThe positives are:\r\n\r\nWill increase cycle and road safety\r\nCut down on deaths and injuries as a result\r\nIncrease the health of the nation, as more people will be introduced to the activity and as a result, some people will take up the activity\r\nThe test will be profit making, so will contribute to government revenue\r\nThe test will employee people - instructors, examiners, admin etc and so an industry will be created\r\nBike sales will increase as people take up the activity\r\n",
