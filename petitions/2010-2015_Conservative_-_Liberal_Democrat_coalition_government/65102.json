        "additional_details": "Stephen Sutton raised over \u00a33m for the Teenager Cancer Trust in under a week, being himself terminally ill. He alerted the world to the plight of teenage cancer sufferers and kept up his campaign with a smile. Despite being desperately ill he harnessed social media to draw over \u00a33 million in just one week, to support the vital work of the Teenage Cancer Trust. His social media campaign went viral and was taken up by national media within a few days. Stephen passed away at the age of 19 on 14 May 2014. Prime minister David Cameron took a personal interest in Stephen's campaign and we herewith petition the government to bestow an OBE upon this remarkable young man. There are precedents for bestowing this award posthumously. ",
