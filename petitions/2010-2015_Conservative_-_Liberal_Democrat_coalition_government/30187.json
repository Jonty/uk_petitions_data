        "additional_details": "Owing to a combination of factors, including climate change and unfettered population growth, water is going to become an increasingly scarce - and therefore costly - resource in the UK.\r\n\r\nWe are already seeing water prices rising to unaffordable levels. In the coming years we will all have to pay ever higher prices for access to fresh, clean water - one of the most basic human needs.\r\n\r\nIt is morally unacceptable, therefore, that in a future scenario of spiralling prices combined with restricted supplies, a small number of directors of private water utility companies will stand to make vast personal profits out of what is essentially a fundamental resource owned by the nation.\r\n\r\nTHIS MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN. THE UNDERSIGNED CALL FOR THE UK GOVERNMENT TO VIGOROUSLY DEBATE BRINGING THE WATER INDUSTRY BACK UNDER PUBLIC CONTROL.",
