As the government has announced that cybercrime costs the UK economy \u00a327 billion a year.\r\nTo try and prevent internet fraud and any other illegal activity on websites, the use of the UK internet domain (.co.uk) should be controlled through licensing legislation. With licensing legislation in place to host a .co.uk domain website, webhosts would be held responsible to ensure activities that occur on their site remain legal with the threat of having their license revoked.\r\nPlus the purpose of this is so that anyone who wishes to set up a website using the .co.uk domain need to make sure their site is safe to use. The same as a license pub owner needs to make sure they sell alcohol to those over the legal age and to ensure no illegal activity occurs within his/her pub to keep hold of their license to sell alcohol.
