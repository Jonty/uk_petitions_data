They make decisions and oppress it to the point where it gets banned (Google Ham and Bacon Subway Ban)\r\n\r\nIt's getting outrageous now. The coalition government make the laws, minorities do not. If you want to have something banned, it should be a diverse selection of the population with a majority who wins the debate.\r\n\r\nWe the people of Britain ask the Government to STOP all bans of food, and anything which is important to our daily lives, such as the freedom to do what we wish as long as it's law abiding.",
