        "additional_details": "The Scottish independence referendum was swayed by the promise of new powers given to Scotland. As many people who voted Yes believe, these powers will not be given. They were simply a lie to win over votes.\r\nIf these powers were not promised the outcome of the referendum may have been very different.\r\n As such, I request the referendum be repeated in the event that we are not awarded these new powers that we were promised.",
