        "additional_details": "I am 16 and have a profoundly deaf 10 year old sister who is unable to talk. Therefore it has occurred to me that in order to not only help her, but also the rest of society, sign language is needed to be taught in mainstream schools. This will end isolation throughout society and will enable my sister and others to be able to function in their day to day life. Even answering the door and going shopping will no longer be a nearly impossible task. Please sign this petition to help me have peace of mind for my sister and her future if I am ever not here to help her.",
