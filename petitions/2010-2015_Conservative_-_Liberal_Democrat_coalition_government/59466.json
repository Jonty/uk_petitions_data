        "additional_details": "We call for a new charge of Causing death by driving which carries a minimum 2 yr custodial sentence and a 10yr ban from driving with a compulsory re-test. Too many drivers who kill are charged with Careless Driving and given fines as low as \u00a335 and short driving bans. The current charging and sentencing regime is an insult to all those victims who are killed by reckless or incompetent drivers. We need to end the culture where causing death with a motor vehicle is excused as acceptable \"collateral damage\"  from the act of driving.",
