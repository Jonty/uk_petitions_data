        "additional_details": "With todays proposed Infrastructure Bill which would allow companies to drill for shale gas and build shale gas pipelines under privately owned homes without the permission of the land or home owner would violate the rights of the property owners.\r\n\r\nFurther the fracking companies will rake in the benefits and leave the owner of the properties/homes alone with all the risks. Insurance companies will charge top prices if a property is affected by fracking going on.\r\n\r\nThese companies are trying to push this infrastructure bill through to capitalise on it with the support of a government which was elected by exactly the people who will now be exploited if this bill goes ahead.\r\n\r\nI want this change in law removed from the bill so that no one has the right to access the land or exploit natural resources underneath a property or home without getting written permission of the home owner.\r\n",
