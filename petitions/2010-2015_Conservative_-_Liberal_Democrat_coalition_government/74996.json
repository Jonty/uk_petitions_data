        "additional_details": "The age limit to drive HGV/LGV has been reduced from 21 to 18 years of age.\r\nWith correct training and successfully passing the driving test, an 18/19 year old may drive a vehicle exceeding 30+ tonnes.\r\nIt is impossible for an 18 year old rider to pass a test to ride an unrestricted motorcycle.\r\n\r\nA 30 tonne HGV/LGV is considerably more dangerous than a motorcycle.\r\n\r\nThe laws do not apply to car drivers. A 17 year old could drive any car subject to being able to source insurance.\r\n\r\nIt is an unfair restrictioin to motorcycle riders.\r\n\r\nPlease revise this restriction.\r\nAt age 17, limit to 125cc for 12 months.\r\nAt 18 years of age, allow the rider to train and take a full unrestricted test. If a rider satisfies examination standards, allow them to ride with no restrictions. They will have proved themselves equally as much as a HGV/LGV driver.",
