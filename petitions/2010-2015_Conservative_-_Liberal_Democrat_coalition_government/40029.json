        "additional_details": "Children EGG allergy sufferers in the UK have been left without flu immunisation due to a national cull of a safe jab. Celvapan (Baxter)\r\n\r\nHealth officials adviseChildren should have flu injection.\r\n\r\nBut people with a severe egg allergy need a different type of drug to protect them, as the normal flu vaccine is cultured in eggs.\r\n\r\nThe reason that people with egg allergies can't get flu shots is because flu shots contain eggs -- and therefore egg proteins, which can cause Anaphylaxis, or anaphylactic shock, which is a catastrophic allergic reaction. Immediate medical treatment is essential - without it your circulation may fail and you could die.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 My brother was given the Celvapan (Baxter) to help him with protection from Flu as he sufferes with Egg Allergy and Asthma. This vaccine is no longer available. Putting him & thousands of others at RISK!\r\n\r\nBRING BACK THE EGG FREE FLU VACCINE AND HELP MY 4 YEAR OLD BROTHER AND THOUSANDS OF OTHER PEOPLE IN THE UK.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
