        "additional_details": "Premarin is the only human estrogen replacement drug that is derived from an animal (hormones beginning with the letter \"e\" are specific to equines, hormones beginning with the letter \"h\" are specific to humans).\r\n\r\nThe production of this drug relies on the use of urine collected from pregnant 'battery' mares, these poor creatures have every one of their basic instincts taken away from them, are kept in cramped conditions hooked up to a piece of equipment that collects their urine. They are given minimum access to water to ensure that their urine is stronger, and once the foal is born it is killed & the mare is inseminated again as soon as possible, to repeat the cycle, until she is too old or no longer of use then she is disposed of!\r\n\r\nThis practice is barbaric & inhumane, it needs to be stopped now! Please sign & share, help us to get this cruelty stopped. Thank you ",
