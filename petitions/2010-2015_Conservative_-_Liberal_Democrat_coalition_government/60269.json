        "additional_details": "UK Sport funding is elitist. It\u2019s no compromise rule perpetuates funding for sports inaccessible to the vast majority.\r\n\r\nIn 2012 37% of our medal winners were privately educated. The reason is UK Sport\u2019s funding. Even an ambitious state school can only offer a few of the 19 sports funded.\r\n\r\nThe sport that receives the most UK Sport money has 0.17% participation.\r\n\r\nHalf of the funded sports have 14-25 participation numbers so low (next generation of medallists) Sport England suppresses the data. The system is hugely-weighted against team and globally popular sports. Currently one team sport is funded, unsurprisingly it\u2019s popular in independent schools.\r\n\r\nUK Sport is not fit for purpose. It is anti-team and justifies itself on a self-fulfilling prophecy \u2018if you don\u2019t win medals, we won\u2019t fund you, so you won\u2019t win medals\u2019\r\n\r\nThe Government must reconstitute UK Sport, end this elitism and give a fairer platform to team sports.",
