        "additional_details": "Endorse a proposed  MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) that has UK charities as its beneficiaries - Calls4Charities.\r\nBy subscribing to Calls4Charities,mobile phone users can ensure that a minimum of 10% of their spend will be donated to a charity of their choice, with no extra cost to them or change in behaviour.\r\nIf 1m subscribers spent \u00a320pm over 12 months, they would quickly generate \u00a324m for UK charities - a fraction of the potential.\r\nCutbacks have eroded the UK charity sector. People still suffer from cancer, child abuse, drug abuse, homelessness, underfunding in sport & education\u2026 the list of deserving charities is endless.\r\nWe want government to:\r\n\u2022Endorse Calls4Charities as a Public Service (just as it did for the National Lottery).\r\n\u2022Bring this to the notice of our Prime Minister. We are led to believe by his aides that he would respond to its altruistic motives.\r\nWe have partners in place.We are ready to go.\r\nLet\u2019s talk. www.Calls4Charities.com\r\n\r\n",
