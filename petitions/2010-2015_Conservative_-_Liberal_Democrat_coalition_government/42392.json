All it requires to ensure it's continued support of the music and local arts is to be granted a late license.\r\n\r\nA successful application would create dozens of jobs within the local community and allow us to renovate a historic Victorian Building while providing a safe and unique venue for music and art in Manchester.\r\n\r\nIt has run for over 4 years with the help of volunteers & donations.\r\n\r\nWe want the council to recognise the importance of this unique piece of Manchester.\r\n\r\nWE NEED YOUR HELP!\r\n\r\nPlease sign this electronic petition to support our application and support live music and the arts in your community.
