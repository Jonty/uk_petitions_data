The body was exhumed and reburied at an undisclosed site.\r\n\r\nThese actions are inhumane and completely unacceptable, especially as this was a heritage site highly revered by Muslims, worldwide.\r\n\r\nA group named Jubhatul Nusra has been linked to the attack which has been identified as a terrorist organisation by the United States.\r\n\r\nThis is a direct attack on Islamic heritage with no benefit to the cause of any political stance currently taking place in Syria.\r\n\r\nThe Muslims of Great Britain collectively condemn these inhumane acts and urgently request your assistance to:\r\n1.\tCondemn these actions\r\n2.\tStop and prevent the perpetrators from further demolishing shrines and exhuming bodies of Muslim saints.\r\n\r\nWe urge the current political issues of Syria to be side lined in order to deal with this issue in a humanitarian manner, thus to preserve religious heritage sites.",
