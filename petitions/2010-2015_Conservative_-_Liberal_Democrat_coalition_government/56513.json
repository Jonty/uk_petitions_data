        "additional_details": "Don't get me wrong, the government funding for 15 hours of nursery is a brilliant idea, however I feel it is not fair that it is only available during school term times. As a nurse, my job expects me to be able to work every week throughout the year, including summer holidays, when hospital services still run I require my child to be in nursery for me to work, however without the government funding my daughters nursery bill will almost double within a month. I know I am not alone!\r\n\r\nWorking families need more support towards child care and having 15 hours funded a week every week throughout the year rather than term time only will make a positive contribution!",
