        "additional_details": "Under Section 21 of The Town Police Clauses Act 1847 a Local Authority may close certain streets in it's area if it believes because of an event (such as a parade or festival etc.) which is going to take place will cause the streets to be thronged or liable to be obstructed.  Fair enough and most Councils use these powers sensibly. But there is no consultation process with the residents and businesses in the affected streets. The Government should amend the legislation so that some form of consutation process must take place between The Council and persons who are likely to be affected by the closures. ",
