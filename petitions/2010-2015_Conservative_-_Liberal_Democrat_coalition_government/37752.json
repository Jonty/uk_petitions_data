In response to a Freedom of Information request, the BBC has admitted spending \u00a3332,780.47 of public money in legal costs alone to hide the contents of the report from the public.\r\n\r\nWe ask the Minister to commission a public enquiry into why this money has been spent in this way, and why the report has not been released.
