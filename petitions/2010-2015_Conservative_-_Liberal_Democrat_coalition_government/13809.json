Can one imagine the French or the US permitting their national fla being upside down through indifference and ignorance? The Japanese have it easy! Manufacturers of bunting are guilty and come the Queen's jubliee and Olympics, millions will celebrate\r\nUnder a wrong flag and many more will not know.\r\n\r\nCulprits should be forced to put up their flags correctly or face a fine and manufacturers likewise. Th epublication of upside down flags should be banned, even if in the hands of UK medal winners and spectators.",
