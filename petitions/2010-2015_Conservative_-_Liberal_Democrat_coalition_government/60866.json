        "additional_details": "We want the government to seriously reconsider proposals put forward in the 'Regulation of Childcare' changes.  The proposed changes do not safeguard children they leave them at greater risk.  This is due to reductions in ratios, dumbing down of qualifications and the ability for people to look after minors with no regulatory body to oversee the care provided, resources or safety of the property.  The lack of a regulatory body will reduce parents ability to complain and will increase insurance premiums for registered providers.",
