        "additional_details": "The science of cloning is still developing but now it is possible to clone mammals like sheep, cattle, etc. Although whole human beings should not be cloned as a general principle, HMG clear position on cloning whole humans should be discussed & kept under constant review. Should it be possible to clone a deceased child/person in exceptional circumstances (like after illness, accident or as a result of a vicious crime)? If so what are the circumstances? A clone is basically an identical twin with the same genetic makeup (hardware), albeit different degrees of experiences (software), thus behaviour. Genes does not code for multitude complex behaviours as they are learned from experience on interaction with one\u2019s genetic made-up. Genes (nature) interact with the prevailing circumstances and experiences (nurture). For example, if Einstein was cloned today he will have the benefit of computers unlike in the early 20th century.",
