The current vetting works on a very crude \u2018first-submitted by subject or title\u2019 basis, and not on the actual direction and substance of each particular e-petition. Compare my rejected e-petition with the previously accepted one: Community Force - Michael Christopher Walker. Compulsory for un-employed school leavers; minimum 3 years between 16 and 19 yrs; stationed in ex military bases to learn self-discipline (Edited). Introduce Compulsory Community Work Scheme for Young People \u2013 Clive Frost. 1 or 2 yr compulsory Community Work for all 18 to 25 yr olds; after secondary school or undergraduate university study and before beginning full time employment; not in military, but in social areas; bring together young people from different backgrounds to create more homogeneous, unified, caring and less self centred country (Edited).",
