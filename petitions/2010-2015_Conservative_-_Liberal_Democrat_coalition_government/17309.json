        "additional_details": "Pets at home are continually selling ill, mis-sexed and pregnant animals in their stores and I feel animal welfare is becoming an issue. They are also selling cages far to small for many small furries to live in, much below the RSPCA minimal cage size standards. Some pets are not well kept in stores and others who dont find homes may be euthanized. Please support this campain for these poor animals welfare and wellbeing.",
