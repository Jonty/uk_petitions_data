We think that as a multi-millionaire he simply doesn't appreciate how little money this is to live on, especially after bills. He recently claimed \u00a349 expenses for breakfast for one day.\r\n\r\nWe petition IDS to live on \u00a353 for a month, with account taken of average bills in a one bedroom flat, and the remainder given to him to live on.",
