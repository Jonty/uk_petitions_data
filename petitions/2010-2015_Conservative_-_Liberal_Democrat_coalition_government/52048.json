        "additional_details": "This petition is to change legal process to prevent police abuse of surveillance.\r\nFollowing claims made in the press that Police authorities abused unchecked surveillance powers in an attempt to smear innocent members of the Lawrance family I demand a change in the law to prevent this abuse from occuring again.\r\nI request that from this point forward any and all surveillance performed by the Police and security services shall be required to have written justification for the reason for the surveillance, quoting specifc grounds for suspicion of criminal activity, in writing, signed by the Senior Officer, subject to adhoc review by the IPCC. Further more that any intelligence garnered without this process or not meeting the requirements of 'reasonable grounds' to be considered firstly inadmissable in court and secondly to have been gathered in an unlwaful fashion requiring criminal prosection of the officers involved.",
