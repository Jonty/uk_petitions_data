        "additional_details": "This petition is to make the practice of religious slaughter of animals for food consumption illegal.\r\n\r\nMany people are simply unaware that it is possible to be served meat in a Restaurant/cafe or even a school canteen that was produced in this fashion and might be horrified as a result.\r\n\r\n'Normal' slaughterhouses use a practice where animals are stunned unconsious , i.e from the use of a bolt-gun or similar, before the animal is suspended and has its throat cut to drain it of its blood, etc whereupon it dies.\r\n\r\nReligious slaughter, on the other hand, uses the practice of slitting the terrified animals throat whilst it is fully conscious.\r\n\r\nI believe this is an inhumane and barbaric practice which should not be practiced in a so-called civilised country like ours.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and put a stop to animal suffering in the name of a religion.",
