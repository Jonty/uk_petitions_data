        "action": "The use of pesticides in the domestic environment should be banned.",
        "additional_details": "There should be a debate on the argument that the  sale and use of pesticides in the domestic environment should be banned.\r\n\r\nPesticides not only affect intended 'pests' but also wide ranges of other insects and have many other effects on our environment, which we do not even fully understand.\r\nFood supplies of larger animals are also being directly killed off with pesticides, causing starvation and poisoning of the predators themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is vital to understand the importance of insects at the core of the food web.  A ban on domestic pesticide use would not lead to a boom in garden pests, but instead to a boom in the predators of those pests such as birds in our trees, hedgehogs in our gardens and fish in our rivers.",
