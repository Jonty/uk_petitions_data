        "additional_details": "Petition to stop the UK Government borrowing money from private banks by issuing our own currency and thus eliminate interest rates which are bankrupting this country. Over night this country could be dept free. In the 1860,s President Lincoln advised Congress to pass a law authorizing the printing of full legal tender Treasury notes known as the Green back Doller and in 1963, President Kennedy signed a presidential document, called Executive Order 11110, which gave Kennedy, as President of the United States, legal clearance to create his own money to run the country, money that would belong to the people, an interest and debt-free money. He had printed United States Notes, completely ignoring the Federal Reserve Notes from the private banks of the Federal Reserve. Its so simple yet our government continues to borrow with the Tax payer paying the interest why ? Maybe they fear the same fate as Lincoln and Kennedy.\r\n",
