        "additional_details": "There is an increased number of \"scratcher tattooists\" coming into the public eye and it's a disturbing trend where people can now easily obtain tattoo equipment that has the potential to damage a persons skin beyond repair, cause infection and promote unhygienic practice.\r\n\r\nIt's time something was done to end this. What's making it worse is a sudden rise in Tattoo Schools, which offer full training in a handful of weeks.\r\n\r\nIn reality this job takes years to learn and perfect and it appears people are cashing in on a seemingly unregulated part of our industry.\r\n\r\nWe need stronger action taken against people who tattoo unregulated and we need these schools removing. If you want to create a training environment then a process needs to be created with proffesional, licensed, existing tattooists",
