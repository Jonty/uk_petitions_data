        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, believe that positive and constructive measures are needed in the wake of the riots in England this summer. In place of exaggerated sentencing, we ask that the government announce an amnesty for an agreed period for those who were involved in rioting and looting (with exceptions for offences of assault or arson). Those who during this period provide full disclosure of their offences will not face criminal charges or custodial sentences, but must be prepared to return all looted goods, and undertake a period of unpaid work, administered by community organisations, to help with reconstruction of destroyed shops and properties, or other duties required by affected businesses to compensate for their losses.\r\n\r\nProvision would be made to take account of childcare or employment commitments. We believe these measures would help to rebuild community relations and provide positive responsibilities for those involved in the rioting, helping them to reintegrate into society.",
