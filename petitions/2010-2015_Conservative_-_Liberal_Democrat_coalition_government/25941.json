        "additional_details": "This would facilitate tracing, recording breeds of dogs, identifying stray dogs, facilitate buying & selling, movement of dogs within the EU, as well as allowing certified rabid free dogs to travel within EU without the need of being quarantined. By registering online keepers of specified dogs, dogs and their owners are then identified & \u2018licenced\u2019. Some specified dog keepers may be banned (& recorded online) by courts to be the registered keeper of certain dogs for a specified period of time. Irresponsible dog owners do play a part in a dog\u2019s behaviour. Genetics, as well as the training/socialisation of a dog does play a part in determining whether a particular dog is dangerous or not. It is irresponsible to leave large dogs unsupervised with human babies. Dogs (as well as the owners) should be properly trained and excluded from potentially dangerous situations by their owners. ",
