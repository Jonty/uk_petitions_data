The weapon was returned to him after he had threatened to shoot me.An investigation is being carried out by Surrey police with the support of the IPCC.The laws on guns need to change.There is no specialist team to access weather or not a person is even capable of firing a gun. I would like to see a change in the fee and a full assessment on a person right to own guns. A full medical check and cross checks with any other agencies who may have had dealing with the applicant eg social services, doctors, other police constabularies.\r\nThere needs to be specialist to assess the capability of applicantt to use a shot gun. Ex army or military would be far superior in accessing the safety of guns. I would like to see these teams in every county .\r\nThese laws need to change and they need to be enforced meticulously every time.",
