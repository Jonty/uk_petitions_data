        "additional_details": "In light of the current on-going events in Syria, the Syrian ambassador and diplomats represent a brutal, murderous and unforgiving regime. Such representation is not welcome on British grounds.\r\nMany British Syrian families have been intimidated, threatened, arrested, tortured and brutally killed for speaking out against the government. To ensure such violations of human rights do not continue, expelling such representatives would be a step closer for the safety of British citizens and their families.\r\nLet us show support for the Syrians who are putting their lives at risk for freedom and expel the Syrian ambassador and diplomats from British soil.\r\n",
