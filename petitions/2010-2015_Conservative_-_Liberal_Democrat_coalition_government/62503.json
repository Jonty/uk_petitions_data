        "additional_details": "Functional Neurological disorder is an illness with a  variety of symptoms of apparent neurological origin but which current models struggle to explain psychologically or organically. Symptoms mimic conditions like MS, Parkinsons, strokes and brain tumours.\r\nMany people with this illness have had psychiatric   assessments which proves to show no mental illness is present or causing the symptoms. It is very common for patients to be left with this condition after a psychical illness, surgery or spinal injuries.  Patients are often thrown between psychiatrists and neurologists, both not knowing what to do for the patient or denying any care.\r\nThere are only three specialists in the world for this condition.\r\nPlease can the Government take action to fund towards this illness for research, so patients can no longer be denied any care, justice, and not left to their own devices to live with this gruelling and disabling condition.\r\n\r\n",
