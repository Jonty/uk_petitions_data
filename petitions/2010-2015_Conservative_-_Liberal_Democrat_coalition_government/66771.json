According to current rules any vehicle that we bought would be subject to VAT.\r\n\r\nThis is because only \u2018vehicles which have one or more stretchers ....together with permanent fittings to hold this stretcher in position (Ambulance) or motor vehicles that are capable of carrying up to 12 people, and have been designed or substantially and permanently adapted for the carriage of a person in a wheelchair or on a stretcher\u2019 qualify for zero rating.\r\n\r\nAirRescue 24 and other similar organisations use vehicles to get them to the scene of an accident or major emergency so that they can give assistance to seriously injured casualties. They do not necessarily have the space to carry a person on a stretcher.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to review the current rules in order to allow for zero rating on any vehicles that provide such a rescue service.",
