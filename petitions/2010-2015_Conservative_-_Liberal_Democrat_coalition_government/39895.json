        "additional_details": "i want a review of the management of paedophilia by looking at its classification/ definition to decideis it:  a)  a lifelong sexuality that cannot , by definition, be cured and hence needs lifelong management in a hospital instituion or PROVEN effective treatment. b) a psychiatric disorder and if so is it curative (by looking at international rehabilitation techniques /medical treatment and their effectiveness ie statistics on reoffenders) . c) an avoidable criminal offence and if so ;due to it's heinous nature which is not reflected in the sentencing ; the deep predominantly life long psychological scars left on the victims;  the fact that a civilised moral society usually takes responsibility for the safeguarding of its children and in this area it does not appear apparent ; the high level of recorded reoffenders. thats only the convicted reoffenders !. Ergo does it not require a life sentence.",
