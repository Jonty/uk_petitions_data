        "additional_details": "I want this inclusion in writing, because at the moment the RSPCA rely on the clause, when its there property, its there's to do what they like, which makes a mockery of verbal assurances given by an Inspector of new homes, even when the animals are signed for new homes.  Most of my young dogs are dead because this warning was not on the Animal Acceptance Agreement.  Nothing was said about euthanasia. I have tried, but the RSPCA will not put this warning on voluntarily.  The following is the euthanasia figures of the RSPCA in recent years, 2007 66489, 2008 60203, 2009 63231, 2010 59384, 2011 53183, 2012 64295, 2013 in the region of 61,000 {figures are now given in graph form}.  In 2011 the RSPCA euthanized 10 of the 58 animals taken in under the Home for Life Service.  Please sign this petition to make the RSPCA put written warnings of euthanasia on this documentation, currently there is nothing. ",
