As a young student, myself and any others find it extremely difficult, bordering on impossible to save up for the high prices it costs to insure a car. Especially during this economy, where it is equally difficult to find part-time or full-time employment.\r\n\r\nI call upon the government to ensure that insurance becomes fairer for all, and to stop the blatant discrimination against men in-particular.
