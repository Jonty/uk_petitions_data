        "additional_details": "MP's (when allowances are taken into account) have a wage of three times the national average. Many appear to have lost touch with the realities of life for their poorest constituents.\r\n\r\nMP's should therefore be required (while parliament is in recess) to spend 2 weeks a year living in basic accommodation, on minimum wage and using only the local services and public transport.\r\n\r\nThis would focus their attention on the needs and problems of the poorer sections of society. It would give them practical experience of the standard of the services provided by national and local government. And finally, it would give politicians practical experience of the effects and consequences of their decision making.\r\n\r\nSuch 'front line' experience can only assist MP's of all parties as they seek to aid their constituents and enact legislation.\r\n\r\n",
