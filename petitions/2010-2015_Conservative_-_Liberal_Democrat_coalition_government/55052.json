        "additional_details": "The BBC Licence  was originally designed for Households having only ONE TV. The BBC's Commercial Arm has long addressed the issue of Hotels requiring a licence and so its charges based on the number of rooms that it has and not on a one licence fits all basis. If the Government considers that couples or single people should not live in Properties no bigger than one bedroom, via the instigation of the Bedroom Tax, then is it not fair that the same couples or single people who would be using or viewing less TV at any given time should pay less in the TV licence than bigger Households such as families who would have access or view more than 1 TV receiving  appliance at any given time, a family of 6 would or could be viewing 6 TV receiving appliances at any one time. If Parliament truly believes in a fairer society then they should consider this anomaly and as the BBC has obviously failed in its moral obligations then it is up to Parliament to reduce the payment based on viewing ability.
