Of those only 286 out of 2029 were stopped on attempt.\r\n\r\nSo we can all see that there is a direct issue of burglary in the U.K so surely it must be in the Governments good intentions to help prevent all these shocking statistics.\r\n\r\nSo please do help stop this terrible crime from; not just Burglary's, but from our own government aswell.",
