        "additional_details": "As residents of the area surrounding Chertsey Road Feltham we are extremely concerned for the safety of children going to and from school. With large lorries travelling at high speed, it is very dangerous when two lorries pass each other as they mount the curb, parents and children have to move onto the grass verges to avoid injury. The grass is wider than the path, if the grass was removed it would give pedestrians more space to keep away from the traffic.\u00a0\r\nThere have been accidents over the years, one recently being fatal.\r\nAttempting to cross this busy road is fraught with danger as you cannot see far in either direction due to bends obscuring the view of approaching high speed traffic.\r\nThere is urgent need of traffic calming measures, speed cameras, speed bumps, islands in the road. But ideally, traffic lights or a crossing for the safety of the many school children. Something more must to be done, before children are killed.\r\n",
