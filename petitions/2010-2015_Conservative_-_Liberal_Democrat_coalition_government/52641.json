Its obvious that the Inspection and Report appeared to be constructed in a manner to force it to become an Academy, in line with the Department of Education\u2019s drive to convert schools from being run and managed by elected parent and community Governors, to industry sponsored Academies.\r\n\r\nThe Parents from the School have chosen not to be forced into becoming an Academy, and seek an urgent council debate.  This e-petition objective is to gather the support to facilitate the debate taking place.",
