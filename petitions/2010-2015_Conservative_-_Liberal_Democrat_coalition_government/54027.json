        "additional_details": "On Sunday 18 August 2013, David Miranda, the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, who has written investigative articles revealing mass surveillance programmes by the US and UK Governments, was held at Heathrow Airport under the UK Terrorism Act. He was released without charge after nine hours.\r\n\r\nThe use of the Terrorism Act to detain and interrogate the partner of a journalist is disgraceful and more characteristic of a command-control state than our own democratic framework. This detainment has no real basis in protecting us from terror, but has everything to do with intimdating those who would oppose or question those who abuse their power.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call on Parliament to debate and legislate to prevent such misuse of this act.\r\n\r\n",
