This petition is for fairer band allocation as at the moment if you live with your parents and are being made homeless; the housing authority will not increase your band because you live with your parents and your parents wouldn't throw you out onto the street or make your life hell.\r\nThis is wrong; therefore this petition is change how bands are allocated and allow people who live with their parents and are under threat of homelessness to have their band number increased. Since the only way to increase your band is to become homeless.",
