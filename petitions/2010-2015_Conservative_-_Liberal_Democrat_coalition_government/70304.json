        "additional_details": "British Nationality Act does not allow the inheritance of BN(O), it deprives the rights of the descendants of BN(O) to a nationality they should obtain through their parents. It unfortunately exposes these children to the violent rule of the Chinese government. We do believe that our children should be able to acquire British nationality through us, the BN(O), and have the same rights we are entitled to as British nationals.\r\nAs granting the descendants of BN(O) the rights to the inherit British nationality through their parents sends a clear message about the UK\u2019s commitment to the protection of human rights, we sincerely hope that the HM government would consider modifying their existing British Nationality Act.",
