        "additional_details": "I believe the continued use of a term from thousands of years ago is a cornerstone of sexism and inequality. We are not all kinds of 'Man,' we are all kinds of 'Human.' Even the term 'Human' is gender biased, but it is culturally considered a neutral and positive name for our species.\r\n\r\nWe are also, finally, beginning to accept that there are indeed more than 2 genders. Yes male and female are both needed for reproduction, but not for life. You can be any 'gender' and live. If you are alive you are part of the same system as everything else that is alive. Logical progression states that we are all, therefore, born equal.\r\n\r\nTherefore I propose that the government impose that all uses of the word 'Mankind' in education should be changed to 'Humankind' from this point forth. We can not change what has already been conditioned in society, but we can protect our children form such conditioning.",
