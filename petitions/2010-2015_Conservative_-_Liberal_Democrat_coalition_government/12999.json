        "additional_details": "This petition to ask all involved to rethink any plans they have of introducing curfews on the people of Britain, as a snap response to the recent riots.\r\n\r\nCurfews restrict the rights of British citizens and punish everybody for the actions of a few. The government should not have any say in what time of the day its people are allowed to leave their homes, or be in public areas.\r\n\r\nThis includes people of all ages. All young people should just as equally not be punished for the illegal actions of a minority. It is the right of the parent or guardian of a young person to decide when they can be outside. The government/police should not be involved in this decision unless the person is causing a nuisance, performing an illegal act or is seen as being in harm.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned petition against the idea of curfews being imposed on innocent people.\r\n",
