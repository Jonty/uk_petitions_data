Labour inspired NGO 'Lobby political' charities\r\n2. Conservative inspired 'Tax-avoidence' charities\r\n3. Liberal inspired 'Sexual liberalisation' charities\r\n\r\nNone of the above has any automatic 'right' to have charitable status (in accordance with the original parliamentary Act of 1853 (with an intention of 'public benefit' during austerity). This really is a wake up call for the Charity Commission to remove corruption and historic exploitation by individuals (or politicians) who claim a tax free status whilst running a business with the same aim (of avoiding tax).\r\n\r\nLets restore a proper charitable intent to it's original and traditional purpose of benefiting the public.",
