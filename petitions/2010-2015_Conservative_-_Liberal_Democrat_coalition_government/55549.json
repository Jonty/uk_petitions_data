        "additional_details": "On Tuesday 1st October 2013, Bradley Antill was wrongly convicted of child abuse in a huge miscarriage of justice. There is NO evidence other than the words of his accuser, no physical evidence, no witnesses, no medical evidence because it did NOT happen.\r\n\r\nBrad IS completely innocent and we are extremely concerned for his state of mind, he is currently under watch in the health care wing following a suicide attempt.\r\n\r\nHuge amounts of people are being wrongly and falsely accused of child sexual assault on no evidence at all. This is happening far to often and innocent peoples lives are being ruined.\r\n\r\nThis must stop!\r\nIt is all too easy to accuse someone falsely.\r\n\r\nWe need a retrial so that the defence can present new evidence clearly showing Brads innocence.\r\nPlease help us to achieve this by signing this e-petition.",
