        "additional_details": "There is currently no enforcement on lights on push bikes. During the winter period cyclist need to be seen, but is it necessary to blind motorists with very bright and flashing lights.\r\n\r\nEnforcement needs to be carried out to firstly ban flashing lights on push bikes. Flashing lights can cause epileptic fits and there is no reason for any bike other than a police bike to have a flashing light.\r\nSecondly a limit should be placed on the intensity of light produced from a push bike light whilst on the public highway. Most modern cycle lights now are as bright as a cars headlights on main beam.\r\n\r\n",
