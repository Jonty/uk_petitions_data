        "additional_details": "We need to stop the amendment being introduced that will stop head-teachers from allowing parents the 'authorised 10 days term time leave for family holidays'.\r\n\r\nThis government needs to understand that whilst 'we accept' that schooling and education is of vital importance to our children's wellbeing and future, spending 'quality' time with family is of equal importance to a child.\r\n\r\nMany parents work unsocial hours and gone are the days of Mon-Fri 9-5 with parents working shift patterns and weekends..never before has there been a need for more flexibility in the time that parents can take holidays with their children.\r\n\r\n1 week experiencing the culture of another country is more valuable than 18 years reading from a text book.\r\n\r\nThis amendment will place more pressure on schools to reject 'holiday requests' and will force more parents to take unauthorised leave and to then find the money to pay the associated fines.",
