        "additional_details": "Martial law is the imposition of military rule by military authorities over designated regions on an emergency basis\u2014usually only temporary\u2014when the civilian government or civilian authorities fail to function effectively (e.g., maintain order and security, and provide essential services), when there are extensive riots and protests, or when the disobedience of the law becomes widespread. In most cases, military forces are deployed to quiet the crowds, to secure government buildings and key or sensitive locations, and to maintain order.  This petition has been made by a law abiding citizen and asks the Government to install Martial Law immediately to effect control of civil unrest.",
