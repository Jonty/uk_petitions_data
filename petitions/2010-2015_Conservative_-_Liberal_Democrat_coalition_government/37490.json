It is time the Great Britain started to do something about it, so that when the time comes, and the EU breaks up, or we are forced out, we have strong ties with others.\r\n\r\nBritain has a commonwealth, a great union with other nations, so why do we not use it? I propose an EU like trade agreement with Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and any other Commonwealth nation that wishes to join, so that we can bolster our imports and exports to and from these nations, so that when the EU collapses, Britain will not be so badly effected.",
