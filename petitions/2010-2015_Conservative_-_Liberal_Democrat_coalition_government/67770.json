        "additional_details": "The Viney Hill Junction on the A48 is a short stretch of dual carriageway on which there is a cross roads - one way going to Viney Hill and Yorkley and the other way to Etloe & Gatcombe.  The Crossroads is just below a crest of hill and is unsighted when driving from Lydney.  It also means drivers turning into or out of the Viney Hill Road have very little notice of approaching vehicles.  The speed limit on this stretch of road is 70 mph.  Even the police agree that is too fast to approach this junction.  Please sign this petition to try and get Gloucestershire Highways and Gloucestershire Police to make this junction safer, preferably by reducing the speed limit.  Thank you",
