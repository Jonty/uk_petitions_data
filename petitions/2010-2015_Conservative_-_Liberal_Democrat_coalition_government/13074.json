        "additional_details": "It was reported in the media recently that an illegal immigrant was given 11 months imprisonment, instead of 12 months, so as not to trigger automatic referral for deportation so that he could be with his children and wife who claimed British Citizenship through him. The spouses and offspring of illegal immigrants should not be able to claim British Citizen from them and should all be deported. In the last election campaigns to become Mayor of London, many of the candidates proposed to give amnesty to illegal immigrants who have been in UK for over 5 years. This is actually rewarding and encouraging further illegal immigration.  ",
