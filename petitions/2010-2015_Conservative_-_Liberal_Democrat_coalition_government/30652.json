        "additional_details": "RSPCA Head Office receives millions in donations from good natured people believing that their money is going to help animals. This is NOT true. All branches have to fund themselves. Preston RSPCA has had to reduce its staff from 12 to 4 as they dont have enough money to employ them anymore. They have to stop taking any more animals in. Why cant the Head Office send them some of the donations good people have sent to help animals. The animals of Preston and surrounding areas are now at risk as they cant be taken to RSPCA. Think of animal welfare",
