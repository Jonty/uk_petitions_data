        "additional_details": "Ban Elephant racing on the highways!\r\nHeavy goods vehicles (and others) impede the progress of other road users on duel carrigeways by overtaking at speeds as little as 1mph. This causes frustration and stress to other road users. This seems  a deliberate sport on the part of  some HGV drivers as most travel at 1mph below the limit  on duel carriageways and  Motorways. It  takes 10 minutes  to overtake a 50ft vehicle traveling 1mph hour faster. Now multiply that by the number of vehicles hindered. and thats overtaking just one vehicle.  Planes missed,hospital apointments, family emergencies , etc etc.  Calculate  time wasted & cost to economy up and down the land.\r\nhttp://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/250246/lorry_overtaking_ban_halts_elephant_racing.html",
