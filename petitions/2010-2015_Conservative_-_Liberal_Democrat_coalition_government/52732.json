        "additional_details": "On the basis that the govt are activelly discussing the matter of whether to 'instruct' ISP's to mandate an 'opt-in' policy for pornography- I would like the same discussion to take place with anything that has subject matter pertaining to religion.\r\n\r\nI am concerned that children and minors could be exposed to religious concepts at a young age that could be damaging. By comparison if you look at the amount of deaths, serious harm, torture, mental anguish, abductions, rapes, child molestations, beatings, discrimination against women, discrimination against other nationalites/ races caused by or sanctioned by religion- compared with pornography- I feel that religion is a far bigger threat to our children if left unsupervised. I feel that an 'opt-in' setting for religious content is completely appropriate for parents who leave their children unsupervised using a laptop. I would like the Govt to enforce ISP's to force parents to 'opt-in' to view religious material.",
