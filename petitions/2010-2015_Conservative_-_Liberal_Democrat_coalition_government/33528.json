        "additional_details": "The process of repatriation of UK citizens with mental health issues stranded overseas needs to be streamlined.\r\n\r\nAt present the system is unfair, unbalanced and undemocratic and in favour of the State instead of the citizen.\r\nFamilies of UK citizens who travel to the US for example, for work and suffer a nervous collapse several years later as a result of rape, domestic abuse (physical or psychological) or robbed, experience great upheaval in attempting to have their family members repatriated.  UK embassies insist on having necessary identification documentation in order to arrange emergency travel from the port of departure.  This can be extremely difficult to obtain since sufferers of mental health conditions are unable at best to produce such documentation.  Secretary of State needs to look at such issues on a 'case by case' approach instead of using a blanket policy which effectively marginalises such groups who are already vulnerable and at high risk.",
