        "additional_details": "This petition is to keep David Moyes in his job as Manager of Manchester United Football Club.\r\n\r\nThere have been a number of articles written recently that suggest David Moyes time at \"Man U\" is nearly up.  This would be a terrible miscarriage of justice and must be prevented at all costs.\r\n\r\nDavid Moyes credentials are unquestionable and he has the undivided support of the fanbase.  At Man U's last home fixture (vs Liverpool FC) they unfurled a banner that said \"David Moyes is a football genius\", you dont get much more clear cut than that.\r\n\r\nPlease please please please please keep David Moyes at Old Toilet.\r\n\r\nKindest Regards\r\nA Supporter",
