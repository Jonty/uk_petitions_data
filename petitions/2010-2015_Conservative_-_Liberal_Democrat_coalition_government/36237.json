        "additional_details": "Last week my 15 year old daughter went into Paul's hairworld in Manchester and asked for advice on how she can lighten her hair. They sold her a 1 litre bottle of 9% hydrogen peroxide and a 500g tub of powdered bleach - which cost approx \u00a311 (easy in the range of spending money). Both bottle and tub were labelled \"for professional use only\" and involved mixing the liquid and power in a certain ratio. Fortunately I found it in her bag before she had the chance to cause some real damage to herself. When I complained to Paul's Hairworld, I was informed that there is no law stopping the sale of these chemicals to kids aged under 18 and hence this petition. Please sign and stop these shops and stores from selling toxic chemicals to kids.\r\n\r\n",
