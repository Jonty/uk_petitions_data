However, from 2012 this has increased to inflation plus 3%. The increase should just be equal to inflation or less!\r\n\r\nFor the average UK resident, travel is the probably in the top 3 annual costs for the year !\r\n\r\nWe are encouraged to \"Travel Green\" but these price increases are making this more and more difficult.\r\n\r\nAs an example I require a monthly rail ticket to travel from Aldershot to Windsor:\r\n\r\nin 2010 my ticket cost \u00a3252 per month, in 2011 this raised to \u00a3265 and in 2012 raised again to \u00a3282\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the above example the year on year raises have been well above the rate of inflation.",
