I have submitted at least 4 petitions concerning this matter, but all of them have been rejected. This matter should at least be given a chance to collect signatures. All we are asking is for the Prime Minister to come on national television and say the words, \"The Game is up\". I can assure you, this is not a joke, although I wish it was. These three little words will make a bigger difference in the lives of so many than you could ever imagine.  Please consider this with the utmost concern.",
