        "additional_details": "This petition is designed to prevent the Core Issues Trust from launching an advertising campaign on London buses implying that a person can be \"cured\" of their sexuality.\r\n\r\nThe slogan \"Not Gay! Ex-gay, post-gay and proud. Get over it!\" is not only misleading, but a deliberate response to gay rights group Stonewall's \"Some people are gay. Get over it!\" campaign.\r\n\r\nThis campaign will only serve to encourage both discrimination against gay people and also spreads misinformation about the nature of a person's sexuality and their ability to control it. As such it is damaging, and should not be allowed to take place.",
