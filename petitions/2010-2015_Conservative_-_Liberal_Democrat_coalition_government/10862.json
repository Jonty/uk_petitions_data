Litter picking, street cleaning, park tiding, doing chores for the elderly and disabled, volunteeer work, etc,.. are some of the things they could do to earn their benefit.\r\n\r\nStaff could be hired to manage and supervise these people and this could be paid for out of the benefit re-couped from those persons who refuse to work to earn their benefit.\r\n\r\nNot only would this make persons on benefit more appreciative of the money they receive, it would provide a necessary and useful service to society.  It would also create jobs for those who supervise and give those on benefit a feeling of self-worth and increase their chances of obtaining paid employment.",
