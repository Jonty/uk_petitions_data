More emphasis should be taken in these talks, the prime minster should work with other country to encourage these peace talks to reduce the amount of blood shed and loss of life.\r\n\r\nNo one deserves to die or suffer the way these people are suffering you don\u2019t need to be a Muslim to stand for up this justice you just need to be a HUMAN. They have eyes who have dreams, they have ambitions which they want to be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nMost of all they have hearts and so do we let\u2019s do what as \u201cdarkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can, hate cannot drive out hate only love can\u201d- martin luther king jr\r\n",
