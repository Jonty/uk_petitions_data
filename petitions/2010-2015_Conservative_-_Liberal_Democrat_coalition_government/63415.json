        "action": "Refer Maria Miller's 'administrative failures' to the Crown Prosecution Service.",
        "additional_details": "Following the decision of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, that Maria Miller repay  the Taxpayer \u00a345,000 for her 'administrative failures,' this figure has subsequently been reduced to a sum amounting to only \u00a35,800, by the Standards Committee. Clearly there are differing opinions in relation to her level of culpability and the amount of money due to be repaid. It is my view that it is appropriate to refer Ms Miller to the Crown Prosecution Service, as I have seen people in Magistrates Courts being punished and ordered to repay, in full, amounts which have been erroneously over-paid to them, or where a citizen has made an administrative error in their claim for Job Seekers Allowance. I am sure the Government does not want to be accused of double standards?",
