        "additional_details": "The new law on squatting will make the homeless vulnerable. It states that squatting is a criminal offence. We therefore want the government to reverse this new law and make squatting legal again.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated there are about 1 billion squatters around the world, and the new law in England states that squatting is illegal and they can be sent to jail or fined for this offence. How is this fair? All they want is to have shelter and warmth, and the money used for them to go to jail could be used to find them a home and get a job.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I don't feel for needless vandalism, if someone were to squat they shouldn't be allowed to take or steal other people's property. There should be boundaries between squatting and vandalism, stealing and many other crimes some squatters commit.\r\n\r\nThank you, and I hope you sign this petition to get squatting legalised once more.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
