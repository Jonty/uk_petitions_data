        "additional_details": "I would like the government to review the usage regulations regarding agricultural vehicles. Other industries and jobs require extensive training and testing of employees, regular testing of machinery and an audit trail of all the above. Agriculture, it's employees and it's machinery does not. With the massive advances in technology of the machinery and yet the tender age at which many people begin operating huge, heavy and fast machines on the public highway, this must be changed.",
