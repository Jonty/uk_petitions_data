Those are just the most recent actions.\r\n\r\nThe criminals who comitted these acts, \"if\" caught will have the possibility of being freed after 15 years for \"good behaviour\".\r\n\r\nNumerous people lose their lives, and their attackers punishment is simply to lose a few years before being allowed to rebuild their lives from the start.\r\n\r\nThis is completely wrong and I firmly believe that if a \"person\" is found guilty of murder they should see out their days in a prison cell.",
