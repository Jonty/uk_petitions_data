        "additional_details": "We the undersigned deplore the proposed closure of over 44% of Accident & Emergency Units in West London.\r\n\r\nAllready an 8 hour wait at Hillingdon is frequent & the addition of patients diverted from Ealing well be catastrophic.\r\n\r\nOther alternatives to Ealing at Hammersmith & Charing Cross Hospitals are also on the closure list as is North Middlesex.\r\n\r\nThe extra travel in peak traffic times has obviously not been taken into account & alone could cause fatal delays to treatment.\r\n\r\nAlso Hillingdon has had complete rebuilding plans for several years, which could disrupt A & E facilities there.\r\n\r\nHillingdon Hospital allredy has all accomodation in use & any enlargement could result in vital treatment clinics being displaced.\r\n\r\nTherefore we call upon the secretary of State for Health to cancel all plans for Closures of A & E facilities in West London.",
