        "additional_details": "When oil prices rise the big energy companies can not wait to increase gas and electricity tarrifs.  Yet the same isn't true when oil prices drop.  The cost of oil has dropped in recent months, yet the big energy companies bury their heads in the sand and continue to charge extortionate prices for domestic gas and electricity.  The Government must act now to force energy companies to pass the cost of falling oil prices on to customers and make gas and electricity more affordable",
