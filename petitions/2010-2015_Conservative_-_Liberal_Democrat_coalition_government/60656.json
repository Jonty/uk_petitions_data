However you could have a 4.0L engine with eco friendly emissions yet you are paying more road tax than a 1993 car which ruins the envrionment alot more. Also there will be drivers with no insurance if third party insurance cover is included within fuel price - the isurance will be invalid - but it stops others who pay for insurance spending 20 pound per policy on drivers who are not insured ",
