The use of air force and navy is very effective and cost less in lost lives of our brave servicemen and servicewomen in Libya; and yes it would have been applicable in Afghanistan as well. Instead of running the gauntlet/lottery of not hitting an explosive roadside device (IEDs), let the Taliban and their murderous improvised road side explosive (IEDs) devices do battle in the air with extra fighter bombers, drones and gunships (like Apache helicopters and even specially fitted out cannon bearing ground attack Hercules aircraft). Also Chinook helicopters and Merlin helicopters can more safely transfer essential personnel and equipment when required & necessary from theatre of war to theatre of war.",
