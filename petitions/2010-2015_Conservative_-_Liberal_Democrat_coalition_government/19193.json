        "additional_details": "Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, several African states, etc who received substantial financial and/or militarily aid often also have large number of their citizen who are illegal immigrants, failed asylum seekers and potential refugees seeking asylum in Britain. It had been reported that Iraq had refused to accept illegal deportees in the past. This indicates that Iraq is an ungrateful state and that hundreds of our brave British armed forces died or severely wounded for nothing. Aid should only be given on the condition that the recipient country accepts their citizens who are failed asylum seekers & illegal immigrants, with or without passports. Many asylum seekers who claim \u2018prosecution and fear of death\u2019 in their own country will inadvertently go on holidays to the country of their origin and seek permanent residence in UK for their extended family members but only AFTER they were given asylum status in UK.",
