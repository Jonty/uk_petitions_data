The Care & Support Alliance of 50 charities, including Carers UK, Age UK, Leonard Cheshire Disability, Sense, Independent Age and Macmillan Cancer Support, urges the Government to deliver a long term solution on care funding that can weather political and economic change, based on the Dilnot Commission\u2019s recommendations for:\r\n- a proposed new cap on care bills\r\n- a national system of eligibility\r\n- a new advice and information service for families accessing care.\r\nWe urge the Government to accept these recommendations in its White Paper on Social\r\nCare, which it has promised by Easter 2012.
