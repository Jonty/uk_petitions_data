        "additional_details": "Finding a bed for a elderly person in a mental health unit/hospital is impossible.Even if the patient is sectioned under the mental health act it is no guarantee that a bed can be found and even if a bed is found it could be anywhere in the country thus being in most cases impossible for family to visit. The time it takes from a patient trying to take his/her life to being found a bed in a safe and secure environment with the right medical assistance is to long and for a lot of people sadly to late. I would like the government to review the laws and regulations on help that is urgently needed and provide more funding into these services which are not advertised as other health issues are. Old age pensioners are part of every community and deserve to be looked after with dignity and respect.",
