        "additional_details": "I am utterly disgusted that a boy 11 yrs old Iis picked up off his feet from the street by two peaodophiles, forced into a stairwell and RAPED! Those responsible were given bail before attending court. This is of grave concern for innocent children being preyed upon and then not protected by those with the 'POWER' to uphold laws that were designed to punish those choosing to commit such crimes. The discretion used in this case is not within the best interest of the victim and promotes lenient penalties which can encourage other peaodophiles to intensify their crimes without fear of harsh scentences. I question ANY judge or investigating officers who choose to use their discretion to display leniency for such a crime. I want the government to do the same",
