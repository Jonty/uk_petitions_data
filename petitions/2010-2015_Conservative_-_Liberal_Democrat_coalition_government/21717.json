        "additional_details": "Every year around November 5th millions of British pets have to endure night after night of public and private firework parties.\r\n\r\nAnimals endure extreme anxiety and fear from the high frequency emissions generated by fireworks which only they can hear.  Many have to be sedated with drugs to help them through the ordeal.\r\n\r\nMost of us accept that Bonfire Night represents a significant facet of British history, but it loses meaning when it becomes a movable feast to suit individual and commercial interests.\r\n\r\nPlease vote to limit the occassion to November 5th only",
