        "additional_details": "My wife and I currently own a second property that we are renovating with a view to making it available to rent as a long term investment.\r\n\r\nOur local authority Telford & Wrekin Council have set the council tax on this property at 150% of the standard rate, this has left us with a combined Council tax bill of almost \u00a33000 a year which we cannot afford.\r\n\r\nMany people are being affected by this but some people pay nothing in different Local authority areas, the 150% rate can be applied to anyone who buys a property that has been empty more than two years.\r\n\r\nWhile I don't expect to pay nothing I believe 150% is grossly unfair.\r\n\r\nPlease support my petition, thanks in advance.
