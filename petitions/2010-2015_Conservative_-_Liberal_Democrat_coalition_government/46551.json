This vile practise is active in the USA and homophobic parents encourage their children to do this.\r\nI believe this nonsense causes massive harm to vulnerable children and young people who have been living with homophobia and hate for their lives and see this nonsense as a way out of being what they are. All they can achieve by doing this is to live one more lie and live their lives in misery.\r\nWe should be helping homosexual people to believe in themselves instead of allowing these hate organisations who hide behind religion to do terrible hateful and spiteful things to vulnerable people.
