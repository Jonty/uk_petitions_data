        "additional_details": "Virgin Rail has over the last 15 years utterly transformed the West Coast main rail line between London and Glasgow. Through the introduction of modern high-speed Pendolino trains, journey times have reduced, punctuality has improved and comfort on board trains is improved except at very busy times.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Transport has been seduced by an unrealistic bid by FirstGroup and awarded the franchise to them. FirstGroup have a poor reputation on every service that they operate throughout the country.\r\n\r\nAs taxpayers and users of the West Coast main line, we would like to see Virgin retained as the operator for the next franchise term.",
