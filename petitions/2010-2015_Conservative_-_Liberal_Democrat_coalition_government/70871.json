        "additional_details": "As if out of a horror movie, children are being abducted out of their homes and taken to another country. Psychologists have emphasised on the dramatic impact child stealing has on abducted children. These children suffer psychologically and emotionally after being uprooted from the life they know and love to a foreign environment. These children are often alienated from the primary parent they were taken from either telling them the parent doesn't love them anymore or is dead.\r\nThis sudden change leads to brutalisation of the children psychologically and destroys their sense of trust in the world around them putting them at risk of serious psychological or emotional problems.\r\nThe government needs to seriously monitor this issue and put in place strategises to stop children from being taken out of the country without the UK based parent's permission. Children should be protected from the harmful effects of wrongful removal from their habitual residence.",
