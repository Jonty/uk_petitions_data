But we need our troops to protect our country yet their numbers are being reduced due to budget cuts whilst  foreign aid is being increased to help amongst many things build schools & educate children, please can you tell me how this helps defend or country because that is what we should be thinking of. Some of the countrys that we've increased aid to have actually said they do not want it!  Overseas aid should be less, our countrys security should be our main objective and that money should go to keeping the numbers of the Armed Forces  and we remain a force to be reckoned with.",
