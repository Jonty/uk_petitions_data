        "additional_details": "Abolish the unfair system of the road fund licence and replace it with an increase in fuel duty.  Currently cars are taxed, rather unfairly, on the amount of C02 they produce and the age of the vehicle. Surely this is not the best way to raise tax.  Would it not be a fairer and greener alternative to abolish the road fund licence and collect the tax lost by an increase in fuel duty.  This would also be a considerably more green tax because the more miles you cover, the more pollution you cause and, as the tax on fuel has increased, the more you will pay.\r\n\r\nAt the same time as abolishing the road tax, a compulsory vehicle insurance and MOT disc should be displayed on the vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe current system of road tax also unfairly discriminates on people on lower incomes who cannot afford newer, less CO2 producing vehicles and are therefore forced to run older vehicles which attract a higher road fund duty.",
