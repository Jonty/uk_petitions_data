        "additional_details": "This e-petition has been created to fight the latest 10 point penalty deduction placed against Portsmouth Football Club. Portsmouth Football Club has already paid it's penalty in season 2011/2012 with a 10 point penalty and should therefore not be penalised again with a second 10 point penalty for the same crime. I would like the government to support the amazing supporters of Portsmouth Football Club to give them a fair and level start to the new season 2012/2013, and to show that the real supporters are not punished for others incompetency and mismanagement of the clubs finances in previous years. We have been punished enough! ",
