        "additional_details": "The signatories of this petition request that the Attorney General review the lenient sentencing of Jordan Sheard, who set fire to Autistic teenager Steven Simpson, resulting in his death.\r\n\r\nThe signatories feel that the sentence of 3 and a half years, being released on license halfway through his sentence is incredibly lenient for taking another person's life. We request that the sentence be reviewed, and a lengthier sentence be considered, as anyone who could set fire to another human being as a \"prank\" is a danger to the public, and Steven's family and friends deserve more in terms of respect and justice for Steven's life than the 21 month sentence that has been handed out.",

This sentence will be reviewed therefore,  without the need for any further request. \u201d"
