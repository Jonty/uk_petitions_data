        "additional_details": "Over 70% of the uk population cannot afford to pay legally binding insurance in a lump sum such as that required for cars, thus, effectively resulting in billions of pounds being lost to financial institutions that would be better served in the economy.\r\n\r\nThe right wing irony is that if you earn in excess of \u00a360 - 70 000 then you could save upto \u00a3500 a year compared to those of the working class.\r\n\r\nThe lower classes are being penalised for a legally binding contract because they cannot afford to pay their insurance as a whole sum.\r\n\r\nBy abolishing the interest paid on finance a household containg 3 drivers could save upto \u00a31000 a year! Money that would be used in a more efficient means to help the family and the economy.\r\n\r\nI, and many others would like the government to take heed and devise a policy that would allow fair and just equality for a legally binding payment that is required for the whole of the UK population.
