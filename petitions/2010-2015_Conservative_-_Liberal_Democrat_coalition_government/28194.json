Have you had to fill out constant forms, due to miss communication and things getting lost or misplaced? Whatever problem you have had this petition is our chance as students to speak out and make a change with how the Student Finance system works. I will be taking this to my local MP's first and if they do not listen I will take it to Downing street.",
