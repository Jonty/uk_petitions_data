        "additional_details": "The name of the Olympic Park should evoke some positive sentiment relating to its purpose and legacy. Monarch-worship is a cultural dead-end.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, the Games were about ordinary, relatively unknown people achieving great things thanks to an incredible amount of practice and training; many of them have day jobs. Whatever one's position on the monarchy, we all know that the monarchy doesn't represent these qualities - even if you believe it is a good thing in other respects.\r\n\r\nThis petition is not about the wider question of whether the UK should have a monarchy (I think people from both sides of this debate can support this petition), but if you believe that the rename betrays a complete lack of imagination on the part of those taking these decisions, and that monarch-worship has gone too far - to the extent that it is seen as unpatriotic to consider a non-royal name for the park - then please support this petition.",
