        "additional_details": "The people of the UK pay the TV licence in return for unbiased, objective news coverage from the BBC. But examples of biased news coverage have proven this not to be the case: Zero coverage of 2009 the Icelandic revolution, reluctant and often misleading coverage of the \"Occupy Wall St\" movement and most recently, the heavy bias of the \"Better together\" campaign during the run up to the Scottish referendum. These cases have proven that the BBC is not an unbiased media organisation and as such, The Government must abolish the TV licence for the BBC not living up to it's impartial obligations.",
