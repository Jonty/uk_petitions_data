However only an abbreviated 'short' version is available from HMRC which excludes key sections for small business (such as R&D costs, amongst others). To submit the additional information, companies must pay for third party software or an accountant.\r\n\r\nThis additional cost is an entirely unnecessary burden for many small businesses who are capable of filling out a form on their own.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned ask the government to make the full form available, including all sections so businesses do not incur unnecessary costs complying with statutory requirements.",
