        "additional_details": "We petition that ALL onshore gas/oil exploration sites have mandatory EIAs.\r\n\r\nIt is argued that EIAs are unnecessary for exploration as most of this is laboratory based. We disagree; when drilling commences a risk of pollution & damage exists.\r\n\r\nEIAs will not undermine the commercial viability of this industry. In the EU, EIA costs typically account for less than 1% of the overall investments.\r\n\r\nMandatory EIAs will provide local people & authorities with the necessary baseline data in areas with drilling, increase the preparedness among agencies & local authorities & offer local communities an opportunity to be consulted early in the process.\r\n\r\nEIAs will not be a miracle cure to bring about the \u2018social license to operate\u2019 for the industry. However, the Government & the fossil fuel industry should be aware that NOT including EIAs in the regulatory process will further galvanize local opposition to these activities.",
