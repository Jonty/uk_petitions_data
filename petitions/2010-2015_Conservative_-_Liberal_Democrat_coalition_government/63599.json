They should have the power to fine misconduct and ensure that those individuals that have been treated unfairly receive compensation.\r\n\r\nThe system should recognise that most individuals who have been treated unfairly do not have the resources to pursue their grievance through traditional means.\r\n\r\nCharges levied should be reasonable and proportionate.\r\n\r\nIt is time that we stopped this gravy-train for unscrupulous bailiffs who simply pray upon the poor and vulnerable .
