To do this, we need to regrow our carrier operation capability by effectively copying the USN's procedures. This means we need to practice conventional carrier operations before 2020, ideally by leasing F-18 Hornets until then.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, the government must recognise that the original QE Class cost estimate was too low and accept that aircraft carriers are expensive and must be paid for, regardless of cost rises. The USN knows a new carrier costs c.$6bn. Why do we think we can have two for \u00a37bn?  ",
