        "additional_details": "Currently, the Queen and the Prince of Wales must be consulted before legislation is put before the House that might have an effect on the private interests of the royal family. It is unfair and undemocratic that any person should have a legal right to distort the development of the law of the land for the sake of their own private interests, which is precisely what this veto on the passing of legislation by Parliament is. It is also deeply undemocratic that this right is exercised in secret. It must be abolished.",
