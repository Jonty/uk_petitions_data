        "additional_details": "Burma has a population 75 million with the Muslim population being\u00a0just 0.7 million. The Burmese Muslims have been under this affliction\u00a0after 1962 when the Army usurped the power in Burma.\r\n\r\nIt all started on\u00a03rd June 2012 when 11 innocent Muslims were killed by the Burmese Army\u00a0and the Buddhist mobs after bringing them down from a bus. A vehement\u00a0protest was carried out in the Muslim majority province of Arakan, but\u00a0the Protestants fell victims to the tyranny of the mobs and the army.\u00a0Trying to elude capture and an imminent killing; Burmese Muslims\u00a0thronged\u00a0to the Bangladeshi border, but all they met was dismay. The\u00a0Government of Bangladesh refused to offer them asylum.\u00a0Over 500 Muslim villages have been incinerated. Thousands\u00a0have been exterminated. The persecution of the Burmese Muslims at the\u00a0hands of the Buddhist mobs is at its full swing.\r\n\r\nWe call on the British Government to intervene in Burma by sending in troops to put a stop to this callous killings.",
