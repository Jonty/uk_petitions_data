The Bulgarians and Romanians  that live in UK today and those that may travel in the future to live and work in the UK have been invited. They were invited when the UK agreed to the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU. The UK also has agreed to the freedom of movement of people due to its continued membership of the EU. These countries have been fully-fledged members and the UK is still imposing restrictions on their citizens. It is an embarrassment to your advanced nation.\r\nStop this useless propaganda against Bulgarians and Romanians, please!",
