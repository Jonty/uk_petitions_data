        "additional_details": "Why do a lot of prisoners commit petty crimes on a regular basis? Because they have an easier & more comfortable lifestyle inside a prison than they do on the outside, whereby they may not have housing or financial stability. Satellite television and video game consoles on offer as well as free bed and board. Prisoners also receive wages and cash bonuses for good behaviour, while drugs are often cheaper in jails than they are on the streets. It would appear that the Government Justice System is making a mockery of those law abiding citizens who might struggle to pay their rent/mortgage, food, utility bills etc, while a criminal enjoy's the Life of Riley inside HM Prisons. Surely time for a rethink?",
