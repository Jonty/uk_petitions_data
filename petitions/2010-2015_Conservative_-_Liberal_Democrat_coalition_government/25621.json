Morris dancing has been a cultural tradition in England for many years and it is important to show off our proud traditions in the Opening and Closng ceremonies. Isn't that what they were going to be used for. It is an insult to all Morris dancers that this is not the case. They entertain the people of Britian and should show off their skills in the ceremonies in the Olympic Games.",
