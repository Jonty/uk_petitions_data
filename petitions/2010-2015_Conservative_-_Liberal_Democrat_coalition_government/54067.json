        "additional_details": "When a student loan has been fully repaid through PAYE deductions, repayments should stop immediately, and any overpayments should be issued immediately.\r\n\r\nWith the current system, when an individual finishes repaying their student loan at the end of April, PAYE deductions can continue to be deducted from an individual's salary until next April, unless an individual specifically contacts The Student Loan Company (SLC) with payslip evidence, and requests a refund.\r\n\r\nIndividuals that I have met have had student loan repayments wrongfully deducted from their pay, by upto 24 months in some cases.\r\n\r\nWhat SLC are doing is immoral, unethical, outdated and needs to change. They are holding millions of pounds of tax payers money unlawfully, gaining interest.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for SLC and HMRC to provide better visibility for individuals who have paid their student loans back. Any overpayments should be refunded immediately. When you've paid it back, repayments should stop, immediately.",
