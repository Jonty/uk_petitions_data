        "additional_details": "Walter Tull was an English professional footballer who played for Tottenham Hotspur and Northampton Town. He was the 2nd person of Afro-Caribbean/mixed heritage to play in the top division of the Football League, and the first to be commissioned as an infantry officer in the British Army. During WWI Tull served in the Battle of the Somme, he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in 1917 despite the 1914 Manual of Military Law specifically excluding \"Negroes\"/\"Mulattos\" from exercising command as officers. Tull fought in Italy in 1917\u201318, and was Mentioned in Despatches for \"gallantry and coolness\"  he returned to France in 1918, and was killed in action on 25 March, his body was never recovered. It is others and my opinion that Walter Tull should be  posthumously award a Military Cross. Address this injustice by signing this e-petition.",
