        "additional_details": "Many fast food companies and coffee shop chains have a policy that they throw away unsold food at the end of their working day.  This food is in date and safe.\r\nTheir reasoning appears to be that they fear being sued.\r\nI asked for some food recently from a well known coffee shop brand who told me that this is not possible.  This was later confirmed by their head office.\r\nI feel that this food is wasted when it could be donated to the many foodbanks or rough sleeper assistance orgainisations.\r\nI petition for the government to make it compulsory for these companies to donate food that is still in date if asked by anyone who has a constituted group thats aims include getting food to those who need it.\r\nI petition the government to legislate to stop this appalling waste.",
