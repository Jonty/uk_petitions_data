        "additional_details": "Property prices particularly in central london are again rising rapidly, well above the ability of even skilled professional workers to afford them.   This is driven by two factors: shortage of supply and secondly, but no less importantly, the foreign ownership of property as an investment.  Currently around 3/4 of properties in London that cost above \u00a31000/sq foot are bought by foreigners.  A considerable number of foreign buyers are not actually resident in this country.   I am proposing an annual levy of say \u00a350 per square foot on companies and foreign citizens (in particular outside the EU) who own residential property in London and across the country, with a greater sum levied on those properties left unoccupied.",
