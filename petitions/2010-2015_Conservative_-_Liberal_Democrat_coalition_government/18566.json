        "additional_details": "The current system of organ donation is not working as well as it should be, as currently on average 3 people die each day waiting for a transplant, but over 90% of people are in favour of organ donation but only 29% are actually signed up on the organ donor register. A change in the law to an opt out system will greatly increase the numbers of potential organs for transplant. This system does not over-ride an individuals wishes as they have the opportunity to opt out if they wish to do so.",
