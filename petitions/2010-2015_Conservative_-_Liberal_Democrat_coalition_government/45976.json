        "additional_details": "Teaching influences the future of our society, it's competitiveness and it's civility. Whilst it is amongst the most satisfying of careers, it does not rank as a major choice of career due to the lack of pay. The bright and best go into careers in law or finance.\r\n\r\nMy petition seeks to exempt the first 50,000 GBP of a teacher's income from all and any taxes to encourage the best and brightest to join this nobel and critical profession.",
