        "additional_details": "If frustration with \"AIR\" has brought you here, you are not alone in feeling angry.\r\nThe FSO has received a large number of complaints on this topic and GB websites turn up even more. No doubt there are even more silent victims.\r\n\r\nPeople are not informed that policies will automatically renew leaving consumers footing the bill. Often premiums are doubled without people knowing, and cancellation fees are then applied to rake in even more money.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to help defend those people who would otherwise not speak up for themselves.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
