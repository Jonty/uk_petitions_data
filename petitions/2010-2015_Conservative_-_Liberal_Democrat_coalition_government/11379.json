This can be in the form of serving in one of the Armed Forces or by providing assistance, through 'voluntary' work, to a recognized organisation that promotes the welfare and advancement of our citizens. Those who fail to participate, other than those proven physically or mentally incapable of doing so, would forgo their right to any  form of state benefit. National Service, as in many other countries, would help to engender a sense of pride, respect and responsibility for our country and our fellow citizens.   ",
