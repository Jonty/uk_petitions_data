        "additional_details": "Today, 2nd January 2013, rail fares have increased by an average of 4.2% across Great Britain. The Campaign for Better Transport and Railfuture have calculated that some rail fares in Britain have risen by 50% over the last 10 years while the TUC's Action for Rail campaign indicates that increases may not lead to any better service to passengers given that the rail industry needs to save \u00a33.5bn by 2019.\r\n\r\nIt is time for commuters and rail users to take a stand and demand government action to stop further increases, particularly as extra monies paid each annum are not necessarily indicative of a better service. Travelling by rail is vital for many people to reach their employment, whilst also being a safe and environmentally friendly form of transport. Rail use should not just be for the rich, don't let the government let it become so.\r\n\r\n",
