If we were to turn away from this ineffective, destructive and expensive system, we could:\r\n\r\nBoost public finances: the financial benefits of discontinued drug enforcement expenditure could be up to \u00a314 billion, plus the taxation of regulated drugs.\r\n\r\nReduce serious crime: dramatic curtailment of opportunities and incentives for organised and violent crime.\r\n\r\nEnd the largest cause of acquisitive crime and street prostitution, achieving a dramatic reduction in the non-violent prison population.\r\n\r\nImprove public health: creation of an environment in which drug use can be managed and drug users can lead healthier lives.\r\n\r\nReduce war and conflict: an end to the illegal drug trade's contribution to conflict and political instability in producer and transit countries.\r\n\r\nRestore human rights and dignity to the marginalised and disadvantaged, and regenerate deprived communities.",
