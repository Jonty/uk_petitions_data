The former debate should feed into the latter, as it is a Welsh issue, not a British one.\r\n\r\nb) There needs to be research into the viability of independence. This should contain objective evidence, which will be useful to those who already have ideological standpoints which may or may not be supported by evidence.\r\n\r\nI put this to the UK government, since the UK government is needed to make a referendum happen. In the interests of fairness and an informed Welsh population, these proposals need to happen as fully as possible.\r\n",
