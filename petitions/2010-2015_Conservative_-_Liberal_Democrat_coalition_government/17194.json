        "additional_details": "Shockingly, while many unemployed people are desperate to find work, in the construction sector many employers are equally desperate to fill vacancies. The sector is increasingly dependent on temporary workers because it\u2019s not viable for them to keep a large staff on the payroll.  While there is never any guarantee that there will be further work available, for those that work hard to impress there is often the possibility of additional temporary work or even a permanent contract.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople are being actively discouraged from taking on temporary work by Job Centre Plus advisors because of the complications it can create with benefit claims.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need to accept temporary work as an economic reality and introduce a \u2018claim as you go\u2019 benefit system where people could register with Job Centre Plus for temporary work and activate and deactivate their benefit claim on a real-time basis to allow them back into work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
