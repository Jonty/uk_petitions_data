        "additional_details": "The request for the UK to pay \u00a31.7 Billion to the EU by 1/12/14 is unreasonable and illustrates a formula which punishes economies which adapt more successfully to economic hardship.  What is more ridiculous is that it is the same formula that is punishing Greece and Cyprus for good growth after their bail-outs.  That was the point of the bail-outs!  The thrust of the formula is clearly wrong.  This is an issue above party politics and we should show parliament our support for the refusal to pay.",
