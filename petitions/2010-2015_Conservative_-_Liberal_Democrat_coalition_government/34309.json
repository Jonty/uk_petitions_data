        "additional_details": "DEFRA has suggested that buzzards be captured and/ or their nests destroyed in order to help the pheasant shooting industry. While it is recognised that gamekeepers are an established part of country life, it is the same industry that almost led to the extinction of the buzzard several decades ago. Although a substantial number, the pheasant shooting fraternity are simple a small minority who have the time and money to indulge in such activity. We believe that wildlife preservation is much more important than the 'hobby' of a few privileged people. We call on the government to discuss this in the house with a view to ensuring that these plans are dropped or reversed if implemented.",
