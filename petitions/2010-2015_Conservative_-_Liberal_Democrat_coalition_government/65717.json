The existing leadership has lost public confidence.\r\n\r\nA cross-party committee should examine in full the potential costs of Mr Gove\u2019s actions, the long term damage to the profession and education in Britain.\r\nThe changes he has bought into our education system are destroying what chances us children had. We need the old policies back that where bought in by the Labour Government!",
