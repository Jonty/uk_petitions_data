For decades, most employers have only been shortlisting the 6 or so most experienced candidates.  This is unfair and harsh.  Younger workers are particularly affected by this process of short listing as they have less work experience.  If a candidate has the experience and meets all the job criteria they should be invited to a job interview.\r\n\r\nPLEASE SUPPORT MY PETITION\r\n",
