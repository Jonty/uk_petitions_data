        "additional_details": "The goverment should make it a legal requirement to allow new drivers the right to hire a car after they have passed their licence. It is understandable that new drivers pose more of a risk which is why higher charges could be set for new drivers as done with normal car insurance. The goverment should allow people who are legally legal to drive on british roads to hire a car the same as someone who has held a licence for a year or longer.",
