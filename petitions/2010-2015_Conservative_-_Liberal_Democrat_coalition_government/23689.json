        "action": "Call for Parliament to have an open debate on changing drug legislation",
        "additional_details": "This petition would aim to compel the government to at the very least have a free debate about changing current drug legislation. Drug trade is one of the worlds biggest trades, along with oil, arms and cotton, totally untaxed with massive profits benefiting only proffesional criminals. If this petition gathers the required number of signatures we would ask that the commons discussed freely, without pressure from the whips, a two tier classification of \"soft\" and \"hard\" drugs with soft drugs being sold under controlled situations (similar to the way we control tabacco and alcohol) and hard drugs given on prescription and taken under medical supervision. Such approaches are shown by sociologists, criminologists and medical proffesionals to reduce crime rates significantly and also improve health (as with proper controls purity, toxicity and quantity can be properly controlled.)
