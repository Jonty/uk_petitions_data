I take some medication and they do that I get more kilograms ..so now is not just the mental health now is + the pain in my articulate,  my skin  because I'm more fat, allergies. ..etc but they answer at  all this things is: We can't do nothing, any third treatment is perfect. I pass the 68 kg a 96.4 kg..but nobody care my pain, no just physical.  Apparently I'm not fat enough for receiving help but I'm obese.  This have may sense for you?  Can you help?.",
