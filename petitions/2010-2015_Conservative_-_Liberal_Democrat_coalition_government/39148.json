Children must be returned to their families following a successful defense in Court over any such allegations.\r\n\r\nHeresay evidence must never be acceptable as a reason to remove children from their families. Families can still be closely monitored where there is suspicion.\r\n\r\nChildren who have been removed from their families must be allowed supervised access to their parents until a Court has decided that abuse has occurred.\r\n\r\nIn the event that one parent/guardian is found guilty of abuse and removed from the family but another parent/guardian is not implicated, the children must be returned to the 'not guilty' parent.",
