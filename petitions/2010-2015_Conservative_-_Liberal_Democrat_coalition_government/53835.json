Did you know that GPs are being paid according to financial incentives? The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) rewards GPs for how well they care for patients. In order to get a reward your GP has to act in a certain way by ticking boxes on the computer screen. This means that your GP is not really interested in health problems that do not match the tickboxes. DoES your GP really desrve a reward? It is time to re-think the The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) and decide its future.",
