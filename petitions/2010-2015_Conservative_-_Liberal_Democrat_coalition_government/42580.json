        "additional_details": "Peri Partum Cardiomyopathy is a form of heart failure called Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM). In this form of heart failure the left ventricle enlarges allowing more blood into the chamber. This happens 1month prior to delivery to 5months post partum and can be life threatening.\r\nI was not made aware of this condition while preganant and only found out about it when I woke after 5 days of life support.\r\nThe condition is rare but does happen everyday in pregant women.\r\nPlease sign this petition to promote awareness and request more screening for this type of condition.
