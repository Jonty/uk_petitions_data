        "additional_details": "Currently Sawston has no facilities for the younger generation to enjoy apart from some swings and a slide, but I believe that in order for Sawston to thrive as a village that accommodates both the young and the old, Sawston County Council need to invest in a skate park which will not only stop loitering, it will give Sawston positive publicity in the local newspapers. Take the One Minet Park in Saffron Walden, it only opened 7 years or so ago, but it is hosting the X Games, (the equivalent to the Olympics in the action sport world). And has had many famous skaters from the world champion team Plan B.  ",
