        "action": "For the British government to end recognition of all international courts.",
        "additional_details": "It is imperative that the British government end recognition of, and co-operation with, all international courts, such as the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the United Nations Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. Western leaders are effectively immune from prosecution in these courts, no matter how much brutality they commit, which has been a considerable amount in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The ICC is a malicious, racist institution, whose indictments have so far all been against prominent Africans such as President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan and Colonel Gaddafi of Libya. All such courts should therefore be shunned by as many countries as possible, including the United Kingdom.",
