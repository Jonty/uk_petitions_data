        "additional_details": "Our public money should not be used to fund a museum for Margaret Thatcher. The Margaret Thatcher Museum will not be there to preserve history. It will be there to promote Thatcherism and manipulate the facts about her. It will be an attempt to manipulate youth into believing a very biased view of her. There are no museums for other MP's so why create a museum for Margaret Thatcher? She was hated by many and the museum will only anger a great deal of British citizens.",
