This doesn't apply in England!\r\nExploitation of cross border laws should stop.\r\nWe need uniformity between all borders.\r\n\r\nBoth parents earning should apply for fair assessment.\r\nNo parent should have too little to live on.\r\n\r\nUnfair justice on defending against Liability orders in Magistrates Courts.\r\nCourts operate a quick turnaround and ruling.\r\nYou cannot take the CSA to court!\r\nNo court will allow this to happen. I have tried.\r\nCourts have little or no power over the CSA\r\nAllow fair justice for all in the courts regardless of who brings the action.\r\n\r\nCSA must fully disclose what earnings information they have on you.\r\n\r\nTighter controls over the CSA to stop them being a law unto themselves and No more threats or bullying and contradictory advice.  Employees lack compassion, understanding and treat callers like cattle to the slaughter.\r\n\r\nThis needs reform quickly.\r\n",
