        "additional_details": "The reduction of the 50% tax for those on incomes over \u00a3150 is an affront to he Public Service workers in the UK. At a time when Public Servants are having their living standards slashed by pay freezes and increases in pension contributions it would appear that they are now expected to subsidise the wealthiest in our society and having to pay more in pension contributions so that those who can most afford to pay their share of tax pay even less. Therefore I petition the Treasury to :  Retain the 50% tax rate on incomes over \u00a3150,000 and close the loopholes which allow people with massive incomes to pay lower amounts of tax. It does not seem that \"we are all in this together\" more like use Public Servants as scapegoats to pay for the rich to become even more wealthy.",
