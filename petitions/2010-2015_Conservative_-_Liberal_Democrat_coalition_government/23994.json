It is a slap in the face of the UK public that these banks are then getting sold at a loss to Private companies; the only people that profit are the bank managers\r\n\r\nThe government is focused on keeping debt with the banks to hold over the public but this is not working as we have seen. We pay the government, the government should put us before the banks that have done nothing but prove very publicly that they only care about profits, slashing 1000s of jobs, AFTER public money is given to them? The banks are not helping the UK, the UK government is letting its people face lifetimes of debts,\r\n\r\nGovernment, stand up for your people, bail them out of debt and let the banks sort themselves out, they have proven time and again that they do not care about the public\u2019s well-being only their shareholders.\r\n",
