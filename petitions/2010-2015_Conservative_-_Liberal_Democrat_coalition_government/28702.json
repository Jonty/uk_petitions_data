However if Scotland remains within the United Kingdom it should not be treated as a special case and given further powers. If it wants the benefits of being in the United Kingdom, it must also accept the costs. Any proposal to give Scotland further powers ('Devo-Max') must first be agreed by a Referendum of the whole of the United Kingdom. Therefore, the UK government must pass a law that guarantees any further transfer of power to the Scottish Government must be agreed in a referendum of ALL United Kingdom citizens.\r\n\r\n",
