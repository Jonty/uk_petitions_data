        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that Halal meat should be banned in the United Kingdom or if Scotland becomes independent for it to be banned in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nThis is mainly because we think that the method of Halal slaughtering is unjust, inhumane and careless.\r\nHalal slaughtering consists of a slit to a live animals throat, this must cause unnecessary pain for the animal involved. We live in 2014, we should use a less painful method to kill an animal during slaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, many specialists have expressed concern for a while and nothing has yet been done, it is about time we change this.",
