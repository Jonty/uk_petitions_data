By doing this any additional pension plus the state pension can take some people above the threshold, you will then be taxed on the extra monies. If you have a private pension, you pay tax on your earnings and you are then taxed again on your pension, so you can be taxed twice. By the time that you realize this you are a pensioner and it\u2019s too late to do anything about it. It\u2019s about time that the state pension was exempt of tax.\r\n\r\n",
