There is a manifest danger to the public if someone in an executive office does not possess such traits; or if they suffer from psychopathology, extreme narcissism, pathological lying, etc.\r\n\r\nThe public should have confidence that this is not the case. Prospective members of the government should be subject to such tests, administered by independent experts, as a matter of routine. ",
