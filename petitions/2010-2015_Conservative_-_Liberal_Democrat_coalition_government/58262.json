        "additional_details": "On 12th December 2013 Conwy County Borough Council voted to demolish the 113 year old Grade II Listed Victoria Pier in Colwyn Bay.\r\n\r\nVictorian seaside piers are very rare buildings. The pier itself is largely unaltered including retaining 95% of its original beautiful cast-iron hand-rail panels.\r\n\r\nThe architecturally important main Art Deco Pavilion / Theatre erected in 1933 contains the only remaining murals by Eric Ravilious, artworks of international importance. Many other original features of this unique building also survive largely intact.\r\n\r\nThe Pier has just survived the largest tidal storm surges for decades completely unscathed; it is not falling to pieces, despite the Council's claims to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe Pier is most certainly NOT beyond preservation and restoration.\r\n\r\nWe urge the Secretary of State to use his powers to call in and reject any application for de-listing of the Pier - which will be required to be granted before demolition can even be considered.",
