        "additional_details": "The Games Makers gave their time willingly to make the 2012 Olympic Games incredible for those lucky enough to attend. The Games Makers gave up their chance to the biggest sporting event of their lifetime as they were outside venues, at train stations, showing confused civilians the way to the toilets or stadia and as a result most did not see any of the events.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as well as giving honours to unknown politicians or rich celebrities CBE's, OBE's etc., each Games Maker should be given an honour to provide a tangible reward, alongside the purple polo shirt and beige slacks, for their selfless efforts",
