        "additional_details": "Reasoning:-\r\n1)\tBBC coverage is watched by millions of people many who can\u2019t afford a sky subscription.\r\nThe BBC has many fringe/low rating broadcasts and channels that should have been axed to save F1.\r\n2)\tSky has the exclusive rights to too many sports, this deal only add to its strength and takes us one step further to an unstoppable Sky sports monopoly.\r\n3)\tF1 is a huge UK tradition enjoyed by many fans, it should be protected for everybody to enjoy.\r\n4)\tMany F1 teams are UK based and it\u2019s a great way to showcase the UK\u2019s engineering and technological prowess at home and around the world. Free to air\u2019s maximum coverage inspires the next generation of motorsport professionals to continue the UK\u2019s F1 tradition.\r\nAction required:-\r\n\tBlock the BBC/Sky deal and keep F1 on Free to air TV\r\n",
