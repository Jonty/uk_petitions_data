        "additional_details": "Being 19 i am a user of social media sites and it is common for inappropriate videos to be shared publicly throughout the site. Being a media student of 3 years I know how difficult it is for police and government to keep check of  content posted on sites, especially Facebook and YouTube. I do not agree with using sites to spread videos of a sexual or violent nature. The videos go from masturbation to scenes of extreme animal cruelty. I find them graphic, stressful and upsetting. I believe these videos should be filtered out or sites should be shut down. There is the argument that these videos are enlightening us about the world, but i believe that we are more than capable of knowing what goes on without having to see these vile videos. Together we can stop these videos being shared. We need to stand together.",
