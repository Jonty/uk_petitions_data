        "additional_details": "Bilal was a young, bright and whole-hearted student who loved maths and had many dreams. He was overjoyed when his efforts allowed him to enrol into Paddington Academy 6th Form.\r\n\r\nRegrettably, this was short lived. At the end of his first year he had a few incidents and did not submit some work, which led to him being dismissed.\r\n\r\nDue to his tough upbringing which left him vulnerable to antisocial behaviour, and the absence of school in his life, he got caught up in the wrong crowds. Tragedy struck and Bilal lost his life. The streets were the next best option for a talented young boy who had so much to offer but was forbidden from fulfilling his dreams.\r\n\r\nSchools are prioritising academic reputation over student welfare by letting go of students they deem less able at any given chance.\r\n\r\nI would like the department of education to increase the difficulty for students to be expelled and ensure those who are expelled are regularly checked to ensure they are on a positive track.\r\n",
