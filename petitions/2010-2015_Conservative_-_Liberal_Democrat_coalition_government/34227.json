In the last 2 months friends and family has lost dear\r\nFamily pets, mainly dogs, as they were poisoned by anti freeze by evil people contaminating water in public parks and woodlands. I petition to make the sale of anti-freeze for 18+ years of age and when purchased forced to provide car registration, and address details. I would also like the government to make manufacturers of this chemical to change its compound that makes it taste sweet to animals or include animal repellant. It's nearly impossible to catch these people, this will at least make it harder for them to purchase and safer for animals.",
