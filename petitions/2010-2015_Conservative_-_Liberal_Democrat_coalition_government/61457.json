        "additional_details": "The Ministry of Justice are currently reviewing an appeal by Gordon Rideout for release from prison on compassionate medical grounds.  Canon Rideout was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in May 2013 for 36 charges against 16 children.  Now, after serving only 8 months of his sentence, he is appealing to be released on medical grounds.  Should the MoJ show him any compassion?  Did he ever show his child victims any compassion when he was abusing them? Please sign to make sure that this awful man serves his sentence in full.",
