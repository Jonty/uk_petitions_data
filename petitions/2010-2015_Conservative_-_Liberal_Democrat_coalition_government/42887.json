If it is the case that criminals are entitled to be compensated when the police is acting lawfully then it MUST be that council tax payers - who have no option but to pay their council tax or face legal action - MUST lawfully be entitled to compensation from the police when they fail in their protection of taxpayers and they suffer hurt - either financial or personal - as the result of criminal action.  It CANNOT be lawful for criminals to be compensated while council taxpayers who are victims of those criminals are not!",
