I believe that if you act inhumanely then you are not human. If you are not human then you should not have human rights.\r\nWhen an animal attacks a person then you put it down, but because these animals look like us and can communicate with us we show them a mercy that was not given to their victims.\r\nI cannot think of any circumstance that would excuse them from their deeds against society and therefore call on the government to bring back the death penalty for these sub human people.\r\nI have fought for my country for 12 years and I hate to see it brought down from within.\r\nPlease vote for my petition if you believe that these people do not deserve to live.\r\n",
