However to allow what has happened this year (2012) in GCSE English Language which was to change the grading criteria on the final leg of a two year unit is nothing short of recklessness.\r\n\r\nI want to call for a public enquiry.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing what-so-ever wrong in increasing standards and also raising the bar of achievement, but this must be done at the start of the two year course for GCSE and A levels so that students are fully aware of what is expected and required to gain the required grades.\r\n\r\nEducation in this country is based on the principle that students should be given a fair chance at the assessments and this means told what is expected on enrolment of the course. I don\u2019t mean teach to the assessment, rather what is expected in meeting the given learning outcomes and how it will be graded.\r\n\r\nI want a public enquiry and any wrong doing to be corrected for our young people affected by this problem.\r\n",
