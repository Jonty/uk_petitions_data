        "additional_details": "The inefficiency of CAFCASS is a diabolical fact.\r\n\r\nThe current trend for CAFCASS workers to base their recommendations on one phone call is absolutely insane.\r\n\r\nSome CAFCASS workers also find it appropriate to make Section 7 report recommendations without first obtaining essential safeguarding checks. This places children at great risk.\r\n\r\nThese people can be condescending, sarcastic, bullying, patronising, downright useless and can earn up to \u00a345k pa....for what?!\r\n\r\nI would like to gain as many signatures to this e-petition as possible so that I can lodge an official complaint about CAFCASS via my MP to the Ministry of Justice.\r\n\r\nDon't let CAFCASS into your lives, they will destroy it!",
