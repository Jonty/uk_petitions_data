Similarly, immediately stop Foreign Aid to Pakistan which has been seen to give support to the Taliban who kill our soldiers in Afghanistan as well as hindering essential supplies to our troops in Afghanistan. Stop Foreign Aid to Zimbabwe a country run by Mr.Mugabe a sworn enemy of the UK. Also review all other Foreign Aid to ensure it goes to those who deserve it. The money saved should be spent on our own people in their time of need. Charity Begins at Home.  ",
