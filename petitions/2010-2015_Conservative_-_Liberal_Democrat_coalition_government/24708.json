        "additional_details": "India\u2019s bland assurances are contradicted by a 2005 study by the Institute of Water Modeling (IWM) Bangladesh, which concluded that during a drier monsoon season, when Bangladesh will need water for fisheries and cultivation, Tipaimukh dam authorities would nevertheless retain 27 percent more water in June, 16 percent in July, 14 percent in August and 4 percent in September than an average monsoon year. The water retention accordingly would also reduce the navigability of the Barak\u2019s two downstream channels, the Surma and Kushiyara rivers. Due to this being a major ecological issue and can affect major areas and countries in Asia, we are requesting all support from the Government in tackling this issue.\r\n",
