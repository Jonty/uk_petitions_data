        "additional_details": "There are many people out there in the UK that are far to happy to rest on their laurels and claim benefits.\r\n\r\nSome of these people are also in receipt of CSA payments to support additional chlildren in the home if the parents are no longer together. No such entitlement can be given if both parents are still together but out of work, they receive the same nugatory benefits as an individual in receipt of CSA.\r\n\r\nIn both examples, they have their Rent, NI, JS/IS and Child Benefit. The difference being that a seperated person may be better off than those that are still together. This is surely influencing the culture of get pregnant by whomeverand claiming benefits\r\n\r\nInstead I propose that it is debated that these cases should be means tested and surpluss to requirement funds should be re-numerated to goverment for the benefits system to re-coup some of the tax that the rest of the working population pays lessoning our overall burdon of the benefits system.",
