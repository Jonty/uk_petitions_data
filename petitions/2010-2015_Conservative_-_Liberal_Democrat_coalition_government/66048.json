        "additional_details": "Several years ago, powers were transferred away from the Police to tackle households generating noise disturbance by playing excessively loud music.\r\n\r\nThis problem is now handled by local councils.\r\n\r\nThis is of no use at all to anyone affected by this disruptive and antisocial behaviour, since councils are notoriously difficult to prompt into action and cannot respond anywhere near as quickly as the Police, nor can they do so outside office hours.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to ask the Government to reinstate the Police's powers to challenge those creating a disturbance with the playing of loud music - and to toughen up the law so that it is unacceptable to do so without a licence at any time of the day, not just at night.",
