I pay my taxes and the government\r\ndistributes my taxes as it sees fit.\r\n\r\nIn order to earn that pay cheque, I work on a rig for a drilling contractor.\r\nI am required to\r\npass a random urine test for drugs and alcohol, with which I have no problem.\r\n\r\nWhat I do have a problem with is the distribution of my\r\ntaxes to people who don't have to pass a urine test.\r\n\r\nShouldn't one have to pass a urine test to get a benefits cheque because I have\r\nto pass one to earn it for them?\r\n\r\nPlease understand that I have no problem with helping people get back on their feet.\r\n\r\nI do on the\r\nother hand have a problem with helping someone sit on their backside drinking beer and smoking dope.\r\n\r\nCould you imagine how much money the\r\ngovernment would save if people had to pass a urine test to get a benefit cheque?\r\n",
