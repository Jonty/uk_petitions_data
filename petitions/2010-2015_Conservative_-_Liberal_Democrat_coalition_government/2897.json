        "additional_details": "It is a proven fact that on shore Wind Farms are one of the most inefficient methods of generating renewable energy. The vast majority of on shore wind farms are situated in areas of beauty yet contribute little to the targets set by Government. They receive significant subsidies although their contribution is small\r\n\r\nI would ask the Government to\r\n\r\n1.seek alternative methods of renewable enery such as off shore windfarms, tidal power, biomass which are proven to be far more efficient\r\n\r\n2 Stop subsidies to on shore wind farms that are less than 30% effiecient and with the savings increase funding grants to house holders that wish to intall zero carbon systems\r\n\r\n3 Allow Local Planning Authorities to determine applications for on shore wind farms on efficiency, noise and other factors that are detrimental to local residents.",
