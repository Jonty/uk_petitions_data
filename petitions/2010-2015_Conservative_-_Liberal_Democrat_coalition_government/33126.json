        "additional_details": "Qualifying years for State Pension reduced from 44 for men 40 women, to 30 years in April 2010 increasing future pensions costs. More will now get full pension, those with fewer than 30 qualifying years get increases around 46% for men and 33% for women. State Pension age has increased to 68 due to \"rising costs\" blamed on longevity. Brits leaving school at17 retiring @ 68 will pay NI for 51 years directly or by credits. The change to qualifying years has no benefit whatsoever to the vast majority of British workers. Beneficiaries of the changes include working age Emigrants, early retirees, those who stop work early, the wealthy who don\u2019t need to work & immigrants who can arrive in the UK aged 38 and get exactly the same Pension as a Brit after 50 years of work. The change must be reviewed to stop millions of Emigrants Immigrants and wealthy getting unfair State pension increases costing British taxpayers \u00a3billions and to avoid increases in State Pension age.\r\n\r\n",
