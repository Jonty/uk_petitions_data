They have to pay to park at their workplace and all they want to do is help others.\r\n\r\nNHS staff spend days such as Christmas and New Year with complete strangers, with their patients and colleagues, helping to save lives. For doing this they get a little bit more money, but the job they do is priceless. Please sign this petition.",
