        "additional_details": "We would like the HMRC & UK Government to increase the diverted profit taxation from 25% to 50% in the United Kingdom. It means organisations would no longer getaway with the use of tax avoidance schemes like they were able to do in the past from April 2015.\r\nWhy is this important?\r\n\r\nThe UK public purse loses tax that can be used to fund much needed public services 25% is too low for the new tax rules.\r\n\r\nOrganisations that have little or no investment, in the UK and earn large sums for example:\r\n\r\nAn organisation made \u00a33.3 billion they paid tax of \u00a320.4 million small compared to if they were taxed 50 % through the new scheme:\r\n\r\nThe public purse would have gained \u00a31.65 billion that could have went to the Government.\r\n\r\nThe consultation closes on the 4th February 2015.",
