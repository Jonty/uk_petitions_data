        "additional_details": "Increase funding for rural schools.  Despite increasing demand for school places rural schools are suffering.  They struggle to get enough funding to pay for enough teachers so that classes can be kept at single ages.  Teachers are lost, classes are combined and parents seeing this take their children out of the school and send them to a larger school in an urban area, thus increasing demand there and decreasing the funds of the rural school further.\r\nI ask that funding is allocated to rural schools where there is a demand thus enabling the school to pay the staff and take the pupils.",
