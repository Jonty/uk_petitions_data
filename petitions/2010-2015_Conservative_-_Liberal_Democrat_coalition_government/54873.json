        "additional_details": "Since September of 2013 a new rule has come into force, it means that parents who take their children on holiday during term time could possibly face a fine and the holiday will go down on record as an unauthorised absence!\r\nThis is very harsh For parents like myself who cannot afford to go away during the school holiday periods!\r\nThe old rule was each child was given a maximum of 10 days holiday per year....the rules need to change back! The new rule is discriminating to both parents who can't afford the luxury of school holiday time breaks and also for  a lot of local business owners who rely on the holiday time trade simply can't leave at the busiest times of the year!
