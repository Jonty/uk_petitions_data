        "additional_details": "Tax needs to be simple, explains where its spent and all conclusive - everyone must pay it - and ultimately fair and non punitive.\r\n\r\nI call the government to action a law and a tax to fund a working model of citizenship and immigration:\r\n\r\nHow much: The minimum is 3 pounds 65 pence Sterling. Although a government may recommend more, the levy can be no more than 1p per day per year.\r\n\r\nWhere does it go: Creating a working system dedicated to monitoring who leaves and who enters the country and the ability to work out if someone is the country or not and if they are of British citizenship or not.\r\n\r\nWho pays: Everyone who wants the right to live and work in the UK. (It's set LOW so that everyone MUST PAY - there is no excuse for not paying this tax. )\r\n\r\nHow it's collected: Anyway possible - since everyone should pay for it.\r\n",
