        "additional_details": "This petition is for the removal of all religious preference in UK state-run schools. Britain is a multicultural society comprising of many different religious groups and cultural backgrounds, and state-run institutions should not discriminate based on these grounds, schools included. British children should not have their educational opportunities limited due to their religious beliefs (or lack thereof), in the same way that British citizens do not have their opportunities in work, welfare and healthcare limited by their beliefs.",
