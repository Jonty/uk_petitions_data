        "additional_details": "Burn the VAT on sunscreen is a petition to Her Majesty's Treasury to cut VAT on sunscreen.\r\n\r\nUnder current UK tax law, sunscreen is categorised as a luxury and is subjected to cosmetic levels of VAT at 20%.\r\n\r\nThis petition aims to ensure the public stays safe in the sun by making sunscreen more affordable to all.\r\n\r\nEvery year, more than 100,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with skin cancer and over 2,500 lose their lives as a result*. Skin cancer is largely a preventable disease, with high factor sunscreen helping to protect the skin against harmful UV rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to help make sunscreen more affordable in the UK, by removing the 20% VAT on sunscreen.\r\n\r\n*Source: British Skin Foundation, March 2013\r\n\r\n\r\n",
