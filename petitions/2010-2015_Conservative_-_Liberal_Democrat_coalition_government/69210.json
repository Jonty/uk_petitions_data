        "additional_details": "Following his comments that Charities should \"Stick to their Knitting\" and \"not stray into the realms of politics\" I am calling for him to be fired on the grounds of being grossly unsuitable for the position to which he has been appointed.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, no elected official has any right to instruct or advise any organisation to stay out of politics.  Politics is not owned by politicians and participation in the process cannot be at the request or approval of the incumbent overlords.\r\n\r\nLastly, for a government who has invited private business into its bed, asked them to run our most cherished public trusts and begged them to buy our long standing public assets at cut rate prices to turn around and tell charities that they are encroaching on the proper boundaries of politics is quite frankly sickening.\r\n\r\nI don't want his resignation.  I don't want an apology.  I want him fired.  On principal.  Because we deserve better than this.",
