        "additional_details": "To solve the current account deficit, we begin the development of genetically modified cats. These cats will be big enough to survive in arctic tundra like regions where normal housecats would perish. We then export these housecats what are massive to countries such as Iceland or the North pole (probably a country) and make a large amount of profit from their sales. This increase in exports should balance the current account deficit.",
