        "additional_details": "I believe that there needs to be a clear division on what firearms are considered \"antique\" and which are not. I call for the terms on which a person can own a rifle, shotgun or handgun to be changed. I think that any firearm designed/manufactured (such as colt revolvers- still produced today) pre 1945 should be legal to own on private premises or at gun clubs/shooting ranges. Furthermore, I propose that it should be made harder to get the licences needed to own such offensive weaponry, by say, upping charges, and more extensive psychological tests to be performed on those applying for licences, such as those performed on police officers wanting to become authorized firearms handlers.\r\nAll in all, I want firearms first designed or made pre 1945 to be legal, in calibers up to .357. I also want the tests to decide on whether or not a person is fit to own and handle firearms to be more in depth and harder to pass.",
