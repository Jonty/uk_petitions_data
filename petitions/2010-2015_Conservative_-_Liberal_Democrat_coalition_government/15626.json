        "action": "Prevent future \"boom & bust\" cycles by legislating for all UK property transactions to be controlled by the government ",
        "additional_details": "\"Boom & bust\" cycles in the UK have been caused by the collective aspirational greed of homeowners & estate agents forcing property prices to often ridiculous levels. The government should assume responsibility for setting fixed, non-negotiable prices of UK housing with all sales, private & public, forced to use a central government \"estate agency\". This radical yet logical proposal eliminates the \"greed\" factor. It would require, inter alia, severely curtailing \"buy to let\" & ceasing all council house sales. Current prices are too high & must be reduced. A healthy house-linked economy - new kitchens, bathrooms, furniture etc, - is improved by a regular turnover of housing stock . Since aspirational greed cannot be controlled and will continue to be a permanent risk to the stability of the UK economy, it follows that only intervention at the most fundamental level will \"cure\" the problem.
