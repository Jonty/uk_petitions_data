        "additional_details": "Research has shown that 'Free-From' foods and drinks (gluten-free, dairy-free, wheat-free, GMO-free, etc.) are significantly more expensive than comparable standard foodstuffs, often making the average weekly shop at least double the 'normal' cost for consumers.\r\n\r\nWhilst some people choose a Free-From diet as a lifestyle decision, many of the consumers have no choice but to pursue such a diet due to illness. This puts suffers under a great financial burden through circumstances that are no fault of their own, particularly for those on a low income. Approximately 12 million British citizens followed a Free-From diet in 2013, amounting to a fifth of the entire UK population.\r\n\r\nThe Government are requested to bring in retail regulations for all Free-From foods and drinks to ensure that there is fairer pricing when compared to standard products and bring an end to the disproportionately higher pricing of Free-From products in our supermarkets.",
