        "additional_details": "I suggest that instead of married couples being treated as individuals regarding take home pay, they should be regarded as partners, which they are in the eyes of the law.  The gross wage earned by the married couple should total \u00a370,000 before 40% tax is applied.  With the highest earner then being liable for the tax if this figure is over taken.  This would mean one partner could earn \u00a370,000 without the other partner having to work.  This would be an incentive for marriage, and also give married couples the tax break they HIGHLY deserve. ",
