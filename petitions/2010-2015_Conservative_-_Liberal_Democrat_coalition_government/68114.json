        "additional_details": "This petition is for Parliament to initiate sanctions against the USA as the main sponsor for the atrocities being carried out by Israel against Palestine.\r\n\r\nAs long as Israel has the support of the US the UN is impotent.  Israel is doing whatever it likes.\r\n\r\nElsewhere the US has deemed that if the UN is being ineffective then sanctions should be taken against the main sponsor.  Applying this to Israel means that the most effective course of action is to bypass the UN and sanction the main sponsor ie the USA.\r\n",
