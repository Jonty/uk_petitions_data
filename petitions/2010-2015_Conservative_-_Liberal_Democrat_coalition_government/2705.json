        "action": "Allow State Pension increases for ALL UK pensioners residing overseas.",
        "additional_details": "This petition aims to get a ridiculous, unfair and discriminatory piece of UK State Pension legislation overturned.\r\nDiscriminating against approx. 525,000 UK pensioners residing overseas. We have paid our Class B, NI contributions.\r\nInflation is a worldwide phenomenon, not just restricted to UK and EEA countries.  We have willingly paid all contribution increases over the years. When the overseas resident reaches SPA, we want to see the same fairness from the UK government.\r\nPresently, the UK state pension is \"fixed\" at the rate applicable at that time.\r\nApproximately 535,000 overseas pensioners do get the pension increases, if they happen to reside in a European Economic Area (EEA) country or country with a special UK agreement.\r\nIronically, most of the countries were the pension increases are not paid, are British Commonwealth countries that do have long standing historical, trade and friendship links to the UK.",
