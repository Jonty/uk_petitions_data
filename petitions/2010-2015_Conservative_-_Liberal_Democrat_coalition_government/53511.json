There's even a baby now - it's like a posh version of Family Guy, but with less farts.\r\n\r\nWho better to represent the rich, diverse culture and heritage of our great nation than UK Pop's very own Royal Family?\r\n\r\nBest Song Ever is a reminder that this nation is moving in just One Direction - towards greatness.",
