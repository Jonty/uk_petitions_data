As a Mom of a 6yr old Type1 It is a 24hr job and they need constant care although when trying to claim for our children we are hitting a barrier with the DWP. It is a 'lottery' as to what rate you will receive and some are getting the bare minimum and others get everything. Most people end up going to appeal. This should NOT be the case. It is stressful enough being a Type 1 Parent without having to fight for what our Children need. Testing, administering insulin, coping the hypo's and hypers, mood swings, changing canulas (pumping) and counting carbs etc, 24 hours care is needed but not according to DWP. This needs to change..",
