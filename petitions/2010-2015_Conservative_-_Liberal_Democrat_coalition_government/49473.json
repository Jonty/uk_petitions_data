Half its solders have served in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nIts recently held one of its most successful recruiting events with over 50 extra potential recruits signing up.\r\n\r\nWe call on the MoD to reconsider their plans and instead support the success and leadership shown by  the RMLY in recruiting, training and retaining loyal solders.
