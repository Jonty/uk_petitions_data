        "additional_details": "There is no need to await the departure of the floods to begin Dredging at once, when, with the removal of financial restrictions by Mr Cameron, floating Dredgers can start work at the sea end of the outfall   of the main river and work upstream as soon as they can be brought to site. Dredgings can be dumped at sea to avoid contaminating the land while flooded. The sooner work starts the sooner the floods can be dispersed. Westminster Dredging are experts. I was Agent for the construction of two Jetties on the Thames from floating craft. ",
