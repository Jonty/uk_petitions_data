        "additional_details": "Currently, lettings agents do not have to by law sign up to any kind of regulatory body. They charge extortionate fees couched in language like 'administration fees', 'checkout inventory', and 'credit referencing'. The fees cost a small fortune and are completely out of balance with the service provided.\r\n\r\nI want to call on the Government to ensure that lettings agents must by law sign up to a regulatory body and code of practise, thereby protecting tenants from fraudulent agents and cracking down on extordionate fees.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, all the fees other than a refundable deposit and rent are illegal. Lets be the change we want to see in the world!\r\n",
