        "additional_details": "Today's prisons are overcrowded and a drain on the tax payer's money. Surely the two main purposes of prison are to remove someone from society who poses a threat and take away that person's independence as a punishment for their crime.\r\nSo why are those who commit fraud or fail to pay their TV license sent to prison? They are not a threat to society and would be much more beneficial carrying out community service or paying a fine, instead of being locked up and costing us thousands of pounds.\r\nPrison should be for violent or threatening crimes only.
