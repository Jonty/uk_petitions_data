The mileage you have done in the previous year is divided into cost per mile based on what Tax Band your vehicle fits into and an average mileage for the UK road user.\r\n\r\ne.g. Survey mileage travelled by the average UK Road user from mileage collated in between yearly MOT tests, cap that mileage as a max figure (in this example 20k), then divide this by the total cost of your tax band.\r\n\r\n(Band L) \u00a3460 \\ 20,000miles = 0.023 pence per mile\r\nMy average annual mileage of 3500miles\r\n0.023ppp x 3500miles = Approximate Yearly Tax of \u00a380 (for a low mileage driver).\r\nIn this scenario you would have to pay for the previous year\u2019s road tax based on usage.\r\n\r\nI feel this is fair to all involved based on the emissions and how much it is used.",
