Afterall we are a democracy, and members in the House of Lords are chosen without earning the seat.\r\n\r\nThe reason why they should be voted, is because House of Lords can make bills that could get through even if the public never voted or want it. They can also can make changes to bills as well, which can effect the public and why should they have the right to change any part of a bill or put forward a bill that will effect the public when the public did not ask them to make these decisions on our behalf.\r\n\r\nThe system that I would like to see is PR voting and also elections to happen every 5-6 years, this can be debated what voting system should be used and when elections can take place.",
