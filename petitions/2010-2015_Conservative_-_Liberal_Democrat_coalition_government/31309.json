        "additional_details": "Hundreds of thousands of people are set to be made homeless and will be forced to leave the homes that they are currently renting as Housing benefit cuts are introduced. These government welfare cuts will not only affect those claiming housing benefit -but will also leave numerous landlords without tenants to rent their properties. London hosting the Olympics also means that the cost of renting has actually risen within certain areas. Where will everyone go? What will happen to your area? What will happen to our people? We need to make a stand! The people at the bottom need a voice too! Sign this petition to STOP THE CUTS BEING MADE TO HOUSING BENEFIT!!!",
