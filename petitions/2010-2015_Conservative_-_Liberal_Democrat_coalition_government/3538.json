The UK's influence and world standing should not be jeopardized in order to solve short term financial issues, especially as defense cuts now will force a rise in MoD spending in the future, and possibly irreversibly erode the global position of the UK.\r\n   Therefore, we the below signed wish for the Armed Forces to be exempted from Treasury cuts, particularly cuts which will cause job losses for serving troops who continue to do their jobs bravely throughout the World.
