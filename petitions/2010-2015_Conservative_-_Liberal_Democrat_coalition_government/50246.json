Or are you being messed about with your access rights because you won\u2019t lie down and roll over on every command made by your ex? Have you been through the courts for access orders that stopped almost instantly? Or are you just fed up completely with absurd way that the CSA runs and how they would sooner see you out on the street then show a little compassion to your personal circumstances.\r\n\r\nMy rights to make this partition are the fact I\u2019ve gone through all of this and still am. My child is 5 and I\u2019ve been to court 6 times already for access that lasts no longer than 2-6 months. If you agree that the governments should seek reform than sign away and with any luck they\u2019ll sort this joke of a system out!\r\n\r\n\u201cChange of circumstances\r\nDoes the non-resident parent have access to the children- yes or no?\r\nDoes the resident parent allow access- yes or no?\r\nCSA NO ACCESS NO MAINTENANCE!!!",
