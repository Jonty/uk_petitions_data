        "additional_details": "We can all buy our telecoms from any provider, but ultimately when they break down it is  BT who do the repair.   BT outsource this repair to a subsidiary  company \"Open reach\" which is NON customer facing.\r\nAny  business  urgently needs to know how long the repair is going to take.  Unless you are a direct customer of BT , this information is not available. BT are never asked to show how efficient their repair service is to 3rd party providers. It is in the Interest of BT to deliberately slow down repairs to 3rd party organisations. Most customers of 3rd party telecom providers return to BT because of this issue.\r\n\r\nWhy are BT not answerable for leaving my business without telecoms for 7 days.  (ISDN30 Failure Twice in 6 Months) No explanation, No responsibility, No Care.  Probably because they are a legalised monopoly and the regulator does not care.\r\n\r\nA clear breach of monopoly power. ",
