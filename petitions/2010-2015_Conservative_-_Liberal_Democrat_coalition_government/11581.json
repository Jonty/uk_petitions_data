All Money raised from the dog licence could be used to fund dog wardens, cleaning of parks & open play areas etc. thereby saving money out of our Council Tax that is needed for more important things. Each dog could be DNA'd, at the time of issue, so that any fouling in public places could be traced back to the owner for a fine. The more dangerous a dog, the higher the cost of the licence. In Ireland they are \u00a35 and \u00a32.50 for seniors. Lost, abandoned and stray dogs could also be traced.",
