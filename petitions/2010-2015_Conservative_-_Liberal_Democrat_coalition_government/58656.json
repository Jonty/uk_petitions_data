        "additional_details": "A funeral was recently arranged for an ex Royal Marine and because he had no family then he was going to go out on what is known as a paupers funeral. When the Department of Work and Pensions were called to ask about a contribution for payment, our requests were dismissed. This is not right for a person who paid into the Department of Work and Pensions all of his life and served for over 10yrs as a Royal Marine. Therefore we are asking for your signatures to help for this law to be changed. One thing that could be done is for a red flag to be put onto medical records making it easy to spot and obtain payment from the Department of Work and Pensions for a dignified final journey. Thank you.",
