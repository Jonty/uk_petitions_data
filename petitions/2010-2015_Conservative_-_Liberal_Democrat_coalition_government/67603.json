The definition of \"left wing\" would be determined by the regulator, Ofcom. The definition of \"loss making\" would be determined by HMRC. Both criteria would need to apply for this tax rule to be applied\r\n\r\nWere such a judgment to be reached, then additionally, all those receiving salaries or fees from such newspapers or broadcast outlets should be taxed at 50% on all their annual income in order that this can be reinvested in the media and culture of our nation. This tax revenue would be earmarked for use by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.",
