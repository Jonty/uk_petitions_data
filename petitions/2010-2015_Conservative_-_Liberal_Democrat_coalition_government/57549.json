It could devalue the pound, like many EU countries do for the euro\r\n\r\nResponsible department: Her Majesty's Treasury\r\n\r\nThis is because using the pound as a momentary currency entitles co-ordinated agreed fiscal policies, objectives & required appropriate actions. Clearly if an independent Scotland uses the British pound as their momentary currency, she will be dependent on UK\u2019s dictation like what Germany does for her euro. Declaring INDEPENDENCE but being DEPENDENT on UK is contrary in terms and is unrealistic, as well as being deceptive.",
