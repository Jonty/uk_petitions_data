        "additional_details": "The Ukrainian parliament controlled by President Yanukovych has enacted legislation that clearly infringes upon the Ukrainian people\u2019s right to protest peacefully and curtails their freedom of speech. It is aimed at establishing a dictatorship. This appears to be the latest attempt to suppress the demonstrations in Kyiv without dialogue or compromise.\r\n\r\nPlease introduce personal sanctions against  President Yanukovych and the supporters of his bloody regime, including a ban of entrance to the European Union for Mr. Yanukovych, the members of his government and their families, as well as the MPs responsible for passing the new legislation. We also demand a freeze of European bank accounts affiliated with Mr. Yanukovych and his supporters.\r\n",
