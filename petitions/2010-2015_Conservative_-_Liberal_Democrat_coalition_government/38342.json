        "additional_details": "Genuine concert goers do not get a look in when they want to see their favourite artist as concerts are continually being sold out within hours of tickets going on sale as ticket touts snap up as many tickets as they can. They then list these tickets for sale for extortionate amounts on Internet websites such as Ebay and GetMeIn.\r\nThis petition is to make it illegal to resell concert tickets for more than the face value and to ban online websites from giving the opportunity to ticket touts to list concert tickets for sale at more than their original value.",
