        "additional_details": "Richard Littlejohn, a man who's opinions and hate campaigns have led to public outrage and even the suicide of an innocent person.\r\n\r\nHis latest outburst was to belittle the hard work done by The Sophie Lancaster Foundation to finally put in steps to reclassify hate crimes.\r\n\r\nHis belief is that the whole thing is a joke and that it should not happen. In his article he also used a lot of offensive stereotypes to try and justify his outburst.\r\n\r\nHis journalism style is far from reader friendly and many people feel he should be removed from the daily mail.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for his articles to be removed from the web, an apology made to everybody he has hurt and that donations be made to the family of the innocent person he drove to suicide and to the sophie Lancaster Foundation.\r\n\r\nEnough is enough,  this man needs to be silenced.
