        "additional_details": "I am writing this petition to make the Government realise that people aged 70 and over need to be re-tested on their driving skills.\r\n\r\nMany people fall victim to death each year as OAP's manage to hit into the victim. I recently read an online article (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1355502/A-real-princess-smiling-First-picture-teenage-girl-killed-pensioner-lost-control-car.html) giving details on a young female's tragedy as an OAP lost control of their car and swerved into the innocent girl, leading to her unfortunate death.\r\n\r\nThere is another petition similar to this one existing already, however, that petition is asking for a different law to this petition.\r\n\r\nThe Government should take immediate action and make sure people over the age of 70 become tested both mentally and physically regarding their eligibility to be able to drive.",
