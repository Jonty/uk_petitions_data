It took years for us as a country to gain the debts that we have and he is trying to cure the problems all at once. The only people who suffer in this are the low paid and those on benefits. we need him to resign now before we have more homeless people, deaths from people not being able to heat their homes and children starving.\r\nPLEASE SIGN NOW.\r\n",
