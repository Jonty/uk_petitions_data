Allow us to petition for a 'Worldwide Remembrance Day' for animals that have been killed or have passed away so that they will never be forgotten.\r\n\r\nSeptember is the month for World Animal Remembrance and the date we would like is the 4th of September.  We ask you, the government to allow us that date on the English calendar as OUR DAY.  We also want to petition for the right to lay a Himalayan Blue Poppy Wreath (our companies emblem) in remembrance on the 11th of the 11th every year.\r\n\r\nWe are petitioning for a calendar day, a day where all of the wonderful animals that have passed away due to abuse, natural disasters, natural causes, in the line of duty or illness can be commemorated and cherished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
