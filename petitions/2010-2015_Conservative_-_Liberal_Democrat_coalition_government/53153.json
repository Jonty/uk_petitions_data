        "additional_details": "Hedgehogs are in serious decline in the UK.\r\n\r\nOne recent factor is that new housing developments often use gravel boards to surround gardens which exclude wildlife such as hedgehogs from gaining access. A hedgehog needs to traverse around 12 gardens a night to forage.\r\n\r\nA simple change could be made in new developments requiring a 4\" ground level gap in at least one gravel board per garden to allow hedgehogs to travel between gardens",
