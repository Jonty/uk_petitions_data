        "additional_details": "Prison sentences for people who post grossly offensive comments or so-called jokes on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are an affront to the concept of freedom of expression in a democratic society. In fact, such people should not even be prosecuted.\r\n\r\nWe do not condone their actions. But in a free, open and democratic society people must be free to say distasteful things just as they are free to criticise and satirise people in authority.\r\n\r\nWe ask the government to amend section 127 of the Communications Act 2003, or otherwise to legislate, issue guidance or to take other effective action to exclude postings on social networking sites from prosecution for being \u201cgrossly offensive\u201d. Postings which incite criminal behaviour or threaten others with criminal behaviour should continue to be criminalised.\r\n",
