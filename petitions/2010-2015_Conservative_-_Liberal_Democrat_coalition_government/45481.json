        "additional_details": "We call on HM Government to raise the minimum voting age in the UK to 50. We believe that:\r\n\r\nUntil one\u2019s semi-centenary, one lacks sufficient life-experience to contribute to this country\u2019s governance \u2013 and to extend the franchise to those with little stake in society encourages irresponsible decision-making.\r\n\r\nThere is no great desire among our juniors to vote \u2013 two-thirds of under-25s do not vote in general elections \u2013 and politicians are therefore wasting time and taxes by currying favour with them.\r\n\r\nThis measure would show the Government is serious about representing the major stakeholders in British society. (The over-50s hold seven-eighths of the country\u2019s wealth.)\r\n\r\nAnd with six million people aged between 50 and 60 in the UK \u2013 a figure growing by 800,000 a year \u2013 this proposal would receive a warm welcome from modern Britain\u2019s biggest and most influential demographic sector.",
