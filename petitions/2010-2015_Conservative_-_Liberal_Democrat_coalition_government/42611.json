The excuses range mostly from staff shortages which have been going on for months to regular blame on power and anything else they can think up to excuse such poor service.\r\n\r\nResponsible department: Department for Transport\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to insist upon the URGENT removal and replacement of London Midland rail services.\r\n\r\nLondon Midland customers have been faced with daily delays, cancellations, reduction of service, and dangerous overcrowding at stations for months.\r\n\r\nThe level of customer service and communication is appalling and the constant delays and cancellations to the service are not only incredibly inconvenient but also likely to cause accidents at heavily overcrowded stations and platforms.",
