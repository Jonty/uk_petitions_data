Those not in the NEET group may decide when to do their National Service. Those in the Neet group should do it as soon as they are classified as NEET. This would save the Government money, in the long term, put the general publics mind at rest and give youngsters something to focus on and teach them that benefits need to be earned.\r\n\r\nNational Service should to be looked into by the Home Office and voted on in Parliment.\r\n\r\n",
