This can be unfair to the honest responsible motorists that take extra care on the road,\r\nCar insurance should be made affordable for people. As a consequence the number of uninsured drivers and fraudulent policies are likely to decrease.\r\nA survey was carried out in 2013 with 150 people about car insurance and fraudulent policies. 87% of the people claimed they would take out a fraudulent policy in order to afford the insurance premium and a surprisingly 43% claimed they would drive uninsured because premiums cost too much.\r\nYoung drivers are being quoted \u00a310,000 to \u00a315,000 for a car that is not worth a fraction of its price. It is unfair and extortionate. This must stop!",
