        "additional_details": "Under the current legislation, through the Criminal Injury Compensation Authority a victim of sexual abuse cannot claim a penny in compensation because of the ludicrous \"Same Roof Ruling\"?  which stops individuals who were sexually abused in their childhood from claiming financial compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority simply because they lived with their abuser at the time the abuse took place.\r\n\r\nHistoric abuse has got to be recognised and every victim compensated. Victims of abuse had no choice whatsoever when a member of their family \"decided\" to abuse them.  The current ruling states this is so perpetrators of abuse cannot financially gain from any financial payment from the victim of abuse.\r\n\r\n",
