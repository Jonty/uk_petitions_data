The fully costed figures.\r\n\r\nScrap current welfare and pensions budget raises \u00a36375 per UK adult.\r\n\r\nScrap the tax free personal allowance and raise income tax to 50% raises at least another \u00a35000 per UK adult.\r\n\r\nThen pay every UK adult a tax free unconditional basic income of \u00a311375 a year instead and it also means anyone who takes additional paid work will always be better off, solving the \u201cbenefits trap\u201d problem.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to replace income tax with the land valuation tax while raising the same amount in tax revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\nFFI : http://thebigpoliticalparty.wordpress.com/the-unconditional-basic-income-all-your-questions-answered-in-800-words/\r\n\r\nFFI: http://basicincome.org.uk/",
