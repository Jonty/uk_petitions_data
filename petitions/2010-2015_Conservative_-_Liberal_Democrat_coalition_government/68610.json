        "additional_details": "In the UK, it is legal for a woman to abort a baby up to the gestation of 24 weeks - the same age that doctors are willing to fight for these babies to survive.\r\n\r\nAs the mother of a baby boy who was born at 24 weeks and survived, it is my personal mission to see that the abortion limit is decreased to at least 20 weeks. (The youngest baby recorded to have survived being born prematurely was 21 weeks.)\r\n\r\nAlthough abortion is a contentious topic, I think many of us would at least agree that if a baby can survive at 24 weeks, it cannot be considered \"merely\" a fetus. These babies are human beings.\r\n\r\nTherefore it should be illegal to abort a baby that has the capacity to live.",
