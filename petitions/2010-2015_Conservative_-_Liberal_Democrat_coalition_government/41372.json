As a white British male I was not permitted to join any of those groups. I then started a white reading group and was branded a racist.\r\n\r\nMove on 15 years and orginisations such as the \"association of black lawyers\" & \"association of black police officers\" are still very prominent in society.\r\n\r\nHow are these allowed to be in existance when if I was to start a \"white only\" group I would be branded a racist and be forced to close down any website etc?\r\n\r\nIt is orginisations like this that help breed animosity between different ethnic groups leading to resentment.\r\n\r\nYou can not have one rule for one and one for the other.",
