        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition for a lesson in infant basic life support to be given to parents before taking newborn babies home.\r\n\r\nAs a mother of four, one of whom was hospitalised recently due to sleep apnea (a condition in which a baby will stop breathing during their sleep, that has been linked to SIDS) I feel that hospitals should routinely teach parents basic life support before they even leave the hospital with their newborn baby. it'd only take 20 minutes and can give the parents enough knowledge to perform a life saving act should their baby ever stop breathing.\r\n\r\n I was lucky enough to be shown basic life support after my daughters apnea attack but strongly feel that parents should be equipt with the ability to attempt to save their child's life from day one.
