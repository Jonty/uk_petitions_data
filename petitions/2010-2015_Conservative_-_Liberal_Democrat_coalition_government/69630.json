If these games were at a more attractive price The RFU would fill the grounds up and help subsidise the higher graded games.  In turn this would make these matches more accessible to home nation fans and not just businesses, clients and higher net worth individuals.\r\n\r\nThe issue is fairness and these prices are not fair for the normal supporter.  It is a disgrace and it is a sign of greed and RFU ignorance of Rugby development.",
