        "additional_details": "The UK government to submit a proposal to the United Nations for a Humanitarian Relief Project.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is for member states to create a Register to which its citizens can sign up, to provide emergency shelter for those effected in a disaster. Different citizens would be able to provide different services and for different lengths of time. Citizen A is willing to provide a room, to no more than 3 people (Husband, Wife, Child) for a period of 3 - 6 months, Citizen B for 2 Months & the register should reflect these details.\r\n\r\nThe register provides two levels of humanitarian relief, those willing to give up space in their homes to people experiencing a disaster in their own countries & those willing to do so for people involved in international disasters.\r\n\r\nThe relief victims would have access to local facilities like schools, healthcare, social care & the UN could send food/clothing vouchers directly to the refugees cutting costs and being more effective.",
