For some reason this has been increased to a Minimum investment of \u00a3100. This is just silly! These used to be a popular present from grand parents and between young children. WE NEED TO BRING THIS BACK.\r\n\r\n\r\nI propose that the minimum investment rate is dramatically reduced to be able to invest small amounts at any one time.\r\n",
