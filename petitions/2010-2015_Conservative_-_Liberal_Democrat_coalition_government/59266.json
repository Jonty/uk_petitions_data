I think that the law should change so it states that a woman who enters a new relationship with a woman when she is already married to a man should be classed as adultery, even though it is not penetrative sex. It is still an affair, no matter who the person enters a new relationship behind their married partners back. As I find it completely absurd that men have had wives have affairs with women and the men can not divorce their wife on the grounds of adultery. ",
