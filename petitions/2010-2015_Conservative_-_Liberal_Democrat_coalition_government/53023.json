        "additional_details": "A lot of the questions on the theory test are very wrong, very dangerous and some are irrelevant. question 2 asks about someone with a broken arm? What has this got to do with learning to drive?, there are quite a few questions like this, they are people learning to drive, if they wanted to be a paramedic they would take the relevant training, some of the other questions were even worse, this needs to be sorted, we all wonder why our young drivers don't drive so well, it's because they are not being tested on driving. The test urgently needs to be re-written, with every question relevant.",
