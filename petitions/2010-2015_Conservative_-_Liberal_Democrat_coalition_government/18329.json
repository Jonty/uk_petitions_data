        "additional_details": "The UK has one of the lowest holiday entitlements for workers in Europe and I believe the longest working weeks. The workers of this country work very hard and deserve to be able to spend more time with family, or just having a life outside of the workplace. I would like the UK government to increase the number of holiday days a worker has to between 35-43 days a year like France and Spain have.",
