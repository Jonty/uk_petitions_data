        "additional_details": "I would like the government to introduce legislation that non UK nationals must take a UK LGV (Heavy/Large Goods Vehicle) test before they are allowed to work driving Heavy Goods Vehicles on British roads. I believe the standard of a substantial number of these drivers is well below what British drivers are expected to attain before gaining an LGV license. This would stop the loophole where some overseas people can get an LGV license in their country by simply passing a test with a trailer behind a car! Please help keep our roads safe. ",
