        "additional_details": "We demand the PM launches an inquiry into why people are turning to foodbanks as demand for emergency supplies continues to surge.\r\n\r\nMore than 350,000 people received a three-day food package from the Trussell Trust between April and September, three times as many as the same period last year.\r\n\r\nSome food bank recipients are so poor they have returned produce that needs cooking because they cannot afford the electricity to heat it up.\r\n\r\nGovernment appears to regard foodbank use as normal practice when in reality people should be able to afford to buy food and afford to pay for the gas/electricity to heat it up.\r\n\r\nIt is completely unacceptable that in the seventh wealthiest nation on the planet, the number of people turning to foodbanks has tripled.",
