        "additional_details": "Many local councils have made parking bays smaller to accommodate more bays. This in itself is at odds with large family cars. However, even drivers of the smallest cars now find it difficult, if not impossible, to get babies and toddlers in and out of cars whilst parked in the bay. I call on all local councils to designate end parking bays as parent and child, both for the safety of those concerned and to encourage families to visit local shopping areas, many of which are in decline.",
