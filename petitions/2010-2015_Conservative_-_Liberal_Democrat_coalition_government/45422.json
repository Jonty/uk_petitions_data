        "additional_details": "The mad rush for the HS2 project is being fuelled by sentiment and sound bites which have no basis in reality.\r\nThe DfT has knowingly fabricated the supporting evidence for HS2, using every outdated figure and model available to them. As a result, they have presented a grossly inflated business case which doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny. The costs are too great and the value for money of the project is far too low at a time of supposed austerity. The projected job figures are simply wishful thinking and all the evidence shows that London will be where any economic benefits are found.\r\nEnvironmentally HS2 is a disaster threatening at least 350 unique habitats, 50 ancient woodlands, 30 river corridors, 24 Sites of Special Scientific Interest and hundreds of other important areas which cannot be replaced.\r\nHS2 would have significant social impacts, uprooting householders and devastating communities without proper compensation.\r\nHS2 is simply a vanity project and must be cancelled.",
