        "additional_details": "I would like the government to pass a law that states where a work entered the Public Domain in its non-EEA country of origin before 1997, Eritrea for example, then it should automatically enter the UK Public Domain as though we still followed the Berne Convention Comparison of Terms from 1956 to 1996. This would clear up all the confusion as to what's legal and what isn't as we would only have to check the status of the work we'd like to use, and not have to think about what year it entered the Public Domain.",
