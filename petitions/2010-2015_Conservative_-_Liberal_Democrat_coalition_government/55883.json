        "additional_details": "After the trial of Janet Hewitt,I would like the government to stop trumped up charges. Ms Hewitt has given her life teaching children to swim. We want her to continue. \"A 69-year-old swimming coach who's been teaching kids for 51 years is facing a ban after being convicted of assaulting a child. Janet Hewitt denied the charge that she grabbed a 10-year-old and shouted to get changed, but  found guilty after a trial.Magistrates gave Mrs Hewitt six-month conditional discharge.She was accused of bruising the child's arm.But she insists any marks were due to the girl running into her \u2013 which were backed up by a witness. She said I was kneeling down and she bumped into me. She knocked me over.Then the mother accused me of grabbing hold of the girl's arm. The child told prosecutors that Mrs Hewitt grabbed her arm and shouted loudly.Another child said she saw the girl come around the corner and bump into Mrs Hewitt.The conviction means Mrs Hewitt won't be able to volunteer with children.",
