        "additional_details": "Ofcom has indicated that the 700MHz band should be reallocated from Freeview to mobile broadband by 2022, http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/consultations/700MHz/statement/700-mhz-statement.pdf . This would mean a massive retuning exercise and the probable ending of the extra HD channels recently introduced to about 70% of the population. This change would probably necessitate rendering a lot of equipment obsolete and cause a lot of confusion to those who don't understand TV technology. This petition calls on the Secretary of State to overrule Ofcom and preserve the current Freeview transmission frequencies for the foreseeable future.",
