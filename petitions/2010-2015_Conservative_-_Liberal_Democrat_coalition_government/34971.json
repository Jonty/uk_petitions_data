        "additional_details": "It is time that we changed the age at which children start formal education, or at very least to consider how the current education system affects the youngest who attend reception class at age 4.  The current system was introduced because of the industrial revolution and the need to protect children from deprivation.  We need to understand that this archaic system does not fit with the ever changing culture children have to contend with on a daily basis.  That is influenced by the media, advertising and technological advances.\r\n\r\nWe need to allow children the time to play and experience first hand experiences without the constraints of the current top down system in place.  Using affective pedagouges we can teach children at an age appropriate level, improve their chances in latter life and most importantly allow them to be children and build lasting happy memories which will build their self-esteem and confidence.\r\n\r\n",
