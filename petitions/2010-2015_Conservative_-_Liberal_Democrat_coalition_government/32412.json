We also reject the idea of the content of calls, emails, and website visits being looked at, if a warrant is granted.\r\n\r\nWe feel that these proposals, similar to those proposed in 2006, are an infringement of civil liberties, that goes beyond the steps needed to stop terrorism and crime.\r\n\r\nWe respectfully request that the proposals are withdrawn immediately, and that they do not feature in any future government legislative agenda.\r\n\r\n",
