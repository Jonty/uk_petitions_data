        "additional_details": "Road traffic accidents are one of the most prolific causes of death in the UK, particularly amongst the young.  Reducing the speed limit on all residential roads from 30mph to 20mph could save many lives, whilst not adding significant times to journeys.  We, the undersigned, call on the Government to reduce the default speed limit on residential roads to 20mph.
