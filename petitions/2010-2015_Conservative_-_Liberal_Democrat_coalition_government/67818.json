        "additional_details": "Changes to Road Fund Duty mean that from October 1 2014, when a car is sold mid month the seller cannot reclaim their payment for the remainder of the month and the buyer must pay from the start of that month, hence the government is paid twice for the month where a car is sold.\r\n\r\nThis mostly applies to private sales and penalises people who own cheaper cars and are less able to afford to pay the double tax.\r\n\r\nThe action we request is that the remaining fee (to the end of the month) that has been paid by the seller is automatically transferred to the buyer giving them time to arrange their RFD and not to pay a second time for that month.",
