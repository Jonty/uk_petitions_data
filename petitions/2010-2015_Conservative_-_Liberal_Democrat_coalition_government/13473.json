        "action": "Stop publicly owned banks from banning use of rival ATMs ",
        "additional_details": "In the wake of news that Lloyds TSB and the Royal Bank of Scotland are to introduce bans on use of rival ATM machines, it is requested that the people of Britain support this petition to ensure that the matter is discussed by members of parliament with a view to reversing this decision. In a move which is likely to affect thousands of Britain's poorest people and those with less privileged accounts, Government intervention is most certainally required as these and many parent banks including the likes of Natwest are state owned. Public money was used to bail these banks out, it is therefore only fair that the public get thier say in the matter.",
