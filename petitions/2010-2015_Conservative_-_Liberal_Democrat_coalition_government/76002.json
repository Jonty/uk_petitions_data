The government is now embarking on suppressing the fundamental rights of the people including their rights to peaceful protests and freedom of expression. This is a recipe for the return of violence, thereby threatening our fragile peace your government helped us to achieve.\r\n\r\nWe request the intervention of the British government to impress on the APC government to reinstate the VP and uphold the constitution.
