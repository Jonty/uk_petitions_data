        "additional_details": "The government must re- introduce national service for all young adults leaving school who are not going to study in University. This will encourage our youth to further their education or to take part in supporting their nation and help shape their future by gaining life and work experience.\r\nLike some other nations, national service needn't just be military based but could also include health care work, basic security or community/ council based activities.\r\nThere are too many young adults in Britain with no outlook on life that have lost the will to strive for a better, law-abiding future. As a Nation, the adults of the future need to learn and gain self discipline and morals.\r\nNot only will this create jobs for Britain but will also give even the most hard up youth a sense of responsibilty and trust to continue on in their lives.
