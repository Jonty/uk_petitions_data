        "additional_details": "Parking concessions for disabled people with complex mobility issues are vital for their independence and ability to participate in everyday life.\r\n\r\nDisabled people with tax exempt vehicles, who are currently entitled to park for free in many local authority car parks, rely on their nil disabled tax disc to prove to traffic wardens they do not have to pay parking charges. DVLA\u2019s decision to abolish paper tax discs makes this impossible and traffic wardens cannot check the tax exempt status of vehicle license plates against the DVLA database online.\r\n\r\nThe cost of setting up local solutions is being foisted on local authorities and as a result many will cease to offer the concession altogether.\r\n\r\nMany of those currently eligible for concessions will be impoverished by the introduction of parking charges.\r\n\r\nDVLA should immediately restore the paper tax disc for disabled drivers of tax exempt vehicles.\r\n",
