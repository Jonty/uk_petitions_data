        "additional_details": "It has become apparent that within the last few years the Government/Ofsted has encouraged Childminders to increase their fees to the minimum wage.  However this now means the majority of parents cannot afford to work. It has become not cost effective.  I feel this one deciding factor has had a huge impact on the workforce and unemployment.\r\n\r\nI used to be a Childminder myself,  and I used to only charge about \u00a31.80-2.00 per hour per child. But I did have approximatly 4 children. I understood that this means that parents can at least bring home some/half of their income.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned believe the Government should a) Make it easier/cheaper for childminders to register\r\nb) Encourage Childminders to reduce fees to a maximum of \u00a32.00 per hour.",
