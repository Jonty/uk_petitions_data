Either all drivers should have a box fitted or just new drivers.  Monitoring the data would be a huge task and expensive but with suitable fines (as well as punishment) levied on those who speed; the system should be created to pay for itself.  The main reason for this radical action is to try and save the 3000 people that are killed on our roads each year, the 28,000 who are seriously injured \u2013 such as brain damage, paralysis, loss of limbs, severe burning or facial disfigurement and the 218,000 that sustain minor injuries.  (2007 Figures obtained from Brake.org.uk).  The true cost of these deaths and injuries is far reaching that can run throughout an effected family, costing the health services and economy \u2013 for me it\u2019s always action not reaction life\u2019s too precious .",
