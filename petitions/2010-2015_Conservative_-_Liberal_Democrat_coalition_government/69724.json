        "additional_details": "10% of the Scottish electorate are English, yet only 1% of the English electorate are Scottish. By excluding the English electorate from Scotland over the Scottish issue of independence in the referendum, then we have a victory for Scottish Independence. The Westminster government stated that the referendum was an issue for Scotland to decide, yet when it appeared that the vote might not be what Westminster wanted (in a poll a few days prior to the voting day), innumerable 'celebrities' and English politicians waded in to give their opinion on this 'purely Scottish issue'. Shame on all the Westminster parties and on all those south of the Scottish border who had the audacity to try to influence something that does not concern them. The divide between Scotland and England now runs deeper than ever. The old wound inflicted on us (which was inflicted by an act of economic engineering 307 years ago) has been re-opened by the sheer arrogance of the English bully boys. Welcome to England.",
