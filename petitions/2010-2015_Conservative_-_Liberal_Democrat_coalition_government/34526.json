        "additional_details": "Why is it that you only qualify for a Police Jubilee Medal from the Queen if you've got 5 years service? We all work the same hours, attend the same jobs and get paid by the Government regardless of the number of years we've been employed.  It seems very unfair that the younger in service are not being honoured like everyone else for the very hard job that we do.  It shouldn't matter what length of service we have, we should all be acknowledged regardless.  It might only be a medal but its the principle of the matter!",
