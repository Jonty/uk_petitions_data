        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, do not want the Government to implement the Leveson recommendations, nor to give the state any role in press regualtion.\r\nThe UK is proud to boast of its free press.  We, the undersigned, believe that any democracy must protect that freedom to the utmost.  We do not want to join such countries as Syria; North Korea; and Zimbabwe in giving the state a role in controlling of the press.\r\nEvery decent citizen feels sympathy with the parents of Milly Dowler; Madeleine McCann and others.  But what happened to them was a breach of the law.  People have now been arrested, and so they ought.\r\nLord Leveson is wrong.  If politicians get their hands on the press, if they are allowed to control, in an way, what the press does it will be a disaster.  It will be the stories of MPs and the establishment misbehaving and corruption in high places that do not appear.",
