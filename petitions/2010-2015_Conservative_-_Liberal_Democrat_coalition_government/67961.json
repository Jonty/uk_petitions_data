        "additional_details": "The flag of Palestine is to fly atop of Preston Town Hall, after Councillors approved a request from the Palestinian campaign group 'Children of the Ghetto'.\r\n\r\nCouncillor Peter Rankin, Leader of Preston City Council, said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are flying the flag in solidarity of the people of Gaza who are locked in a bitter and long lasting conflict with Israel.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs well as the military conflict, there is also a blockade that is having a devastating effect on the people living in Gaza, causing un-necessary hardship and misery. By flying the flag we can raise awareness of the suffering of the people of Gaza and have empathy for them.\"\r\n\r\nThis is clearly an act of taking an anti Israel stance. It has to be condemned!!!\r\nSince when do councils pick sides??",
