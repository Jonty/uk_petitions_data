        "additional_details": "Ealing Hospital is set to lose its A&E and if this goes ahead the likelihood is that it will then lose its maternity unit and children\u2019s services in increasingly desperate efforts to save money by healthcare officials in NHS London. All of these changes have been rushed through as a result of the coalition government\u2019s Health Bill just recently signed into law which aims to knock \u00a320 billion off the bill for paying for the NHS.\r\n\r\nWith more than 100,000 people each year being admitted to Ealing A&E, and surrounding acute services stretched beyond their capacity, health campaigners claim this will have a catastrophic effect on patients in the Borough. Two other local A&E units are also set to close, these will most likely be those at Hammersmith and Charing Cross, as Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust struggles to pay off its \u00a340m debt. The irony is that Ealing is one of the very few financially viable trusts, yet it will be destroyed by these plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
