        "additional_details": "The number of families claiming child benefit for huge families has increased significantly recently.  There are many shows on TV which show this.  These parents do not care how much they cost the taxpayer and want to carry on having children.  The argument for increasing the population to look after the elderly no longer applies as we are now vastly overpopulated.  therefore, the erstwhile should no longer pay for children after a 2nd child.  This rule should come into force immediately so that if anyone after 9 months  from now had a 3rd child the get no extra benefit.  This ensures that people know it s being enforced so cannot say that the child is in poverty, they know it Is coming.",
