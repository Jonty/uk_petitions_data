They have seized that opportunity, enjoying a vibrant and detailed discussion about what they want their country to be. But people in the rest of the UK have not had that chance. South of the Scottish border, there has been no great conversation about our future, or which powers should lie at which level of government.\r\n\r\nWE need to have that conversation!\r\n\r\nThis is a call to everyone to join my campaign that will ensure that your vote WILL count, and your voice WILL be represented at the seat of government.\r\n\r\nNot too long ago, we had the opportunity in a UK wide referendum to change the electoral system from one hat nearly always returns a government that does not represent the majority of those that voted, to one that is not much better.\r\n\r\nJoin me and have a say in our future.",
