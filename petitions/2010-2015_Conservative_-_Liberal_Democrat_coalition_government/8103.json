We demand that the government takes immediate effective action to return law and order to our inner city areas.\r\nRiots need riot control measures and the use of rubber bullets / baton rounds, water cannon and tear gas should be authorised.  Emergency powers should be introduced including curfews and the use of the military forces.\r\nIt is not acceptable that our police officers should be under attack and unable to defend themselves.  Give them the tools and the power to restore order.  Stop this situation now.\r\n",
