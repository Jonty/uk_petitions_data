        "action": "Funding for Halogen Spotlight Replacements",
        "additional_details": "The Government has made significant progress in phasing out the use of traditional tungsten bulbs in domestic settings.\r\n\r\nHowever, many homes and flats now have significant numbers of 20-50 W halogen spotlights. This means that a small room can now have upwards of 300 W of lighting. This is a terribly backward step, and not in keeping with the UK's energy saving aims.\r\n\r\nWhilst more energy efficient products are available, their cost is significant because properties often have multiple fittings. This petition requests that the government acts quickly to fund the change to more appropriate equipment such as LEDs.\r\n\r\nThis should be long before the current 2016 target for new minimum efficiency levels for halogen lamps.",
