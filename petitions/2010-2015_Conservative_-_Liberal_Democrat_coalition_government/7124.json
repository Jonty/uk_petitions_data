        "additional_details": "DfT to sponsor this idea:\r\nBuild HS2 to Channel Tunnel size & put fast car and lorry shuttle trains on it, in addition to passenger trains.  Vehicle loading site at each city.  This will:\r\n- open HS2 to the masses, not just business class travellers;\r\n- spread benefit of HS2 to towns around the cities - wider sphere of influence - a person can drive to the train, go to another city & drive 50 miles to a meeting;\r\n- allow car users to go direct to France on holiday without having to drive to Kent;\r\n- allow a lorry from France to deliver to Scotland in 1 day with 1 driver - the driver sleeps on the train;\r\n- reduce CO2 & motorway congestion from Kent to Scotland;\r\n- reduce foreign lorry driver miles on UK roads;\r\n- not cost much more at this early stage of the project - re-use the 3 CT boring machines that were kept;\r\n- improve HS2 business case.\r\nIf HS2 is to be made, make it accessible to all.  We have only this 1 opportunity to make a decent large gauge railway in the UK.",
