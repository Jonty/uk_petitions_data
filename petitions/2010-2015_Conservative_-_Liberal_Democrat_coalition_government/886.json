        "additional_details": "What about nationalising some British manufacturing industries before we have none to talk about?  It cost a few \u00a3billions (at most) to support British manufacturing industries that have countless beneficial effects to UK plc, compared to several hundered of billions or even trillions of pounds to support banking as well as lining the pockets of  directors of banks. Why can't the British government invest in the space and shipping industry like the USA and South Korea respectively?  How about land reclamation as in Holland? Defence will also be good investments (like for missiles, stealthy dromes, carrier launch Typoons, etc). British car manufacturers like Jaguar, Land Rover, MG, Mini are now in foreign ownership. This is giving away British car technology, know-how and manufacturing technologies wholesale abroad. Why can\u2019t the government invest into research & development on British companies before they have foreign owners and have the many of the available jobs shipped abroad?",
