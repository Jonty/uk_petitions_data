We hope this is helpful.\r\n\r\nNHS Trusts continue to demonstrate that they cannot be trusted to use the money handed over to them for the purpose it was intended.  Recent publicity about a model obtaining a breast augmentation (which was then reversed by the NHS) at taxpayer expense while children suffering debilitating and horrible illnesses have treatment denied by the very same NHS Trust is a perfect example.  This is going on because managers are allowed to decide what is paid for and there is no interested party oversight of the procedures.  THIS SITUATION NEEDS TO BE RECTIFIED BY THE APPOINTMENT OF TAXPAYERS FROM THE AREA TO A FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT PANEL TO CONTROL WHAT NHS FUNDING IS SPENT ON IN THEIR AREA.",
