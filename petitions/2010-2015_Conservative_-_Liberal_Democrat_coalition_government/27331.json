Goverments should be forced to be more transparent as David Cameron has promised and I propose that each goverment should have to publish an independant  detailed set of accounts showing how much tax has been raised, in what manner and how it has been spent/ allocated and what future commitments they have committed the British taxpayer to 6 months prior to re-election. The British public will then have the correct information needed on how to debate any anomolies/issues and vote accordingly.",
