        "additional_details": "Hold a debate to find a way to close the National Insurance loophole, whereby large companies can register an office outside the UK in order to avoid paying Employers National Insurance. The employees still have to pay thier NI contributions, so why not the company. This is not only unfair towards smaller companies, it is also damaging to the UK finances due to the fact many millions of pounds are not going into the coffers.",
