If they do not work three days a week (for a good enough reason) they should not get benefits.\r\n\r\nThis would help to get rid of the 'claiming benefits rather than getting employment' mentality, whilst also giving the individual time to (two days per week) to attend interviews.\r\n\r\nThe three days work should be flexible and not be allowed to carry over into the following week.  No work, no pay.\r\n\r\nThis would also give the indivdual some experience to add to their CV, reduce the amount the UK has to pay in benefits and lift the mood of all the taxpayers out there that are sick of paying for these individuals to sit back and watch Jeremy Kyle (on their looted flat-screens) whilst we all have to go to work and pay higher taxes to help get our country out of a recesion.\r\n\r\n",
