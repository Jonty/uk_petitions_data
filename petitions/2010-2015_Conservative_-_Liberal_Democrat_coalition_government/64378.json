        "additional_details": "Many mothers who continue breastfeeding past 6 months are approached with stigma & \"extended\" (full term) breastfeeding is seen as taboo. Changing NHS guidelines to match those advised by the WHO will help rid the UK of this stigma & may help raise our country's poor breastfeeding rates.\r\n\r\nCurrent NHS guidelines: Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for around the first 6 months of your baby's life. After that, giving your baby breast milk alongside other food will help them continue to grow & develop.\r\n\r\nWHO guidelines: Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended up to 6 months of age, with continued breastfeeding along with appropriate complementary foods up to two years of age or beyond.\r\n\r\nWHO guidelines are much clearer, & stating \"up to two years of age or beyond\" reduces the stigma & taboo of full term breastfeeding. All heath professionals agree that milk is of utmost importance to a child's development, what better milk to give than human milk.",
