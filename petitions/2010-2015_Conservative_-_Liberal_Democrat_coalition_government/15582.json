        "additional_details": "I want the government to tell the EU that 60W bulbs may be purchased if a person has chosen to use incandescence over alternative lighting methods. If I wish to buy something that cannot be used to cause harm to other people I should be able to do so. Research has linked fluorescent lighting to migraines, the current CFLs do not give full output immediately, and many do not like the colour of the light produced by fluorescent, CFL or LED lights. In addition, many of these alternative light sources should not be used outdoors. Many people prefer the light produced by incandescent bulbs, have livelihoods where good lighting is important, such as mechanics, builders, and artists. Also, many people have older light fixtures that require incandescent bulbs, for example the use of a bayonet fitting. I want the Government to stop mollycoddling British people and give them back the right to a choice.",
