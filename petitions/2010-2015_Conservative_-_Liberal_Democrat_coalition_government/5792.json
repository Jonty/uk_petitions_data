The State's aid system gives the long-term unemployed no reason to start working for minimum wage jobs, which will not allow them to rent.\r\n\r\nI implore the Coalition to make it mandatory for the long-term unemployed to work voluntarily for the good of their local community for two days a week, allowing them to look for work for the remaining three.",
