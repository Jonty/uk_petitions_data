        "additional_details": "Not all train stations have access for wheelchair users or people with prams. There should be at least one station that provides access for BOTH types of users to enable them to get the train. Two stations in Salford, Eccles & Patricroft do not offer either and there are no other stations close by for people to use. They offer a taxi service for wheelchair users but absolutely nothing for people with prams. Northern Rail have said they do not hold responsibility for pram users therefore are not prepared to change. There are many people across the country not just in Manchester who are suffering because of this. We should have more help, instead of being singled out for pushing a pram!",
