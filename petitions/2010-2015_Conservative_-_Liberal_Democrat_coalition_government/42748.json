        "additional_details": "Background (Preamble):\r\nThe post-revolution Egyptian draft constitution was recently passed to Mr. Mohamed Morsy, nine days after he has issued a decree that granted him extraordinary powers. In turn this was put to a nationwide referendum despite the abstaining of the liberals and the Church body, represented by members from three different denominations, from voting on the draft since it violates all laws of human rights, inhibits freedom of speech, and undermines the legal system within the country.\r\nPetition:\r\nWe the undersigned call for the British Government to: 1) Apply pressure on Mr. Morsy to withdraw the decree and to stop the referendum on the draft; 2) Pressurise Mr. Morsy to permit elite members of the high constitution court to draft the new constitution before putting it to a nationwide referendum. In the interim period the temporary constitution from the 19th of March 2011 should be avowed.\r\n",
