        "additional_details": "Many taxi drivers in the south Gloucestershire area have been mugged, beaten up or attacked. South Gloucestershire taxi drivers are not allowed safety partitions in their taxis as south Gloucestershire council does not allow it. Considering the amount of people taxi drivers pick up & the sort of people get in their cars i would of thought taxi driver safety was most important. I know many taxi drivers that have been attacked in the yate area. These guys work hard to provide a service day & night. They need a partitions in their cars to keep them safe. Please sign the more signatures we get the more chance of getting this changed.",
