        "action": "Allow freedom of expression on the internet to the extent that it does not cause physical danger to someone from third parties.",
        "additional_details": "The internet was a designed to allow the sharing of information and thoughts across the world. It is still a place where this can be done, but this is changing quickly. People are being arrested and their lives ruined for making a joke on the internet which is considered offensive by random third parties. Not only is this an infringement on people's freedom of expression, it is also a huge waist of police time due to the fact that police officers are investigating someone calling a person a \"Choc Ice\" instead of arresting rapists, murderers and paedophiles. This has clearly gone too far and the law needs to be changed.\r\n\r\nThis petition is proposing that we allow freedom of expression on the internet to the extent that it does not pose a threat to someone's health or safety from third parties. What this means is that you can say what you like, to the extent that you do not threaten to cause physical harm or damage to the person or their property, or propose third parties do the same.",
