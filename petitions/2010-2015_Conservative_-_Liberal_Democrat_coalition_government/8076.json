        "additional_details": "I push for a National Police force made up of specially trained officers, Armed Forces personnel and Reserve Forces, to be made to combat violence as seen recently in the riots, as-well as other serious crime incidents where violence is a prominent factor. This would mean that a Force can be deployed to help specific areas without having to borrow officers from other local forces. (Eg, the Met borrowing Kent officers for the night of the 09/08/11). To confirm, I propose this to be a separate force to other local forces, almost a mirror of the French \"Police Nationale\"    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Nationale and the \"Gendarmerie\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarmerie\r\n\r\nI also push for local polices forces to be armed with Handguns as standard, with the National Police to mainly be used as a riot force aswell as being armed with Rifles/Sub Machine guns.\r\n\r\n",
