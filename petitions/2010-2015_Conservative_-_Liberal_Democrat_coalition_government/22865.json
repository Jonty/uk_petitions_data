        "additional_details": "This countries workforce is bending over backwards to pay of the Bankers debt and need to be repaid for their efforts. This petition is to mandate the government to provide a clear exit strategy to the austerity measurers they have introduced. Without such a commitment, when the debt burden diminishes they will start handing out our money to all and sundry in an effort to regain political status. The government must pay back their domestic creditors first in the form of tax rebates for those who pay tax.",
