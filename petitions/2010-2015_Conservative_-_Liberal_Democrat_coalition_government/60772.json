DH has decreed that only those who are 70 or 79 can receive it - those between 71 and 78 will have to wait until they reach 79. This is discriminatory and far from cost effective. It also lacks logic since they have also decreed that it is ineffective for those over 80. This policy needs to be abandoned immediately.  ",
