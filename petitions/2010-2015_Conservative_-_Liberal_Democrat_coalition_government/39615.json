The only people who can trully understand the illness are people who suffer from this condition.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to set up support groups (ie from doctor surgeries, community centres, internet etc) across the country where sufferers can get together and help each other through the illness. Alot of people do not know much about the illness but it is not a joke. It can lead to further mental health conditions and some cases can lead to suicide or attempted suicide.",
