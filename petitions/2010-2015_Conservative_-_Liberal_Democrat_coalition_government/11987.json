Why are hard working people paying taxes to provide sky tv, playstations and \"fancy\" meals for prisoners? We need an overhaul of the Human rights act to ensure that prisons become a place that is feared, not seen as a great holiday spot! We spend too much time and money protecting the rights of criminals, they gave up their rights when they commited these crimes!",
