        "additional_details": "In the wake of the death of Mark Duggan on Thursday 4th of August, Tottenham erupted in violence on the evening of Saturday 6th. By Sunday it had spread to Brixton. Monday saw Lewisham and Clapham Junction similarly engulfed. It is clear that the Metropolitan Police Service, in particular, and the West Midlands Constabulary have been over-stretched whilst doing an admirable job of trying to contain the violence.\r\n\r\nOn Monday 8th, Theresa May \u2013 the Home Secretary \u2013 described the riots as \u2018sheer criminality\u2019 and said that those responsible will be brought to justice. Impressive sounding rhetoric it may be, but how can the government be \u2018tough on crime\u2019 if it is cutting 16,200 officers, 16,100 civilian staff and 1,800 PCSOs over the next four years (source: HMIC, \u2018Adapting to Austerity\u2019, 2011)? Public Order policing will also inevitably be impacted on.\r\n\r\nThese cuts are endangering public safety - perhaps absolute numbers should actually be increasing.\r\n",
