        "additional_details": "We the undersigned feel it is unfair that our children have to go without free nursery places for 2yr olds because we choose to work but still are on a low income.\r\n\r\nWe ask the government to address the following:-\r\n\r\n1- that free child nursery placed for 2yr olds are available for all children who's parents work but are on a low income and not just those on benefits. Decided by the way of means testing incomes\r\n2- that our children aren't penalised because we choose to work instead of claiming benefits even though the money value is pretty much the same\r\n3- that our children don't miss out on essential social skills and development which the would receive should they be given free nursery places.\r\n\r\nParents that work and who are on a low income should be allowed the free places for their children.\r\nMy child is missing out on 1 year of social skills and learning because we choose to work and earn. Lets make working pay!!",
