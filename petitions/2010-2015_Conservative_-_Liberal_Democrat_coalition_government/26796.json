        "additional_details": "The prohibition and regulation of controlled substances should be based on science and evidence, rather than tradition, media pressure or the personal opinions of politicians. This petition calls for the UK Government to base its drugs policy on extensive research into the relative cost/benefit potential of a given substance - whether medical, psychological or societal; to properly consult the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and to fairly hear and act upon the evidence it presents; and to not push through reactionary bans on substances for which there is limited or no evidence of harm.",
