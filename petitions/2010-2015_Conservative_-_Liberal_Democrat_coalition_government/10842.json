All benefits claimants must be made to give at least 16 hours a week of their time unpaid to local community projects, charity work or any work available at their local council. That will put them on equal footing with the rest of the working population and make them proud of their day to day contribution to society. That will also allow them to be more active, and appreciate the value  and rewards of hard work and earn back the respect of their community for their contribution to society. ",
