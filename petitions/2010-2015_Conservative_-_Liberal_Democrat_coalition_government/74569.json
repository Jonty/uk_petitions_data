How to tax or a mortgage, no clue where to start,  surely this is what we should be taught in our schools?\r\n\r\nHow is it possible that I can tell you what colour magnesium burns but not how to look after my health?\r\n\r\nIf the government can not tell us how it is applicable to people's lives then it should not be mandatory to learn.\r\n\r\nThe solution to the problem? Educate us in things that will actual help us in life, teach us all 30 of our human rights and if a subject doesn't directly help make that subject optional. ",
