        "additional_details": "There is a growing concern over the number of Social Housing schemes being put forward in small villages where the local amenities are not adequate to support the residents of these affordable homes.  When a village does not have a school, shop and post office along with a reliable public transport network it does not represent a suitable place to build affordable homes. We need to realise that for affordable homes to be sustainable it is not just the cost of the rent or mortgage that must be considered, we must also consider whether or not it is affordable to live in a given location when taking into account transport costs, higher cost of living due to lack of mains gas, water, etc, and the lack of amenities in villages.\r\nIt makes far more sense for the development of affordable homes to be concentrated in our towns and cities on previously developed land \u2013 building on brownfield sites or utilising homes which are currently empty.",
