        "additional_details": "The Chancellor is called to answer the question why the Bond Prosperity Plan has been ignored as an alternative economic strategy for the revival of the UK economy.  Drawn up by finance specialist Michael Bond and submitted to the Prime Minister, in October 2010, forwarded to Treasury for action, it offers an alternative strategy to reviving the UK economy at no cost to taxpayers and will:\r\n\r\nsolve the housing crisis, preserve the green belts,\r\nrevive UK manufacturing, create new industries and businesses, raise new income in paying off the national debt, create upto 300,000 jobs in the construction industry alone, reduce our vulnerability to European economic problems and more.\r\n\r\nThe Plan has been submitted to the government and copied to Deputy-PM, Defence, Communities and Business departments, without response.\r\n\r\nWhy has there been no response to this Plan and no interest in the benefits it claims to provide the UK economy at a time of dire austerity?\r\n",
