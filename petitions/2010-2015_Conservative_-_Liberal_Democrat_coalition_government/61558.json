        "additional_details": "I think it is about time to revise the justice system in this country. It doesn't work and is costing the government a lot of money keeping people in prisons and juvenile centres. My main concern with my partition is to take a look into the reinstatement of the 'Death Penalty' for serious cases of illegal activity, examples include:\r\n-Rape\r\n-Child Abuse\r\n-Murder\r\n-Terrorism\r\n\r\nCorporal punishment is another case of law that should be reviewed. I believe a referendum should be sent out for both cases. It is time to sort out this country... WE ARE TO SOFT!!!!\r\n",
