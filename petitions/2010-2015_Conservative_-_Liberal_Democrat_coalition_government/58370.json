Then they blocked the anti-government sites and I did not speak for fear I would be labeled a radical. Then they blocked the file sharing sites and I did not speak, lest I be labeled a pirate. Then they blocked blogging sites and I could not speak at all.\" - Teract.\r\n\r\nThe process of filtering the internet should be a voluntary one.\r\nThe new system forces the internet service providers to automatically filter websites, this will in time lead to over-blocking, abuse and in many years to come people will become accustom to websites being blocked for their \"safety\".\r\nInternet providers should have an online page for account holders to control the internet filters.\r\nThis would give the customer private control over what the household can view, meaning they can view adult content without having to tell the internet provider what they wish to view.
