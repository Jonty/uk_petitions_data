        "additional_details": "BT Openreach appear to have the monopoly for the provision of telephone and broadband services to all UK providers such as BT, Sky, Talk Talk etc. They appear unaccountable in terms of the service (or lack of service) they provide, they are not contactable, they fail to keep appointments, and do not provide services when stated. They should be given time limits to complete works associated with the provision of a service, with penalties payable if they cannot comply. They should also have a customer service centre to deal with queries and complaints with a documented hierarchy and procedure so that customers are aware of how to escalate a problem. I would like the Government to oversee this and bring competition into the market to create a better service. The recent media article on BBC Watchdog is just the tip of the iceberg and Openreach's woeful performance is affecting people's lives and livelihoods.",
