        "additional_details": "\r\nBritain is better off without the Climate Change Act. We demand an independent review of both the climate science and the economic models used to support the need for this Act and a zero carbon dioxide Britain. This Act and environmentalism have never been democratically tested.\r\n\r\nBritain\u2019s unilateral action on the climate is a futile political gesture, because the UK accounts for less than 2% of global CO2 emissions, our sacrifice will have no meaningful impact on the Global Mean Temperature. The Renewable Obligations and wind farm subsidies must stop, because wind farms despoil Britain\u2019s scenic beauty and require 90% back up by coal and gas power stations - consumers are being ripped off.\r\n\r\nThe proposed Carbon Floor Price will drive 1 in 4 households into fuel poverty and carbon leakage will export jobs to countries without CO2 taxes, green levies and climate legislation.\r\n",
