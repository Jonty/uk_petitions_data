DEFRA said in a report, \"Retrospective analyses have indicated that reliance upon clinical diagnosis alone resulted in over-reporting of FMD, since the\r\npresence of FMDV on 23% of farms designated as infected premises\r\ncould not be corroborated by rRT-PCR, VI or Ag-ELISA.\"\r\nPen-side test kits were availble in 2001 but HMG ignored them. When FMD hits the UK again we must use the pen-side test kit, and further, we MUST VACCINATE. Please support the Petition to vaccinate against FMD in these circumstances.\r\n",
