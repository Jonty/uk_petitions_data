        "additional_details": "I'm asking for your support to get DEFRA to take greater action to prevent the Illegal theft of fish from waters, particularly but not confined to the Fenland/East Anglia regions. For some time now organised gangs have used all manner of illegal methods to target native fish stocks, including the use of set lines, trawl nets and other such illegal boating activities. The ecological balance of many fenland waters have already been critically damaged, this is also having a financial effect on those whose livelyhoods depends on the tourist & sport fishing trades. The laws to prevent such actions are already in place, they just need stronger policing & heavier penalties on conviction. Please support this petition, before our waters are ruined forever.\r\nThank You.",
