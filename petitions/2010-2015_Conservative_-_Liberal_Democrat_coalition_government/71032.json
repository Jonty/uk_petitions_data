        "additional_details": "As an Atheist, I do not believe that after studying different religions and cultures in Religious Education for the past 10 years I should have to continue studying this subject during my GCSE's.\r\n\r\nWhen I contacted the DfE, Elizabeth Truss MP claimed that:\r\n\r\n'The Government firmly believes in the importance of RE to foster understanding among people of different faiths and cultures. That is why it is compulsory for maintained schools and academies to provide RE for all children up to the age of 18 years.'\r\n\r\nThere is the Parental right of withdrawal but as a responsible 15 year old who chose his other option subjects, that I and others should have the right to opt from studying this subject ourselves.\r\n\r\nI am currently in my second year of GCSE's and at the end of it I will have to do an exam for half a GCSE. I feel like many of my peers that this time is wasted and can be spent much more wisely studying and revising for more relevant subjects for our futures.",
