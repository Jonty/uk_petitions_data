        "additional_details": "I, hereby petition the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to allow full time further, and higher education students under the age of twenty-five and over nineteen entitlement to financial support including but not limited to; income support, housing benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance. As it stands, as a full time further education student at the age of twenty-one on commencement of my course, I am not entitled to jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, nor income support, or any other form of benefit as far as I am aware. My course is full time and I work twenty hours a week, yet still I struggle to a high degree to support myself financially. I also petition the government to allow for a reasonable living wage, if the primary petition demands are not met.",
