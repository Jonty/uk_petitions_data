        "additional_details": "This petition aims to help prevent suicides from ALL Bridges in the UK by requesting that our Government finally gets serious about building suicide safety nets & URGENT funding be made available, similar to that approved for the Golden Gate Bridge in the USA, just recently.\r\nOn 10/06/09 my beloved eldest daughter Laura, aged just 20, died by suicide after jumping from the Orwell Bridge.\r\nThe Government appear to be turning a blind eye regarding these horrific tragedies that are occurring far to regularly on many UK Bridge suicide \u2018hotspots,\u2019 (research suggests exact numbers of victims are sometimes difficult to determine, as many jurisdictions & media agencies have ceased collating data & reporting suicides in the belief that the reporting may encourage others?).\r\nNothing will bring back our loved ones but if the Government act now by putting further safety measures in place as a matter of expediency, it could prevent others going through what we are going through.\r\n",
