My suggestion is that anyone convicted of these crimes would be tasked (under strict supervision) to clean up the whole mess they have made and repair the damage they have caused. They would have to wear identifiable clothing whilst doing so, with no extra payments.  Fail to comply would be a custodial sentence.",
