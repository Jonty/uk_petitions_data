        "additional_details": "The Home Office proposes that from April 6th, non-EEA migrants \"coming to the UK make an appropriate financial contribution to the cost of their healthcare\" through the immigration health surcharge which is set at \u00a3200 for all migrants and \u00a3150 for students.\r\n\r\nThe Home Office neglects the fact that non-EEA migrants in employment in the UK already make the said financial contribution through National Insurance. Furthermore despite paying NI, non-EEA migrants have no recourse to public funds.\r\n\r\nWe feel that the immigration health surcharge unfairly penalises migrants already paying NI. We urge the Home Office to exempt NI-contributing migrants from this surcharge.",
