This is clearly stupid and not what the act was designed for.\r\nAs stated above this is wasting huge amounts of police time and money dealing with things that police  used to deal with by telling both parties to pack it in, but cannot because the harassment act and crime recording standards state it must be recorded as a \"crime\", and crimes \"must be investigated fully\".",
