        "additional_details": "'National Insurance' is a misnomer. It is another form of income tax on individuals. For businesses it is a direct cost per employee. There are no funds held by Government earmarked for paying out on insurance claims.\r\n\r\nMaintaining the facade national insurance confuses the electorate and causes them to disengage from political debate. In an age of 'transparency' the Government should remove the label of national insurance and replace it with a better title and so enable a better understanding of taxation levels.  ",
