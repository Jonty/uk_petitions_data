UK taxpayers are the ONLY group of people on the planet who pay for the provision of translators and interpreters for people who choose not to learn the language of the country they are in.  Follow the example of the remainder of the (sensible) countries on the planet and get those who need interpreters and translators in this country to fund it themselves.  It is misappropriation of taxpayer pounds to use them to pay for translators and interpreters for foreigners.",
