It was announced recently that the Treasury has decided that this money (in excess of \u00a320 million) should be given back to the public, to be spent on Community projects. This petition is to request that the money should be used to offset the ever-increasing price of Energy, rather than frittered away. The simplest way would be to give the money back to the producers, with the watchdog ensuring that the customers benefit to the full amount.",
