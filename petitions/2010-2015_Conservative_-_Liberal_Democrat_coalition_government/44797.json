These decisions are being  made by  politicians and civil servants who undoubtedly have private medical insurance.\r\n\r\nThis is happening as the retirement age is being gradually raised to 70, and Doctors deciding if over 70's warrant treatment.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the government to hold a full debate on these practices, and suspend them, unless and until, the public approve them.\r\n\r\n",
