        "additional_details": "Some institutions charge far too much for a single item of fruit.  The price of a single banana, for example, ranges from 19p to 65p along the length of Fenchurch Street with some motorway service stations charging 50p for what is essentially a commodity.\r\n\r\nI propose that the Government imposes a maximum price for single items of fruit to encourage healthy eating and to enable people to purchase more fruit.",
