        "additional_details": "Plastic bags represent a small fraction of the plastics used in packaging products sold in shops. Far more is used in containers for liquids,clear plastic cartons for batteries,small electrical items, printer cartridges etc., and packaged fruit and groceries. Plastic carrier bags are low cost, convenient, and can be reused or recycled  with other plastic waste. It is not true that bags damage  the environment. We ask that the government focusses on more pressing problems such as the potential destruction of the beauty of our countryside by wind farms, solar arrays, HS2. Let us keep our free bags   ",
