        "additional_details": "Customers have been suffering with months of delays and suspensions on the Metrolink. Tram failures and points failures are a daily occurrence now on the Metrolink. We've finally had enough and demand action. The Director, Peter Cushing should be accountable. All Transport for Greater Manchester can offer is an apology. Whilst refunds are offered, I'm sure the people of Manchester would just rather have a system that works as it should. The Metrolink network continues to be expanded but this is just causing more and more problems. The metrolink no longer runs on most weekends due to 'improvement' works, although nobody had actually seen any improvements yet. Various newspapers have reported how awful the Metrolink service is.",
