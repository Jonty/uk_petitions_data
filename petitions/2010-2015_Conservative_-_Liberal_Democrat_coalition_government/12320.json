This is not the reason to have a child.\r\nI would like to see the government remove these financial incentives offered to girls/young women for having a child and offer a 'token for goods' based system instead of actual money. This will mean tokens can only be redeemed against essential baby and child products.\r\n\r\nI would like this matter debating in government.",
