Their graphic evidence is featured on their website. The rabbits are kept in disgusting conditions and subjected to abuse that is beyond words.\r\n\r\nIn the UK, stores such as Tesco and Marks and Spencer are still sourcing products from overseas even though they claim not to 'knowingly' purchase materials gained by illegal practices.\r\n\r\nIf the importation of Angora were banned in the UK, it would help to curb these cruel and inhumane practices.
