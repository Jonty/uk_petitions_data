        "additional_details": "I propose a change to street lighting within the UK.  There are many street lights which not only drown out starlight, but also affect the body clocks of people.  I propose changing the street lights to a more cost effective and energy and light saving like what they have in Arizona.\r\n\r\nBy changing the lights from the yellow to a more energy saving used in the USA it will allow a better view of said \"Night Sky\" and be more cost effective.\r\n\r\nI admit the change will cost more for the UK to implement but in all, the savings will reduce electricity consumption from power stations during the night.  Maybe these lights coupled with Solar panels and internal batteries could save more money when so much is wasted in lighting the night sky.",
