        "additional_details": "I want the government to overrule the judgement that says councils cannot say Christian prayers before a council meeting. Councillors have the right to absent themselves from the prayers if they wish. This gives everyone the chance to make their own decision about whether to be present whilst the prayers are said. Also this council judgement must not alter the law regarding a corporate act of worship in schools. ",
