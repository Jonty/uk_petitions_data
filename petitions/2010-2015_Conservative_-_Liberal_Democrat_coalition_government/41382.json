It's not the dog, it's the owner.\r\n\r\nAll dogs have the right to be in a safe and loving environment.\r\n\r\nIt breaks my heart knowing there are dogs out there not being looked after properly and being beaten by sick people.\r\n\r\nIf you agree with me, please sign. It's about time this was made the law!",
