Thousands of couples in Great Britain cannot have children but desperately wish they could so why doesn't the government sterilise everyone who has has 2 or more children taken away and provide IVF for as long as it takes to either get pregnant or for the couple to no longer wish to go through the emotional and physical effects for free.
