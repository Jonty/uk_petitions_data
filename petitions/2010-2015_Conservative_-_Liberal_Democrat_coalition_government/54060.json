        "additional_details": "The Chief Constables of several forces have pointed out that the wearing of black shirts by police is causing  increasing public agression towards them and at the same time is encouraging aggressive attitudes on the part of the officers.\r\n\r\nMany however seem to prefer to to allow their officers to look and act more like paramilitary militias than British police.\r\n\r\nWhile it can be accepted, albeit grudgingly, that the wearing of stab vests and the carrying of paramilitary style weapons may have become a necessary evil, the conversion of the British bobby to a member of a militia style force must be resisted at all costs.\r\n\r\nThe return to white shirts would be one small step in this direction and remove a source of abhorance, disgust and offence to many for whom European Fascism and the resurgence of the extreme right is not just history.\r\n",
