        "additional_details": "This is a new petition to provide that we, the public of Great Britain believe that live animal exports should be banned or vigorously monitored.\r\nAnimal welfare regards have reached a long time low and drastic re-consideration is needed by the UK Government.\r\nIt is unnecessary to export UK farm animals abroad for slaughter/fattening. I call on you, the UK Government to re-consider:\r\nThe Harbours, Docks & Piers Clauses Act 1847, which makes it illegal to refuse a ship the use of a port if it is carrying out lawful trade. This law must be amended to let port owners refuse, on animal welfare grounds, the export of live farm animals.\r\nEU Regulation 1/2005 on the protection of animals in transport. This must be enforced with determination.\r\nI plead with the Government to update the 1847 Act to reflect changing times and attitudes. We are a civilized nation of animal lovers. This devastating cruelty must stop.",
