        "additional_details": "I believe that both conservative and Labour leaders should go head to head with each other before the election on TV. It has become apparent that this has been a negotiated situation,  without the consultation of the British public in order to suit political ends. We are a democracy and should be part of the process with regards to choosing our next five years, not the end product of what suits a particular political party. The last 50 years has been labour vs conservative and we as an electorate demand a one on one debate.",
