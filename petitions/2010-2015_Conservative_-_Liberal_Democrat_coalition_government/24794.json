By that time all UK Universities were promised to all people that they will be eligible for Post study work after completion of their studies. but unfortunately UKBA changed their policies and introduced new policy which stated that nobody will get PSW after April 2012.\r\n1) Is this fare to me or engineers like me those who came for engineering before Jan 2011 and graduating after April 2012?\r\n2)according to the second provision after april 2012 people will need company letter but the thing is none a single company accepting application without asking candidates visa status. Is this fare act?\r\n3) I read the complete IMECHE document about engineer shortage in UK. many engineers like me facing the same problem after spending \u00a320k to \u00a330k on university study.\r\nPlease take strong steps and keep our faith in UKBA",
