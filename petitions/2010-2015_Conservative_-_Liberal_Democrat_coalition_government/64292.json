        "additional_details": "Temporary & low paid workers employed by recruitment agencies are at times not offered P.A.Y.E. and are forced to use an umbrella payroll company. In many cases workers are not paid enough hourly rate to be able to claim expenses in the first place and as a result unfairly suffer huge deductions from their wages, these deductions include Employers national insurance, umbrella fees and holiday pay gets deducted from their gross earnings.\r\nThe end result is temporary workers get more money taken off their salaries and the company employing them never has to pay their fiscal obligations as they get unfairly passed on to the workers.\r\nI want the government to make all agencies offer temporary workers a fair and ethical alternative to the umbrella payroll at all times.",
