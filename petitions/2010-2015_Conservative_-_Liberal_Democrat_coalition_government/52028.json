        "additional_details": "Every session inside the House of Commons is relevant to the shaping of our country, no matter how dry the subject at hand. But if you watch BBC Parliament, you will find that many MPs are engaging in the use of electronic devices, as opposed to focusing on the session itself; remember they are being paid \u00a360k and over each year by the taxpayer, so we must ensure that our representatives are actually listening to the debates as well as speaking in them. For some MPs, it seems that as soon as they've recited their speeches, they swipe out their iPhones and start blogging (or worse). This freedom isn't always abused, with many MPs simply tweeting to their constituents about the debate's progression. However, one must bear in mind that MPs have plenty of time in their offices to do this, and so this petition aims to ban the use of such devices in the Commons, so that both ministers and back-benchers alike can better their focus on the matters at hand.",
