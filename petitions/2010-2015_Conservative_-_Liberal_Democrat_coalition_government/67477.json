        "additional_details": "UK needs to introduce an extra tax for foreign investors buying up property in London. If the UK government is really serious about long term economic stability they should attract foreign investors to other parts of the UK and not just London. Londoners who currently rent are out priced of the property market and have to move outside sometimes 100 miles or more away and then are forced to commute for hours every day. On the other hand foreign investors just buy up the flats/houses speculatively pushing the prices up. As an example 1 bedroom property in Bromley area was sold for 195k in 2013 and now worth 240k. So to afford even a mortgage on that property salary should have increased by around 13%. I would like to know how many people in London had such an increase in the last year.",
