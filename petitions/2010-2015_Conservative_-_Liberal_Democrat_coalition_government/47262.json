        "additional_details": "At the moment, if you send your children to an independent school, you still have to pay taxes for state education to the government. This petition calls for some of this money to be refunded. If all the children at private schools did go to a state school, many new schools would have to be built and class sizes would be larger, the latter surely making the standard of education poorer.",
