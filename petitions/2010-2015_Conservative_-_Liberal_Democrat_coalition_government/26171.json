Research shows that there is a close relationship between children\u2019s exposure to smoking on TV and take up of smoking.\r\n\r\nAs the rest of the country moves towards becoming smokefree, popular pre- watershed programmes continue to show scene after scene with people smoking, often glamourising it and rarely showing the negative consequences.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to protect children\u2019s health and save lives by removing smoking from pre-watershed programmes.\r\n",
