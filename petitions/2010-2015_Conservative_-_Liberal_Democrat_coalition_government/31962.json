        "additional_details": "Now that gun ownership and use, by government sponsored criminals, extends to machine guns, as evidenced by the shooting in London this weekend, it is time that the honest, innocent people of this land were given the wherewithal to protect themselves.  This is even more pertinent in view of this government's proclivity to removal of the last remnants of law and order through converting all our front line policemen to PCSO.  The people deserve better, and since they are paying for it, it should be made to happen.  Any politician who does not support the right of the people to defend themselves against threats created and nurtured by those same politicians, should resign and put himself up for re-election.",
