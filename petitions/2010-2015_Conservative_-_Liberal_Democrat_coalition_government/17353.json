        "additional_details": "In countries like Germany, doctors are trained in both medicine and holistic health meaning rather than automatically reach for the prescription pad, which often only treats the symptoms, they are much more likely to suggest treatment to stop the problem at it's source.\r\nPrescription costs have risen rapidly in the last few years, partly due to the ageing population but also due to eg anti depressants being handed out like smarties to anyone feeling a bit low and the over prescription of statins for marginally raised cholesterol levels. ( see petition regarding stopping government reward for prescribing statins) This would save the government millions of pounds and lead to a happier healthier nation free from the side effects of unnecessary drugs. I would like the Department of health to review medical training in the UK therefore to improve this situation\r\n",
