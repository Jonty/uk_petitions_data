Other materials that bear The use of The Union Flag on products also, are trying to instil a false sense of patriotism within the buyer, to make them feel the need to buy the product. A false sense of propaganda. Therefore the bearing of this Flag should only be used where patriotism is being used by the manufacture, not just a marketing ploy.\r\nAlso would encourage the production of products within Britain, producing the same result as applying Tariffs from abroad (1902), but without doing so.",
