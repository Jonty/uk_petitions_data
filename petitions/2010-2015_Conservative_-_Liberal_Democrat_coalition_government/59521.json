It's 1 simple test to check for this condition and quite easy to treat if found but it isn't offered enough to women out there going through this heartache,  some women have gone into double figures of losses before seeking private help and this condition being found. It should be set in the NHS recurrent miscarriage range of tests or at least preformed after 4 or 5 losses. ",
