        "additional_details": "Tourism in Greece was built on it's cultural heritage and natural beauty, The Greek economy relies on tourism for one in five jobs to support the population. The marked increase in Hotels and Large Tour Operators offering only All Inclusive Holidays is detrimental to local restaurants, bars, tourist shops , transportation etc.in resorts throughout Greece. Some form of restriction is essential in order that businesses can continue to thrive thus providing a quality service. We ask Parliament to bring pressure on all holiday companies to look again at their policies of All Inclusive Holidays. ",
