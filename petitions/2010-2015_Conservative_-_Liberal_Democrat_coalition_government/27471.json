        "additional_details": "full contact motorsport should not be banned for many reasons, not every driver in the world can afford to race such formulas as touring cars or nascar etc so we have our own way of having enjoyment. full contact is just part of the game but contact can only be used to a certain extent, this does not make the sport anti-social it makes it more entertaining for the supporters and it also helps the drivers climb up the positions. if all full contact motorsport were to be banned there would be alot of unhappy people of the public becase this is what they do as a hobby and some do it for a living.",
