This will allow, upon request from the person, to remove, without question or proof, all bad credit history, missed payments, ccj's, defaulted and search history on all credit files held by credit history companies (such as equifax, experian etc).  This will NOT extend to the removal of any debts or legally binding judgements such as fraud or criminal activity.\r\n\r\nThe purpose will be to boost the economy and allow citizens to restart their finance without the handover of the past 6 years of recession. It will also allow credit companies to lend to more people and free up the bottleneck that is present in the current climate of bad debts and negative equity.  ",
