        "additional_details": "Why do schools have to have their logo on every piece of uniform. This not only increases the cost but also makes it harder to source. Removing the un-nessasary logos will make it easier and cheaper for parents to purchase. Surely having the logo on the overpriced poor quality blazers is enough to identify the school the child attends.\r\n\r\nthank you for reading the petition.",
