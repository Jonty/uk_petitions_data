        "additional_details": "I suggest that compulsory charges for the use of NHS resources, including transportation to hospital, incurred by people who are found to be incapable and needing hospital treatment, through drunkeness or the misuse of drugs should be levied upon these misusers of the health system.\r\nAccident and Emergency departments are being overwhelmed by such misuse of the system, especially, but not exclusively, on friday and saturday evenings/nights.\r\nIf it were the case that such misuse of the system was charged to the individual misusers, the result would be two fold,,, 1. The NHS would raise sorely needed revenue, and 2. Most of the misusers of the system would think twice about allowing themselves to get in such a state, that they have to be treated at A and E departments.\r\nI also believe that the staff within the NHS, including ambulance staff, should be afforded more respect, which is not what is given by the system misusers",
