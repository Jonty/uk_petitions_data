        "additional_details": "We as responsible dog owners/lovers understand that we are ultimately responsible for our dogs behaviour. Bull breeds are being persecuted again due to recent media interest but all dogs no matter what the breed can bite. Look at the right end of the lead and start with the owners. Breed Specific Legislation needs to be dropped and and an overhaul of the laws to make sure that all dog owners have to be responsible for their dogs behaviour on and off the lead. It doesnt matter if your dog is tiny, it still should be under control as a large dog showing exactly the same behaviour is classed as threatening. The government needs to stop killing dogs because of the way they look and start doing something about those who allow the animals who are genuinely a danger to be in a position to harm humans or other animals.",
