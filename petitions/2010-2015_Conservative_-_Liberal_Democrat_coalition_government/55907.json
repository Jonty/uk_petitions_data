The price of keeping children in care way exceeds the 6 weeks initial financial support offered to new mothers who give birth.\r\nWhy should adopters be discriminated against? Often people adopt more than one child at the same time taking more children out of care and reducing the cost to the government.\r\nSurely, in line with the government's recent successful initiatives regarding adoption this anomaly should be rectified to provide fair treatment to adopters.",
