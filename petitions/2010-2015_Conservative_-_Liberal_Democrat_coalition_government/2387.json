It allows British citizens to engage with the institutions of parliament and highlight issues that may be ignored by parliamentarians.\r\nIn practice, the innovation has allowed certain issues to be highlighted for the benefit of publicity seeking individuals of all political traditions.\r\nUntil the e-petitions idea is improved this petition wants e-petitions to be suspended.",
