There need to have checks and balances for even for other NHS professionals. Even frontline healthcare NHS professionals who themselves (not only managers) interview & appoint new healthcare professional colleagues & services may also develop services that duplicate and over-manned healthcare services. Not only do the politicians, Judges, executives, police, media need checks and balances, so do dentists, NHS professionals (like nurses), GP budget holders, etc.",
