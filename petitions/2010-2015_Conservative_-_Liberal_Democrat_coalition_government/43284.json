There are no public street lights active in the area, they were All deactivated a number of years ago.\r\n\r\nAs this is the main entrance to and from the estate I find this Unacceptable, this pathway is used by children to go to the local primary school, high school and youth club. The area also has a high number of elderly and disabled people who are now and have been for some time afraid to leave their homes or even go into their gardens after dark.\r\n\r\nAs winter approaches the area becomes more dangerous with Ice on the floors creating more injuries such as slips, trips and falls.\r\n\r\nI want the street lights between Swallow drive and Maesyrhandir primary school reactivated for our safety.\r\n",
