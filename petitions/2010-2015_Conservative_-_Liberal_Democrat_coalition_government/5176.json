        "additional_details": "With gas and electricity bills for the six major energy suppliers in the UK set to skyrocket, a major rethink on how energy is supplied in the UK is needed.\r\nThis petition states that all gas and electricity should be nationalised and owned by the state and taken out of the hands of private ownership.\r\nAs the British taxpayer will effectively own these resources this will allow the taxpayer a greater say in how these resources are run and will be able to bring the government of the day to account if the service is not run effectively.\r\nAlso, it will be up to the Government of the day to determine how gas and electricity is paid for. Perhaps means testing for those on lower incomes and for pensioners so that they don't have to pay gas and electric bills.\r\nIf you think nationalising these industries is a good idea, then please sign this petition and hopefully generate a debate in the House of Commons.\r\nThank you",
