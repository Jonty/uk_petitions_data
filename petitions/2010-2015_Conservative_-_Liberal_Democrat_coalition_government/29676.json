By reinstating the school hygiene nurse , parents could be informed directly instead of by a generic flyer at school and as such would not be able to avoid treating their children. I dont think this needs to involve excluding infested children as head lice can be dealt with quickly and effectively these days, so not infringing their rights to an education .",
