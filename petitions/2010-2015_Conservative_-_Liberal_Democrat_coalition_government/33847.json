        "additional_details": "This petition is to make representations to Central Goverment regarding controls to be placed on the actual purchase of gas carrying appliances (boilers, fires, cookers, etc) and gas carrying components for the repair and maintenance of appliances. It is proven and common knowledge that since the inception of CORGI (Mandatory) in 1991 through to 31st March 2009, and Gas Safe Register since 1st April 2009 to date, there is still a large fraternity within the gas, plumbing and heating industry who are carrying out illegal regulated work whilst not being registered as defined with the GS(I+U)R. The general solution to combat this problem is to place direct controls at the time of purchase, so as only persons who are currently on the Gas Safe Register can legally obtain the appliance or spares. .",
