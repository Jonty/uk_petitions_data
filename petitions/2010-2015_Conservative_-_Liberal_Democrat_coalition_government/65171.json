We hope this is helpful.\r\n\r\nThis was a shameful demonstration of the disdain in which these people hold our armed forces - which they send to foreign parts to be killed.  These people have no nobility nor probity and MUST be forever removed from the House of Lords and have ANY titles bestowed upon them in the name of the people they so obviously have the greatest disregard for, removed. Greater hatred hath no man (or woman) than he who can walk out during tributes to members of our armed forces who THEY approved sending to be killed.  GET THEM OUT AND KEEP THEM OUT.",
