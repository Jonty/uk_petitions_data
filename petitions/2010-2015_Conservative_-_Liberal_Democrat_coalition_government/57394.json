        "additional_details": "With Muslims become more and more brainwashed by Islam, we are under increased threat from Muslim extremist groups. After reading in the news that they're planning on capitalising the UK by using 'Sharia Zones' I personally just can NOT sit and accept this.\r\n\r\nWe need to unite and stand up against this extremist hate preaching group of individuals (who WILL soon take over).\r\n\r\nThis is NOT a hate breeding group, nor a racist attack, this is a simple stand up against a violation of equal human rights and opportunity.\r\n\r\nIf you want your neighbourhood to have split sex zones, no smoking, no alcohol, no pornography and no casual clothing then stay quiet and accept the change.\r\n\r\nIf you're AGAINST this then please SIGN THE PETITION asap and we may well be able to do something about this!",
