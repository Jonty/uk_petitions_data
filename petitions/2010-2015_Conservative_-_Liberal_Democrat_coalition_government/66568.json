        "additional_details": "There are 274000 managers in the NHS with no medical experiance. Using the example of Kaiser Permanente in the USA healthcare professions are able to use their medical experiance to run the hospital. This provides better service for patients and much higher staff moral.\r\nThe current NHS staff moral is at an all time low, this is brought about by 'managers' that have no relevent job experiance. 'Managers' who reduce the number of nurses and front line staff whilst bolstering their numbers.\r\nRemove the 'managers' and bring the NHS back in the BLACK. Assuming the 274000 managers are earning a conservative estimate of \u00a350k = \u00a313.7 Bn",
