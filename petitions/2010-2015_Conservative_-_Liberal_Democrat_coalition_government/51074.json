        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the Government to make road safety lessons a statutory part of Key Stage 1 national curriculum provision on the following grounds:\r\n\r\n- Between October 2011 and September 2012, 24,860 people were killed or seriously injured on British roads. Almost 10% (2,360) were children (Department of Transport).  To increase awareness at an early age in a child's development will save lives especially as they become drivers in later life.\r\n\r\n- Over the last 24 months, the numbers killed or seriously injured has increased year-on-year - while investment in road safety education and public awareness materials has been cut.  Every child should have a right to this vital information, not subject to a lottery based on the school they attend and the importance the institution places on it.\r\n\r\nWe urge the Government to ensure these crucial lessons are taught in schools, by schools, at an early age to help reduce the number of child fatalities and injuries on British roads.\r\n",
