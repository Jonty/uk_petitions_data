Currently there is no independant authority to resolve problems that the like's of Ebay take any notice of.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion is the creation governing body to ensure fair and responsible online practice, a body with the force of law able to oversee the actions of these online companies, force remediation, impose fines and sanctions and even shut a site down until compliance is achieved.
