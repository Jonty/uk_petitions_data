More and more companies are using non-geographic numbers and many people associate these with FREEFONE , LO-CALL, Local rate etc. This is NOT true from most mobile phones and users usually pay a hefty premium for calling them. Cynically, mobile phone companies often provide them as the only way to contact them hence building their profits at our, the users, expense. There should ALWAYS be a geographic number available! The government should act NOW to force the operators to comply with this - don't wait for this petition to run its course!",
