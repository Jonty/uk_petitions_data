        "additional_details": "We believe we go to secondary (high) school at the wrong period of our lives. Teenagers often lack the maturity or focus to gain value from school, so a lot of the educational spend is wasted.\r\nWe petition for an elongated version of primary school until age 14 or 15. Then, young people go out into the world for a couple of years and do real work, for real pay, in a real workplace, carefully monitored and supervised, alongside adults. This removes them from the false closed world of school into an environment where ages vary right across the range.\r\nHaving seen how educational outcomes affect people\u2019s earnings, attitudes and status, THEN they should do secondary school at perhaps age 17 or 18. The educational budget would be more effectively spent, because exposure to the real world would make more pupils focused and motivated. A higher percentage would have settled on realistic and attainable career choices rather than drifting into \u201csoft option\u201d vocational training after school ends.",
