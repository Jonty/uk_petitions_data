If you do not like the laws then challenge through democratic means, as is the right of any citizen. If you really cannot abide by them then leave. If you want to live under Sharia law, do so in a country which imposes it.\r\n\r\n2. Respect Britain as a Christian country, don't try to change it. You can do this whilst practicing whatever faith you wish. Do not expect your beliefs to be afforded any priority, state funding, protection or provision of secular education.\r\n\r\n3. Do not expect special treatment on account of being a minority group - leave or source the special treatment you require at your own expense. Slaughtering of animals in accordance with halal or kosher is not a British custom and should be outlawed. It is not the job of the NHS, police, education system, benefit system to provide interpreters.",
