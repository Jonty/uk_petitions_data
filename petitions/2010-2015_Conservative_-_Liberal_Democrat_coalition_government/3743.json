        "additional_details": "This petition seeks the ban of all petitions seeking to reinstate the barbaric practice of capital punishment in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe reinstatement of capital punishment by a state which has already banned it is arguably a breach of international human rights law.  The reinstatement of capital punishment in the UK would certainly constitute a fundamental breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly Protocol 13 thereof, which outlaws capital punishment within Europe.  As such, the UK should send a clear signal that epetitions cannot be raised for matters that will only serve to undermine basic human rights and the rule of law.\r\n\r\nNo more pro-death penalty petitions!",
