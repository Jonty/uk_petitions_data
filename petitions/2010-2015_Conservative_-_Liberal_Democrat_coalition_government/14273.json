        "additional_details": "Job Seekers are given benefits on the understanding that they are seeking work. I believe all job seekers should attend the job centre on an office hours basis, for example 9-5 Monday - Friday. Whilst there, the  should be able to receive training, CV development, interview practice, etc. This would give job seekers the best opportunity to gain employment, whilst encouraging the work ethic, punctuality, etc. required to return to work.\r\n\r\nAn additional benefit of this change would be that fraud would be reduced as it would be impossible to work cash in hand whilst at the job centre. It would also not be an easy option compared to work, and would motivate people to gain a job to increase their wealth.",
