        "additional_details": "Homework is a stress inducing chore fro children/teenagers to take part in. The process of having homework for (Averagely 9) subjects adds a huge amount of pressure and drives a teenager away from their daily activities. Here are a few of the reasons i believe it should be removed from the curriculum\r\n\r\nStress\r\nHomework creates a stressful task for a child, and it can become a challenge to get done with multiple distractions of gadgets and media around them, their minds are away from school and as such are not stimulated for learning, meaning a simple piece of work may take longer than an hour to complete, with multiple subjects, this quickly builds up an enormous amount of stress and can take over their lives.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately at this time i cannot add a larger description but i will create a site or a page explaining the problems that can amount from homework.\r\n\r\nI wish for the government to take action as for homework to be eliminated from the curriculum as soon as possible.\r\n",
