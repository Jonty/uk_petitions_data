        "additional_details": "People now treat the word billion as if it were million. The word has lost all impact and people have lost sight of the fact that a billion is in fact a million millions. If economists and commentators had to say 10 million millions instead of 10 billion it would bring into focus the real size of the figures in question. The government should insist that million millions are quoted instead of billion.",
