        "additional_details": "We were eager to help the libyans rebels in ousting Gaddafi, and yet when Zimbabwe's racist Mugabe brutaly kicks people off their farms, beating them, with no respect of their wellbeing and then one of his friends runs torture camps to mine diamonds, britain sits back. It is time Mugabe is removed, and the british government should put more pressure on Mugabe to step aside. He is, alongside the likes of Gadaffi, a modern day Hitler.",
