We therefore urge the government to rethink its policies on population growth in the UK.\r\n\r\nIn detail:\r\n\r\n- Scientific surveys are showing that species, such as: Bumble bees, Corncrakes, Bats, Crickets, Ground Beetles, Wildcats, Dormice, Starlings, Sparrows, Woodpeckers, Warblers, Hedgehogs and Badgers are suffering habitat destruction and many are threatened by extinction.\r\n\r\n-As our population grows, construction and intensive farming will put further pressure on our remaining wildlife. Wildlife habitat, such as grasslands, ponds, bogs and woods, will be destroyed.\r\n\r\n-Since 1930, 98% of wildflower meadows (bumble bee habitat) has been lost to farming, and development.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned urge the government to reduce the UK\u2019s population. Wildlife has a right to thrive here. Failure to act now could lead to the irreversible loss of species which are a part of our nation\u2019s identity and health.\r\n",
