        "additional_details": "We call on the government to drop the Welfare Reform Bill 2011. We believe that in its current form the bill takes away an important safety net of welfare for many vulnerable people. The sanctions for those who turn down work are not properly accountable and will lead to cases where people are unfairly labelled as unwilling to work without taking into account any other extenuating circumstances. The scrapping of Disability Living Allowance and the reassessment of those currently recieving it is un necessary. The government has announced it will reduce the number of claimants by 20%, we believe that this risks letting down many legitimate claimants. The benefit cap on families will only affect a small number of claimants, but for large families it could have a severe impact on the living standards of children.",
