In these days of increased traffic and near gridlock on occasion, the government should do more to further their traffic reduction policy by allowing all motorcyclists to use the pavement.\r\nNot many pedestrians use the pavement nowadays anyway, and those that do, are often old or poor people.\r\nGREEN: by getting people out of their car and off the roads we will reduce pollution dramatically.",
