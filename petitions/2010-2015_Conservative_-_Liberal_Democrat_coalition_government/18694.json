        "additional_details": "A sickening video of cruel breeders skinning helpless raccoon dogs alive has surfaced on the internet.\r\nThe raccoon dogs - an Asian breed related to foxes, jackals and domestic dogs \u2013 are being bred and tortured by skinning alive before being tossed onto a pile. Their hide is being used to fuel the FAKE Ugg boot trend.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to believe, but these Uggs could even be on the UK markets NOW as there is NO LAW AGAINST RACCOON DOG FUR AND HIDES \u2013 the material is being marketed as \u201cAustralian Sheepskin\u201d with some companies removing the \u201cMade in China\u201d tag and replacing it with an \u201cAustralian Made\u201d tag.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned, call for a UK ban on Raccoon Dog hide and an end to this disgusting trade.
