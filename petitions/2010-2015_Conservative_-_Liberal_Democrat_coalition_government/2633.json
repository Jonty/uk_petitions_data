        "additional_details": "I wish for rents to be fixed at affordable levels especially but not exclusively in our cities.  We need to make housing affordable to the ordinary working man and woman in this country.  This would stop greedy landlords getting their mortgages paid for by Housing Benefit and allow people to live without reliance on Benefits.  This would also relieve the demand for Council housing.  If the man who collects your bins, the nurses who work in our hospitals and the teachers in our schools cannot live locally how do we build communities.  People have to commute long distances, adding to pollution and congestion on our roads.  No average 3 bedroom family house should cost more than \u00a3180 per week. Please bring back the rent officer in our local councils with the authority to fix rents on any property whether it is rented by a person on benefits or working.  ",
