It has become apparent that Logan needs a statement. As a parent you can request this as I have but what I didn't know was that county would stop all of logans funding whilst they decide if he will be granted one. So I propose that this should not be allowed to happen. Logan or any other child in his position will be left with out funding for one on one help for 6-8 weeks if not longer whilst a decision is made. Please sign if U agree. ",
