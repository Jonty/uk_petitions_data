        "additional_details": "As part of the assessment for PIP,I would like the Government to take into account the effort that the claiment is making to hold down employment or, if they have lost their job, the percentage of their working life that they have worked if they are deemed capable of work. The day of activities should only be a very partial factor.  The main part should be based on what the claimant's doctor, psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker and another person who the claimant chooses to bring with them to the assessment.  The input of the professionals who have first-hand experience of the claimant's needs and barriers to work should be rated much higher than the activities.  This way people who have invisible disabilities such as neurological or mental disabilities receive a fair assessment.  Please support me to ensure that this money goes to those who deserve it.  It's only fair.",
