We want the government to take action and to get these young people off the street and back training again. Sparta is already an existing club and we are still awaiting a reply from the council as to why our lease was terminated at Bo'ness Recreation Centre (Falkirk Community Trust). Also, when we asked to share the Pavillion in Zetland park they told us they had a long standing agreement with the Zetland boxing club allowing them sole use of the premises and no other club of any type would be allowed to use these premises. We are still awaiting a copy of this long standing agreement which Falkirk Community Trust have so far refused to show us.",
