        "additional_details": "The Weatherspoons chain have been granted a licence to open a pub on the M40 motorway and will be allowed to serve alcohol.  This will undoubtedly lead to an increase in the number of people drinking and driving.\r\nDrink driving slows your reactions down, even if you only have one and since you can travel at up to 70MPH on a motorway you need very quick reactions.  This will lead to an increase in the number of accidents and possibly even deaths on our motorways.\r\nWe therefore demand that the licence to sell alcohol on motorways is withdrawn.",
