        "additional_details": "This should mean the car driver is driving without due care and attention, which by law is an offence! Too many bikers are being killed and getting away with manslaughter using 'SMIDSY'. The CPS and general public always blames the biker for going too fast, but  bikes are not invisible. The law should be upheld that if a 4 wheeled driver kills someone whilst driving without due care and attention, then he should be sentenced for manslaughter. SMIDSY is never an acceptable excuse. If you agree, and I can get enough signatures I will present this to government, but it takes your signature to be able to make any changes. Please sign. Thankyou",
