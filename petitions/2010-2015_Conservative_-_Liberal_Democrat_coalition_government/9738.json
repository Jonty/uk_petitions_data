Thus giving people experience, training and qualifications in areas that they would like to work.\r\n\r\nThe job club would involve training on interview techniques, job applications etc.\r\n\r\nFor those taking part, benefits would be increased to minimum wage and travel passes would be free to assist further.\r\n\r\nThis would give people pride in and respect for themseleves and their communities, whilst contributing to the economy.\r\n\r\nThose not taking part see reduced benefits.",
