        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned feel it is incredibly unfair that couples who both work full time and bring home a combined income of nearly \u00a3100k a year will continue to receive child benefit, whereas a family where one parent earns \u00a360k and the other is perhaps a stay at home parent or where there is ony a single parent earning over \u00a360k, will receive nothing. How can that possibly be just? We would like the government to make the cut off point based on the overall household income rather than that of individuals.",
