        "additional_details": "A motion to ban all forms of economic speculation on markets (including all forms of short selling) save for the trading of shares in limited companies registered on a regulated exchange. Speculation, broadly defined, has bred a culture in financial traders that seek to gamble on trends. This has led to a development of increasingly obscure products and also causes the gamblers to make massive profits when the general population is suffering.",
