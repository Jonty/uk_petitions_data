Also those of us who have paid in for over thirty years should receive some additional payment.\r\nIt has been calculated that if the flat rate of \u00a3150 is paid to all that quite a number of pensioners could lose up to \u00a35,000 a year; for many pensioners this \u00a35,000 is a very significant part and the lose of which will cause great harm.\r\n",
