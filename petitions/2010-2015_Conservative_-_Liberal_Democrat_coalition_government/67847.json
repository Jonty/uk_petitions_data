        "additional_details": "I know many parent's who must be pulling their hair out, at the start of the long 6 weeks summer holiday, because i'm one of them. When you hear those dreaded word's MUM I'M BORED and it's only 2 day's in, you think here we go, but what can you do.\r\n\r\nCan you afford to take 6 weeks off?,\r\n Can you afford to send them to an out of school club for the whole of the summer?,\r\n Can you afford to go on holiday, knowing that the inflated price's will bankrupt you?.\r\n\r\n If the answer is NO to any of the above, something needs to be done.\r\nThe long school summer holidays are now so out of date in the 21st century they are almost prehistoric.\r\nLets have a shorter summer where families don't have to juggle childcare and time off and where they can enjoy what time they do have together.",
