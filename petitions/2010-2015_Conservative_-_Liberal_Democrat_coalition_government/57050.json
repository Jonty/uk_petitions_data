        "additional_details": "Please make Christmas Eve a Bank Holiday by Christmas 2014.  Christmas Eve, for most, is the last day to buy presents, prepare food, and make final preparations to make Christmas Day special for all.  More importantly it is a day for those who have to travel to see family for Christmas, in a time when people increasingly move away from home and families are geographically fragmented.  The increase in retail spending should reduce the economic effect of having just one more bank holiday a year, and the social benefit would be tremendous, easing the stress of this busy time for so many.",
