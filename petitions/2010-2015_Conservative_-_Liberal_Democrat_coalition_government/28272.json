        "additional_details": "The Government have decided to cap incomes for families that receive Wefare Benefits.  They state that \u00a326,000 equates to a \u00a335,000 per year wage.\r\n\r\nMinisters continue to penalise disabled people for their inability to work.  They pay a private company ATOS to assess disabled people.  This company last month found a \"Coma Patient\" fit for work and it has also been suggested that ATOS have been causal factor in the suicide of 11 disabled people.\r\nWe residents of the United Kingdom request that the Government halt their Welfare Reform Bill and properly asses the impact of disability cuts on the disabled and their families.\r\nWe also request that Ministers wages are capped at \u00a326,000 so they can feel the effects of the impact of their proposed cuts.\r\n\r\nIts time for the Disabled People of this Country to find a voice.  Treat Ministers in the same way that they are treating you.",
