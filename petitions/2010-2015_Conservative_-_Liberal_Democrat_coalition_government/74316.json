        "additional_details": "Recently, our school, Marlborough College, has introduced new, extra long lessons. These are extremely inefficient and can be seen to have a negative net effect on pupils learning.\r\n\r\nThese lessons are 1hr20m long. Research has shown that teenagers can keep up concentration for a little over 40 minutes. In a normal, 55 minute lesson, pupils can concentrate for the given period of time with small 30 second breaks. However, with \"super lessons\" pupils enter the classroom with a negative attitude, as they have to study for such a long period of time. This lack of motivation negatively affects concentration throughout the lesson, defeating the point of lengthening lessons. Teachers also can not be expected to maintain their full concentration, let alone the focus of their class.\r\nPlease take a minute to sign our petition.",
