        "additional_details": "Following the terrible fiasco with a local proposed Incinerator that has now been rejected, and the very real likelihood of extra savage cuts affecting local services, whilst \u00a330 million pounds has to pay the firm concerned 'compensation', we demand that the people who pay taxes to Norfolk County Council be given a Referendum - a Vote of Confidence in that council.\r\nIf the Vote of Confidence goes against that council - all elected officials should stand down, and fresh elections held. Such a result would be a clear indication that voters are fed up with the way elected officials are blatantly misusing our funds, and spending our money in ways they'd never spend their own!\r\n",
