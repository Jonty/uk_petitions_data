Re-registration with local authorities is necessary if the dog is moved around the country. All puppies must be microchipped by 3 months old and the attending Vet must register the puppy onto the central database.\r\n\r\nAny change of address or the death of the dog must be reported within 10 days to the Identity service.\r\n\r\n",
