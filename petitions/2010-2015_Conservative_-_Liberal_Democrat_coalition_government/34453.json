One of the \u2018harms\u2019 quoted is the anxiety created in cases of false positive results. However, what is not taken into account is the anxiety created in women worried enough to request a smear and being refused one.\r\n\r\nWe believe that these women should have the right to opt into the cervical screening programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
