        "additional_details": "A lot of young offenders such as the rioters are not deterred by the expensive process of overcrowded and often further corrupting prison sentences. I suggest using some of the money we spend on aid to set up government run schemes to send young offenders to third world countries to work on various aid projects. Being involved in witnessing and improving true poverty is proven to be a life changing experience. The schemes would also provide paid jobs for others as obviously people would need to oversee these projects. Please sign my petition if you agree.",
