        "additional_details": "We call upon the government to introduce in full the Independent Commission on banking recommendations, at the very least within this Parliamentary year and for the legislation separating and controlling  retail banking  from the investment and speculative banking operations to be in operation by the end of 2012.  This is needed to protect the taxpayer and the economy from the excesses, greed and depredations of the banking and financial sector inflicted upon us in the recent past and to ensure that  the current economic and financial crisis does not again lead to us having again to bail out banks and speculators. Ensure in law that the speculators take the risk and are not underwritten by the British taxpayers",
