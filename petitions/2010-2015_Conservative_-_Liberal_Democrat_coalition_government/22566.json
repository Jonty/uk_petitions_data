        "additional_details": "This petition calls for all British troops to be withdrawn without delay from any overseas territories in which they are currently stationed, including Afghanistan, the Balkans, Cyprus and Germany. The United Kingdom is not in any immediate danger of being attacked by any foreign armies at present and so these deployments simply represent old-style imperialism and notions of national superiority. It is a violation of a country's sovereign rights to be occupied by a foreign power and so democracy cannot occur until a nation has been liberated from occupation. ",
