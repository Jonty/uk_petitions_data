        "additional_details": "The time has come to stop companies advertising products with a small asterisk attached to the end requiring the consumer themselves to read through tiny small print to find out what the actual product or offer is.\r\n\r\nIt is underhand and almost tricks consumers into buying something they think is something else only to find out later that there was some small print. This small print is getting smaller and smaller.\r\n\r\nIt has to stop, why can't companies be more honest and tell us exactly what they are offering including all hidden charges upfront in large print without any asterisks and then we will all know what we are buying.\r\n\r\nPlease join this petition to change the way that companies advertise their products. If we can get at least 100,000 votes then this could be debated in the House of Commons. Please add your support now.",
