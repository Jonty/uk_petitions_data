        "additional_details": "The way the ATOS Work Capability Assessments are carried out at present is all wrong.  They are based on what people can do and not what they can't do.  They do not take into account how a person's illness or disability affects them in all aspects of daily life.  For example, if a claimant can grip a piece of paper in either or both hands, they can grip or hold anything.  This is not always the case.  If, for example, someone has really bad rheumatoid arthritis in either or both hands, they have severe difficulty in gripping everyday things.  This is not, at present, taken into account by ATOS Healthcare Professionals.\r\n\r\nAlso, these assessments should be more open and the descriptors should not be checked in a sneaky and underhand way.",
