        "additional_details": "Yogi, born in Cuba but moved to the UK at the age of 7, Yogi is now trapped in Cuba after going to help his mother recover from hurricane Sandy. Officially a British citizen, Yogi holds a full British passport and lives in Mansfield with his partner and child. Having done nothing wrong and travelled to Cuba to help his mother out, Yogi is now stuck in Cuba and needs help to get home.\r\n\r\nOn the 4/12/2012 Yogi was supposed to leave Cuba and return to the UK. Cuban immigration denied his departure and refused to let him leave as he doesn\u2019t have a Cuban passport. After contacting the British embassy he was told all of these check\u2019s should have been carried out before entering Cuba and without the required documents, he shouldn\u2019t have been granted access to the country. The reason Yogi is currently stranded is because Cuban immigration failed to perform the required procedures granting him access to Cuba yet now they wont let him leave without the required passport and documentation.
