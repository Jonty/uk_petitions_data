        "additional_details": "Cambridge is a city of a grand endeavour where skills and knowledge come together to drive innovation and shape the future. The university has built a reputation for self-improvement through hard work and doing the best you can - a meritocracy if you will. This petition is to revoke the title of Cambridge from use by the Royal Family. At a meeting at the Privy Council on 17 July 1917, it was declared that all male descendents of Queen Victoria shall bear the name 'Windsor' and they should stick to this.",
