Football is almost a basic need akin to air for those who follow the sport. The FA are miss managing our national sport. The inconsistent, common sense defying lack of retrospective action and unpredictable punishments are a clear example of the FA not functioning as the country deserves. High profile figures within the game have made clear public statements questioning the FA. I believe the FA themselves are bringing the game into disrepute and need to be investigated. The FA made comments relating to the length of a ban a player would serve before an independent panel could arrive at a decision, therefore, influencing the panel\u2019s decision. I would like the government to hold an enquiry into the working of the FA and their own impartiality with regards to players, clubs and managers and how the well the national game is being managed?",
