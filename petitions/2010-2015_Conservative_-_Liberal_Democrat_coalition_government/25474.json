        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that while the E-Petition system is becoming an important opportunity for the general public to influence the democratic process, at the moment, it is too easy for a single \"populist\" issue to get support and therefore parliamentary time and possible action but there is no simple way for people to lodge their disagreement to something which may  be very controversial. We believe that either all E-petitions should by default be created with a counter petition or alternatively that any which reach the 100,000 mark and are progressed should be set up with a counter petition for a period after to allow people to lodge their opposition.\r\n\r\nWe believe this would provide an important counter balance to more extreme opinions and suggestions.",
