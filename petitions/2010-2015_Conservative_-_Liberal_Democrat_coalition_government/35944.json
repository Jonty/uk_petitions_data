MPs in the commons being chosen not for their common sense, IQ or expertise but rather for their ability to sell themselves or con the public. How many promises have been made and not kept?  Successive governments through bad policy decisions have brought Britain to its knees illustrating the need to give the Lords more powers to call for a referendum of public confidence and dissolve the Commons. This would clearly not work if the Commons elect the Lords",
