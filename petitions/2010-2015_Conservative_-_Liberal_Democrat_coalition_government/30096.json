        "additional_details": "The service that The Pirate Bay provides is in no way different from the search engine Google in that it allows the user to locate files on the internet. These files are no more illegal than the content hosted on Google video site 'Youtube', where it is (hypothetically) perfectly easy to download and stream illegal, copyrighted content such a music and films with little moderation. These files are actually hosted by Google, Inc. themselves, while The Pirate Bay hosts no illegal content whatsoever, only torrent files which connect to a peer-to-peer network. There is not one illegally hosted video, image, text or audio file on thepirate bay's servers and any misuse of the service provided is at the responsibility of the uploader or 'seeder'. The Pirate Bay has become a scapegoat and this needs to end. Attempting to censor the internet will lead to civil unrest. ",
