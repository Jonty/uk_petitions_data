        "additional_details": "\"A police state is one where only the police force are armed, a dangerous state is one where only the criminals are armed.\" There is no reason why the British Police should remain one of the few unarmed police forces in the world. Parts of Britain are currently some of the most dangerous places in the western world. Countries such as Australia which are widely regarded as safer than Britain have a fully armed police force. \"There is no need to fear the armed police if your not doing anything wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the correct training and management, an armed police force will be able to take back control of the streets from the armed gangs.\"",
