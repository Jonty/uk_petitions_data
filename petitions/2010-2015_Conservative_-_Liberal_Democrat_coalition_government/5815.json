        "additional_details": "\r\nThis petition is to empower Government  via an Act  to set binding annual caps on what all energy and water companies can charge all  their customers . Also Government should have the power to force energy/water companies to reduce their prices for all customers when they are too high and cause economic hardship.\r\nThe need for this reform arises because  despite the existence of competition and the free market the energy and water companies have acted like a colluding group of monopoly providers relentlessly increasing their prices without having to take any account of the majority of their customers economic circumstances against the back drop of deep and long term recession. The only alternative is for greater Government intervention and price controls over what the energy and water companies can charge us all.\r\n",
