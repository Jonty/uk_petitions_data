        "additional_details": "For too long the general public has had to live under laws and under threat of laws that are bias towards Christianity and the teachings of other religions.\r\n\r\nWhat the law has failed to recognise is that when it comes to religion there has been no evidence to suggest that any of the claims that they make are true. As such there is no evidence that laws enabling gay marriage, gay adoption and better access to abortions and contraception for women should not be enacted.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence to suggest that these are 'immoral' acts and common sense suggests that these should be things that the public has free access to.\r\n\r\nRather than restricting our choice because of their beliefs, the government should always place secular ideals first and allow the religious population to opt out of taking advantage of these opportunities.\r\n\r\nOur freedom from religion should be respected.",
