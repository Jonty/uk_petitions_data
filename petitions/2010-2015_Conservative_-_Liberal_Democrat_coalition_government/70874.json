        "additional_details": "At present, there is no naturally occurring substance that produces the effect of dissipating harmful thoughts and behaviours as marijuana does. Many people suffering personality disorder find that SSRI's and anti depressants do NOT help with crisis situations and attacks of rage that can spontaneously occur. Many find alcohol a suitable alternative, to theirs and others cost. Using THC will reduce cases of violent crime and enable those who see marijuana as a medical necessity to stop intrusive thoughts/behaviours feeling like criminals, which they technically are at present. Reinforcing the criminal mindset is not conducive to a positive place in family and society. Give those who seek to control and work with their illness the relief of respite from troubling thoughts, allowing them to be more relaxed and 'together' and therefore more receptive to different therapies and able to deal with change and the crises of daily life.",
