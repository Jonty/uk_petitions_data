        "additional_details": "The Government should investigate the appetite of other EU members for breaking away from the current EU and forming a new community of elite, more developed, wealthier  western European counties to form a less integrated trading union that will not be involved in interfering with each other's internal laws and immigration policies. Countries to be targeted should be:\r\nGermany, Holland, Belgium, France, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. In any new union, the emphasis should be on maximizing trading opportunities and international co-operation and friendship. ",
