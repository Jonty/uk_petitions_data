        "additional_details": "To ban the compulsory use of school uniform with the school logo on as this allows the school to sell the clothing at a price which is much higher than the high street.\r\nMajor chains are doing their part by offering school uniform at a cost that all families can afford, but when a school insists on the shirts, jumpers and p.e kit all having the school logo printed or embroided on them which the school has the monopoly on this makes the cost so much higher. Either ban their use altogether, use a sew on patch which can then be re used as the child grows or have the option of having a logo or not.",
