        "additional_details": "Implement control measures to restrict the amount of wheat / barley straw, wood shavings and other materials used for animal bedding that can be sold as renewable fuel for electricity generation. As incineration comes into favour, we could easily see all available sources of these materials purchased in bulk to be burnt for electricity generation in the not too distant future. This would drive the price sky high and the availability down meaning that owners of leisure horses and other medium / large livestock in the UK are unable to acquire reasonably priced bedding for their animals.",
