        "additional_details": "The growing 'thinspiration' presence online is promoting life-threatening illnesses and encouraging young people to adopt dangerous habits which could cost lives. With rising numbers of mental health problems, the government should take more preventative measures to stop people from developing eating disorders, such as censoring this glorification of self-harm and starvation. Sites promoting the concept of 'thinspiration' should not appear on search engines and should be able to be reported if found and closed down or disabled. Hashtags/keywords such as 'thinspiration', 'proana' and 'promia' should be banned from use. They are just as offensive as racist/sexist comments to those who suffer from EDs, and potentially just as dangerous as websites encouraging violence, drug, alcohol and sexual abuse; they all promote unhealthy and destructive lifestyles. If these are not deemed acceptable, why is it alright to expose people to the twisted beautification of self-deprivation and starvation?",
