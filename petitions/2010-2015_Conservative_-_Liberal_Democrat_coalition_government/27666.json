IIt is now clear that they deceived the Gurkhas.  They have, as part of their nonsensical defence cuts, turned on them and their families in a manner that Gurkha campaigners could never have expected.\r\n\r\nThis is no way to treat these decent, honest people who have, time and again, contributed so much to the well-being of the United Kingdom and the threat of these job losses must be removed immediately.",
