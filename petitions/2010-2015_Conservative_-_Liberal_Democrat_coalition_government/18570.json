It is also an extremely high pass boundary of 86% in the first part of the test. This allows little room for human error and individals can end up paying over 90pounds in attempting to pass. This reidculous as it already costs 30quid to to get the books and cd rom on top. 120 pounds is not fair in this economic climate.  ",
