        "additional_details": "Stop allowing footballers from returning to the profession they love after they commit heinous crimes. It was announced in May 2012 that Luke McCormick will be given the chance to train with Swindon Town FC. This after he had needlessly taken the lives of 2 children after drinking and driving and only served half of his extremely lenient 7 years and 4 months custodial sentence. Another high-profile example of this was the return to football by Lee Hughes who is now playing in the third tier of English football despite serving a prison term for leaving the scene after killing a fellow driver following a drink-drive journey.",
