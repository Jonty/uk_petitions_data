        "additional_details": "Young drivers could be banned from giving lifts to their mates - as part of a Government drive to cut teen deaths on the road.\r\n\r\nTeenagers would only be allowed to carry passengers if they are family members only.\r\n\r\nThe Government is also considering banning novice drivers from carrying any passengers at all, the Daily Telegraph reported today.\r\n\r\nThe proposed ban - aimed at preventing teens being pressured by 'pals' to drive fast or show off behind the wheel.\r\n\r\nThis is just reinforcing a negative stereo type of teens who we know aren't all idiots or at fault. 2/3 of road incidents happen from people over 25....\r\n\r\nThere are much better ways of cutting the human and monetary cost of poor driving across the board and we accept young people make up a disproportionate amount of the incidents. Educate, lower the cost of insurance so young people can get better/safer cars look at a stricter points system, make the roads safer, ban all smoking in cars while moving.",
