Gyanraj has said \u201cI will die in the name of dignity and equality for all Gurkhas.\r\n\r\nThat is all he and many others want, equal pay, benefits and pensions to the UK colleagues they serve alongside on behalf of our nation.  How can we ask people to fight for our country and in good conscience, basically tell them their life isn't as valuable as a UK citizens.\r\n\r\nThe sooner we hit our target the sooner we can save a life...please help?",
