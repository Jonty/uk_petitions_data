        "additional_details": "UK to become food and fuel self sufficient\r\nWorldwide resources are under greater demand than ever.  New economies are immerging, demanding more and more food and fuel.  This will drive prices up.\r\nTherefore it is essential that the UK is not only able to feed its own population but provide enough energy in the form of Electric/Oil/Gas to meet the population\u2019s requirements.\r\nI believe the best way to achieve this is:\r\n(1)\tProtecting our farms and increasing output.\r\n(2)\tSupport of our Universities to maximise power production efficiency and to find new solutions to providing power for our country.\r\n(3)\tImpose import restrictions/tariffs on inefficient electrical goods e.g. Goods with standby or with wall transformers that discourage the user to switch them off.\r\n(4)\tThe managed reduction of our population.  This political \u2018hot potato\u2019 simply must be addressed in conjunction with the above so that increased production can meet reduced demand in a reasonable way.\r\n",
