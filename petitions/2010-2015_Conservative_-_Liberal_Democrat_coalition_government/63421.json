Burning an animal alive (People and animals are taken into account)\r\nAny foreign entities that enter our country must be tested for English skills, written and spoken, as well as a nationality test, for their knowledge on our culture and country.\r\nEveryone, home born or foreign must submit to a DNA and fingerprint test, to help fight crime in the future they may commit.\r\nAny survivors of reciprocation punishment will be sentenced to a labour camp, where they will be also subject to almost hypnotic \"society reintegration\" classes, during the minimum 5 year sentence. NO PAROLE.\r\nConvicts will only get basic life saving medical care, not \"restore to former glory\" medical care.\r\nAnimals and People alike should NOT be abused, by a poor legal system, governed from over our oceans. We should lead the world into a peaceful future, by forcing people to think about their actions.",
