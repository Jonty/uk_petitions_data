        "additional_details": "Our diverse society, which is peaceful and welcoming, is being infringed by Islamic extremism and terrorism. Islamic extremist preachers and terrorists should be extradited from our country in order to minimise the encouragement of Islamic extremism and to restore the peaceful values of our multicultural society. Due to the Human Rights Act, Islamic extremists cannot be extradited (and if, very rarely) because \"it might infringe their right to a family life\", etc. Well Islamic extremism is infringing the innocent British people's way of living in its entirety. Islamic extremists come into the UK deliberately to oppose the British way of life, strike terror into British citizens and to \"recruit\" potential Islamic extremists. This has to be stopped immediatley! These extremists give Islam a bad name and anger many people. If this extremism is not dealt with properly, a large misconception of Islam will be created, segregating entire communities. So act now and help save our society!",
