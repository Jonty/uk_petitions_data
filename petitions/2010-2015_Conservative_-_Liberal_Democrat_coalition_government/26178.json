        "additional_details": "I wish the govenment to make legislation that would provide a parent entering the family courts with a backround history of cafcass officer candidates, to enable the parents to choose one that is more satisfactory.\r\nIt is unfair that a father taking his ex to court with a very good chance of winning is given a cafcass officer that has 2 children from one father, another from different father and call's herself Ms.  The caffcass officer will without doubt relate to the mother and do everything in her power to ensure the mothers needs are met by the courts with no respect for whats better for the children.  Cafcass officers with this backround should be moved to different area's of work and not be made avaliable to the courts dealing with seperated parents.",
