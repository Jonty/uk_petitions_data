This outruns Britain's current record spend of 0.56 per cent GDP on overseas aid and will see it rise to 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2013.\r\n\r\nWe are not opposed to overseas aid in principle, but believe that while UK taxpayers and voters are enduring genuine hardship, the elimination of this problem should take precedence over helping overseas nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
