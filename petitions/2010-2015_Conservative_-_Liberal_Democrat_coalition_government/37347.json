This has led to huge public opinion about whether they will be able to meet this commitment after Virgin have managed this successfully over the last 10 Years.\r\n\r\nWhy does one company get ownership of the mainline service? Why can it not be managed by First Group and Virgin?\r\n\r\nSplit ownership of the West Coast mainline service to First Group and Virgin. You offer competitiveness to the industry, competitive pricing and offer choice to customers about which service they wish to use. Replicate what the government is trying to do with the Banks. Give people more choice.",
