        "additional_details": "The portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge announced on 11th January 2013 and displayed at the National Portrait Gallery is a disgrace.\r\n\r\nIt is an insult to the Duchess, the Royal Family and to the whole British nation.  It fails entirely to capture either her beauty or her personality.\r\n\r\nShe has been placed in an invidious position by some extremely poor judgment by both her advisors and the gallery.  How can she possibly criticise it?\r\n\r\nMr Emsley may be an talented painter but on this occasion he has failed.  The portrait should be removed from public display",
