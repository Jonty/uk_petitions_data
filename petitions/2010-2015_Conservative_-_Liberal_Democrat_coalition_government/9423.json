        "additional_details": "In a time where families are finding their budgets squeezed, it is getting too hard to eat healthily as items such as fresh orange juice are much more expensive than their less healthy, processed alternatives.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is getting comparability cheaper to eat unhealthily. We need to make good healthy food a permanent fixture in our weekly shop. Similar to smoking, these options should be made to be less attractive with extra charges to help put money back into quality food for our people.\r\n\r\nWe should be trying to to help individuals and families to have a healthier diet, by subsidising healthy foods and reducing any taxes on shops and those who grow the foods to keep costs low. Shops could have incentives to put offers on to help people choose better products and improve their overall well being.\r\n\r\nWe need to make healthy food in this country a viable option, not a luxury.",
