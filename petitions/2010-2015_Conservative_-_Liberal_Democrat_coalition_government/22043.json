Sick to death of the lies, bureaucracy, and bunglings of The Home Office, UK Border Controls and European legislation in relation to mass immigration?\r\n\r\nEver thought that we should make people in this country fill the vacant positions instead of bringing foreigners in to do our dirty work?\r\n\r\nEver thought that you can't change policy?\r\n\r\nWell now is your chance, together lets make the Government reveal EXACTLY how many out of the 5 million immigrants Thereasa May has quoted are likely to commit criminal acts. How many could rape, murder, attack, mug, fraudulently claim insurance, benefits etc etc against us, decent hard working people of Great Britain. Sign the e-petition and lets get our voices heard.",
