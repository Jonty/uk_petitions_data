        "additional_details": "I would like to see the current use of ATOS for medical assessments scrapped and their contract torn up.\r\n\r\nATOS agents are not concerned with physical disabilities, just capabilities. They do not look at letters provided by applicants from doctors or specialists. They are told by DWP to assess on capabilities only. There are questions being raised as to the credibility of some of these agents. ie: They are not qualified to carry out all the task given them.\r\n\r\nThis is wrong.\r\n\r\nInstead give the task to G.P.s\r\nIt does not need to be the applicants G.P., however one that practices from the same clinic/centre.\r\nThis would ensure greater accuracy of results for both applicants and the DWP.",
