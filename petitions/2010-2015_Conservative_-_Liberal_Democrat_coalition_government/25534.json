        "additional_details": "Thousands of people are not sending Christmas cards this year due to the high prices. A small overseas card is \u00a31.10, so sending 10 will cost \u00a311! If the Post Office made a special deal that meant you could send unsealed Christmas cards for half price, a lot more people would send cards. They mean a lot, particularly to the elderly, and, for some it's an important contact with loved ones. With the current economic conditions, those less well off, the elderly, those who've lost jobs need some show of thoughtfulness by the powers that be. The Post Office would, no doubt, profit from this, as we would probably end up sending MORE cards. Maybe they could do it from mid November until Xmas Eve. It's just too expensive these days, and no one, except the post office, is benefitting. Something should be done to help garner the spirit of Christmas.",
