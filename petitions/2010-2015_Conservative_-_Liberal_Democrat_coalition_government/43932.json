        "additional_details": "The Government pledged that they would drop the toll charges when construction costs for the tunnel and bridge were paid off, but since the Dartford Crossing went into profit in 2004 they remained in place. If tolls were scrapped the vast tailbacks would be reduced dramatically and the high levels of pollution engines would also be cut. We are now told that the Toll Charge is in fact a congestion charge, and the recent rise from \u00a31.00 to \u00a31.50 for cars is to ease jams. The jams are far worse since the tolls have been increased.  Meaning that effectively this congestion charge is causing congestion at the Dartford Crossings. If a motorist arrives at the booths and cannot make payment, then all traffic is stopped whilst the motorist is directed to the hard shoulder. There is the extra time needed to give change to motorists now that the charges are higher.",
