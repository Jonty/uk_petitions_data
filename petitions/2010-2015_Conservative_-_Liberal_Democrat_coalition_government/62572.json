        "additional_details": "This petition is calling on the Department for Education to introduce the topic of Female Genital Mutilation into the national curriculum.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that 30,000 girls in the UK are at risk of FGM abuse, and that number will continue to grow if we do not educate our future generations.\r\n\r\nFGM education would allow children to learn about the health consequences and know where to go should they be at risk. Additionally they would be much less likely to abuse their own children in this way, thus reducing the number of girls affected in the future.\r\n\r\nPlease sign our petition and help us end this horrific form of child abuse.",
