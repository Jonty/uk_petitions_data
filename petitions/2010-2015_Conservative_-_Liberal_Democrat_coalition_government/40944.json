        "additional_details": "In my 25 years of watching football I have witnessed some ridiculous refereeing decisions, from balls that crossed the line and red cards for clean tackles, to goals being allowed that were offside. I have listened to managers complain in post-match interviews and about decisions that went against them. I have noticed that more often than not Manchester United are the team benefiting from these bad decisions. Who governs referees in the premier league? After these referees have been leniently dealt with they are free to referee matches involving the same clubs. Is that right? Should they not be stopped from refereeing the same club after they have clearly made a bad decision? Manchester United have benefited considerably from this. Over the last 15 years I have watched their biggest title rivals receive soft red cards resulting in suspensions for key players.",
