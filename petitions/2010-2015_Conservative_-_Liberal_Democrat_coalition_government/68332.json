        "additional_details": "Herne Bay Pier Trust was set up in 2008 to regenerate and rebuild its pier which is a focal asset for the local community -  one of the poorest in the Canterbury district.  The pier's history dates back nearly 200 years and the Victorian pier was the second longest in UK. The town wants its pier back - the old pierhead remains out at sea. The town has 400 volunteers working hard to regenerate this pier. In 2013 the Trust built 12 retail outlets on the leg and is in the process of extending the village with a further 16 huts, a stage  and toilets - all funding raised by the Trust from a variety of sources. Now we need a large injection to extend the platform further. Please can we be included in the \u00a38 million plus set aside by govt for coastal regeneration including piers. ",
