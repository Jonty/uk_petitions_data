        "additional_details": "We've all seen the film 'Back to the Future' it prompts fond childhood memories of how exciting it was going to be living in the future. Flying cars, robots to do the housework and most importantly the hoverboard so that we'd never have to walk again. The date in the back to the future film is fast approaching and we are an embarrassing million miles away from introducing the hoverboard to everyday life. This petition calls on the government to increase funding into hoverboard research so that we can have the hoverboard in widespread use across the globe by October 21st 2015, the date depicted in film.",
