        "action": "Removal from the UK of non British origin people who are against Christianity or our Armed Forces.",
        "additional_details": "Do you think it is right that not of British origin people can publicly incite hate and abuse against the UK's armed forces. If they reside here and are not happy here then they should be removed from the UK. Nor should not of British origin people be allowed to publicly call for the death of Christians without immediate arrest and subsequent removal from the UK.   Nor should they be allowed to claim free legal aid. Please add your name to this petition if you want this terrible threat to our British way of life to stop. Thank you.",
