        "additional_details": "How annoying is it to be disrupted half way through a conversation by a stupidly loud car/bike driving past ? Having to stop talking until the vehicle is several miles away so that you can hear some one ! Or having to put up with a boy racer living next door with a tiny car that sounds like a jet engine and shakes the windows from their frames because they have added a so called \"performance exhaust pipe\" ! Or a bike fanatic with his Harley that sounds like a pnumatic drill in your ear every time they rev the engine ? This kind of noise is dangerous to our ears and totally unnecessary with todays technology for quieter  engines. I want the Government to ban these antisocial noise makers and have every engine \"decibell tested\" for health and safety. It could be built into the MOT with little cost and easily tested with a decibell metre. If you agree with me then VOTE FOR ME PLEASE IN YOUR THOUSANDS AND CHANGE THE LAW ! ! !",
