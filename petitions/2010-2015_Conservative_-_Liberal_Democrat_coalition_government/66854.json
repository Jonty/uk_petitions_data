        "additional_details": "Recently an online radio station named BenRadio had sacked one of their former presenters, Lewis Thorp. According to Ben (The Owner), the reason for this was because a switch around in the schedule and fellow presenter, Dylan Doughty, has took his timeslot. Lewis has been entertaining hundreds and hundreds of people from around the globe for 3 years now and does not deserve to be kicked off a station in an upsetting, unjust and unfair manner. Ben has said he will bring back Lewis to BenRadio if we have many signing a petition. If you believe that Lewis deserves to be on a station he can make a positive impact on, sign this e-petition!",
