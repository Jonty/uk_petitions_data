        "additional_details": "HM Government should encourage people to pay more tax by offering annual prizes e.g. free ride on an RAF helicopter, lunch with HM The Queen; the greater the amount of tax paid the greater the prize. Prizes could be allocated within bands of tax payable so that taxpayers would be incentivised to pay more tax to win a better prize. The marginal cost to the Treasury would be minimal as taxpayers would merely participate in activities already being carried out and paid for by the taxpayer e.g. training flights, banquets etc.",
