        "additional_details": "We need to transform Religious Education and make it mandatory and compulsory in the national curriculum for Primary and Secondary schools.\r\n\r\nThe foundations of a good society should include some decent moral values like those inherent in the basis of many religions eg: Christianity. An understanding of other different religions is also essential to harmony in a multi-cultural society. Religion is also closely tied to belief systems and politics in many countries around the world. In the UK for example the Church of England has a important role in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nFollowing on from my previous comment. I think the two reports listed below vindicate the need for a review of religious education and how it is delivered in the curriculum;\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/transforming-religious-education\r\nhttp://www.ofsted.gov.uk/node/1960\r\n",
