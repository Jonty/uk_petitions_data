If a company has been privatized, the consumer must be able to chose from a different company at a different price.\r\nThis means, for example when purchasing a train ticket, there must be two different companies providing trains between their desired locations at the time that they want to leave, and the two trains must have differentiated pricing.\r\n\r\nIf the company is not able to show that there is real competition, then the company will only be able to charge cost price for the service, which includes people directly working on that service and costs, (which does not include management fees).\r\n\r\nIntermediaries are not real choice: The producer/provider of the service must sell the product, intermediaries providing different pricing structures do not provide real choice.",
