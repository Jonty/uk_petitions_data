        "additional_details": "We are very concerned at the damage by debt to health and wellbeing of the poorest London citizens done by housing benefit caps and if the Universal Credit cap goes ahead. We ask comfortable taxpayers to consider the Government Office for Science evidence that debt and mental illness are related, and London School of Economics researches showing that the stress of the parents affects the immune system of their children, and to reflect on the stress when rent is made unaffordable by government policies, and the loss to many already vulnerable children of the protection of the local authorities and schools when they are forced to move by the caps. We call on Parliament to prevent the mass changing of locks by bailiffs as tenants are evicted to an uncertain future by ending the cap on the Universal Credit, reforming the Housing Benefit Regulations and creating a policy for affordable housing in all tenures which will improve the health, wellbeing and security of every citizen of London.
