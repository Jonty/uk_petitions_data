The kids/teen rooms seem to be used by those looking to prey on young children for sex and grooming talks.\r\n\r\nThe rooms are meant to be moderated but they can not be there all the time and are not 100% effective when they are their. Some of the rooms have open web cams for public viewing and anyone can go in and view and come across obscene sights.\r\n\r\nThe kids and teen rooms seem to be full over people to old or too young to be there.\r\n\r\nThe site is a danger to all those who go in to them.\r\n ",
