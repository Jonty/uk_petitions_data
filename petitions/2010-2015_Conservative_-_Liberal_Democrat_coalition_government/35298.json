        "additional_details": "The recent weather in the UK has been totally unacceptable. The rain spoilt the diamond jubilee celebrations, has ruined the homes and livelihoods of many people, and ruined peoples' holidays. Countries like Russia and China use weather modification to ensure fine weather for important events. This petition requests the government ensures either the Met office does the same to ensure fine weather for future events, and also at least a month of warm dry aunny weather each summer, or it is abolished and replaced with a superior organisation.",
