        "additional_details": "As a part of diversity in schools, I think at least once the children should be taught about the topic of vegetarianism and veganism.\r\n\r\nI think this may help reduce any bullying in schools due to their belief by understanding.\r\n\r\nI think the lesson should consist of reasons why people are vegetarian and vegan by covering topics. The topics/reasons could consist of:\r\nReligious reasons\r\nSpiritual reasons\r\nEthical reasons (treatment of animals etc. )\r\nHealth reasons/benefit\r\n\r\nI tried to make this petition before but it was taken off because I was apparently pushing belief. I just want to state that I am not vegetarian and I simply feel it should be taught for diversity.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like the education system to talk about this topic with pupils even if it's just for 1 hour so that people can understand another difference about that minority of people (vegetarians and vegans).
