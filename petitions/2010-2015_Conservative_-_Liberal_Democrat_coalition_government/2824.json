        "additional_details": "The proposed child benefit changes are not fair. The proposals are to withdraw child benefit completely for families where one parent only just pays higher rate tax and the other looks after the home or has a low income, whilst those families with both parents earning just below the higher rate of tax, almost twice as much, are entitled to child benefit in full. It makes no sense.\r\n\r\nThe Government need to change the measure used to be on joint or household income. Clearly the second family in the example above should receive less than the former.",
