        "additional_details": "The current preferred route to a new station at Toton is not practical since the present infrastructure (road and rail links) makes access to Toton difficult. Derby already has an established rail network and station, not building a new 239 Hectare site at Toton including 33 Hectares of green belt will save money. Choosing this route would also mean that it would not be necessary to build a 2km tunnel beneath East Midlands Airport another huge saving. Please give your support to Derby.",
