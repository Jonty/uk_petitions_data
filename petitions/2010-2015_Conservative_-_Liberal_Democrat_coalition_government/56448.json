        "additional_details": "Marrons Planning are proposing to build up to 65 houses off of Cropston Road.\r\n\r\nThe village is already struggling to cope with traffic, doctors & schooling etc.\r\n\r\nWe will not know the true impact what Davidsons developements will have on the village yet until they are finished and now another developer wants to add a further 65 houses, 130 plus cars to the roads, 100 children to find school places for?\r\n\r\nAnstey is slowing murging into surrounding villages, this will take us nearer to Thurcaston, (who are also battling to keep rural), and Cropston.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to try and STOP Anstey from becoming a town!",
