        "additional_details": "Denmark is involved in a shameful practice of animal cruelty! This subject has been raised and petitioned against before, without success! Please sign and share if you agree that the EU and other governments should impose sanctions against Denmark until this is stopped! The sea is stained red with blood because of the cruelty of human beings who kill hundreds of the famous and intelligent Calderon dolphins! This happens every year in Feroe Island part of Denmark. In this slaughter the main participants are young teens, WHY?\u00a0A celebration, to show that they are adults.\u00a0Is it necessary to mention that the dolphin Calderon, like all the other species of dolphins, it\u2019s near extinction.\u00a0They don\u2019t die instantly; they are cut 1, 2 or 3 times with thick hooks. And at that time the dolphins produce a grim cry like that of a new born child.\u00a0There\u2019s no compassion while this magnificent creature slowly dies in its own blood! PLEASE SIGN AND SHARE!",
