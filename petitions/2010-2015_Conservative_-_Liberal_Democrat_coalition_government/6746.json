        "additional_details": "If a driver of a vehicle causes the death of someone whilst under the influence of drink or drugs or as a direct result of dangerous driving, especially if they also have no licence, insurance, MOT etc, charge them with manslaughter rather than slapping them on the wrist with a pathetic 'causing death by dangerous driving' charge which carries a ridiculously minor penalty. If you punch someone and they die after hitting their head on the ground you can be charged with manslaughter so how is hitting someone with a car any different? ",
