        "additional_details": "The 26 seats in the House of Lords permanently reserved for the prelates of the Church of England are an anachronism and have no place in a modern democratic parliament. There is no justification either practical or moral for having dedicated separate representation of religion over and above that already exercised by individual citizens.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the Home Secretary as the Minister responsible for equality and anti-discrimination policy to introduce legislation in the next (post 2015 election) parliament to abolish these unwanted aberrations.",
