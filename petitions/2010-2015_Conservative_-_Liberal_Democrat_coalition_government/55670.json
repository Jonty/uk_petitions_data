        "additional_details": "There is, it seems, no town, city or village without at least one disused, uninhabitable or derelict building which goes untouched for decades whilst all around us new housing estates are continually appearing. With the very real threat from global warming it is our duty to protect our land and resources.\r\nThis petition is asking that the Government scraps plans to build new homes (200,000 in next 4 year's) nationally and instead focuses on   the renovation of existing unused buildings; enhancing the visual environment, protecting our land, recycling resources and conserving energy.",
