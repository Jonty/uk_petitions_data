        "additional_details": "Some if not all multinationals spend huge amounts to arrange their affairs to avoid UK tax. This seems to be legal but grossely unfair to this country and to firms that don't cheat.\r\nFor example, Google UK receives huge advertising revenues but pays almost no corporation tax here by claiming massive so called expenses from zero tax Bermuda. see http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-shows-how-60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes.html\r\n\r\nChange the law or interpretation to insist each company proves it has paid the equivalent of UK corporation tax on all amounts it is claiming as costs or deductions. Otherwise, UK tax amounting to the difference will be payable.\r\n\r\nSome companies may threaten to leave the country but most will be empty threats and the pillaging will be halted.",
