        "additional_details": "As a means of increasing police numbers and further involving communities why not introduce a territorial type service, much like the retained firefighter or coastguard, enthusiastic ratepayers can join the force and aid the policing of their own neighbourhoods therby increasing numbers and overall feeling of security in the area. This way policing would be integrated into our community rather than remain at arms length unable to react quickly enough and able to cope with a wider range of disturbances.",
