Why is it we have days off for Christmas and we have schools that break up for Easter but yet no recognition for other religion. Wouldn't it be nice to have these religious holidays put into everyone's calendars and have a public day off work or school an spend time with your family.\r\n\r\nWe need to sign this petition people so we can make this happen and be equal in Britain. If we can get as many signatures to make this happen. America has already done this.\r\n\r\n",
