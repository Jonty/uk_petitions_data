Specifically, to allow players to communicate with their squadmates in-game without having to pre-arrange the match with those same people.\r\n\r\nAs the UK is a world leader in the PC and video games market, as the VAT on copies of the game sold in the UK will generate millions of pounds for the Exchequer, and as there is so  we feel that the UK government has legitimate cause to discuss this issue in an adjournment debate.",
