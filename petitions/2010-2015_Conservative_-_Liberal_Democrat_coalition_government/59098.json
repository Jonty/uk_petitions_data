        "additional_details": "Following the conviction of a female for the most despicable paedophilic crimes against her own two children, one under the age of 5, and who was jailed for 10 years & 8 months in 2007 (soon due for release, if not already), I petition for the creation of an International Sex Offenders Register.  Upon release, this thing, and her like, could leave this country committing the same crimes in others without any country being forewarned of the danger.  Conversely, an International Register will flag up those entering this country, who should be forced to comply with the same rules as those on the Sex Offenders Register already in place in the UK. Let us try and protect children worldwide.",
