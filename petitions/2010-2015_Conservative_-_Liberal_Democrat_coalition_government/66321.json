        "additional_details": "Adrian Chiles is simply the worst TV presenter to ever appear on TV. Couple this with the fact he landed the jackpot by presenting the nations most loved sport, and travelling the world to do so, is nothing short of obscene.\r\nHe offers no insight into the beautiful game and patronises ex-professional players with his ridiculous opinions that often distract from the subject and his worthless and nauseating 'banter'\r\nHis poor personal skills seems to rub every football fan the wrong way and people are simply sick of him. A brief look on any social media site during the time he is on demonstrates the disdain people feel towards him. I heard him once comment on the type of stadium brickwork during and FA Cup game build up. Why?\r\nI would like this petition to highlight the need to prevent Chiles presenting any more football based programmes or events, if he remains I may end up going clinically insane and spending the rest of my days muttering 'Chiles.. No Chiles..bring back Jimmy Hill'",
