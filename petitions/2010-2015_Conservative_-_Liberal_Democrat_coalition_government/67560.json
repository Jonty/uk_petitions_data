        "additional_details": "As of 2014, immigrants are coming to this country with the sole intentions of claiming benefits and doing nothing to put money back into the pot.  This is pure exploitation of our benefit system, and it time to stop.\r\n\r\nBy signing this petition you want the UK Government to stop paying immigrants Benefits if they have not paid anything into the tax system for a minimum of 5 years total.  They must have worked in a job that have provided tax and national insurance from day one.\r\n\r\nNew immigrants should not be entitled to any benefits of any kind without securing a job for a minimum of 5 years before any entitlements.",
