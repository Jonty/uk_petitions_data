That would be a deterrent and major cost saving.\r\nIn the UK it costs over \u00a340000 per annum to keep someone in Jail, in Thailand its costs them circa \u00a3450 per annum.\r\nPrison isnt supposed to be nice. Do you think people would re-offend for petty offences knowing the destination of the prison?\r\nUse the UK prisons as holding pens for weekly transport flights to said destination.\r\nSave money, reduce the re-offending rate dramatically and help the 3rd world financially!!\r\n\r\n",
