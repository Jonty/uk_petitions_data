        "additional_details": "There are so many bad and serious accidents on our roads today. Also drivers are ignorant to the laws of the road system.\r\nThere should be an education system put in place every two years for every driver who holds a driving licence.\r\nA classroom examination and a pratical driving examination by a qualified driving instructor.\r\nThis will bring money into the treasury. This will possibly remove dangerous and bad drivers from the roads. Another driving test should be selected to prove that a driver is safe on the road. Convicted/cautioned drivers should take exams every six months, if they are not disqualified.",
