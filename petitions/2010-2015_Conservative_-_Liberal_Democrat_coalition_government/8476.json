        "additional_details": "Roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the family unit are not clearly defined, which mean it is not easy to determine legal responsibility.\r\n\r\nThis petition proposes that parents be legally responsible for all of their children's actions until the age of 16 (or 18). The child will also be jointly responsible for their own actions. This should also extend to absent fathers (and mothers).\r\n\r\nThis will have the effect of motivating parents to keep a check on their children's actions and to prevent them passing the buck and stigmatise poor parenting at all levels in the community.\r\n\r\nChildren will be accountable to their parents, parents will be accountable to society.\r\n\r\nFirst offences may result in a community service punishment, where the parents and the child jointly do community service.",
