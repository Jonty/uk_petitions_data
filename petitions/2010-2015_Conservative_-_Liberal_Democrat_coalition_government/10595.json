They say they have spoken to the Chief Officers who as usual paint a 'rosy' picture. The Goverment should be talking to the troops on the front line to get a true picture. When they do speak to the front line Officers they do it on a surprise visit so no Senior Officer can be primed up by a Senior Officer as to what he should and should not say.",
