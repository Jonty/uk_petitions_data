        "additional_details": "There have been calls for Facebook and Twitter to protect people against online bullying by the banning of  accounts  and the  removal of  pages like 'spotted', 'Tell him/Tell Her' etc. These sites allow people space to post anonymous abuse aimed very specifically at individuals who can identify themselves - yet not know who has posted the threatening, sexist or degrading comment, with the moderation  of comments and posts left to the people who created the page.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these sites are not constantly moderated results in a  breeding ground for bullies to play their anonymous hand, protected from any repercussions.\r\n\r\nPlease support this petition. This issue urgently needs to be brought to the Government's attention to apply pressure on Twitter and Facebook forcing them to address their Terms of Service and operating procedures in dealing with online abuse.\r\n",
