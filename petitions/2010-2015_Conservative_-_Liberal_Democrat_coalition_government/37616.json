        "additional_details": "We ask HM Government to Pardon Temperance Lloyd, Susannah Edwards and Mary Trembles of Bideford for the crime of Witchcraft.\r\n\r\nThey were hanged on August 25th 1682 at Heavitree, Exeter, convicted for actions they could not have committed, under a law that no longer exists.\r\nThey were convicted on hearsay evidence under the 1604 Statute against Witchcraft devised under King James I - who believed his cousin had tried to assassinate him by raising a storm at sea using witchcraft.\r\nLeading theologians abetted their conviction by defining the \"Attributes of Witches\" and by declaring \"to deny witchcraft is to deny God\".\r\nThe assizes Justices did not believe them guilty but responded to an angry mob that called for a hanging.\r\n\r\nPardoning the \"Bideford Witches\" would acknowledge their innocence and that of over 450 others executed in the name of good government.
