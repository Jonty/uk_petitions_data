        "additional_details": "This petition is created in direct response to the wholly appalling, unethical and profiteering practices carried out by so-called secondary selling sites in their business roles of having become large scale formalised touts, scalping massive profits from the public in the reselling of tickets to major musical and sporting events for unregulated and extortionate price hikes.\r\n\r\nIt is in support of the campaign by MP Sharon Hodgson to have a bill passed through parliament which will see legislation brought in to control these practices. Something which so far every other country has failed to do.\r\n\r\nIt uses the same name as the twitter hashtag for her campaign, #tickettoutsbill, and information on how the bill is progressing and how to contact and petition your local MP can be found on her website http://j.mp/Fans1st.\r\n\r\nMore information about secondary selling sites (such as Viagogo and seatwave) can be found by viewing the Channel 4 Dispatches program The Great Ticket Scandal.",
