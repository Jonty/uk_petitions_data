        "additional_details": "We call on Parliament to cease operating a central bank or a base rate of interest. Having such a system only fuels inflation in the economy as banks generally have to pass on the base rate at least as a form of interest on debt. Abolishing the base rate helps to move us from the perpetual illusion of the growing economy to a steady state economy where the main goal is to improve the quality of life for citizens without damaging the environment and through using resources in a sustainable manner.",
