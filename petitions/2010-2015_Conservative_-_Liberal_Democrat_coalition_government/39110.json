By blaspheming and defaming the blessed personality of the holy prophet (PBUH) this vile group of people and their disgraceful supporters have disregarded, and indeed totally trampled on the feelings of so many Muslims across the UK and the world at large.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the British Government to use all means at its disposal to prevent the incendiary effects of this movie within the borders of the United Kingdom. We call upon the Government to join us in condemning the incitement of religious hatred that is promoted from this loathsome movie\r\n",
