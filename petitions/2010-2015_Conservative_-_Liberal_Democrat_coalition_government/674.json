        "additional_details": "Due to the use of Bad Language and sexual images on TV just after 9pm,I believe some young child even as young as 8-13 yr olds will be present whilst parents watch TV or even allowed TV in their bedrooms at this time. Over the past few years bad language, lewd talk and sexual images etc have been shown immediately after 9pm. I feel it is time for the Department for Media to act for moving this time from 9pm to 10:30pm if not later. Some would advocate turning off TV when this happens but I suggest if the TV Companies had a shred of decency they would do this voluntary.",
