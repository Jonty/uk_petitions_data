If any refusal, benefits to stop!!! coaches/trains from towns to transport our civilians to the nearest army barracks to be trained by our army. We need to show these terrorists we are NOT going to roll over and sit back and wait to be taken over. We have men who are able, some willing, to stand united and defend our country. I personally am terrified for what the future holds for my country and feel useless, so sat at home with my children, looking at what the future holds for them, I have nothing to defend and protect them from these animals. gun laws restrict, so how do I defend my friends and family!!?? I need to know our boys are standing strong. This will cost no more to the government as benefits will still be paid to those who training.",
