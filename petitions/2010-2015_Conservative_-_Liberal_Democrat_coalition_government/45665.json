Over 65,000 litres are disposed of as clinical waste each year. Only 50,000 litres are needed to meet over 80% of transplant needs.\r\n\r\nMany parents wish to be able to do this and many simply do not know they can. Currently only a handful of hospitals offer this.\r\n\r\nOn the day you give birth, you can give life twice!",
