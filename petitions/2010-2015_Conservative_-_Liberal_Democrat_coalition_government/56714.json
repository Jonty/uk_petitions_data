        "additional_details": "Stop HS2 from destroying Barnsley protected and endangered wildlife. They plan to destroy ancient woodlands near Wombwell, Rabbit Ings at Royston and Carlton Marsh wetlands. This is not necessary as other routes could be used,and apart from the land being contaminated and sealed it would cost them millions to clear the areas up. The train line is to be so big it will virtually wipe out the areas involved, not to mention the works before hand to build it. Once we lose the areas they will be gone forever.  please sign this petition we need 100,000 signatures to get this through parliament please help.",
