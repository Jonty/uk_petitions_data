Government ministers, BBC workers, NHS Managers, Councillors, Police Chiefs, QUANGO people etc NONE of THEM!\r\n\u00a3100,000 is a huge sum, and if they want more, they can go to the private sector.\r\nIt is recognised that management is needed and is a rarer skill than some labour. But the chiefs get too much money for this from us.\r\nThis will make sure there is enough money for the real people who do the actual work.",
