        "additional_details": "It is still to easy for people to purchase 2 foot rabbit hutches, these are often sold as \"stackable breeding hutches\" or \"starter hutches\" They allow no room for movement (even small breeds cannot move freely) and most rabbits are around 2ft long when stretched out. These are inhumane, they are in many ways against UK welfare laws, they allow no space for the rabbit to show natural behaviours, only one rabbit can physically fit into these boxes (meaning that their needs to be kept in pairs or groups, as social animals, are not met) and the cramped conditions and lack of movement causes severe suffering from long term health issues. We think that in order to ensure no more rabbits are forced to live in these boxes they should be banned from sale completely. ",
