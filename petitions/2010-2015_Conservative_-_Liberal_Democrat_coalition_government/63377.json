These people have never been interviewed by Police, it has been dealt with 'in-house' which makes perjury outside the Govt a mockery and bias. We want the same criminal enquiries carried out that anyone else would be subjected to with the same ramifications. In cases where it is an MP then that MP's Constituency has the right to call an immediate BY-ELECTION!",
