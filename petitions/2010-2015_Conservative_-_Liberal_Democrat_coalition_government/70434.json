        "additional_details": "I am petitioning for the regeneration of the area surrounding the Tottenham Hotspur White Hart Lane stadium. One landowner is appealing the rightful Compulsory Purchase Order issued by the Secretary of State (itself taking far too long) and this is delaying the regeneration of the entire area. Such regeneration would create many jobs basically bringing a derelict area into the 21st century and vastly increase local revenue. This ridiculous appeal by a greedy landowner needs throwing out as soon as possible allowing this much needed work to begin. The football club should be applauded for investing so heavily in the area.",
