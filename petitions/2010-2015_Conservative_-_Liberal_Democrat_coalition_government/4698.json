This needs to be investigated immediately.\r\n\r\nPending the outcome of the investigation all planned price rises should be put on hold.\r\n\r\nWhen the investigation is complete all suppliers found to have participated in the cartel should be fined their last 5 years profits and have their license to operate in the UK withdrawn. Directors, past and present found to have been aware of the cartel or operated within it should be prosecuted.",
