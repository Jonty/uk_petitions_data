        "additional_details": "There are many law suits in the civil courts which simply would never have occurred a few years ago and compensation culture is now running rampant. This needs to be stopped. I propose a solution herein. I propose that a two tier system be adopted that places on tier one (no deposit required) suits arising from serious injury or death with serious being defined as loss of a limb, both eyes, etc. Or where the immediate (not eventual) financial loss is greater than GBP400,000. Tier 2 would contain all other cases, and in order to make it into the courts as a tier 2 case a deposit of GBP10,000 would be payable, refundable only on winning the case. In the event of loss then 80% of this deposit would go towards the defending sides costs with 20% retained by the courts to improve court facilities, etc. ",
