        "additional_details": "Amendment to the outdated Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol) Act 1985 to allow local licensing authorities to decide when and where alcohol can be served at football matches in line with other sporting events.\r\n\r\nThis law should be amended for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nDiscriminatory - This discriminates against football fans and reeks of class bias.\r\n\r\nAnti-Competitive - The law as it stands clearly gives other sports clubs e.g. rugby clubs, an unfair competitive advantage over football clubs in their sales of hospitality and sponsorship packages especially when they share a city or even a stadium.\r\n\r\nOutdated - Football has changed beyond all recognition in recent years.  The reason for the implementation of the act is no longer valid.\r\n\r\nThe decision on which games and which areas should be granted a license should be left to the local authority who understand any risks rather than a blanket ban.",
