        "additional_details": "The recent Facebook Terms of Service agreement change (TOS) and the changes to the Facebook Messaging system now provides means for anyone, children in particular to be sent un-solicited messages via their inbox. Since 20nd-21st Dec 2012 facebook have been rolling out changes to their system which unlike the previous privacy settings which would allow you to only receive mesages from friends or friends of friends, now allow basically anyone to send you a message. I have checked the validity of this claim of potential abuse. At present Facebook are testing in the USA a $1 per message system which allows anyone prepared to pay $1 to bypass your 'OTHER' message inbox aswell and have it sent direct to your 'INBOX'.\r\n\r\nI ask the Home Office to urgently look at this issue as the potential risk to children is huge.",
