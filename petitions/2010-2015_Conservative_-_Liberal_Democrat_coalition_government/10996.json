        "additional_details": "We have all seen prisoners on the news, in newspapers, magazines and books who have murdered, raped, abused and stolen and who live in their cells with Flatscreen TV's, Xbox's, on-suite showers and safes so that nobody steals their belongings (they should have nothing worth stealing in prison).\r\n\r\nLets get this sorted! They have hurt people and broken the law, why should they then be 'treated' to a holiday camp! They leave prison feeling good about their experience.  This is not right and these prison rules are making a laughing stock of the UK.  Get tough on criminals and leave the soft britain behind for good.  Genuine good citizens may not be able to afford a full Sky HD Package, but our government give criminals this luxuary!\r\n\r\nSign this petition and make our UK Prisons somewhere to be scared of, and learn the bad people a lesson.",
