They say if you don't pay we will re-home or destroy your animal knowing that it already has a good home. This has happened to me and my dog Rocky was held for two days even though we offered payment. This has to stop. Your dog your property and the financial side is a civil matter. My MP Andrew Selous has already expressed concern. Please help.",
