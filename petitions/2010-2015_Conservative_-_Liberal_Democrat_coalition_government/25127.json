        "additional_details": "Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy agreed the EU needs a new treaty to bring in changes which they insist will prevent a repeat of the current debt crisis.\r\n\r\nThe French and German leaders unveiled tough new plans - with sanctions to penalise countries that overspend - that they said would ensure the survival of the single currency.\r\n\r\nThey will present their outline, which will involve bringing all changes into a new single treaty, to European leaders at a summit on Thursday 8th December.\r\n\r\nBefore the UK signs any new treaty the public should have the right to say whether or not they agree with the new treaty.  We want the Government to call a referendum on the signing of any new EU treaty.\r\n\r\n",
