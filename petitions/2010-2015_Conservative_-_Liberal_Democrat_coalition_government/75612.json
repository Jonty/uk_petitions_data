I have overwhelming evidence.\r\nThe police bureaucracy has done nothing but waste time. There is a 2 day wait for their action fraud to call you back. And 28 days to investigate. Surely 28 days is enough for someone to scam as many as possible, close their account and leave without trace.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the company is active and they are still scamming people. Something needs to get done urgently. This online fraud can be stopped without bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nThere is an active bank account which can be linked to these criminals, please sign this petition.\r\n\r\n",
