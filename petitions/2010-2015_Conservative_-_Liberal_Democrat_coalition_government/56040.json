Not only will this effect our community as the center is widely used by many parents but also its putting jobs at risk!\r\nThe childrens center is not only a great place to take your children but its also a life saver for many people who are struggling and need help and support from the fantastic staff members.\r\nThey help with making sure families get what benefits they are entitled to, give information on how to access local food banks and also support with pre and post natal depression along with much much more. So please sign this petition to help keep the childrens center open.  ",
