        "additional_details": "This petition calls on the Government to introduce legislation that ensures all airbrushed images in media are clearly accompanied by a statement revealing the image has been airbrushed and thus is not a realistic image.\r\n\r\nThis petition believes this must be done to scale back the constant bombardment of what is perfection by the media on impressionable young people in particular. This petition believes people should be allowed to develop their own image, rather than have dictated to them how they must aspire to look by magazines, newspapers, adverts and media in general.\r\n\r\nThis petition does not believe airbrushed images must be banned, but it does believe that people have the right to know what has been airbrushed.",
