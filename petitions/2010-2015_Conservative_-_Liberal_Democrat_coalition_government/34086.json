Any process which requires HomeOffice to approve a file in order to release a work permit takes at least 5 months! No employer will accept waiting that long for a resource!\r\n\r\nSocial classes affected: ALL potential full time permanent employees (\u00a36 ph - \u00a350k+ pa) & ALL entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nAvailable for any questions,\r\nBogdan Ciocoiu\r\nbogdan.ciocoiu@bogdans.co.uk",
