        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned demand a ban for all lorries/HGVs on B roads and country lanes nationwide.-Most of these roads are too narrow and do not allow oncoming vehicles to pass or overtake. When HGVs exceed the speed limit\u2013which is frequently the case - other vehicles are forced to take evasive action which is often very dangerous especially in bad weather conditions. Nowadays, HGV drivers are using satellite navigation systems in order to find shortcuts and avoid traffic jams. It is unacceptable that the pressure of delivering goods in time justifies inappropriate driving behavior and leads to an overuse of UK\u2019s B roads and country roads and therefore puts people\u2019s lives at stake.We need to ensure that these roads are safe for us and our children. We therefore plead for better signage (eg. \u201cUnsuitable for HGVs), more control through the police and fines for non-compliance.",
