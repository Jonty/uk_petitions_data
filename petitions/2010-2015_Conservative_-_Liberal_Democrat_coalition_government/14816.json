We have remembrance Sunday also no bank holiday for the fallen.  With the successful Armed Forces days that have already taken place, the Nations obvious support for Help for Hero's and the the many fantastic organisations supporting both living and families of the bereaved  I believe that we should and could commemorate all in a bank holiday.\r\nAn ideal day for this would be to use the already existing 1st May. The father of a fallen solider - Gary Pritchard. RIP Michael Pritchard.",
