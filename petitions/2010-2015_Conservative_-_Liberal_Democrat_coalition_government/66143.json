        "additional_details": "Plans are in place to deny deaf people with mild to moderate hearing loss a hearing aid on the NHS. New proposals by health bosses in some areas (initially Staffordshire), will mean only those with severe hearing loss will qualify for the devices. Fears are that other areas will follow.\r\nHearing loss is a serious issue which if ignored can lead to dementia, isolation and mental health problems.\r\nHearing aids offer a lifeline to many, especially older people, many who live alone and who would be sitting at home unable to communicate.\r\nMild hearing loss means people find it difficult to follow a conversation in a crowded room, moderate hearing loss means someone has to turn the TV volume up much louder to hear it properly.\r\nYet again it's the most vulnerable in society who will suffer most from the proposed cuts. Please sign and support this petition, and stop these outrageous and discriminatory proposals from happening. Thank You. Helen Donovan (double NHS hearing aid wearer).",
