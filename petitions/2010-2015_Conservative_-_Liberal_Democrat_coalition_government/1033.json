The heredity principle of our head of state is inimical  to the principle  of  the sovereignty of the people. The existence of the monarchy is therefore  anti-democratic . A further consequence of this will be a revocation of an established church, of which the monarch is the titular head. This will  establish an equality of  all religions or  none at all,  without the privileges  attached to the established church.\r\n",
