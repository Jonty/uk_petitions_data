Today in Britain only offenders have access to firearms, and innocent people are paying the price. The law should be changed to allow all UK citizens by birth that have a clean police record and are over the age of twenty five to own a firearm for self-defence within the home.\r\n\r\nUK citizens of good character should have the right to own any type of hand held pistol, shot gun and rifle excluding semi and automatic weapons.\r\n\r\nIt should also be allowed that citizens can carry weapons after undergoing full training and membership of a firearms club.\r\n",
