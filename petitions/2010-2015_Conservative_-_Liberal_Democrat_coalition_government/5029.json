        "additional_details": "Major trunk route HGV speed limit\r\nThe HGV speed limit on all A classification roads is currently set at 40mph, for cars the limit is 60mph. This limit difference causes frustration and danger from cars overtaking .\r\nSafety would be improved by increasing the limit due to the reduced overtaking required.\r\nPrevious government debates have had no objection to an increase to 50mph but argue that few trucks obey the 40mph rule and do not want to encourage even higher speeds!  So few HGV\u2019s obey the 40mph limit because it is too dangerous to do so, trucks are currently speed limited to 56mph.\r\nHGV\u2019s pulling over to allow faster moving vehicles to pass is not practical nor environmentally friendly. The pollution caused during the operation will be astounding with a 44tonner getting ess than 2mpg during acceleration.\r\n\r\n",
