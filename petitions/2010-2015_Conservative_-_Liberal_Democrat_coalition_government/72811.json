        "additional_details": "There is a significant amount of data showing that the consumption of meat is a major contributor to global warming, and yet peoples' awareness of this contribution is disproportionately low with respect to the damage caused.  One of the latest papers can be read here (PDF):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/field/field_document/20141203LivestockClimateChangeBaileyFroggattWellesley.pdf\r\n\r\nThis petition calls upon the Government to introduce a tax on meat products in accordance with the damage they do to the environment.  The tax would raise revenue which could be used to research, promote and fund work to reduce climate change.  It would also encourage people to change their behaviour in a manner commensurate with the damage they are causing to the environment.",
