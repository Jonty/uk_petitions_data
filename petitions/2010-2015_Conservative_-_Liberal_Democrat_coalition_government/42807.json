        "action": "Stop penalising old age pensioners with vehicle tax",
        "additional_details": "The road tax affects old age pensioners much more than most other group of people.\r\nQuite often a pensioner would only be able to visit their grandchildren about once a month. This means that even before they start their journey, it will cost them (assuming band G rate of \u00a3170) \u00a314. To a pensioner this represents a significant amount.\r\nFor people such as BBC directors on \u00a3450,000 per year, as opposed to pensioners on \u00a34,940 per year (a difference of 91 times) the car tax is insignificant.\r\nThe government should abolish the car tax and add a small amount to tax on petrol.\r\nWhen the savings at the DVLA, cost of printing the license disks, cost at post offices for the administration are taken into account. Only a very small increase in cost of petrol would be required to recover the same amount of tax.\r\nThis would also mean that those who use the road most and who use gas guzzling cars, would pay the most tax.  A much more equitable system.\r\n",
