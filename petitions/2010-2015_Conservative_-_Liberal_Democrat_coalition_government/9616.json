        "additional_details": "Parents can really educate their kids in a more proper way without being frightened of losing their kids to the social services if they show a tough tone. Unfortunately the schools and even nurseries are teaching the kids to dial 999 if they feel upset with their parents but the kids are abusing this system against their loving parents who are scared to lose them incase the social services gets involved. The government was asking parents to call their kids from the streets during the riots but the kids were showing no sign of respect to their parents because that's what they have been taught. The government should really reconsider their policy towards parents who knows how to put  their kids on the right track without using the social services as a weapon to threat the parents. ",
