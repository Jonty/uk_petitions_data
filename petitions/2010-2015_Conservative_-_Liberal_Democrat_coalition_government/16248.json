        "additional_details": "Currently, petitions which gain 100,000 signatures are offered only \"consideration\" for parliamentary debate.  I propose a new parliamentary rule, or law - if necessary, is adopted such that any petition that is signed by more than 100,000 citizens should be guaranteed a parliamentary debate.\r\n\r\nProblems of potential time wasting can be addressed by allowing any Member of the House to propose a motion to cut-short the debate at any time, thereby allowing debates to be abandoned if the majority of the house wish.\r\n\r\nHowever, I feel it is important for democracy that the House, and not the government of the day, should have the ultimate decision over whether a debate should proceed.  I propose the best way of making this happen is to guarantee that a debate will commence for every petition that reaches 100,000 signatures.",
