        "additional_details": "Challenge 25 is a disgrace!! How can the government allow it is beyond me! Here is my scenario, I go to my local shop to buy cigarettes I am 25 in two weeks, I don't carry ID with me as everybody bar one member of staff has seen it. That particular member of staff was working so I asked for my cigarettes and I am asked for ID which I reply well I do not have it as I am a regular customer so she tells me she can not serve me.It does not matter that I have two children, I pay my taxes, I own my own house (last time I checked you had to be over 18 to do) but I am being dictated to by someone when I can buy a packet of cigarettes!! Sorry but that should be MY choice! Young men can join the army at 17 but can not buy a packet of cigarettes! You can get married at 16 but still cant buy a packet of cigarettes! This country is backwards and very confusing. You changed the legal age to 18 but are still expected to carry ID 7 years later!\r\n ",
