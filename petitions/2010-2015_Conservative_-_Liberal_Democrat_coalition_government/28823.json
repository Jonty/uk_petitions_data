        "additional_details": "I would like the government to stop giving aid primarily to India and all countries that have no genuine need for it. We cannot keep this so called soft power funding of emerging nations of the far east especially when the named country is funding huge expanses in their military power (much bigger than ours) and a space programme to boot. If there street children are supposedly the cause of this money then why doesnt their own government divert funds from these excesses and put it into helping their own children. This money is supposed to gain the United Kingdom influence in these areas but alas this has failed as they have just awarded the French a contract for their new warplanes instead of the BAE consortium. This has cost many hundreds of UK jobs.",
