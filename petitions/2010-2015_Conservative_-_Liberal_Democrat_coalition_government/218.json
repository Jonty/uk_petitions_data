Compensate where necessary and re-invest in branch railways.\r\nThe permanent high volume of heavy traffic on roads is overwhelming. Travel for motorists will be easier and ultimately it will help the environment. But no one should lose financially. There will still be a need for short distance haulage and local haulage. Difficult but possible.",
