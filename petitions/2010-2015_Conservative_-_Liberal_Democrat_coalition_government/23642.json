If children were educated to understand the differences and needs of those who experirence difficultes, less bullying would occur and society would be more accepting of the social model of disability. I would like to see disability awareness taught in all schools across the UK and call upon the government to include this as part of the school curriculum.\r\n\r\nPlease help me make this a reality and society a better place for all.
