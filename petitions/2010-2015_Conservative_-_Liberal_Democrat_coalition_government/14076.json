        "additional_details": "As the RoOA stands people with even minor convictions are discriminated for 5 years making obtaining employment, setting up a business or obtaining insurance virtually impossible. This leaves people either dependant on benefits until the conviction is spent or more likely to resort to further crime. We petition the prime minister to help offenders who wish to reform by amending the RoOA as follows: 1. Reduce the rehabilitation period for fines and community sentences from 5 years to 2 1/2 years,\r\n2. Respect the right to privacy under the human rights act by only requiring someone to disclose an unspent conviction if it is relevant (eg fraud for applying for insurance or applying to work with money),\r\n3. Further respect the right to privacy by ordering police to destroy fingerprint and DNA records of any convicted criminal considered rehabilitated under the RoOA on the basis that if they committed any further crime they would then be permanently placed back on the database",
