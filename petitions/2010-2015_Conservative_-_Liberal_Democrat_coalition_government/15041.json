        "additional_details": "Did you know that \"In modern times the main driver of economic growth has been, and continues to be, energy\" - all economists and all informed politicians do though most prefer not to say so.\r\n\r\nNuclear power is the cheapest, safest, most reliable source of electricity. Even though most of the current cost is made up of government regulations.\r\n\r\nThe AP1000 reactor is sold, off the shelf for $1 bn bought in quantity. We could have match all of our current power for \u00a336 bn. Government intends to spend 100s of billions building windmills to replace 1/3rd. To get out of recession we have to produce more power at lower cost. Currently Britain has the most expensive electricity of any sizeable country in the world and Parliament is committed to massively raising the price.\r\n\r\nWe also see 25,000 pensioners dying unnecessarily annually from fuel poverty.\r\n\r\nWe call for Parliament to get out of the way and allow the free market to build as much nuclear capacity as there is a market for.",
