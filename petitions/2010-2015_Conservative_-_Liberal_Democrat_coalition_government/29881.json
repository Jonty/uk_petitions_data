        "additional_details": "While we welcome new technology in Vascular Services, we object to the removal of these services from Halton, Warrington, and Whiston Hospitals.\r\n\r\nWe therefore want the Government to reconsider relocating Vascular care to only the Countess of Chester and Royal Liverpool Hospitals.\r\n\r\nWe fear other services could be jeopardised, and that proposals for the Countess of Chester Hospital to become a centre of excellence for vascular surgery could cause waiting lists to soar and operating theatres to close.\r\n\r\nAccidents on motorways, often cause gridlock, making it difficult to reach Chester and Liverpool.\r\nLocally there is a reliance on public transport, due to levels of deprivation.  This would make time-critical hospital-based treatment a problem.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this e-petition which will force a Parliamentary debate if it reaches 100,000.\r\nDon\u2019t forget \u2013 to get your name added to the e-petition you will be sent an email and you need to respond.
