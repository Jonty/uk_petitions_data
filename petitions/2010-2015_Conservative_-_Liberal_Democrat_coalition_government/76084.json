        "additional_details": "THE CASE\r\nCurrently, the absent partner can stop paying child support once the child turns 18 years old.\r\n\r\nThe government pays child benefit till the child is 19 years of age or until it leaves further education; the government also supports children through higher education, so why can't the absent parent continue to contribute to the child's welfare?\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM\r\nIt is unfair that as soon as the child turns 18, the main carer should shoulder the full financial responsibility for welfare of that child until s/he finishes higher education or leaves home.\r\n\r\nTHE PROPOSAL TO GOVERNMENT\r\nThe proposal to government is to raise the limit from 18 years old to 21 years or when the child finishes university.\r\n\r\nPlease support this petition. Thank you.",
