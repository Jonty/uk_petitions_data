        "additional_details": "It has been widely reported by news agencies online, however, there has been little or no TV coverage by the major UK news outlets about the attacks by Boko Haram in Baga, Nigeria that claimed the life of up to 2000 Nigerian citizens. I believe it will bring to the attention of the British public and to the world the scale of the atrocities being perpetrated by Boko Haram in Nigeria. A statement condemning Boko Haram for the attacks, made in the House of Commons I believe would be a good way to show solidarity with the Nigerian people.",
