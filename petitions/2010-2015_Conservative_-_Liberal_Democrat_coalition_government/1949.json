        "additional_details": "In the UK there is a severe organ donor shortfall with people in dire need of an organ transplant unable to be treated. In other European countries, such as Spain, which have opt-out systems there is a much higher donor rate saving thousands of lives. By introducing a similar system in the UK not only could thousands of lives be saved, but the public would also be able to retain the right to opt-out if they did not desire to be an organ donor. The British Medical Association has been campaigning for a change for over a decade and we believe that the time has come to take the only logical step to change the system as fast as possible to save as many lives as possible.",
