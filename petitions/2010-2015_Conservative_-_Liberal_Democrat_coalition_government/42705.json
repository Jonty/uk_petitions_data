MWA in 2012 missed it's government set-target of 5.5% and the Universal Jobmatch is only another scheme expected to fail with only the grievances of those rightfully claiming benefits having to suffer the hardship of threatened sanctions illegally, by a change in benefit that was never voted for by the British public not verbally/written that such Universal Jobmatch scheme is voluntary and without retribution towards claims if a direction is not followed (a direction is NOT an order or mandatory).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
