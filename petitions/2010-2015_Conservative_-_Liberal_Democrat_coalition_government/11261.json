        "additional_details": "I have just read on the Yahoo's news pages that the government has sold the London Olympic Village for \u00a3557 Million. These flats and shops cost the tax payer in excess of \u00a31 Billion. How is this a good deal for the tax payer at a time when London has a massive social housing problem and there is not enough social housing being build any where in the UK? Instead of selling it off to foreign companies who will pay no tax on its revenue in the future this housing should be split between first time buyers and people on low incomes who need social housing.",
