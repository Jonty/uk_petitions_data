There will be no AS or A2 examinations in January 2014.\" - taken from aqa.org.uk regarding government reforms to education.\r\n\r\nIt is simply unacceptable for students to sit exams in January 2013 only to have this right retracted in the following academic year - this isn't what we signed up for. As such it is imperative that the government modify proposals to allow students who began their course of study in the academic year beginning 2012 (and these students only, in line with proposed reforms) to sit exams in January 2014.",
