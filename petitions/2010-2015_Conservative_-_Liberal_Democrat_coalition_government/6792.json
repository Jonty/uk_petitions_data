        "additional_details": "Heathrow airport is now operating at maximum capacity. There is no possibility of further expansion without substantial disruption and pollution to the high density population areas surrounding the airport. Building a new multiple runway airport in the Thames Estuary will put London at the very centre of the European Air transport system. The benefits to Britain as a global business hub and the environmental improvements would be incalculable.",
