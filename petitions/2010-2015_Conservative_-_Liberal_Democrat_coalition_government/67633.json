        "additional_details": "Hull City council are removing all funding from West Hull Community Transport and also East Hull Community Transport. We have been given 90 days notice (today is the 16th July 2014) so after that time there will be no cheap and accessible transport available to the elderly, vulnerable, disabled etc people of Hull. Hull needs our vital service and also there are many members of staff who will become unemployed. Please help us reach 100,000 signatures so this situation can be debated by government and hopefully find a way to save our businesses.",
