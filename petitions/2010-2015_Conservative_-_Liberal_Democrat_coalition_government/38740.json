        "additional_details": "When our loved ones sign up for The Armed Services, go to active war zones and so on, they know what the dangers and risks are. By sending Prince Harry to Afganistan, an already volatile situation has been inflamed as the Taliban have their sights on him. This has put ALL of our other service wo/men at a sudden greater risk.\r\n\r\nWe call on the MOD to immediately withdraw Prince Harry from Afganistan. His wish to serve is admirable just like all troops, but the presence of one particular service man should not be allowed when it leads to such heightened risks for all other troops. ",
