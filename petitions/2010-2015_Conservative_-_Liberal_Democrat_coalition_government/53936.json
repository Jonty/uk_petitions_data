        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned demand a cap on the maintenance provided during Social Housing tenancies so that taxpayers are not penalised for the repeated destructive or careless behaviour of others. If they repeatedly smash windows these are replaced without question, holes in interior walls are repaired as often as they lose their temper, and even lost keys are greeted by a free locksmith \u2013 there is no limit on costs or repeated occurrences and no deterrent to deliberately damage in order to acquire new. Those paying for their own housing face consequences or repercussions for careless or destructive behaviour and those in social housing should face the same. ",
