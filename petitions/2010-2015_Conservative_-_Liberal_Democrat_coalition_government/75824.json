        "additional_details": "Scott Hall, a man with physical and learning disabilities was attacked in Newton Hall last July and 9 days later, he died of a brain haemorrhage.  He was punched on the face, knocked him to the ground and carry on kicking him on his back and shoulder.  Several witnesses reported he lost conciousness for a couple of minutes.  He spent his last days in fear.\r\n\r\nOne of the youths who attacked him changed his Facebook status to full time killer after the Mr Hall's death However an inquest could not find a link between the attack and Mr Hall's death 9 days later and the youths has been given community service.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to revise this sentence since it seems far too linient and an injustice to Mr Hall.\r\n",
