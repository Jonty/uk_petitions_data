This can have a profound impact when there are professional failings within an organisation that is protected by the NHS.\r\n\r\nEvery individual in this country deserves to receive consistent and transparent care.  NICE Guidelines are supposed to be the framework put in place for the NHS to provide the same standard of care and treatment across the board.  The guidelines are not worth the paper they are printed on if there are no repercussions when they are not followed?\r\n\r\nThe law should protect members of the public not the perpetrators who continue to provide abysmal care and get away with it because the NHS closes rank and hide behind a smoke screen.  Has nobody learnt from Staffordshire Enquiry?\r\n\r\n",
