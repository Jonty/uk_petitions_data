        "additional_details": "The UK government reported the statistics of child and adult obesity is going up every year, yet the price of healthy food, fruits and vegetable and gym membership is flying sky high!!\r\nIt is almost impossible to afford, a healthy meal for an average family, therefore people are relying and munching on junk food, which crazy enough- is much cheaper and affordable.\r\n\r\nThe government should fund free gym membership for all British people, with restrictions such as, may be free membership during off peak hours, or even certain days.\r\n\r\nInstead of complaining of the obesity level, while eating a burger, let's make a change, and invest money in to a healthy lifestyle.
