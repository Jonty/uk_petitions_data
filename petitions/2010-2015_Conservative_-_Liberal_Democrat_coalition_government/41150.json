        "additional_details": "The Armed Forces is the last institution in the UK to have a complete blanket ban on Diabetics joining. Understandably Front line combat jobs are unsuitable for people with Diabetes however there are many jobs in the armed forces which are not Front line roles and I believe could be done by people with Diabetes. The government should remove the blanket ban and assess candidates with diabetes on an individual basis. In the 21st century Diabetic people are more than capable to hold roles such as Intelligence officers in the RAF or Army and on naval vessels where there are medical facilities available. Candidates could sign a waiver acknowledging the risks involved. ",
