        "action": "Stop giving British taxpayers' money to the EU",
        "additional_details": "Every year British taxpayers are being forced to hand over billions of pounds of their hard earned cash to the European Union. Britain hands over billions more than it get backs and even then the EU wants more and wants to axe our rebate. While we are subject to an age of austerity in Britain, the EU thinks it is acceptable to keep on increasing its spending at our expense. This petition therefore calls upon the Government to stop handing so much of our money over the to European Union.",
