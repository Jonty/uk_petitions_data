However, they DO serve as a deterrent for some offences.\r\n\r\nRestore the death penalty as the maximum sentence for the murder of Police Officers, and other law enforcement agency officers, and show the Government's support for a role that is extremely dangerous and which puts every day, unarmed people in danger of losing their lives.
