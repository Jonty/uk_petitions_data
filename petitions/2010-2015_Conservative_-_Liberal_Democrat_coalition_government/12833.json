        "additional_details": "Raising the income tax threshold will have 2 massive effects on UK society. Firstly, it will raise almost everyone out of poverty (ie no more riots) & motivate the unemployed to take low-paid jobs. Secondly it will create a massive economic stimulus following the extra injection of cash into the spending economy - right where's it's most needed - in the hands of local business. ",
