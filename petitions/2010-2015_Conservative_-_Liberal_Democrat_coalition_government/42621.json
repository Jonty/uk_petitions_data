        "additional_details": "I am completely for the government with the shift towards summer-only exams in September 2013 to prevent the \u201cresit culture\u201d. However, I am absolutely outraged that these plans are going to be introduced half way through our A level courses and affect our year that began our A levels in September 2012.  The syllabuses that we are currently studying are designed to be tested in chunks, hence why there are multiple modules. Surely then it's ludicrous that we will have to take modular exams in a linear format?\r\n\r\nWe should have known what we were signing up for when we started our A levels, I do not understand why the government has implemented these changes two months into the start of term \u2013 why can\u2019t we finish our A levels how we started them?\r\n\r\nUs 16-17 year olds simply wish for the government to let us do our January exams in our 2nd year of A levels and start afresh with the reforms in September 2013 for students in their 1st year of studies.",
