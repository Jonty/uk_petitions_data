        "additional_details": "Our children spend far too much of their childhood doing homework and this really isn't healthy! The increasing pressure and demands on our children is bound to eventually have an effect on their psychological and physical health. Our children should be able to relax at home and 'switch off' from school. If the school day was 9 - 4.15/30pm, more work could be done in school. I understand the requirement to promote self study...have bigger libraries and more computer rooms so that pupils can study by themselves in the last hour of school. Please give our poor kids a break!",
