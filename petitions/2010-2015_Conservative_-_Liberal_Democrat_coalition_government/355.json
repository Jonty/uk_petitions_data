To reduce costs, the BBC has seemingly decided to halve the coverage of F1 to allow them to retain BBC4, a minority channel watched by only a few tens of thousands of people on average (see the BARB web site for details). Formula 1 may be expensive for the BBC but 5 million people can't be wrong - it's in the BBC's top 10 programmes every week that it's shown). Over half the F1 teams are based in England (including, for example, the \"German national team\" of Mercedes - cars built in Brackley and engines built in Northampton). As a comparison, any particular Premiership Football match on Sky TV only attracts around 1 million viewers for our so-called \"national sport\".",
