        "additional_details": "Pre-pack administration continues to be abused, it's about time the government banned them as they were going to do this and then it got abandoned. A new system should be brought in for businesses in trouble and this should ensure that the current directors or shareholders are not using pre-pack as a tool to deceive creditors and other directors, the other parties to this system are the Insolvency Practitioners and they are now becoming parasites of the British Industry.\r\nPre-packs should be banned immediately .",
