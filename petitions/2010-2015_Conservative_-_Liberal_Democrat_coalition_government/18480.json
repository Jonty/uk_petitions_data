        "additional_details": "Currently the majority of train operators make it impossible for commuters or enthusiasts to cycle to work from their city destination hub, unless they own a folding bike.\r\n\r\nThis is due to \"capacity constraints\" on rolling stock. I propose that train operators should be mandated to add a cycle carriage to every train to allow commuters and cyclists to cycle to and from their places of work whilst allowing them to use the train for the long leg of the journey.\r\n\r\nThis journey mix would\r\n1) Create one of the most environmentally friendly forms of travel to work\r\n2) Promote healthier living and ease the burden on the NHS\r\n3) Ease the burden on city transport systems during rush hour\r\n4) Utilise the investments in cycle lane systems in cities",
