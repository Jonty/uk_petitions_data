        "additional_details": "I'm 22 and when I was at School I found that the way sex education was taught was out dated and wasn't very useful at all, at least it was useless to me since I am Gay (wasn't out tat the time).\r\n\r\nTimes have changed and in todays world younger generations are a lot more open minded. I strongly believe that it is extremley important to change the way sex education is taught so that it applies to those who might be Gay and even those who aren't that might have a Gay experience - because believe it or not, there are straight people that do have an experience at some point, wether it's out curiosity or whatever.\r\n\r\nSay yes to changing the way Sex Education is taught so it applies to everyone and encourage anti-homophobia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
