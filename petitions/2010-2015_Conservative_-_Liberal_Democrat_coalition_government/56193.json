By implementing this, we will have children growing up in loving, caring and safe environments where they know it is wrong and can speak out with the knowledge that they will be protected and heard.\r\nWe will have less adults needing life-long support who are not being reached or getting the correct counselling because of the lack of specialists in this subject specifically Child Sex Abuse, victims and survivors.",
