Reparation may be given by monetary compensation or even through community service as a reparation to the state.\r\n\r\nI believe there should be the option of Reparation to prisoners or mentally ill patients who seek to give back to society or the family of their victims. Under the current system, many prisoners do engage in certain Tasks however they menial. I believe many of the prison and mentally ill population have certain creative skills sets or qualities if properly focused can be used for positive means. These could include writing, drawing, interior design, poetry etc.\r\n\r\nThere is vast amounts of unlocked potential and the government just needs to reckognize that.",
