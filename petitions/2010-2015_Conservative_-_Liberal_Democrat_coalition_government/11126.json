        "additional_details": "I suggest that all persons convicted for the recent riots across the country should be conscripted into the armed forces, where they can gain discipline and learn to respect others.  Any offenders under the age of 16 should be made to attend a military style academy until they reach 16 and then serve a further 3 years within the armed forces.  This will hopefuly help these troubled individuals to find a purpose in life and make ammends for the trouble that have caused.",
