        "additional_details": "Let's petition parliament on all of the police pay and conditions, not certain aspects.\r\n\r\nThe Windsor Review made numerous recommendations. A fraction of theses are that officers increase their pension contribution to 14%, that all overtime including working a rest day at less than 5 days notice, is paid at a minimal rate. It also believes that police should be paid their pension at pension age, not when they retire and that officers pay 40% tax on their pension commutation when they retire.\r\n\r\nAn average Met Police officer will be \u00a3150-\u00a3200 worst off a month after tax. This means that police couples will have up to \u00a3400 less a month to live off (\u00a34800 a year LESS).\r\n\r\nPolice officers will no longer be able to concentrate on protecting the public, but on survival and this means second jobs. Officers won't be able to put the public first and do their job properly due to tiredness.\r\n\r\nMembers of parliament, please don't attack those that protect you.",
