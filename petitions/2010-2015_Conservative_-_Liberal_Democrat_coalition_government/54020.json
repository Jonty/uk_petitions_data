I can't even begin to explain how annoyed me, and most the British fans (or you can even call us the \"original\" fans) are. I have nothing against America getting this stuff, But when they get it and we don't, or even if they get it before we do, this is really disgraceful, that's what it is!\r\n\r\nThe BBC use our money, that's right the British tax payers money to produce merchandise that we can never get hold of! The BBC are constantly doing this, with them announcing pretty much all the merchandise these days in some other country, like the complete 7th series. I would like the goverment to take action on what is sold internationaly in a bussiness and to stop give the US a lot of are British Merchandise and for the BBC to let us have new DVDs and other Merchandise before the USA.\r\n\r\n",
