        "additional_details": "There could be 3 reasons: 1 - it was a demonstration of his arrogance in that he was empowered to make such decisions because he considers that his is the only opinion which counts - The Hubris Syndrome.  2 - It was an attempt to further damage the financial state of the country as a reaction to him being told that he was being move from DFID to Chief Whip, demonstrating a complete arrogant disregard for the welfare of anybody but himself.  3 - It was a final opportunity for him or a member of his family with business connections to Rwanda to 'make a few bob' out of Andrew Mitchells proclivity to giving government contracts to people or organisations he knows.\r\n\r\nThe first 2 show a mental health problem which means he should never be in charge of other people's money, ever again.  The 3rd is illegal, for which he should be put in jail.",
