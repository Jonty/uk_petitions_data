We should be able to take the Public Transports without being bother by those people who have absolutely no manners.\r\nIt is so annoying to see that some people have so little respect to the fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nJust imagine if we had one carriage made in all the Trains where people using electronic devices would have to use as a compulsory measure.\r\nLet\u2019s have people without manners next door, for us to enjoy reading our newspaper in  a quiet journey.\r\nPlease make this E-Petition a success! Thank you\r\n",
