        "action": "Introduce legislation in 2014 so MPs can veto their 11% pay rise",
        "additional_details": "The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) is proposing MPs get an 11% pay rise in 2015 from \u00a366k to \u00a374k. Contrast that to a fully qualified nurse who starts on just \u00a321k who will have got a total of 2% increase in the 5 years up to 2015, in real terms approximately a 10% pay cut.\r\n\r\nThis petition proposes that IPSA should continue to make independent proposals for MPs' pay, but that legislation should be introduced in 2014 to allow MPs to veto proposed increases they feel are excessive. This would allow the public to see if their MPs are prepared to accept the same pay restrictions they have imposed on millions of public sector workers for 5 years. It is the test of whether we really are all in it together as they say. MPs cannot be allowed to spend the next year being unaccountable and hiding behind IPSA's independence. ",
