        "additional_details": "There's an estimated 1.5 million people addicted to Benzodiazepine's, a Tranquilliser with devestaing side affects. The side affects are not recognised in most cases as \"real\" and are seen as \"in the mind\" of the addicted person by the Medical Profession. Discrimination reigns from many GP's as lifes are being lost after decades of over prescribing, with almost no help for \"a legal addict\" to safely withdraw. We want to be heard and have dedicated centres and support to help us get back whatever we can from a lost life to \"legal addiction\". Please sign this petition and lets get heard. There are up to 1.5 million of us, please take this chance to show we will not be a muted generation anymore. We further want to be withdrawn from this medication safely and not dictated to by GP's who have little or no idea of what it's like to live as \"a legal addict\"",
