        "action": "Introduce basic economics in schools",
        "additional_details": "This is a request for the UK Government to introduce economic education into schools as early as feasibly possible to help avoid future boom and bust in the UK economy.  In 2011 many children and indeed adults have little or no understanding of basic economic principles.  The lack of understanding of the free market, the benefits of saving whether as an individual, company or Government, and the difference between currency and real money (Gold and Silver).\r\n\r\nAn investment in economic education for our children will provide valuable life skills that will enable them as adults to recognise the difference between income and expenditure, assets and liabilities; and the need to save for what they desire as opposed to depending on credit.\r\n\r\nThere is a need to educate our children as to how an economy grows and why it crashes to avoid future financial turmoil.\r\n\r\nThe action the UK Government should take is to introduce economics as early as primary school.",
