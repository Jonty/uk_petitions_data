        "additional_details": "Filton Airfield is to close on the 21st December 2013, pending redevelopment. It has always been a controversial subject and the airfield - having served this country, its people and the aviation community - is to be finally slated at the end of this year. Jobs will be lost. English heritage shall be destroyed. And above all, an iconic gem of British history will be lost forever.\r\n\r\nI ask the government if this petition reaches a significant vote count review the matter of Filton Airfield in an official and publicly available inquiry. Our council have failed us, so I ask the peoples government that we believe in and look up to, to do something about this demolition of our history. To lease with the groups of BAE and Airbus employees, the residents of the area, the community and above all the British people to see what *they* want to happen to what they and their forefathers have built.",
