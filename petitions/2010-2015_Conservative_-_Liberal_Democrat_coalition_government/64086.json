        "additional_details": "Llandudno once had a wonderful sandy beach. Conwy County Borough Council has progressively dumped thousands of tons of rock and cobble in the mistaken notion that this is the best way to prevent flooding from the sea. They have refused to look at other less-damaging sea defences and what CCBC are doing is destroying both the tourism in the area and the livelihoods of local people. It has now become impossible to safely get down to the beach, and any sand that there is has been littered by these large rocks that have been moved by the tide.\r\n\r\nThe people of Llandudno would like the rock and cobble removed, and the beach restored to the sandy beach for which Llandudno is famous. We would also request that should flood defences be required in this area, the work is done in a manner that is aesthetically in keeping with a beach holiday resort, and that this be done in full consultation with the residents of Llandudno.\r\n",
