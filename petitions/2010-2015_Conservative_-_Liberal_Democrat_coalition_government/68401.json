        "additional_details": "I Petition that Gerald and Kate McCann together with all friends who accompanied them on holiday in Portugal be prosecuted for child neglect (under the  Children and Young Persons Act 1933) toward their respective children by leaving them alone in their holiday apartments on and around 3rd May 2007. I strongly believe having studied the PJ files, that Madeleine McCann died in the McCann's apartment on 3rd May 2007 and there was no abduction. I further petition that The Home Office publishes the files they hold related to this case in the same way as the PJ has. If this part of the petition is denied due to matters of National Security I petition the Government to state which particular branch of National Security a missing child applies to. Considering the amount of taxpayers money that has been spent on the case the people of the United Kingdom, Portugal and all parents have a right to know what really happened to Madeleine McCann.",
