This measure will only politicise the police and make it more difficult for them to act in an independent and impartial manner. The proposed measure is unwanted, unnecessary and will only add an extra layer of bureauracy to an already over-burdened system and will be too costly at a time when there are demands for cuts in policing budgets.",
