We have no choice but to pay the high prices because we need to commute.\r\n\r\nStop us being held to ransom by the fuel companies and set a maximum price they can charge for fuel. A \u00a31.00 limit would raise moral for everyone in the country and also leave them with more money to spend back in the economy.",
