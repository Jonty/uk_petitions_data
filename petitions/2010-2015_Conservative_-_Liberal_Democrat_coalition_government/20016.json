Forensic psychological profiling (or personality profiling) of criminal suspects, passengers, spectators, audience, in order to effect covert surveillance, further questioning, searches & other investigations are a necessary fact of life nowadays. In Afghanistan, for example, Taliban, suicide bombers and Afghan famers can convert from one role to another. Taliban or suicide bombers are indistinguishable from amongst many of the populace of Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan but may be more discernible by psychological profiling various aspects of suspects\u2019 behaviour, demeanour, country of origin, immigration status, cultural background, beliefs, habits and rituals, motives, social background, age, education, etc.",
