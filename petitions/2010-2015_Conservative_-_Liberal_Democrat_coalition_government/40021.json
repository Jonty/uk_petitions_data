        "additional_details": "Like many of the UK population I feel that the current Justice System for certain crimes is not tough enough and a prison sentence alone is not enough to be warranted as punishment.\r\n\r\nThis leads me on to the purpose of the e-petition as stated. It is time to bring back Capital Punishment (death penalty).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion a life sentence for murdering someone is not enough whatsoever. many murderers will get a life sentence which is then reduced and the murderer is let out back into society. this is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nif a murder is committed, the murderer has lost any rights he/she had.\r\n\r\nBringing back the death penalty would reduce crime such as murders and give out a statement that once the offence is commited you have lost your rights and life.
