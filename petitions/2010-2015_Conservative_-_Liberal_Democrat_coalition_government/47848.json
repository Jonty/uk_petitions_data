        "additional_details": "We are already seeing signs that the Police and Crime Commissioners are wasting a lot of money employing people at high salaries. These people were elected with only 5% of the vote and recent events in Lincolnshire have highlighted the dangers of giving individuals with largely little experience so much power. We need a chance to choose whether we really need these people, which the low poll suggests we don't. We want the government to give us a referendum, either/and regional or national, to decide if we want to retain the post of Police and Crime Commissioner. ",
