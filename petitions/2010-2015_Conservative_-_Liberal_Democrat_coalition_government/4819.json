        "additional_details": "I propose that this government, or future ones, brings back National Service for all under 25's of working age to teach them respect and discipline.\r\n\r\nThis National Service to be a two-tier system.\r\n1 National Service in the Military with strict discipline codes to follow with punishment as the Military used to be. This for all people who wish to go into the forces and habitual offenders.\r\n2 Those who do not wish to take a Military route serve in Hospitals as porters or helpers on the wards to feed those who are unable to feed themselves etc.\r\nBoth are under strict scrutiny of behaviour and following orders etc.\r\nTo run for a minimum of two years each person. Gives the young a course of respect for others and morals also can help with gaining employment.",
