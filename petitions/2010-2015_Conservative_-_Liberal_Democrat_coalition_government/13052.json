Cutting benefits, kicking families out of their homes and disregarding the sentencing guidelines may grab headlines but will ultimately cost both society and the tax payer more in the long run. Rather than instigating an authoritarian regime to keep the poor and disenfranchised in their place the government should look to address the inequalities that breed gangs and violent, criminal behaviour in this country.
