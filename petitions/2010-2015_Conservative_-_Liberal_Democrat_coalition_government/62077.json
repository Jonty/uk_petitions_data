        "additional_details": "Due to massively increased number of vehicles on the road and poor traffic sense of drivers, they don't stop even when light has turned amber. This creates lot of frustration for drivers wanting to turn right and sometimes creates dangerous situation on traffic signals where there is no separate signal for turning right.\r\nBy allowing all the traffic to clear one side at a time, like some of the traffic signals have, it'll greatly reduce the frustration of drivers stuck because somebody can't turn right due to increased traffic & poor traffic sense specially in rush hour.",
