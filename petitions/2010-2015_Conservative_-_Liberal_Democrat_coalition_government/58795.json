He ordered that the defensive force of cruisers and destroyers should abandon the convoy, fearing that the German surface raider Tirpitz was near. Even worse, when informed that Tirpitz was still at anchor, he failed to reverse the order and left the convoy to its fate. The man was a disgrace to the service.",
