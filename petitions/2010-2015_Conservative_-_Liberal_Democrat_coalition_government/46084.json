        "additional_details": "\r\nWe currently spend more on paying layabout's welfare benefits that we do on protecting the citizenship and livelihood's of over 64 million people.\r\n\r\nThis petition is for the increase of HM armed forces budget. An increase of just over 50% (to \u00a360 billion from the current \u00a338 billion), will suffice in reviving the armed forces to a state necessary for the UK to remain a relevant player on the world stage as well as being able to protect herself and her interests.\r\n\r\nThe current budget, as noted,currently stands at around \u00a338 billion and is not increasing above inflation. We now face an ultimatum, either we have a military that can do its job and protect its citizens without the need for several weeks of paperwork, or no force at all. As with many things, their is no happy medium. Having a budget as low as this is just throwing your (the taxpayer's) money down the drain. If the government wants to spend on defence, they have to commit.\r\n\r\nDon't be blind. Sign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
