        "additional_details": "British Telecom is planning a Nationwide removal of the classic red phone box. I have been informed by BT that unless the boxes are adopted, they will be removed.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be allowed to happen as, not only are they a classic British Icon, famous throughout the world, they still provide a vital service and can be incredibly important in certain situations and removal would only destroy yet another British icon.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls upon the Government to adopt many of the boxes and give the responsibility of restoration or repair to local councils, thus placing the red phone box in the hands of local communities.
