        "additional_details": "We call on the government to keep the promises of previous administrations and remove the toll charges imposed on road traffic using the Dartford Crossing. Not only will this finally fulfil the previous commitments but also clear a choke point on a critical transport route. We don't believe that the argument used that charges reduce congestion are correct due to continued problems with traffic at the Crossing. ",
