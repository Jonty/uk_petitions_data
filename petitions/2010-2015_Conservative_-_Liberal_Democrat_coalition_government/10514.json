        "additional_details": "In this particular climate I think we should consider how shows like Jeremy Kyle impact on people watching at home. It is quite clear that the producers encourage people on to the show to discuss their despicable acts with the allure of being on television.\r\nShould people who have shown the worst flaws of human nature be allowed such a platform?\r\nTelevision is a very glamourous medium and should not be used to shine a light on some of the darker sides of humanity.\r\nSome things are best resolved through the proper channels and not by a televised lie detector test.\r\nThe lack of morality on this show is enough to make an impression on any decent society and for this reason I suggest that the show be taken off air. Immediately.\r\n",
