The EU, again, is pandering to French farmers (who they know will take affirmative action (riots, civil unrest, stopping the UK ferry industry, blocking the delivery of British meat through channel ports - because they know that WE will not respond) against the decision and ignore it).  WE MUST PROTECT OUR FUTURE FOOD CROPS.  STOP THE USE OF THESE CHEMICALS TODAY.",
