        "additional_details": "Red Squirrels are nearly extinct in the UK, with few strongholds left. Action needs to be taken to protect our native Red Squirrel. This should include:\r\n\r\n\r\nA nationwide cull of Grey Squirrels, focused mainly in the North of Britain.\r\nA cull should involve Red Squirrel charities, landowners, and local residents. People such as farmers and gamekeepers should be helped to cull Grey Squirrels in any way possible.\r\n\r\nAn \"army\" of volunteers should be raised to help trap Grey Squirrels, and should work with local landowners, gamekeepers, and local residents.\r\n\r\nNo one should be allowed to keep or release Grey Squirrels (only scientists conducting research into squirrel pox should be allowed to keep them).\r\n\r\nMore money should be put aside for effective habitat management, such as planting coniferous and mixed woodland that the Red Squirrels prefer.\r\n\r\nThe public should be educated about the Red Squirrel.",
