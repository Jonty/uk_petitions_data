        "additional_details": "Enforce strict training and safety courses before ownership along with a licence that needs renewal. Only firearms with low penetration (Such as shotgun or pistol with hollow point rounds) would be legal to avoid accidental injury to people other than intruders. Legal only on own property or when transporting to a firing range or for repair etc. This e-petition is also for the legalization of lethal force as a method of self defence/home defence when on private property.",
