        "additional_details": "This petition aims to make the people of Britain automatic organ donors and those who wish to opt out of donating organs after they have passed away may do so at any point. This will save the lives of thousands of patients who are currently on the transplant waiting list which is approximately 8,000 people. Many people may wish to be an organ donor however have never told their loved ones or signed up for a donor card. In implementing this scheme many more families and friends will be able to enjoy the presence of their loved ones for longer. If this petition is successful I would like the government to automatically make people organ donors with the option of opting out at any point in their lives.",
