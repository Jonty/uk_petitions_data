        "additional_details": "The Government must reverse their proposals to increase tuition fees on the basis that this will provide no extra funding for Universities.\r\n\r\nThe hike in fees is as a result of the Government reducing their state contribution to higher education institutions, with a view to increasing, beyond the reach of many, the personal contribution that students have to make. They believe it is justified to make attempts at cutting the structural deficit by increasing student debt.\r\n\r\nThis will inhibit those from poorer backgrounds from going to university both due to the lack of support from bursaries, and fears about access due to the mountain of debt to follow the completion of a degree.",
