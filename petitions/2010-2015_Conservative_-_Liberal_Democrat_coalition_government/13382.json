        "additional_details": "As the hard-working commuters around the country get squeezed more and more with higher taxes, high inflation, higher gas and energy prices - the train companies have now announced massive increases in train fares of 8-13% per annum.\r\n\r\nWill the train service be 8-13% better? No.\r\n\r\nWill the trains be 8-13% less crowded? No.\r\n\r\nWill the punctuality improve by 8-13%? No.\r\n\r\nWhat are we actually getting from these rises? What do we ever get from these annual rises? Nothing.\r\n\r\nWages are not increasing at the rate of inflation, they aren't increasing at all. Trains fares absolutely should not increase above the rate of inflation and should not increase at all.\r\nWe want the government to debate in the houses to consider not allowing these rises to occur, rather than unilaterally forcing this upon us.\r\nWe will not riot - but we will do the next best thing - petition.",
