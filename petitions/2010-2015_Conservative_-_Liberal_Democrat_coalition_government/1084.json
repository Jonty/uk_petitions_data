        "additional_details": "I would like a restructuring of the council housing criteria to give priority to people who have ties and affiliations in the area to which they are applying. My family has always lived in Dagenham, yet I have been told that there is not one single council accommodation for which I am eligible to bid upon as I have a job and can theoretically live with my parents indefinitely. Due to current housing prices I cannot afford private rent on my salary, and having five adults living under one roof, along with a newborn child, is cramped and impractical. Many others are in similar situations despite living in areas their entire lives, whilst newcomers to the area get priority. This is unfair and the system should be restructured to help the local community, not dilute it.",
