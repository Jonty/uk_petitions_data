        "additional_details": "After the news of the be headings recently and Britons moving abroad to become part of terrorist organisations I think it's about time we stuck up for British citizens in our own country. Too long has it gone on that we are made to feel like second hand citizens. The burka and other face coverings should be banned on our streets!! Neighbours living among us could be soon taking part in be headings and other terrorist actions and it will remain near impossible to be able to identify them beneath their head coverings. Forget their human rights, what about ours?! We need to act NOW as our country is slowly becoming an Islamic state. Get behind this petition and fight for our rights as British citizens. It's about time the government looked out for us instead of foreign nationals!!! ",
