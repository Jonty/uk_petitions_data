        "additional_details": "If you start to force people to wear helmets when cycling it will put many off cycling, this is another nanny state rule.  Wearing a cycling hat makes the head sweat and could cause other health problems.  It is up to the individual to make that choice, not the state.   It could also make people think they are safer than they really are.\r\n\r\nThe head is only a small part of the body and how often is that the point of contact in an accident.  (It wouldn't stop somebody losing their front teeth or braking a limb).\r\n\r\nI would like to see cycling made safer, because any contact with a car would result in serious damage, no matter what protection.  Let us see more cycling paths and current footpaths opened up to cycles.  Currently canal towpaths are used by both cyclists and pedestrians and are no wider than a footpath.\r\n\r\nCar drivers need to be made aware that cyclists need more leeway at roundabouts.",
