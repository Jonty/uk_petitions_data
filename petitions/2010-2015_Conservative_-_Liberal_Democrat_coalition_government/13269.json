The Eurobarometer September\u2013October 2006 survey shows that 59% of EU-27 citizens are against Turkey joining the EU, while only about 28% are in favour.\r\n\r\nBoth President Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel oppose full EU membership for Turkey.\r\n\r\nThere is a risk of mass immigration from Turkey if she joins the EU (Germany already has a population of over 2 million Turks), and the consequential demand on public resources at taxpayer expense - the Institute of Public Policy Research has stated for 2005-06 that 49% of Turkish nationals in the UK live in taxpayer subsidised social housing.",
