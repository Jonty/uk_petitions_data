        "additional_details": "The HMRC Customer Charter states that they will\r\ndo all they can to keep the cost of dealing with them as low as possible. They say that they aim to take up as little of our time and money as they can.\r\nThey will:\r\n\u2022\t try to make services straightforward\r\nand easy to access\r\n\u2022\t make it as cheap as they can for us to\r\ncontact them,\r\n\r\nSo why is it necessary for customers to phone to request a Tax Credits Claim form on a number that costs between 9p and 40p per minute?\r\n\r\nI think that the blank claim form should be available to download online, so that it can then be printed at home, completed by the claimant and posted off.\r\n\r\nI was 'on hold' for 21 minutes, and then got cut off! Second call was 13 minutes.\r\n\r\nThis is not only costly, it is an inefficient use of modern technology, which if used would make life a lot simpler for customers.\r\n\r\nIf you agree please support my petition to try and have these simple changes implemented.",
