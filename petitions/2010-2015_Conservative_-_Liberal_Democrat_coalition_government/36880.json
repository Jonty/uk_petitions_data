        "additional_details": "In these times of financial hardship and acknowledged poor financial education for our young people we need proper leadership from our politicians. This includes using correct language and mathematical terms and avoiding lazy soundbites or populist terms such as \"X-factor percentages\". Our Chancellor of the Exchequer has on National television, at least twice referred to applying 110% effort/support/whatever to something. Quoting this impossibility needs to stop and an apology made through the exact same media channels. That is all.",
