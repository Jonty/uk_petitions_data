        "additional_details": "This petition asks for a referendum on the voting system used in General Elections and for local councils. It's submitted the system should be changed from First Past the Post to proportional representation specifically Mixed Member Proportional Representation (MMR).\r\n\r\nThe main benefit would be that the number of MP\u2019s or councillors would reflect the percentage each party achieves in the vote. In 2010 General Election the Liberal democrats achieved 23% of the vote but only got 8% of the seats. In the 2013 local elections the United Kingdom Independence Party gained 26% of the vote but only got 6% of the seats.\r\n\r\n20% of the votes should give a party 20% of the seats/councillors.\r\n\r\nMMR is an advantageous unlike the AV put forward in the 2011 referendum because:\r\n-Every vote counts, there are few wasted votes\r\n- In places where it is used voter turnout has increased\r\n-Most importantly of all unlike AV maintains the link between the MP and the local constituency\r\n",
