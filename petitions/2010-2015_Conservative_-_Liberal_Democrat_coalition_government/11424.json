A common salary should be fixed per division for all players in the team, with the Premier Division paying more than Division One etc. Each club should also be limited to having say only two \"foreign\" players, which restriction need not apply to UK citizens. The same sorts of measures could equally be relevant to other sports, though football is the glaring one.",
