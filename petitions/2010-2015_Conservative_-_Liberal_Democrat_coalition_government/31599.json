        "additional_details": "This petition is to promote the advertisement and media presence of breastfeeding. The public are continuously faced with negative connotations towards breastfeeding, the promotion of formula and artificial substitutes for breast milk.\r\nIt is critical for the public to be educated on the benefits of breastfeeding for the mother, her child and society. NICE guidelines state, \u2018..UK policy is to promote exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months\u2019. This can be made achievable by the advertisement of the benefits and constituents of breast milk.\r\n We would like the government to assist in encouraging the informed choice of families regarding infant feeding by supporting this petition.\r\nWe want to see breast milk advertisement  as a health campaign, to significantly help reduce the number of hospital admissions due to illnesses directly relating to substitutes; thus saving the NHS much needed money as well as promoting maternal, fetal and public wellbeing for generations.\r\n",
