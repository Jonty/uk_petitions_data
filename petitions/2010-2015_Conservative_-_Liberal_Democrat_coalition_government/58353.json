        "additional_details": "Colwyn Bay pier is to be demolished, councillors have decided bringing a five-year saga over its future to a close.\r\n\r\nA report said restoring the Grade II-listed pier would have cost more than \u00a315m.\r\n\r\nConwy council had a \u00a3600,000 Heritage Lottery Fund grant awarded to investigate the feasibility of restoring the pier.\r\n\r\n'Heritage destruction'\r\n\r\n\"The pier is part of Colwyn Bay's heritage. If we don't pursue the grant, we'll never know what might have been,\" he said.\r\n\r\nCouncillors had six options to consider, including demolishing the pier, carrying on with the restoration, and restoring only the decking but not the pier pavilions.\r\n\r\nWe th undersigned feel it would be an outrage to demolish such an iconic structure that is one of the last regognisable icons of Colwyn Bay's heritage, and want this decision overturned.",
