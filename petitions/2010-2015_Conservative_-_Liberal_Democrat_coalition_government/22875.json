        "additional_details": "Many everyday people who are still lucky to have a job, are being forced to pay from their own pocket for travel, overnight hotel stays, and many other company expenses in general.  They then need to go back and fill out time wasting forms in order to get the money refunded back to them.  If companies want staff to do these things then the company should pay at the start instead of expecting unauthorised hand-outs/loans from its staff who quite often are strugling enough financially as it is.  Make the company pay before the event, they would not lend to us, so why do we have to lend to them, change the law in parliment!!",
