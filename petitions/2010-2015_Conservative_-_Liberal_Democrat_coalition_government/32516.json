        "additional_details": "There is a lot of congestion on the elevated part of the M4 as you are entering/exiting London during rush hour times.\r\nThe elevated west bound slip road entering the M4 at junction 2 is too short and due to the volume of traffic this frequently becomes a bottleneck for traffic on the M4, the slip road, and Chiswick roundabout.\r\nA lot of this congestion can be contributed to traffic from the new industrial estates west of this junction, including GlaxoSmithKline and Sky.\r\nI propose a junction is added between 2 and 3 and approximately where the elevated section becomes 3 lanes. This could connect to the nearby A3002 which would also help with traffic to the north currently entering chiswick roundabout destined for the M4. An entrance west bound, and an exit east bound is required only. ",
