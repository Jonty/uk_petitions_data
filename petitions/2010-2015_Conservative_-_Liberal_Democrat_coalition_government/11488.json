        "additional_details": "At the moment, cars are paying a toll of \u00a35.70 and vans \u00a311.50 to cross from England into Wales. These tolls are not taken by the British government but by a private company run for profit. These tolls have a deleterious effect on the Welsh economy and the people and towns of South Wales including Chepstow, Newport, and Cardiff.\r\n\r\n  It seems not outlandish that the British government could buy the bridge for the people of Wales and run it as a toll bridge until such time as interest payments will allow for maintenance and the bridge will be free to run.\r\n\r\n  For the people of South Wales and Bristol this would aid the local economy and allow families to visit each other on both sides without paying a very high toll.",
