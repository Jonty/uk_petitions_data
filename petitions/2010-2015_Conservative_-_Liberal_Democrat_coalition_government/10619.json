        "additional_details": "The riots in Britain seem to show that our youth are the result of a generation raised with no real discipline. Parents, teachers and police are unable to use corporal punishment as a deterrent and this is the result. Our young have/will have no respect unless we re-introduce the right to use reasonable forms of punishment i.e smacking and the threat of the cane to those in authority. It worked for previous generations - children now have too much power and use it to their advantage. Allow parents to smack, teachers to give the slipper or cane and the police to 'clip' an unruly child without fear of prosecution. There are people that are uneccessarily violent towards children, unfortunately this will always be the case, the removal of corporal punishment has not stopped this cruelty, we simply want those responsible for children to regain control.",
