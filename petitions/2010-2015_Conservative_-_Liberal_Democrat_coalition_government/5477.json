This is because these all effect the standard of driving and the safety of other road users.  How is it though, that you can drive a vehicle without a valid MOT potentially making it unroadworthy and being driven in a dangerous condition yet only receive a \u00a360 fine.  This needs to be brought in line with the various other driving offences which carry points as part punishment.",
