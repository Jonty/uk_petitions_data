Selling properties the 'British Way' is sell by number of bedrooms. This encourages developers to create the smaller and smaller rooms in new developments. This would give us a benchmark for comparison of properties. A one bedroom flat would have a floor area of say 50 square metres and perhaps 60 square metres for two bedrooms.",
