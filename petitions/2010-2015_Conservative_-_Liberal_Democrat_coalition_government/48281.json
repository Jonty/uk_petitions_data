        "additional_details": "Pesiticide Producers Bayer CropScience and Syngenta produce Neonicotinoid based pesticides which have been implicated in the alarming deaths of bees and other pollinators that are so crucial to pollination and biodiversity in the UK as a whole. It is not just agricultural products that they are used in but also a number of products aimed at the domestic home and garden market.\r\n\r\nIn light of this information we call for the UK Govt to show support for UK bee keepers and the bees themselves by placing a ban on ALL Neonicotinoids pesiticdes such as Imidacloprid, being bought and sold in the UK as a show of support.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf the bee disappeared off the face of the earth, man would only have four years left to live.\u201d \u2015 Albert Einstein",
