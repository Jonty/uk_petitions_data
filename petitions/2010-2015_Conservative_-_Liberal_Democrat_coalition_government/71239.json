I am sure that if an adult behaved that way to another adult, Security would be called.  We should encourage supermarkets to put in a prominent place, their Statement, along the lines of \"This Store does not and will not allow abusive behaviour whether to an adult or a child\"  etc. etc.  Security Guards should be employed  to patrol the store and be available to approach such parents, pointing out that their behaviour is not acceptable.  If such parents were to be approached in this way -\r\n1. it would stop the abuse in its tracks\r\n2. They would think twice about doing it again and\r\n3.  The message might filter through that this behaviour is not acceptable.\r\nPLEASE - lets do something - we can't all spend the rest of our lives ignoring small children in this way.",
