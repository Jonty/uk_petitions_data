        "additional_details": "We all know about The ongoing Suarez & Evra Saga. Well I pose this, why wasn't Evra charged with Misconduct Himself. During his Spat with Luis Suarez, Patrice Evra used Insulting Language Towards. Taken From The official FA Document, \"Mr Evra told us that he began the conversation by saying \"Concha de tu hermana\", the literal translation is \"your sister's pussy\". Is this not insulting. \"On 16 November 2011, the FA charged Mr Suarez with misconduct contrary to FA Rule E3. The charge brought is that Mr Suarez used abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards Mr Evra contrary to Rule E3(1)\". Therefore hadn't Patrice Evra used Insulting Language. I, as Myself and a Liverpool Fan Condone Racism, but I least of all demand that the FA are Consistent with their Decisions. Further More taken from an Official email from the FA they state that Patrice Evra Threatened Luis Suarez, The FA state that Patrice Evra said \"I\u2019m going to punch you\u201d",
