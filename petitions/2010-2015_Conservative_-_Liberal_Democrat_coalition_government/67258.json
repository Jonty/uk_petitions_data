        "additional_details": "In light of the Rolf Harris trial it has become more apparent than ever that current jail sentences are far too short. It is an insult to victims that criminals are given such lenient sentences.  It is also likely part of the reason for such high re-offending rates. I realise that prisons are overcrowded but we should not compromise on sentencing.\r\n\r\nWe should adopt a system similar to the US where sentences are a lot longer and tougher. ",
