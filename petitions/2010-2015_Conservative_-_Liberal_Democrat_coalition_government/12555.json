We need to stop the knee-jerk blame game that is calling for benefits to be stopped and tenants to be evicted from their council homes. The perpetrators will be dealt with and after that, after an Inquiry, then we need to deal with the root cause.\r\n This is a petition that calls for the angry figure pointing at the younger generation, single mothers and benefit claimants to stop. Stop the judgments. Arrest the criminals.",
