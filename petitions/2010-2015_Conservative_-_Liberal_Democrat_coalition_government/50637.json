We ask that as punishment for the heinous crime against a member of this country's service personnel, serious consideration be given to rescinding any privileges endowed by this country, including citizenship rights. If the perpetrators of this vicious act are to be punished in this country, then we ask that they be given as strong a sentence/punishment as the law will allow. If at all possible, we, the shocked citizens of this great green and pleasant land ask that, for the betterment of the morale of the country, communication within the relevant ministries and embassies to repatriate these wicked criminals back to their country/ies of original nationality.",
