        "additional_details": "Filipinos contribute highly to life in the UK, often employed as nurses, doctors, carers and other important roles. They leave behind their families to seek work abroad, and better their lives, and yet find it hard for their relatives to visit due to immigration controls.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Filipinos are required to provide documents citing financial and sponsorship capabilities to apply for a visa to visit here.\r\n\r\nI urge the Home Office to consider a 30-day visit visa to be issued upon entry to the UK.\r\n\r\nFilipinos generally don't believe in claiming benefits, but contribute instead to the benefits system by working hard, paying taxes and aiming to become assimilated into the local culture.\r\n\r\nI believe the time is right to reviews current policy, ensuring that Philippines citizens who work just as hard for the UK are afforded the same rights as citizens from other countries.",
