I know there's many types of cancer and the task is difficult but we should be paying more attention when children are getting told there illness is terminal and losing there battle. Ruining family's lives forever. The action I would like to see is that the government invest 100 million a year Into there own CANCER Research Project or they invest 100 million pound a year into CANCER Research. Together we can do this!",
