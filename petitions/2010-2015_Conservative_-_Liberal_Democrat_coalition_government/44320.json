        "additional_details": "As a town we have all used Stocksbridge leisure centre throughout our lives and the devastating news that this maybe taken away from us is just too much to take in. After Yorkshire's amazing achievements in the 2012 Olympics we should be building on this as a county and Sheffield as a city but instead we are faced with the threat that this great sporting facility will be taken away from us. So I urge  the government to reinstate the funding to Sheffield City Council to enable them to keep the centre open. ",
