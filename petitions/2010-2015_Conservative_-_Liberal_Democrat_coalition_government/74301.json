However, from a first person's view, I have realised there isn't anyone that actually helps. No one helped me remove it, and my self confidence was destroyed. I would like to be able to speak to others that have suffered, who I can personally relate to. I would like to set up my own line. I need YOUR help to do this. I am 17 years of age, and have experienced 14 years of bullying. Has your son or daughter? Let me help.",
