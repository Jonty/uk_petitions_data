        "additional_details": "Why change things for those who deserve to be treated better. You send money to foriegn nations but withdraw money from home citizens. The Personel Independant Payment scheme is a scam on those who deserve to be treated better. Having to wait 6 month + for their claims to be heard. Please return the DLA staff to their desks and respond correctly to the disabled or if you want to save on benefits. Members of Parliment and top civil servents,should also take pay cuts but I bet they wont. Or at least think again about tax increases for the rich and mansion tax, instead of making those who need help pay for the debts!!!",
