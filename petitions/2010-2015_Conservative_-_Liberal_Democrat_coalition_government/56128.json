        "additional_details": "The government have a responsibility to provide a stable foundation to the public so business can flourish. Privatisation of the train companies and energy firms as well as privatising parts of public services to be run for profit, damage the stability and confidence nationalisation would bring. Transport, Energy and public services, should be nationalised and run on a not for profit basis. This would stop the public being held to ransom by train companies and energy firms and reassure the public that the public services are serving them and not trying to make profit from them. Renationalise energy firms, train companies and public services.",
