        "additional_details": "The BBC no longer provides value for money for UK licence fee payers. On 29th July 2011 it was annouced that Sky will broadcast live formula one from 2012 with selected races and highlights picked up by the BBC. Upon announcing the decision the BBC Sport Director, Barbara Slater, said: \u201cThe sport has never been more popular \u2013 with TV audiences at a ten-year high.\" This is not confined to sports either at a time where most of the UK is staying home more to save money. It has long been the trend for Sky to broadcast films well in advance of the BBC and the range of film options open to Sky, BT and Virgin media customers puts the BBC to shame. In the digital age viewers should be given the option to opt out of BBC channels and have them scrambled which would allow them to pay for the channels which best suit their personal tastes. It is against human rights to enforce non payment of the fee by the threat of a prison sentence and a criminal record.",
