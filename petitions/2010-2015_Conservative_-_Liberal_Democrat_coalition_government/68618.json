        "additional_details": "\r\nThis petition aims to end the horrific ongoing violation against Kurdish people in North of Iraq and Syria by ISIS. We want the UK government to take notice of this issue and move towards helping to save hundreds of thousands of Kurdish people facing slaughter at the hands of jihadists.\r\nWe believe that the recognition of the genocide by the UK Government will be an important step to break the silence over one of humanity's tragedies. It would also enable the United Kingdom to re-emphasize its long standing tradition for promoting Human Rights and sending a clear message in support of international conventions.\r\nTens of thousands of Kurdish people in Iraq and Syria facing slaughter at the hands of ISIS. Hundreds of Kurdish women and children are being buried alive. How many more have to die before something is done?\r\nForget culture, nationality of religion & please act in the name of humanity\r\n\r\n\r\n",
