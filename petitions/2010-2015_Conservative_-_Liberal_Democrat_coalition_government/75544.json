The current period of 24 hours is not notified on the congestion charge signs and  often is  insufficient for people to pay if they are travelling on somewhere travelling abroad and need to have internet access to pay.\r\n\r\nby extending the period to 7 days and notifying  it on the signs would give people a better  chance  to pay the congestion charge and be fairer on no Londoners visiting the capital who are uncertain of the law.",
