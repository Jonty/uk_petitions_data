        "additional_details": "We call upon the Government to repeal without delay the archaic and iniquitous Chancel Repairs Act 1932 which allows some 5,000 Church of England parishes legally to demand contributions from specific parochial residents for the upkeep of the local church.\r\n\r\nMost people are ignorant of this evil and unjust law which has its roots in Tudor times. The liability comes with the house. What religion you have or even if you have none, you are still liable.\r\n\r\nThe amount demanded can actually exceed the value of the parishioner's house. In a case in 2007, a 68-year-old farmer was ordered by the court to pay almost \u00a3225,000 to the local church. His legal bill in attempting to challenge the demand was even greater.\r\n\r\nSuch a mediaeval law has no place in an increasingly secular, multi-faith Britain. The Church of England has vast assets and should assume the responsibility of maintaining its own buildings.\r\n",
