        "additional_details": "Replace most welfare benefits with a new, non-means tested universal benefit known as \"citizen's income\". Analagous to Child Benefit, this credit is paid to every citizen, instead of being clawed back by unfair means-testing, it's taken out progressively via the tax system.\r\n\r\nCitizens' income would remove powerful disincentives to work, especially considering today's businesses demands for a more flexible workforce. It would also encourage more people to work for themselves and would replace a failed, old-fashioned, very bureacratic safety net that pays people to be idle with a modern, fit-for-purpose welfare system that rewards work instead of punishing it and does not criminalise the poor.\r\n",
