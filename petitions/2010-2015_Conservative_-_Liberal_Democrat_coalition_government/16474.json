        "additional_details": "Current inheritance laws are unfair to the children of parents who remarry. In this situation if your parent dies first, the step parent typically inherits and then on their death they decide who will inherit from them. This can often deliberately exclude children from one side of the first marriage and can lead to poverty in old age. Can the government review this situation please to provide a fairer system. ",
