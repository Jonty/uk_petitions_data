        "additional_details": "Although David Cameron argued that same-sex marriage is an issue of equality, the ban on opposite-sex civil partnerships remains. Straight couples continue to be prohibited from having a civil partnership. In the Netherlands, two-thirds of civil partnerships are between male-female couples.\r\n\r\nIn France, the equivalent of civil partnerships have been available to gay and straight couples alike since 1999. In 2009, some 95% of those taking up the pacte civil de solidarite (Pacs) were heterosexual. While the number of straight French couples opting for Pacs has risen, the number of marriages has shrunk, to the point that there are now two couples entering into a Pacs for every three getting married.",
