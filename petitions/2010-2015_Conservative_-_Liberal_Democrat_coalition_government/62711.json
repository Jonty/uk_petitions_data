        "additional_details": "Due to the recent news of a convicted dog fighting Belfast family only given 6 months prison sentences for their extreme animal anise crimes and those sentences were suspended for 2 years and only given 10 yrs from not being allowed to keep animals. This is wrong and is not fair or safe for animals especially pets and for communities and won't discourage the culprits from doing it again. Get longer sentences; which are certainly not suspended. And increase the animal ownership time to 20+ years. Match the punishment to the crime!",
