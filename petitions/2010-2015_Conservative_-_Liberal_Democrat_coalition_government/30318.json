The traffic lights were not working, Harsh died of serious head injuries on the 22nd Feb 2012.  We would like a portion of the Kings road to be a 20mph zone including the bus lane, so that no family has to go through the pain that Harsh's family are experiencing now.  Harsh was a lovely, happy and sensible child from a loving and caring home.  Please help us and sign our petition, thank you",
