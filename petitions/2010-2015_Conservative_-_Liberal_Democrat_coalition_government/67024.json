        "additional_details": "Due to the jimmy savile case and other famous celebrities being found guilty of sexual abuse I think the government should scrap the TV licence fee as many of us do not want to pay a fee to watch a celebrities that are later convicted of sexual abuse. We want our kids to watch television and feel they are safe. Due to the bbc hearing complaints about celebrities and not acting on them, I think there should be compensation to all house holds that have paid for a licence or scrap fee for a year or 2 as a sorry were they did not act sooner!",
