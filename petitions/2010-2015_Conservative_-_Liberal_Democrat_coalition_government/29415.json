        "additional_details": "Not much to say, I'm actually a spurs fan. But in American sports, squad numbers are retired quicker than the players themselves, often without real merit.\r\n\r\nHowever, if ever there was a player that had claimed their squad number as their own, surely it's Ryan Giggs' number 11 shirt. No one at Manchester United would want to be the new number 11 so why not have them retire it at leas,t if not the English league?\r\n\r\nYeah he had a bad personal life last year but in terms of dedication, commitment and professionalism as a sportsman, not many can compare and i doubt anyone will ever play top flight football for such a huge club for so long, ever again.\r\n\r\nThanks.
