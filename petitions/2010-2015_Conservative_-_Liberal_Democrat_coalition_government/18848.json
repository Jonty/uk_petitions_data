For the well-being and for the best interest of the child and the parents (whom is also a child), they should remove the baby from the custody of it's under aged parent. They have clearly broken the law and should be given consequences to their actions. A child is not capable of caring for a baby, and by allowing a child to keep the baby, it is promoting under aged sex and teenage parenthood. It is not safe for a newborn baby to be brought up by an amateur. ",
