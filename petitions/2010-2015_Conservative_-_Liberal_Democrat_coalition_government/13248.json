        "additional_details": "Train and Tube fares are rising more quickly than the salary of an average UK person. This is creating a big squeeze on standard of living and is forcing people to abandon public transport in favour of cars.\r\n\r\nFare rises are OK but they shouldn't be more than the average pay rise of a UK employee. Instead of basing the fare rise on RPI, it should be based on data collected by Incomes Data Services (IDS). If that was the case, then fare rises would be less than 3% compared to 8% currently!",
