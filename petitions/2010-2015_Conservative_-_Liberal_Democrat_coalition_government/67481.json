        "additional_details": "Good morning,\r\n\r\nI am writing to you the morning after returning from what was supposed to be the best concert of my life - the greatest rapper of all time, Eminem,\r\n\r\nThis pains me to say, but I would like to request a full refund on both of my tickets due to not being able to hear a single word of any of the three acts that took to the stage on Friday night, due to the sound on each performer's mic being completely not existent. The sound was absolutely horrific. Not what I paid almost \u00a3200 and booked a day off for me and my partner for.\r\n\r\nI know I am not alone on this matter and I expect something to be done an some type of compensation applied. The fact that we were standing near the front, by the stage, is an insult to injury.\r\n\r\nAs the venue that provides the sound system for the artists, I believe that the responsibility of this matters lies with yourselves and I look forward to hearing back from you in the near future.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nMr Luke Clark",
