It recommends 5 a day of fruit and vegetables, with no distinction between the two. These guidelines are currently responsible for rising obesity, diabetes and heart disease in the west. The government needs to review the advice they are giving, as diets composed of meat, fish, fresh fruit and vegetables and healthy oils, completely free from dairy, gluten and wheat will prevent all diseases of civilisation.",
