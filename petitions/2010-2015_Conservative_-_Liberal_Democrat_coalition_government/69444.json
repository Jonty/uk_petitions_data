My diffinition of this to to create centres of mass production at which unemployed members of society can labour at a set pay equal to that of the job seekers allowance.\r\n\r\nMy reasoning behind this is simple, it will stop those who do not wish to work, exploiting the current system we have today and detere them from not wanting to work because if they dont work, they dont get money; also, in exchange for their labour the UK as a country will be producing vast qantities of varied goods which will, in turn, will result in an increase of the economy.\r\n\r\n",
