During peaceful lawful protests the psni riot team insult, antagonise and provoke the community into retaliation. Everyone should uphold the law. Yet some of these officers are able to break it unpunished. Something needs done and fast. It's unlawful, unfair and sectarian towards the unionist citizens of Northern Ireland. ",
