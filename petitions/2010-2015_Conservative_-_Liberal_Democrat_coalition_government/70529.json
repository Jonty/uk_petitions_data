I am usually, and perpetually, in arrears due to Tax Office 'oversights'\r\nI NOW have 4 pensions, and thus incomes - and 4 Tax Offices, (as diverse as Newcastle, London and Cardiff) - who patently do not intercommunicate or have a suitable system. I must be one of thousands in this situation - and considering the future where people will have had dozens of jobs, possibly of millions\r\nA single Pensioners Tax Office could, surely, alleviate this AND free up, (in my case 75%), of Staff to pursue deliberate Tax Avoiders and Evaders  - and I would know a specialist who I could visit / talk with",
