A vaccine against Meningitis B has been licensed for use since January yet the government has declined to introduce it. Instead they have introduced a Rotavirus vaccine which while saving the NHS money in hospital admissions etc isn't actually going to save as many UK lives as a Meningitis B vaccine. ",
