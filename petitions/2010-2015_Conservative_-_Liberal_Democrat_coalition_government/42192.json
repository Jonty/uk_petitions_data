A cardiac arrest strikes without warning, holds no boundaries.When a person goes into a cardiac arrest you need to have a defibrillator there within 4 Min's for them to stand a chance of life, having this life saving equipment available within 4 Min's gives them a  chance of survival.Without that life saving shock to restore the hearts rhythm the patient will die.To then learn that my son could have been saved! But due to the lack of funds, the lack of understanding and also the lack of education and awareness, my son has now become just another statistic of this year. Every single one of us deserves a fighting chance in life and every single one of us has the right to lifesaving equipment.",
