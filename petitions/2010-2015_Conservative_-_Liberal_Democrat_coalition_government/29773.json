        "additional_details": "Over the years I have observed the local community and there reaction to the gay community.\r\nMany gay people \"come out\" when they have the support from close friends or others who have been through the same thing.\r\nNorthallerton is lacking a LGBT community. Many scared to confront the public about their sexuality!\r\nAt the end of the day we are all equal and all human beings!\r\nSign this petition now for a LGBT youth group to start and support the gay community.\r\nBE GAY AND PROUD!\r\nYOU ARE WHO YOU ARE!\r\nPlease support our campaign! No matter gay straight or bi!\r\nSo much could be achievable with a LGBT group!\r\nThanks for your time!",
