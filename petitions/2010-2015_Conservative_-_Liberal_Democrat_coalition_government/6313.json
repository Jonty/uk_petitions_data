        "additional_details": "Homeowners are constantly being told to use energy efficient light bulbs, monitor our energy usage, buy efficient applicances and insulate our houses. Councils are resorting to shutting off streetlights in quiet areas at night. At the same time, drive through any city or out of town retail park in this country and you will see shop floors, signage and window displays brightly lit, all night. We should make big retail companies reduce their electricity usage by shutting everything down at night, or tax them if they refuse. This could also be expanded by giving each company an efficiency rating and giving tax relief to the best performers.",
