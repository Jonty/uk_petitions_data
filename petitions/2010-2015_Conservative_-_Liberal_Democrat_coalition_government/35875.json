        "additional_details": "We the undersigned have put forward this petition to update the outdated Provisional Motorcycle Licence.\r\n\r\nWe ask that the following changes be made, and give reasons for said changes:-\r\n\r\n1:) Provisional Motorcycle Licence Holders be given the addition of the ability to ride a 250cc Motorcycle at the age of 20+.\r\n\r\n2:) The Riding of 50cc Mopeds be limited henceforth to City, Village and Town roads - Eg: Only in 30mph Limited Areas.\r\n\r\nReasoning:\r\n\r\n50cc Mopeds are inadequate in terms of safety, traffic-merging, and keeping up with traffic on modern roads with limits above 30mph, and cause road traffic to overtake dangerously at times, risking both driver and rider's lives. 250cc Motorcycles allow a learner greater ability to travel, more responsibility, and greater ability to keep up / merge with other road-traffic safely.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned feel that the changes above will increase safety among young riders, and stimulate growth in the Motorcycle Market in the UK.",
