This is fraud, IT IS NOT THEM BUT LOCAL TAXPAYERS WHO WILL PICK UP THE TAB.  The ONLY way to stop taxpayer funded employees committing criminal acts in the name of the taxpayer is for those fines and compensation orders arising out of the criminal acts to be paid by the person who committed the criminal act.  Every time the taxpayer is called upon to pay a fine or a compensation order indicates that the criminal act was carried out on behalf of the taxpayer.  THAT IS NOT RIGHT AND THE SITUATION MUST BE CORRECTED.  Taxpayer funded organisation CANNOT commit crimes, only taxpayer funded EMPLOYEES can commit crimes, and we always know who they are, so they should be called upon to pay up.",
