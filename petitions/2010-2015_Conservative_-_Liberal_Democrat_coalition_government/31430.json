        "action": "Stop childtrafficking! its child slavery!",
        "additional_details": "Child trafficking is the recruitment and movement of children for the purpose of exploitation; it is a form of child abuse. This is negative because it involes  child slavery such as sexual exploitation ,labour  exploitation ,domestic servitude ,cannabis cultivation\r\ncriminal activity ,forced marriage and moving drugs. Can you imagine what all these could be doing to young children. I belive that the government should  do something about it in order to save these children from this torture. Children deserve a better life and i think that you signing this e-petition will help get the message across. Think of how many lives we will save. put yourself in these childrens shoes for a moment.\r\n\r\n",
