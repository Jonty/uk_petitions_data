Further details can be found at http://www.uniformtax.net\r\n\r\nHowever this rule unfortunately does not apply to our Armed Forces. Even though they are responsible for maintenance and care of their uniform.\r\n\r\nWe would like the Uniform tax rebate scheme to be amended to include armed forces.  ",
