        "additional_details": "I petition the Government to support the British Cinema industry and Cinema goers by actively taking a ZERO Tolerance approach to innapropriate behavior in Cinemas.\r\n\r\nThe culture of the UK has changed so much over the past few decades, that few now adhere to the Social norms expected in these situations.\r\n\r\nPersons talking loudly over the film, persons using Mobile devices are all now more common. Often cinemas are not equipped to deals with these issues and the problem grows.\r\n\r\nI feel that a government supported 'Code Of Conduct' would allow the industry to begin to redress this issue.\r\nThis would assist Cinema in regaining its status as an art and I believe help them attract people back to Cinema.",
