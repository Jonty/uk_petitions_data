        "additional_details": "A cheap but  dangerous form of road re surfacing comes in the form of surface dressing which is tar sprayed onto a poor surface and then  over dressed with  chippings. It is not rolled in but left with lose chippings for months. Any that are not stuck down  can  lay in clusters  and  as such cannot be  seen as  they are  the same grey colour .\r\n\r\nThis is fastest form of surfacing but  it appears to be the cheapest but most expedient.  However due to the lose chippings not rolled in it is definitely the most dangerous surface for any and all two wheeled vehicles, scooters, motorcycles and now including bicycl\r\n\r\nRiding on it can only be likened to riding on marbles or ice or indeed diesel.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf that is not done then as an alternative perhaps the local authorities could be instructed and recommendations made with safeguards that all such temporary surfaces should be rolled to secure the surface and then it should be thoroughly swept to remove all traces of lose and dangerous chippings",
