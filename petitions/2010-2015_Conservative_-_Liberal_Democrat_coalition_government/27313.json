        "additional_details": "We call on Parliament and the British Government to change the way our law deals with file sharing on the Internet. We believe that it should be legal for people to share files on the Internet via P2P and other\r\nmedia, and that the present restrictions on file sharing are an infringement of our personal rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy opening up sharing rights and fighting back against the growth of intrusive anti-piracy laws we will develop an atmosphere in the world of technology that is creative, innovative and exciting.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, we propose that it remain illegal to sell for profit pirated goods. This will protect the rights of producers to be the only people who profit from their work. It will also protect consumers from buying  faulty, dangerous or mislabelled products.",
