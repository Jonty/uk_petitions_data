        "additional_details": "I would like to reopen the petition to ban all ppd products being used in the uk towards hair dye. Like others i have had an allergic reaction that could have killed me. As a young women has died from this product and other country's have banned ppd, i think England should ban the product too. I know we cannot stop it being used in inc and clothing but applying this product to your scalp and hair could be life threatening and people need to understand how serious this product is. I am 22 years of age and i think this product has violated my well being, i cannot understand why this product is on our shop shelfs, ready for anybody to buy. Even if you do a patch test like i did it may not show up for weeks! This is not good enough and i hope everybody will help save life's by getting this product banned!!   ",
