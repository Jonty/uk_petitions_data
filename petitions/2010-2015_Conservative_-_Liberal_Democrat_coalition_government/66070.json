        "additional_details": "I would like the government to reduce the minimum hours to qualify for tax credits back to 16 hours per week for full-time mature university students with children. In order to qualify for a benefit that my family relies upon, I must presently work three days a week whilst studying the remaining four. I feel that the previous system of 16 hours per week would be a beneficial amendment to both those in a similar position to myself, and over a longer period of time to the government. This would allow student to have more time to study and potentially increase their employability into higher paid careers, which in turn would result in a greater amount of tax being paid in the end.",
