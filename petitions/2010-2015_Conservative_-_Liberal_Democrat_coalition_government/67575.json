        "additional_details": "Newly appointed Secretary for Education Nicky Morgan voted against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act at second and third reading last year.\r\n\r\nNicky Morgan stated \"This was totally a free vote, it was an issue of conscience and I had no pressure put on me from anyone higher in the Conservative Party\" - She clearly has deep-rooted views on what is an acceptable sexuality.\r\n\r\nWe want her removed from anything to do with Education. Homophobia has no place in the education system and this must come from the very top, leading by example.\r\n\r\n\r\nNews Source:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/04/09/new-tory-minister-for-women-opposes-right-of-lesbians-to-marry/",
