        "additional_details": "Review the smoking ban to allow certain premises to apply to operate \"designated smoking areas\". This would include public houses, members clubs, casinos and bingo halls. The designation could either cover the entire premises or a specific area that is segregated and clearly signed as a designated smoking area. This would help to redress the wholesale destruction that the smoking ban has caused to the hospitality industry while allowing \"consenting adults\" to gather somewhere other than the doorways of public buildings. At the same time it would alleviate the high levels of noise nuisance suffered by residents who happen to live near to buildings where smokers regularly congregate outside.",
