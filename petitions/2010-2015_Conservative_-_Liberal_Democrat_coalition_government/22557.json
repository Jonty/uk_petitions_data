        "additional_details": "The House of Lords risks ridicule and the loss of its credibility if it allows Baroness Uddin to resume her seat in April 2012. She was found to have claimed money to which she was not entitled and subsequently ordered to repay the sum of \u00a3125,000, which she has refused to do. This behaviour is not only unacceptable it is shameful that a supposed pillar of society can behave in this manner. A Lords sub-committee has stated that she should not be allowed back until the entire sum has been repaid. However, I believe her actions make her singularly unsuitable to sit in the upper house at all.  ",
