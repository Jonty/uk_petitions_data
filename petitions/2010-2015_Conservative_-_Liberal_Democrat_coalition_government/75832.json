        "additional_details": "Since First Group have lost their Thameslink and Great Northern services to Govia, the service that was poor has become a lot worse since.\r\n\r\nThe promises that Govia made have not even attempted to be fulfilled at all and as such there have been near daily delays and cancellations causing major disruption to The Thameslink and Great Northern services. As a result passengers are suffering fare increases and getting the worst service as ever before proving privatisation can fail miserably.\r\n\r\nDevolving The Thameslink and Great Northern services to Transport for London will ensure passengers get trains running on time with competitive fares as well as opening up the boundaries to the Oyster / Contactless network currently used by Transport for London Services. London Overground has proven devolution works and is successful.\r\n\r\nTell the Government by signing this petition you want to see the Devolution of the Thameslink and Great Northern Railways to Transport for London.",
