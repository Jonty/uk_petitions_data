        "additional_details": "Under the current fundamental right to demonstrate it does not take into effect online protest. DDoS attacks should be legalized while the protesters must say when they will start their action and for how long. That way, a website would have time to prepare for the attack, just like an office building has time to get ready for a rally next to it.\r\n\r\nDDoS law should be the same as the right to protest on the street.\r\n\r\nDDoS is not a form of hacking. It simply flood the internet connection to stop people from gaining access the website. This do not effect the system and is becoming more popular to protesters to protest against government and/or website and corporations.\r\n\r\nDDoS only has the same effect as a street protest however it more peaceful for companies that are not being protested about.\r\n\r\nThis means that DDoS law should be decriminalization and change to the same law as protesting.",
