        "additional_details": "How is is possible courts and judges are allowed to treat litigants in person/s unfairly if they have no access to legal aid.\r\nA particular case concerns a 71 year old, where a court had a hearing excluding her from the proceedings. A order was made at this one sided hearing which also stated she had no right to appeal.\r\nUnder the Human Rights Act everyoe has the right to a fiar hearing and access to legal help. How come this frail pensioner has been let down so badly?\r\nLACK OF JUSTICE LEAD TO INJUSTICE.\r\nNo one wants to look at a problem where vicitms are magnificently let down by the justice system. Vitctims that commit suicide because of the lack of justice.\r\nThis cannot on. It is a corrupt unfair system that breeds injustices.\r\n",
