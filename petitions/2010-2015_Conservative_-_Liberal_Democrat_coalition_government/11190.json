Give Judges the power to impose the sentences which fit the current circumstances and which act as an effective deterrent. At the present time, Judges are only permitted to sentence in a pre-designated bracket applying to generic 'best fit' scenarios. The violence we are seeing on our streets today was clearly not envisaged by the Court of Appeal when drawing up the appropriate guidelines. Consequently, there is no 'best fit'.",
