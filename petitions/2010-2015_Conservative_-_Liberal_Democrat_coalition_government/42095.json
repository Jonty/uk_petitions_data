I disagree in the strongest way and urge you to act.\r\n\r\nLETTERS OF SUPPORT NEED TO BE SUBMITTED BY THE 30TH NOVEMBER 2012.\r\n\r\nI have severe asthma - this drug is the difference between life and death for me and countless others.  I want the Government to pressure NICE into the continued funding of this drug.\r\n\r\nIf you or anyone you know has asthma and may need this drug in the future please can you sign this petition and pass this onto others you know.",
