        "additional_details": "Pubs are closing daily all over the country, with damaging effects on community life particularly in rural areas.\r\n\r\nA selective approach to alcohol taxation, favouring pubs over huge supermarket outlets, would help keep rural pubs open.  At the same time, it would reduce the ready availability of cheap alcohol to young people.",
