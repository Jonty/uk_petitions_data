        "additional_details": "To create a 20 mph national speed limit on major roundabouts, to allow safe integration of traffic onto and off of roundabouts, giving motorists of all ages and abilities time to pull into traffic. Especially beneficial to situations where modern technology is now allowing vehicles to circulate unimpeded at speeds often in excess of 40mph plus, giving little time for those entering a roundabout little time to think and react.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS: Smoother integration of traffic: Fewer accidents: Easier to pull into flow of traffic: Safer especially where roundabout has multiple and close exits. Improved flow of traffic. Allow better co-ordination for less skilled or elderly.",
