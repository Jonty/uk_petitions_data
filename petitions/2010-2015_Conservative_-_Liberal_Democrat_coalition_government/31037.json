        "additional_details": "Joseph Kony is the leader of the Lords Resistance Army (LRA). Directed by Kony, the LRA has earned a reputation for its actions against the people of several countries, including northern Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Sudan. It has abducted and forced an estimated 66,000 children to fight for them, and has also forced the internal displacement of over 2,000,000 people since its rebellion began in 1986. As a result, in 2005 Kony was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, but has evaded capture since. Kony needs to be stopped NOW and not LATER. Sign this partition and get the British government to do something which is right not for its own economical gain but something which is right for humanity. ",
