        "additional_details": "The sub prime crisis in the US was brought about by inidividual salesmen selling mortgages where people couldn't afford the repayments while the banks believed they could eliminate risk on debt by removing responsibility. The forms of lending via papers; the internet and by phone has run ahead of legislation. Licensed  credit providers increasingly act like loan sharks. The system needs a massive overhaul to bring back a level of responsibility in lending that is lacking at present. The financial crisis seems to have only encouraged financial institions to take more risks and act increasingly irressponsibly. Bring back crerdit legislation that has the teeth to deal with \"pay day loan companies\" / \"sub prime lenders\" - yes they're still in operation / \"debt consolidation companies\" etc. Bring in teeth for credit legislation at a micro economic level and ensure that casino banking is separaed from high street banking at the macro level.
