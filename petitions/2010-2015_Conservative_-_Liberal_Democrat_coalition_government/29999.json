The NHS also runs a Cord Blood Bank where you can donate from a further six hospitals in Greater London, Barnet General, Northwick Park, Watford General, Luton & Dunstable, St Georges & University College Hospital.\r\n\r\nI am petitioning the Government to make this service available to every hospital in the country.",
