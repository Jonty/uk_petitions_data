        "additional_details": "2014 will be the most important European Election to date as the EU is undergoing significant reform and restructuring.We simply can not afford to have a turnout as low as 34% for an election of such significance. We request that in the run up to the next European Parliament Elections that we have a series of televised debates between the leaders of parties with significant representation. i.e. the Conservatives, UKIP, Labour and the Liberal Democrats. All other political parties with representation fall far below a clear cliff edge, so this would be consistent with participation for the 2010 TV debates. The TV debates will help to increase engagement, understanding and participation among the public. There should be a series of 3 debates in the first half of 2014.",
