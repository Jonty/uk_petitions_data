        "additional_details": "Four hospitals have been nominated as 'ebola' centres, in the case of an outbreak in the UK.\r\nThey are the London Royal Free Hospital -which is the ONLY hospital with 2 containment beds, Newcastle, Liverpool and Sheffield which are all in the north and over 170 miles away from London.\r\nAny outbreak is likely to begin in the south, because 3 out of 4 of the UK's largest airports are located there, as are majority of the UK citizens.\r\nThe North does need to take it's share of the ebola burden, but the suggestion that 3 out of 4 nominated hospitals are located there is ludicrous. Sheffield and Liverpool are only 77 miles apart! Please reduce the amount of nominated hospitals in the the north and include another 2 hospitals with a more southern location to cater for the fact that more than half of the UK population is south of Birmingham! Perhaps an additional London hospital and Birmingham, instead of Sheffield or Liverpool.\r\n",
