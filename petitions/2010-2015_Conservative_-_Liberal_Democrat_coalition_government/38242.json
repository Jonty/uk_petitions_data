It is actually Mancunian Mike Kenney (16 gold , 2 silver) between 1976 and 1988. He has been ignored his rightful place in history purely because he won his medals before the Internation Paralympic Committee was setup in 1989. This is a disgrace that needs to be put right.\r\n\r\nShall we say Manchester United and Liverpool's European Cup wins dont now count because we have the Champions League. of course not so why should Mike be ignored by the same token.\r\n\r\n",
