While if a household has two earners and each are paid just under \u00a350,000 they have retained their child benefit.\r\n\r\nTherefore a single parent of 2 earning over 60k is losing over \u00a31,600 a year while those with a joint income of \u00a399k with 2 children are still benefiting.\r\n\r\nIt is unfair and unjust and must be reviewed to be based on a HOUSEHOLD income level.\r\n",
