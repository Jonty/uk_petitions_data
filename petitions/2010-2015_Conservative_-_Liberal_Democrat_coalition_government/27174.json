In times of austerity ideas like this should not be given any consideration.\r\n\r\nThe priority should be aimed at using finance to build on the current rail infrastructure, lengthening platforms where needed, improving current lines and safety and not allowing large companies to extract huge amounts of tax payers money on a white elephant project that is not needed. There are better ways to spend this money and this is not one of them.\r\n\r\nWhy should the Government waste \u00a332 billion of tax payers money when they are cutting everything in the country whilst still having to pay back billions of our money in interest on loans.",
