But Flintshire County council still want to put them in place.. Let's show them we do not want these speed bumps to go ahead, we don't want them no and never will. It will cost over \u00a380,000 to do the whole works and that money could be spent on improving the community of bagillt in a much better way how we want it spent, and not on these bumps ",
