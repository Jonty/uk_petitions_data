I am struggling to pay bills and fearing for my job ,because I basically think the government is not doing enough in the interests of ,1 the country ,2 the people ,3 business and the economy . So I would like to put a proposal forward and say no more four years in office. We pay the wages of  every politician and the primeminister. And if we don't think that they are doing a good enough job we should be able to cast a vote of no confidence and bring a eairly election, or sack them like hundreds and thousands of people are it may not sound easy. but I personally think it could work the party who comes second in an election could immediately take over until an election could be arranged . Then maybe just maybe the country could be run a lot better and no promises would be made unless they could actually keep them ",
