Also, the definition of rape states that the act must be done with a penis.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, this description is incredibly biased against men and harmful to people of all genders due to the glaring loopholes in its wording. The entire section should be revised to replace male pronouns with gender neutral words such as \"they\" and rape should be redefined as any penetration - not just that performed with a penis.",
