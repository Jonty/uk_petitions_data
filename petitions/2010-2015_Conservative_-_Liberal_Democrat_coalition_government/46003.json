        "additional_details": "Legislation should be brought in to prevent pay day loan companies from being able to continually commit fraud against members of the public who have had no dealings with the pay day loan company.\r\n\r\nCompanies found to be committing fraud against members of the public should be investigated and if necessary have their licenses revoked.\r\n\r\nAt present it seems that pay day loan companies can commit this type of fraud and somehow get away with it by writing off the loans.  There should be tighter controls on loan companies to make sure that the people requesting the loans will indeed be the people repaying the loans.",
