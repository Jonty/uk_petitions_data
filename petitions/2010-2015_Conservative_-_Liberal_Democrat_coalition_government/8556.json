They have said they want people off benefits but they have removed funding left right and centre. We now have riots and the fact of more unemployed does not help.\r\n\r\nIf you remove from police and councils and then cause more unemployment this outcome is inevitable. The conservative goverment should have learned these basic lessons last time round",
