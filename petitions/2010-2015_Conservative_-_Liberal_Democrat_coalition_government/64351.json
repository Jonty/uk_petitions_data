The Government should change this. By allowing people only to smoke in designated areas, we reduce the extreme health risk caused by second hand smoking and the discusting experience of inhaling second hand smoke. This law would also put less strain on the NHS because of the lessened affect of second hand smoke, anyway, the street is a public place, and although it's outside it's still unacceptable that we should suffer consequences from people who smoke knowing they damage themselves.",
