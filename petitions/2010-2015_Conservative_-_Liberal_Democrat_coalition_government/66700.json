We would like the reference the North of England to genuinely start in the North East and the North West rather than in the West and East Midlands.\r\nThe North East is loosing out due to the perception that the North of England is getting benefits when it is not.\r\nThe Government should be forced by law to correctly define the North of England, and only be allowed to mention the North of England in it's correct Regional context.\r\nThis would highlight the fact that many of the government projects such as HS2 are not benefitting Northern England.\r\nThe West and East Midlands and Yorkshire are not the North of England and this is costing the Northern economy many millions of pounds of investment.",
