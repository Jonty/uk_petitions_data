        "additional_details": "The BBC recently announced the decision to enter into a partnership with SKY Sports to only show 10 (of 20) full and live races of the 2012 season, along with 'extended highlights' of the other races. SKY will retain the rights to show every race, qualification session and practice session, as well as pre and post-race coverage. Despite interest from C4 and Five to keep full coverage of the 2012 F1 season s free-to-air, the BBC has decided to pursue a partnership with SKY and refused to consider a partnership with another free-to-air competitor.\r\n\r\nContrary to the BBC's argument, this proposed decision will make watching a full season of F1 more expensive for viewers and will significantly impact on the ability of the UK to generate future interest and investment in the motorsport industry due to reduced viewing figures.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, request that the Government investigate this decision and persuade the BBC to keep F1 as a free-to-air show in its entirety.",
