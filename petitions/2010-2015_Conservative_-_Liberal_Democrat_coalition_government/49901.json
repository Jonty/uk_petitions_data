It is my belief that the majority of politicians only fight to remain in or gain power.\r\n\r\nThe dissolution with the politicians is that they will not fight for what we want only what their respective parties want.  The whole politic class are self promoting we get 5.6 weeks holiday per annum they along with others in what was the public service award themselves about 13 weeks.\r\n\r\nPublic sector working or office doesn't make you better than the rest of us. We are not your serfs and we are not plebs.\r\n\r\nGive us back our country.\r\n\r\nGive us a referendum now.",
