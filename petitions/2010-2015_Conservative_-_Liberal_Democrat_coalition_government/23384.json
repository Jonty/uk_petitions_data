        "additional_details": "Poor eyesight effects a large proportion of the community, and these unfortunate people are being taxed heavily for their disability by unscrupulous opticians who sell what is effectively two small pieces of glass and some bent metal for huge sums of money.  Spectacles are a necessity if you have fading eyesight and these mass machine produced products are being made for a fraction of what they are being sold for. We the undersigned call upon the Government to look into the real cost of spectacle manufacture and then regulate the selling price of these items down to a fair amount and stop this blatant profiteering on disability.",
