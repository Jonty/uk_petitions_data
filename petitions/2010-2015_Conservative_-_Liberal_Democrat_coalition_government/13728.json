        "additional_details": "Recently, within the electrical and mechanical contracting industry, eight of the largest companies in the UK decided to stop participating in a voluntary group \"The Joint Industry Board\", that sets terms, conditions and wages for electrical and mechanical construction workers.\r\nThe construction industry is a very fast paced career to choose. It is interesting and diverse. However, you often find yourself without work at very short notice, and permanent jobs are very difficult to come by. Add to this that most construction workers are self-employed, and don\u2019t receive sick pay, holiday pay or pensions, and it\u2019s not quite what it seems.\r\nThis is why the JIB was formed.\r\nThey set a minimum terms and conditions for electricians, plumbers, pipefitters, associated trainees and labourers.\r\n\r\nI urge the government, not to allow our craftsmen to be exploited by these companies for financial gain. The UK has a reputation for engineering excellence. Don\u2019t let these companies take it away.\r\n",
