        "additional_details": "The main problem with our health service is lack of money. One of the main ways that tax payers money is spent is on the purchasing of medicine. A very simple and effective way to quickly remedy the current situation is to allow our health service to manufacture and distribute its own pharmaceuticals. Not only could we save ourselves a huge amount of money which could then be spent on better healthcare but also our excess stock could be sold to other countries for a profit.\r\n\r\nAntibiotics, anti-depressants and psychoactive drugs currently soak up a massive proportion of our budget which could be better used enhancing existing services, keeping our hospitals open and maintaining and improving our healthcare infrastructure.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would prefer to see our government spending my money for the benefit of myself and my family. If you feel the same way then please sign this petition. Let's get their attention and turn this problem into a solution.\r\n\r\nBen Osborne\r\nben@benosborne.com",
