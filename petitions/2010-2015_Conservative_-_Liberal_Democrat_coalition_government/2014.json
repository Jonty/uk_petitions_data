        "additional_details": "If someone is on job seekers allowance, there should be a record kept of how much money has been paid to them. When the person gains a job they pay back the money on a sliding scale like you do with student loans (pay nothing if you earn less than \u00a318K ect). This would mean that income tax could be lowered and that people who never go on job seekers allowance do not end up paying for other people who are on it.",
