        "additional_details": "This petition has been raised to urge the government to look into the Motor Insurance Industry processes and quoting policy.  The government insist that it's a legal requirement to have motor insurance, yet they allow the industry to charge what they like for the \"privilege\" of driving on the roads.  If insurance is a legal requirement then it must be made affordable to all.",
