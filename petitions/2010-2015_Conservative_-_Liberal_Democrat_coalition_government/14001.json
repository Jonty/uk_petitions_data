        "additional_details": "The Church of Scientology enjoys non-domestic rates relief in the City of London (80% mandatory rates relief saving them \u00a3270K per year), Westminster (80% mandatory rates relief) and Sunderland (100% mandatory plus discretionary rates relief) but has been refused it in Camden, Manchester and Mid-Sussex where they have their headquarters. If all these local authorities allowed the Church to hold their religious ceremonies without financial penalty then they would save more than \u00a3500K a year and bring about a spiritual revival of the community.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to demand from the government that Scientologists be allowed to practice their faith without the imposition of financial penalty.",
