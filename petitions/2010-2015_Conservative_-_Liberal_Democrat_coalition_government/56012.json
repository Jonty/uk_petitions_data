Someone who has a longstanding illness, which will get worse over time, will not have the ability to enjoy the retirement they have paid into for 50 years. Once you have paid into the system for 40 years you should be able to retire as many people now will not even work for 25 years. Let people who have paid into the system retire and this will free up jobs for younger people. Surely paying \u00a3500 pension is considerably less than keeping someone on income support!",
