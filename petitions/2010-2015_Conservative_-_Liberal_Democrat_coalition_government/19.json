        "additional_details": "As cuts are made to most UK government departments and public services by an average of around 20%, it is an affront that public money is to be spent in increased volumes on the European Union, a body which commands little public confidence.\r\n\r\nThe Multi-Annual Financial Framework, set to run between 2014-20, should impose on the European Union the financial discipline which the organisation has demanded of member countries and which the British public should expect.\r\n\r\nThe MAFF requires unanimity in the Council of Ministers, meaning that the UK can veto unsatisfactory proposals. An increase or a cut of less than 20% should be deemed highly unsatisfactory.",
