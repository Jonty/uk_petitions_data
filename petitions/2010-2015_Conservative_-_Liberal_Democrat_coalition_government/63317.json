        "additional_details": "stop day trip coaches from dropping off and picking up of passengers.Give shop traders a better chance of footfall because the way it is the Shops on The High Street and Lumley Road are having their businesses jeopardised and risk of closure because the lack of possible customers coming to the town on day trip coaches If all these coaches dropped off and collected from the designated coach park it would give ALL Traders of the town a fair chance. Before the coaches started using the promenade all traders had a far better footfall and could afford to and be able to stay open longer and all be open on Sunday's too .last year coaches were double parked blocking the road and preventing the Towns service buses from using the public bus stop. Stopping these coaches would make no difference what so ever to the traders along the Promenade as the tourist always go along there any way .We need help to get these coaches using the seafront and to use the coach park facilities provided\r\n",
