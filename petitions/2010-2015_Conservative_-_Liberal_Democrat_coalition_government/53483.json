        "additional_details": "The Zimbabwe harmonised elections conducted on 31 July 2013 were fraught with irregularities and bias.\r\nThe Zimbabwe registrar general and Electoral Commission have yet to provide a searchable electronic version of the voters roll to opposition parties and election observers.  Both the Research Advocacy Unit (RAU) and the Zimbabwe Election Support Network (ZESN) identified major flaws in election process and voters roll.  In the run up to the poll both SADC and AU observers noted similar credibility concerns.\r\nWe call on the UK Government:\r\n\u2022\tto robustly reject the election results\r\n\u2022\tto aggressively pursue diplomatic channels with SADC, AU and UN to facilitate a new credible election in Zimbabwe\r\n\u2022\tnot to legitimize any Zimbabwean government formed as a result of a fraudulent election and to keep in place all targeted sanctions expanding them where required.\r\nThis is a definitive moment for the integrity of democracy in Africa.\r\n",
