This blight renders properties immediately unsaleable  and in effect home owner loose their human right to free movement . The home owner can only make a claim for compensation once the scheme is completed.This compensation is not for the substantial loss of value purely for inconvenience caused by dust, vibration  and noise .  This can and does mean effected home owners are put into a position where their home  looses significant value and is unsalable. Effected home owners should be in a position where they can benefit from the same rights as those afforded to those effected by the HS2 scheme.We should be able to apply to a Extreme Hardship Fund  as we would be able to if our property was blighted by HS2 .
