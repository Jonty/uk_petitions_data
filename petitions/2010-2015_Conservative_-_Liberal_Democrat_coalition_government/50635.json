The UK government has a duty of care to protect its citizens and since those committing violent acts in the name of 'jihad' are known to be on intelligence lists, it is therefore the government's responsibility to detain and prosecute these individuals by the process of the law before they take the next logical step in \"their\" worldview and commit violent acts.",
