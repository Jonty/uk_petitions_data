        "additional_details": "The option of so called \"devolution max\" was deliberately left off the ballot paper in the Scottish Independence Referendum held on 18th September 2014. The electorate was presented with a straight choice between \"yes\" or \"no\" to independence.\r\n\r\nSince the conclusion of the referendum result, there has been a flurry of intentions announced to deliver further devolution to Scotland \"as demanded by the people of Scotland\".\r\n\r\nThere is NO political mandate for pursuing a further devolution settlement. As this option was left off the ballot paper, it should not be pursued when voters did not have the chance to vote in favour or against further devolution. The Government must not pursue these proposals having failed to put them to the electorate.\r\n\r\nWe demand that the Government take the following action:  the Government shall not pursue, in the life of the current UK Parliament, any further devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament without a devo-max referendum being held.",
