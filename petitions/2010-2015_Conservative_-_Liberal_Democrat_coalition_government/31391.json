        "additional_details": "The Hobbit has been threatened with legal action by the Saul Zaentz Company, who own the merchandising and film rights to all of Tolkien's works and have done for 35 years, and are being forced to rebrand. Obviously, it wouldn't be our beloved Hobbit if it weren't The Hobbit anymore, and whilst copyright must be respected it seems as though this legal case is being put forward for the wrong reasons - the SZC had an ongoing dispute with New Line Cinema over The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit films, and as a way of exerting their power over the legal rights, have started forcing small companies to rebrand. This is not right, and we can't just let this happen",
