        "additional_details": "The Chilcot inquiry is of enormous public interest. Despite this clear public interest however the report itself has not yet been released.\r\n\r\nThis report needs to be released as a matter or urgency, but this release is apparently being held up by the cabinet office and their resistance to certain details being published. This resistance has been criticised not just by Sir John, but also former attorney general Lord Goldsmith.\r\n\r\nThe cabint office needs to cease opposing the release of any such details so that the report can be released and the public can finally understand what was done in their name.",
