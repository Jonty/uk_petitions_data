        "additional_details": "Sports bras should be a compulsory part of PE kit in all UK schools in the same way that mouthguards are for hockey and rugby.\r\nYoung girls of school age often wear everyday bra\u2019s when exercising which can lead to breast pain, embarrassment, and potential long term sag.\r\nResearch demonstrates that the correct bra/ appropriate support reduces breast movement and associated pain and may reduce the risk of long term breast sag.  Giving girls the right information at an early age can improve their body image and even encourage greater take-up of sport at school.\r\nPain and discomfort is not linked to the size of a woman\u2019s breasts.  An A cup woman could be prevented from doing sport just as much as a woman with FF cup breasts.\r\nSports bras should be added to PE kit lists with immediate effect.",
