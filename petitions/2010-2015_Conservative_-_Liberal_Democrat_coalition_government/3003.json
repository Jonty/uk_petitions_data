        "additional_details": "The CSA should pay parents the amount assessed as maintenance and take on the debt of non-paying non-resident parents as the agencies, rather than assessing an amount that a parent NEEDS to bring up a child and then letting the parent have to make do with out or claim income support from other tax payers while non-paying non-resident parents get away with not paying. If the debt was taken on by the government they would put more into chasing it and it would be fairer to parents who have to bring up children alone and fairer to tax payers in general.",
