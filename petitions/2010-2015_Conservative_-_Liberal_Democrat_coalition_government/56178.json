        "additional_details": "The UK Government has rejected our original petition to retain the Winter Fuel Allowance for ex-pats - in this particular instance, based in France.\r\n\r\nThe criteria used by the Government are heavily flawed as they include winter temperatures from tropical overseas departments such as Martinique, Guadeloupe etc.   This is clearly cheating (there is no 'nice' word for the process) and only includes a dozen or so ex-pats.\r\n\r\nWe require the Government to continue to pay the WFA to all pensioners as at present - it is part of the pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
