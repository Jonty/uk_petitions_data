        "action": "Include car insurance within the price of road fund license",
        "additional_details": "At the present moment, failure to purchase car insurance is punishable by the law under the Road Traffic Act 1968 & your vehicle is ALWAYS seized. Currently Motor Insurance can only be purchased from private companies and is thus extremely expensive. The compulsory nature of the legal position distorts market forces and prevents consumer choice. Essentially, the law forces road users, under law, to purchase products from private companies. For example, the cost of 1 year's insurance for a 17 year old male is now in excess of \u00a34,500.\r\nThis petition requests that a not-for-profit 'basic' insurance which satisfies the law be included in the purchase price of the Road Fund License. Should users wish to improve their level of cover then private insurers will be allowed to continue to offer this.\r\nThis change will eliminate uninsured drivers, increase treasury revenues and prevent the police from enforcing extortion.",
