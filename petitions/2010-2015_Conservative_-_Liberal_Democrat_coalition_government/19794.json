        "additional_details": "We would like the government to enforce that all exam boards finish the examinations in the summer of 2014 before the 12/06/11. In order to give all the young men and women a chance to watch the football world cup without having the feeling that they should be revising for the exams. It would allow many people to enjoy their summer a great deal more. Also their exam grades are likely to be higher as there would be no great distraction. Everybody will win!",
