        "additional_details": "The youth riots of 2011 have shown that a large proportion our young people across the UK feel no sense of a shared community, or have the slightest regard for other people's property or wellbeing.\r\n\r\nIn short, Modern Britain's 'youth culture' is deeply isolated and sick. Today's savvy teenagers desperately need the close tuition and real-life learning experiences that their parents and schools have demonstrably failed to give them.\r\n\r\nNeighbouring European countries such as Sweden, Austria, Germany, Norway, Switzerland and Finland have currently, or historically all had compulsory National Service programs. They are among the safest most stable and successful countires in the World.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned see no reason why the life-long skills, sense of shared community and vital notions of self-worth afforded to our neighbouring countries people via National Service should be denied to the young people of Britain. We therefore ask the House to reintroduce compulsory National Service.",
