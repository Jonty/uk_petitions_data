This money goes to the rich landlord who gets his mortgage paid off each month simply by housing the unemployed. The tenants could never get a job which would pay the rent.\r\nWe also have the workshy given free council homes and they never work because they get their rents and council taxes paid whilst still having JSA to spend each week. Yet those who work like myself and pay taxes only get our mortgage interest paid in times of unemployment - this is only \u00a380 a month, and to make things worse the mortgage company requests the full mortgage each month.",
