        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that whilst the new announcement to remove the lifetime blood ban on gay and bisexual men and to instead defer MSM (men who have sex with men) for 12 months is a huge move forward, it does however continue to discriminate gay and bisexual men who practice only safe sex and/or low risk sexual activity.\r\n\r\nHealthy blood is healthy blood.\r\n\r\nTo continue to punish gay and bisexual men that have safe physical and sexual relationships isn't fair. This rule is not applied to their straight counterparts who donate blood and so in turn should not be applied to gay and bisexual men.\r\n\r\nA criteria for donation should be based purely on each and every individuals sexual activity and then risk assessed accordingly, not by judging all MSM as an entire group. This should be applied to ALL no matter what their sexuality. Risky behaviour such as unsafe sex is the same across the board, as is safe sex. Allow gay and bisexual men who are safe to donate.",
