New leases now cover this but why did it not go as far as to cover old leases??   Local councils have huge write ups about this so they know it is a real problem, but can only offer advice they should be able to take this further and be able to enforce that laminate flooring be taken up and replaced with carpet and adequate underlay.\r\n\r\nLiving underneath this flooring with kids running around is hell especially when they refuse to help with the issue by putting down rugs.\r\n",
