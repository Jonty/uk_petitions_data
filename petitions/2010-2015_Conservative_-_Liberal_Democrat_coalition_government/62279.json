        "additional_details": "The Co-operative Group intends to sell off its farmland to help pay off the debts of the Co-operative Bank. The sale of such a large area of land provides an opportunity to help land based co-operatives and young entrants into farming access farmland.  Defra can help in this process by supporting the creation of Community Farmland Trusts to buy or lease the land to ensure that the sale provides an opportunity to create new rural businesses creating rural jobs and boosting local economies.",
