        "action": "Petition for Michael Gove to spend a week working in a comprehensive secondary school",
        "additional_details": "Many of Gove's policies have been severely criticised by those within and beyond educational establishments.  Many of these criticisms rest on the idea that Gove is out of touch with the realities of the education system and fails to understand the educational experience of most people in this country.  When Gove does PR activities in schools, these appear to be carefully selected to represent the ideas he wishes to convey.  It is only by understanding the sometimes harsh truths of the current education system that Gove's policies will be accepted by the public and will have any real chance of bringing positive change to the education system.  This can only be achieved by Gove gaining an inside working knowledge of a secondary comprehensive school.",
