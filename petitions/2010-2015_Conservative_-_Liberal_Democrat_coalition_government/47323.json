        "additional_details": "This is a petition for the government to make it compulsory for ALL schools in the United Kingdom to teach basic first aid to ALL children as part of PSHE. If basic first aid was taught in schools, it would help save hundreds more lives. If a loved one or someone in the street required first aid, people would have been taught the knowledge and information needed to help save these lives. Basic first aid and CPR is a lifelong skill that can and will always be used by everyone.",
