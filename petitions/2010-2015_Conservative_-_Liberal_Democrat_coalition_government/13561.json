        "additional_details": "In Nazi Germany Hitler enforced the rule of 'Sippenhaft' which the government are now using to evict and criminalise families of people that had involvement in the recent UK riots. 'Sippenhaft' is a form of collective punishment used against members of families of criminals. Local councils are currently evicting families of those being tried for offences in court that may not even have been proved guilty yet. This is not only ILLEGAL but should not be happening. The local council does not evict family members of murders, thieves or sexual offenders so why those of people that may have been caught up in a moment of madness?",
