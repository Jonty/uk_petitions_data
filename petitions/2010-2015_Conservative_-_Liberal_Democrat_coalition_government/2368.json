        "additional_details": "I feel the House of Commons should abide by the rules that were implemented by the conservatives under Margaret Thatcher and all voting in the House of Commons should be secret votes enabling the individual MP's to vote secretly for or against items according to the wishes of their constituents. Unions are legally bound to hold secret ballots for strike action etc. and I feel MP's should be allowed the same privilege. This would also allow for more ethical voting rather than being forced to toe the party line. The function of the Whips office would also be freed up to present the party case without having the ultimate power to cause an MP to vote against their conscience and the views of their constituents.",
