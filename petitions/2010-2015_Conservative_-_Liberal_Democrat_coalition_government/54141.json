        "action": "Install speed cameras on Stratford High Street E15",
        "additional_details": "DoT should force Newham Council to install speed cameras on Stratford High St for safety reasons.  Within the last 8 months, 2 hit-and-run incidents were reported in the local press, 1 leaving a couple close to death (03/03/13). These are not isolated incidents and do not cover the high number of accidents & near misses.  The road is a death trap and will claim more lives if no action is taken.  I propose the following be done:  1) Speed signs installed & driver speed restricted to 20 mph between St John's Church and Warton Rd/Rick Roberts Way; 2) 3 x cameras installed, 1 at Gala Bingo (attached to traffic lights to trap drivers who fail to stop at red lights), 1 at Warton Rd/Rick Roberts Way crossroads (attached to traffic lights), and 1 speed camera by Carpenters Rd (to catch speeding motorists); 3) Liaise with Met Police to carry out regular spot checks to trap & fine speeding motorists. To protect local residents & their families, please sign this e-petition and share.",
