        "additional_details": "Meals on wheels is a service that can provide the elderly community a hot meal when they are unable to do this for themselves. What makes them any less important then the prisoners who get given hot meals every day?? I think it is important that this service is made available and funding should be put in place for this is happen and to be successful. The elderly are not toys that councils can just play with, many meals on wheels services have been set up and stopped and the people that need the service the most lose out on a hot meal and a friendly face. So please, put funding in somewhere for this service to be set up and made available all over the UK to help our elderly community.",
