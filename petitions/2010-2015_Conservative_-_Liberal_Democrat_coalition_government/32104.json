        "additional_details": "Britain has the lowest number of bank holidays in Europe, at 8 per year. Compared to\r\nFrance with 11, Germany 15 and Spain 16 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7160892.stm\r\n\r\nBritain is almost unique in Europe, in having no bank holidays between the summer and Christmas.\r\n\r\nThis petition is for the Government to grant us an extra bank holiday, in November.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2011, there were severe riots across the country. Community activity is a central tool in preventing and reversing social degradation.\r\n\r\nIf we get an extra bank holiday, the public will be urged to do something kind on this extra day, each year, to support their local communities. It will be a 'Pay It Forward' bank holiday http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_it_forward\r\n\r\n100,000 signatures are needed, for it to be eligible for debate in the House of Commons!\r\n\r\nPlease help make this happen, by signing this petition now and supporting being kindaware.\r\n\r\nThank you",
