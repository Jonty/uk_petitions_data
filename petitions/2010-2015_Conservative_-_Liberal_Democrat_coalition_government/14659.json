        "additional_details": "Stop the 10% property tax on the re-sale of park homes.  This is a derisory tax and far outstrips the stamp duty paid on a house and hinders those wishing to move to another property because 10% of the final sale price is deducted which then means there is less money to use towards another property. Why is the tax so high at 10%?  Many owners find themselves stuck in their properties because of this high tax.",
