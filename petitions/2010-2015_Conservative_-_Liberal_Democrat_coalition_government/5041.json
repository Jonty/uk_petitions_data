One which promises to create a more educated group of decision makers.\r\n\r\nEveryone in the population has the right to \u2018vote\u2019 \u2013 in the same way as usual.\r\n\r\nOnce at the polling station all prospective voters must take a short test \u2013 containing key ideological questions about the main parties, as well as questions on sustainability and utilitarianism (and in the case of referendums questions about the specific issue).\r\n\r\nShould a prospective voter fail the test, their vote becomes invalid \u2013 but the voter is NOT made aware of this.\r\n\r\nThat way we are still galvanised by the idea of democracy, but only those with the necessary knowledge to make an informed decision have any actual power.\r\n",
