        "additional_details": "Many road accidents are caused by inexperienced young / new drivers. To improve road safety the number of penalty points required for a ban should be reduced for young / new drivers to 6 points. If they collect 6 points they should be made to re-take their test before being allowed on the road again. This would make those drivers more careful and if they are not then they will be removed from the roads sooner. This should reduce accidents and consequently motor insurance premiums should fall.",
