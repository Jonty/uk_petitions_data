        "additional_details": "With the rioting of the last few days, it is now long overdue for crimes of all sorts to be reviewed and the punishments increased.  For example rioting, looting, violence against anyone especially the police, arson etc, the prison sentances have really got to reflect the severity of the crimes, we must get respect for the police back, and the only way to support them in this is to fit the correct and just punishments, not merely a slap on the wrist and a fine or 6 months in prison.  Where we have young children running wild and lawless, then the parents must be brought to book and the children placed in a secure establishment where they can be educated and trained etc.   Bring back Borstal Reform School, run them from early morning to lights out, and perhaps we can turn them around to become decent citizens before it is to late.",
