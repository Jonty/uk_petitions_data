We propose that an officer found guilty of using racist language, whilst on duty, face a short prison sentence.  This will create a sufficient deterrent for officers stop using such language whilst in uniform. Although this may not end racism within the force it will act as a sufficient deterrent to those minority groups who feel that they can get away with using such disgusting and vile language without consequences.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to pass a legislation to not only make illegal the use of racist language by on duty officers but to also provide a minimum prison sentence for those found guilty.\r\n\r\n",
