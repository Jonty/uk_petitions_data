        "additional_details": "This aim of this petition is to persuade the Government to charge less VAT - or no VAT - on biodegradable chewing gum.  Such gum is possible (see http://corkindependent.com/stories/item/5771/2011-45/By-gum!).\r\n\r\nAs the USA (Orange County) has done with  engine noise, differential taxation would incentivise manufacturers of nonbiodegradable gum to stop and move to a more environmentally friendly product.  The difference to our streets, and the saving in clean-up costs - would be enormous.",
