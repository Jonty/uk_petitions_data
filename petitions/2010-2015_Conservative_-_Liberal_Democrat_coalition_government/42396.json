        "additional_details": "We call on government to take immediate action that will ensure flood victims and flood hit communities can obtain affordable flood insurance after 2013, in the interests of individuals, communities and the national economy.\r\n\r\nHouseholds that have flooded and those reckoned to be at high flood risk face massively increased insurance costs in a free market, as premiums rise to reflect individual risk.\r\n\r\nInsurance underpins the security of people\u2019s homes and their value.  The end of the \u201cStatement of Principles\u201d in 2013 threatens an unfettered free market that could leave 200,000 homes unable to get flood insurance.  This would\r\n-\tDecimate the value of homes, possibly making them totally unsellable\r\n-\tBlight the health and wealth of individuals and whole communities\r\n-\tBlight local economies, particularly housing markets and small businesses\r\n-\tBlight the lives of older and vulnerable people, who may never recover fully from flooding\r\n",
