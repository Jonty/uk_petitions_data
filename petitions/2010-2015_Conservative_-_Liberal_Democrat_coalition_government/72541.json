        "additional_details": "American businesses are introducing Black Friday sales in the UK. UK retailers feel pressured to compete. In America Black Friday encourages a frenzy of greed opposite to the spirit of Christmas. It causes riots; employees and the public get injured, public property is damaged and the police are called off important duties to keep order.\r\nWe already have post-Christmas sales.\r\nFor the sake of public order we call for a a UK ban on Black Friday and other short-term sales in December.",
