If reported to have done so again within a year the police have the right to confiscate the vehicle. There is no right of appeal and decision are often based soley on witness statements. This goes against the basic right to have a fair trial and be judged by an impartial tribunal. For this reason S59 should be repealed or amended to allow decisions to be appealed in court.",
