        "additional_details": "I am campaigning for the government to force local authorities to act on behalf of educational staff when they are referred to on social networking sites in a libellous manner! I believe that it is time we stood up to  parents and carers who choose to personally name staff members in regards to issues which are untrue, under investigation or indeed have been settled following the procedures, which we in education must abide with.  As educational practitioners we have no right of reply and must stand by and see our good names defamed by those who believe they have an axe to grind.  In all other walks of life one is presumed innocent until proven guilty let us regain those rights before the tidal wave of disrespect and disdain engulfs us!",
