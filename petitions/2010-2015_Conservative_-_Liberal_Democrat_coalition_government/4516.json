I would then like to be able to apply online, if applicable. As my circumstances change, and as taxation rules and policies change, I would like to be informed as to how I will be affected. I would like to be able to see my working history, national insurance contributions, income tax, etc. displayed through a single interface. Future expansion could include access to my own medical records, which can be shared with this system for added information on disabilities, etc.",
