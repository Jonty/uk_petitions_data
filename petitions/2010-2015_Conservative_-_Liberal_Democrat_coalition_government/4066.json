The fact that they do so at present, has had a harmful effect on non-subscription television channels.\r\n\r\nWe should have three separate forms of television funding.\r\n\r\n1. Channels - such as the BBC - funded by public licence.  Not allowed to carry any advertising.\r\n\r\n2. Subscription channels - such as Sky Television - funded by the amounts paid by subscribers.  Not allowed to carry an advertising.\r\n\r\n3. Advertising-funded channels - such as ITV, C4 and C5. Funded only by advertising.\r\n\r\nTelevision channels - such as Sky - should not be allowed to have two bites of the cherry, by charging viewers a subscription AND carrying advertising.",
