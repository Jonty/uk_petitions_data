        "additional_details": "That the present Government for the British recognise that a Country called Britain is as much a Contrivance as a Country called Europe and that it should therefore no longer exist. It produces for the British the kind of Union that so many in the Islands of the British find so distasteful in the European. In the process of dividing Ireland against the will of the majority of Irish people and denying to Scotland and to Wales the voice in the conduct of affairs that they are entitled to the present Union of the British accords to the Capital City of the English disproportionate Power, Status and Benefit. Britain as a Country is a Device not of British Design but of English. If Britain continues to exist at all it is only as a geographical notion and historical curiosity that it should. In any worthwhile and proper Union of the British the only Countries that should exist are England, Scotland, Wales and a restored and reunited Ireland.",
