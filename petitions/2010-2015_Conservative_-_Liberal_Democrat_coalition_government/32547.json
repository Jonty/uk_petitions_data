        "additional_details": "We the undersigned do hereby request a debate and action on the following points:\r\n\r\n1. Privatise the BBC so that UK tax payers do not have to subsidise it, particularly those who do not watch, listen to or utilise BBC services.\r\n\r\n2. Scrap the TV license fee and put the money back into the pockets of hard working UK tax payers.\r\n\r\n3. Stop the TV licensing fee for other media such as Broadband and Telephony which UK bill payers already pay for through monthly payments to the service providers that supply their services.\r\n\r\n4. If the above cannot be agreed upon then a discussion on reduced or free TV licenses must be had in the case of disabled (not just blind or partially sighted), elderly or low income household which cannot afford to pay for it.
