        "additional_details": "At 12 weeks/3 months, the foetus by now, has a brain, a heartbeat, a developing nerevous system and can be recognised as either a boy or girl. From 10 weeks, pain receptors are present and breathing movements can be recorded, meaing that if you abort a foetus after the first trimester, it will feel the pain of being terminated and that will be one son/daughter that could have had an appropriate name for its gender, being terimated.\r\nAt 24 weeks, the baby still has a chance of survival if premature and most if not all of its vital organs and human features are present.\r\nPease sign this petition if you are pro-choice but against unborn babies feeling unnecessary pain as they're practically being killed with a gender, a heartbeat, organs and senses intact.",
