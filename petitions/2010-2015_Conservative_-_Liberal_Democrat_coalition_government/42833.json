These larger businesses and corporations should not be getting away with millions of pounds worth of Corporation Tax. We simply cannot afford to be losing that amount of money.\r\n\r\nI suggest starting ASAP with closing the loopholes that allow tax-dodging. And then focus on collecting the tax we're owed as a country from the worst offenders before HMRC even dreams about cracking down on small businesses.\r\n\r\nPlease treat this matter urgently.",
