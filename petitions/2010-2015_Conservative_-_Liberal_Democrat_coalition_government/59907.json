        "action": "To give carers the option of taking the 'council assessed budget' as a paid salary instead of buying in care.",
        "additional_details": "I would like the government to consider the possibility of offering a salary to main carers of families where there is a disabled person, particularly adults. At the moment especially in adult services the government carries out an assessment of need and awards a budget of which care is then paid for, usually at expensive rates e.g hourly rate through direct payment is at least \u00a37.65 & the cost of 1 overnight in council run respite is \u00a3210 meanwhile the main family carer is awarded \u00a359.75 per week benefit for the majority of hours of care undertaken. The main carer is usually then caught in a benefit trap where employers are reluctant to employ them due to caring duties, we are not protected by law caring for adults past the age of 18 & more often than not are 'let down' by our councils with lapses in care plans which result with the responsibility of care falling back on to us.",
