        "additional_details": "Foreign embassies in London have failed to pay more than \u00a382m in congestion charge since 2003,\r\n\r\nSince the daily charge was levied in 2003, the US Embassy has built up a bill in excess of \u00a38.7m, followed by Japan at \u00a36m and Russia with \u00a35.2m.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, diplomats had 5,662 unpaid parking fines worth \u00a3541,599, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\r\n\r\nThe US, which has the largest congestion charge bill, has long maintained that diplomatic immunity exempts it from paying the congestion charge. It also had \u00a31,075 in unpaid parking fines last year.\r\n\r\nCongestion Charge is a charge for a service and not a tax. Diplomats are not immune. Please apply the rules to everyone and not just law-abiding Londoners.\r\n\r\n(Source: www.bbc.co.uk, July 2014)",
