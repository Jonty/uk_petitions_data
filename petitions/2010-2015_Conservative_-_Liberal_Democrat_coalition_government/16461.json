        "additional_details": "All too often people assume that everyone has access to healthcare here in the UK.  However,  every year, many families seeking basic immunisations for their children or medicine for themselves  are not able to see a doctor.  With ever increasing inequality in healthcare, both in the UK and overseas, health is not and must not become a luxury! Health is priceless.  Having access to healthcare is essential for the patient, but it also has wider implications from a public health point of view.\r\nThis petitions calls for the UK government to uphold the right of vulnerable migrants to access healthcare regardless of their ability to pay. Health is not a luxury.\r\n\r\n",
