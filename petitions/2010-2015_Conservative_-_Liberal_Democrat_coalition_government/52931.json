However, employers sometimes take ownership of them by writing a clause into an employee's contract.\r\n\r\nhttp://answers.onstartups.com/questions/19422/if-im-working-at-a-company-do-they-have-intellectual-property-rights-to-the-st\r\n\r\nHigh-tech startups are likely to form an important part of the UK's future economy, and these often start off as side-projects. But some employees are prevented from doing this, due to the clauses.\r\n\r\nCalifornia has a law that states that anything employees do on their own time that isn't related to their employers' line of work is theirs. I propose that the UK passes a similar law.",
