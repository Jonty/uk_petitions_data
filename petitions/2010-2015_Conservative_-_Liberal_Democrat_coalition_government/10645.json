This means they are hard to trace if they break the law and or commit motoring offenses. I feel all travellers should be made to pay \u00a325 per two weeks for their vehicles if not registered within the UK failure to do so will mean their vehicles will be seized for sale or destruction. All overseas visitors should also have to pay this when entering the UK in an unrequested UK vehicle and this will allow them to drive for two weeks within the UK on leaving the UK the time will be checked and if they have exceeded the two weeks they will have to pay for additional weeks the minimum being two weeks i.e. \u00a325. Each time they visit the UK in an unregistered UK vehicle then they must pay another \u00a325. Even if their last visit was only a couple of days ago on entry, they pay \u00a325.",
