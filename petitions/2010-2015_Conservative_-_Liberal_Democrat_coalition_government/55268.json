        "additional_details": "New regulations have recently come into power whereby EACH parent can be fined \u00a360 per day per child for unauthorised absence from school (taking children out of school for holidays). This has been introduced to ensure all children get the best possible education, something most people would agree with. However it seems a double standard has arisen. Parents get fined for taking a single child out of school for a single day, but teachers face no action by taking large numbers of children out of school because they choose to strike. This petition is to introduce a fairer system that will see either the teachers or the unions penalised to the same value that parents are, \u00a360 per child per day.\r\n\r\nPlease sign up and end this double standard.",
