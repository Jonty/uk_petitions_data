Examples: KPMG, Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young. They offer a 2nd opinion to judge a company's operations and suggest improvement. Any type of this business make profit by offering this service by forcing their client to pay for something they do not need. 'Identify, Qualify, Pursuit and Engage' summarize  the company's needs, and tie them to an agreement. Recruiters have flourished from the mid 1990s. Candidates with a passion to fulfil the needs of an employer are eliminated by an agent\u2019s decision, who has no understanding of the employer\u2019s needs. They read the spiel of the employer to the applicant, as they would entice a new farm hand to a job, but the agent has never seen a field. Employers should handle their own requirements.",
