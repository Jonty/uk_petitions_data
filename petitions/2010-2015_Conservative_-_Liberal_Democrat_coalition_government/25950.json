        "additional_details": "I would like the government to take direct action to secure the future of our airport.\r\nThis airport is a vital hub for the north east and could be a major hub for international travellers, but like so many other UK airports it is being ravaged and is at the mercy of property developers and land grabbers. We need flexibility as well as investment in our transport infrastructure. Regional airports offer much greater flexibility than trains, cars and coaches for both domestic and international travel. With investment, the right management and the right partners Durham Tees Valley Airport would be viable and profitable.The state should take ownership of the entire site, including the land hived off by the current owners / management.",
