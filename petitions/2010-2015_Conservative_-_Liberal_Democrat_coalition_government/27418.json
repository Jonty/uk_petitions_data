        "additional_details": "For the Past few years the Pay, benefits and pensions of Public Sector workers have been under attack with pay freezes, expenses cuts and now an attack on pensions where as Politicians have received pay rises, had attempts to cut their excessive expenses claims relaxed and have no such attack on their pensions or other bonuses. I propose that politicians' pay rises should reflect public sector workers, i.e. that they should be frozen until the % rises they have received over the past two years are achieved by public sector workers and then they should recieve % rises in line with public sector workers from then on. Also that politicians pensions should be subject to the same reviews as public sector workers and finally that the same restrictions be placed on expenses for politicians as public sector workers.",
