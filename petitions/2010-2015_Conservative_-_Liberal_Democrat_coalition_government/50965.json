        "additional_details": "The EU has managed to keep its integrity thanks to the massive bailouts for which we are having to pay, but it is a small price to pay for the unification and peace that the EU has to offer.\r\nBy keeping its integrity the EU has shown that it means business and that it is here to stay. However, if the UK were to leave then that integrity would be shattered. It would be a matter of time before the Union would rupture, taking our peace along with it. We do not remember the times from before the EU, times of war, conflict and destruction. Look at the history and tell me that we want that for our children?\r\nThere are very able people working for most of the year on reforms that the EU undoubtedly needs. We must put our trust in them as well as the European Union, for better or for worse, and not run away just because things are getting a little difficult. Because running away from things that seem difficult is a childish and pathetic approach to life that gets nothing done.",
