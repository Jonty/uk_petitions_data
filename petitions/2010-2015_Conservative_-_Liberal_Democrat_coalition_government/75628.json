As we saw from a recent Telegraph study (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/road-and-rail-transport/11043893/Rail-fare-hike-Britain-vs-rest-of-Europe.html), the UK has the most expensive train fares in Europe. The government may believe that it stops fair business and competition, but this countries relies on rail travel and the history of this country was built on train travel. Why then, should our business men and women, students and people of industry spend their hard earned money on getting to the jobs they need for themselves and to keep the economy going.\r\n\r\nWe propose a fairer system, enshrined in law, where a companies can only charge so much per mile, keeping competitive business alive but keeping fair prices to the consumer.
