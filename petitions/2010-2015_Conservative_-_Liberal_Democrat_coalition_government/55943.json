No specific questions are being asked.\r\n\r\nWe want the government and OFSTED to start asking schools questions about their young carers and hopefully they will start identifying more and giving them support in school that they so desperetly need.\r\nIt will also work by raising awareness and understand about what young carers have to go through.\r\n\r\n ",
