        "additional_details": "Under European Directive, public bodies wishing to advertise contracts for the supply of many goods and services must do so at a European level, using a standard format. The large number of interested tenderers that may respond to an advertisement makes the chance of any one winning such a competition very small.  The vast amount of abortive man-hours generated by the staff of those competing contractors is a huge waste of productive resource.  The large amount of detailed information required to be entered favours the larger companies.  Those larger companies can unfairly refer to the resources of any of their regional offices whether they will be involved in the awarded contract or not.  The whole OJEU system is unfair and needs to be reformed",
