We joined a trading partnership in the EEC & as such we were misled as to the future aims of the organisation in that no mention was made in the 1970's that Europe was aiming to become a political policy and law making government. Our government should make application to withdraw from the EU & as in the past make our own laws free from outside interference. ",
