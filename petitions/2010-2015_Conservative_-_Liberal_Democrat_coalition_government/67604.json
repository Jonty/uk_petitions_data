I know I am not the only parent with the concern that schools don't do this. I do not believe that refusing to give a child medicine prescribed by the doctor is putting a childs welfare first like schools claim they do.\r\n\r\n My daughter was prescribed antibiotics by the doctor  last week and school would not give her the second dose of medicine. Medicines are supposed to be spaced evenly through the day meaning no matter when the first dose is, the second dose would be in school time, especially for younger children who have earlier bedtimes.",
