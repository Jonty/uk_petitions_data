        "additional_details": "From April 2013 missing people will be categorised as either \u2018absent\u2019 or \u2018missing\u2019, and an investigation will only happen for \u2018missing\u2019 people.\r\n\r\nVulnerable children who are repeatedly absent from where they should be, will no longer be searched for by police. This is of major concern when protecting vulnerable young people from child sexual exploitation (CSE) and trafficking. It also directly ignores recommnedations made in November 2012 by the Children\u2019s Commissioner.\r\n\r\nA child missing from care or home is at significant risk of CSE. Until a sufficient way to safeguard young people who are deemed \u2018absent\u2019 is in place, no changes should be made. All reports of missing children should trigger a police investigation. ",
