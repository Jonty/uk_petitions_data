        "additional_details": "We are doing this e-petition for registered disabled people who are being forced to go through the medical assessments. The government are doing these medical assessments for the registered disabled to see whether they are eligible to work or not. Most disabled people can't work under any circumstance, just sitting at a desk for 10 minutes will create so much pain. Also having to sit in front of a panel will just be too much for some people to cope with as some suffer with anxiety and depression. Overall these medical assessments will just be too much for people mentally, emotionally and physically so they need to be cut and stopped.",
