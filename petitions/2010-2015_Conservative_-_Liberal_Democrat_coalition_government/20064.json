        "additional_details": "Patients with suspected breast, testicular or any other cancer can walk into see their GP free of charge for a diagnosis. However a patient with a suspected mouth cancer does not only have to find access to an NHS dentist but also pay a charge for this service unless they are exempt. The treatment for mouth cancer also results in the patient having a significant need for dental rehabilitation, which can be complex and expensive. Under the current exemption guidelines patients who need dental treatment following therapy for their mouth cancer would have to pay for this at their dentist and if this treatment weren\u2019t offered on the NHS they would have to pay privately. Why should patients with mouth cancer have to pay for treatment that is due to a direct consequence of cancer therapy when patients with other cancers do not have to pay for any reconstructive or rehabilitation treatment which may arise due to the direct consequence of their cancer therapy.
