        "additional_details": "The Government must act to ban the RSPCA, breeders and other animal welfare organisations from neutering puppies as young as six weeks of age.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis I believe is animal abuse, and flies in the face of the five freedoms under the Animal Welfare Act of 2007.\r\n\r\nThe duty of care part of that legislation clearly states a pet must be allowed to\r\n \"exhibit normal behaviour patterns\"\r\n\r\nBy paediatric neutering, they are removing three major hormones. Those hormones are there to allow animals to reach both physical and mental maturity.\r\n\r\nNeutering at this age can negatively affect the health and future behaviour of these immature puppies.",
