Through the bookkeeping service, each month HMRC should satisfy itself that the returns are correct and should resolve any queries or deficiencies on the spot without penalty.\r\n\r\nMany a small business would actually pay for this service given that it would be a bookkeeping service which would also reduce the risk and costs associated with audits.  It would also force HMRC to rethink much of the red tape placed on business as the HMRC themselves are themselves forced to wade through the business end of their own requirements.  From HMRC's point of view this would be akin to being paid by small businesses to validate their numbers each month.",
