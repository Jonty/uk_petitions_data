        "additional_details": "The terms AD (Anno Domini) and BC (Before Christ) are increasingly being sidelined by state institutions such as the BBC in favour of CE (Common Era) and BCE (Before Common Era). This politically correct gesture is supposed to appease non Christians even though the start of CE is the birth of Christ. We petition the Government to outlaw the terms CE and BCE and make it mandatory for all public institutions to use the terms AD and BC.",
