        "additional_details": "I believe that the deposit of \u00a350, in order to enrol into NewVic Sixth Form College is a technique of BRIBERY to consume the income from young students for the benefits of NewVic's reputation. Many deprived students in East London have to live on benefits and child tax credit, and are unable to pay for even the essential items that are supplied. The fact that an underachieving or less able student must pay a deposit in order to secure a place in NewVic is disrespectful and undermining the position and class of a deprived student. I want the government to take action and notice the idiotic actions and regulations of NewVic Sixth Form College.",
