        "additional_details": "The flag of the union was created in the 17th century, Wales being subsumed by England in the 13th Century. However, when a country is beaten in battle, the country's name is not changed.  Therefore Wales has always been Wales and not a 'little England'. This was recognised by King Henry VII who had the Welsh Dragon on his Royal Coat of Arms. My petition therefore is simple, on the coronation of Prince Charles to King Charles III, he should, with parliaments blessing, change the union flag to incorporate the Welsh, change the royal coat of arms to show only one quarter of 3 lions, the other, a Welsh Dragon.  The Welsh are a people; the original Britons!  This fact should now be recognised. Thank you for listening to my petition.",
