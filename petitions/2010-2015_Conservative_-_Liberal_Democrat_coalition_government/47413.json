        "additional_details": "On 15/11/12, Adam Simmonds became the Police & Crime Commissioner (PCC) for Northamptonshire.  A week later he appointed four Assistant PCC's - including his campaign election agent and his press officer.  In March 2013, following what was laughably described as a \"rigorous\" selection process, the same people were made permanent.\r\n\r\nWith salaries in excess of \u00a365,000 per year, these friends of Adam Simmonds are each consuming enough resource to put three police officers on our streets.\r\n\r\nWe need an urgent independent investigation, at Central Government level, to ascertain why Adam Simmonds' campaign staff have been given these highly paid roles despite having no recorded involvement with the Police.",
