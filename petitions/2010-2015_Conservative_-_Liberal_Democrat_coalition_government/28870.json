        "additional_details": "For sometime now while commuting to working in the morning, i have noticed that there are many London commuters like me that tend to use the underground tube network after 9.30am which qualifies for an off-peak travel rate.\r\n\r\nHowever I feel most like me will be leaving work at the end of the day around 6pm but because this is before 7pm, they would have to pay a peak travel rate.\r\n\r\nTherefore if the commuter has bought a weekly travelcard, they will have no choice but to but at a peak rate.\r\n\r\nI therefore propose a half and half London Travelcard that allows you to travel between 9.30am to 6pm and will be priced at a rate between peak and off-peak.\r\n\r\nThis will help to save money for the cash tight commuters who are struggling to meet travel cost in these hard economic times.",
