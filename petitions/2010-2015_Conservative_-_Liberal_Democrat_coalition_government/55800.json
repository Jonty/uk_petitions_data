        "additional_details": "We all know that the cost of Fossil Fuels for consumers increases year by year faster than we earn, so its a no-brainer we need to reduce our dependency on Fossil Fuels. Of course there is a very large benefit for the planet.\r\n\r\nThe cost of many green energy resources is decreasing year by year and obtaining the associated technology is a highly desirable and lucrative goal for the country.\r\n\r\nTherefore the UK now needs to alter its energy dependency from fossil fuels to alternative sources and create a long term plan. This could have the added benefit of abolishing the high turnover of short-lived Ministers of State for Energy.\r\nWhat are the alternative sources? Well here's a few examples:\r\n\r\n1) Tidal Power\r\n2) Wave Power\r\n3) Solar Power\r\n4) Wind Power\r\n4) Hydroelectricity\r\n5) Geothermal Power\r\n6) Biomass\r\n7) Nuclear Power (sorry about the long half life but its the lesser of 2 evils)\r\nSo lets sort the mess out now! Vote for a common sense Energy Policy.",
