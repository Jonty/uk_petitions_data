        "additional_details": "The Chagos islanders were forcibly evicted from the Chagos Archipelago in 1973. This eviction was to pave way for a US military base which would be rented by the UK Government to the US for a \u00a314 million discounted price on the Polaris missiles. The 2,000 Chagossians were relocated to the Seychelles and Mauritius, where they have lived ever since.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, the Islanders won a High Court ruling which should allow them to return to the Islands. But since then, the Government has prevented their return by creating a marine park to protect the wildlife of the area and to also stop the Chagossians from fishing in the waters.\r\n\r\nI ask that the Government rethink their policy towards the Chagossians who had been living in the islands for  hundreds of years, and allow the Islanders to return to their rightful home.",
