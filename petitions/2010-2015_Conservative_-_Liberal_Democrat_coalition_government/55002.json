        "additional_details": "It is currently understood that only one female to every five males are diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the real statistic is that for every 5 males  supported with Aspergers, 4 females go unsupported.\r\n\r\nThis is because Females with Aspergers Syndrome present differently with different symptoms and  may be misdiagnosed with alternative labels such as OCD, Anorexia, Anxiety, Manic Depression.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be a FEMALE ONLY criteria for diagnosis in young women so these bright ,intelligent, women can remain just that and are not left unsupported to become exploited by their condition,their naivety and social misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThey must be helped and supported at the root cause of their disability rather than treating the symptoms of the undiagnosed Aspergers.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this petition is for every health care professional in the UK always consider  Aspergers in females when they present with any of the above issues , under a female only profile.",
