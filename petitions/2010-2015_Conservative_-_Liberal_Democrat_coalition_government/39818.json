A law should be set in place for any person(s) to burn poppys or any remembrance symbol. If we burnt their Quran or remembrance symbols, it would be a crime and allot of issues would be set upon the induvidual.\r\n\r\nLet's make it fair that everybody is treated the same and any induvidual who takes part should be considered for imprisonment or deportation.\r\n\r\n#Support the British Troops",
