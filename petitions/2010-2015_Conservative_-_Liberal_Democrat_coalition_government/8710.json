        "additional_details": "We need to respond to the mindless behavior shown by the rioting youth and demonstrate to them that this is not an 'entitlement' society where you can expect something for nothing. National Service including a Civil as well as an Armed Forces element should be initiated ASAP to get youths who clearly have too much time on their hands  a) off the streets, b) to teach them respect for others and their community c) teach them the basic discipline and skills of self respect, timeliness, teamwork and hard work required by and often sighted as lacking by employers. This will also send a clear message to all young people that you have to contribute to society if you wish to enjoy the rewards of living in a tolerant democracy and a society funded by hard working tax payers that has a generous social welfare system.",
