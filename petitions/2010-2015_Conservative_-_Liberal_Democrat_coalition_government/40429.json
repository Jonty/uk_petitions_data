        "additional_details": "25% of people will suffer from some form of mental illness during their lives. It is becoming increasingly common for doctors and medical professionals to refer a patient to a counsellor or therapist to get better. This is a good thing which treats the illness rather than just prescribing drugs to hide the problem. However there are NO regulations for counsellors or therapists and NO requirement to even complete a basic course. This must change! Anyone practicing as a professional therapist from any perspective should be required to be regulated, have sufficient training to be competent and have a minimum number of supervised practice hours. Untrained therapists can do serious damage to clients\u2019 well-being and mental health. They must be regulated.",
