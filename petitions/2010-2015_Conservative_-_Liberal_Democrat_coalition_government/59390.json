        "additional_details": "We urge the HM Government to define the parameters of any possible ownership of Velociraptors, as well as any other Dinosauria clades.\r\nThere is a growing likelihood that private animal ownership will expand to \u201cfringe\u201d animals, as has already been seen with the growing market for marsupial sugar gliders, squirrel monkeys, ferrets and chimpanzees.\r\nWhile ownership of Velociraptors (and related species) isn\u2019t widespread today, a regulatory system will be of benefit to owners, animals and society at large once they become everyday household pets.\r\nTheir intuitive nature can easily cause inadvertent harm to other nearby residents, should they stray from their home without supervision. Strict licensing on all breeding should be formed and introduced, effective as soon as possible.\r\nWe also urge the HM Government to act simultaneously to strictly limit the captive ownership of Velociraptors by organisations for any purpose, in particular for aims of profit. The animals\u2019 welfare is at stake.",
