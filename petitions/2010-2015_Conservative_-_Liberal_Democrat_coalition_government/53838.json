        "additional_details": "Hillcote provides respite and day care accommodation for children with disabilities in and around Salisbury, priding itself upon its strong commitment to integration, community activity, teaching, outings for children, and staff development. Respite care makes a significant difference in the lives of families with children with disabilities, allowing them to relax with peace of mind; cope with daily responsibilities; and participate in social activities.\r\n\r\nDespite its significance and importance for these children and their families, Wiltshire Council proposes to close Hillcote in April 2014, presenting services in Devizes or specialist foster carers as alternatives, both of which are inadequate and unfeasible; there are not enough specialist foster carers in Salisbury, and Devizes is a 50-mile round trip. This petition hereby calls upon the Department of Health to stop this closure and ensure the continuation of vital respite services within Salisbury.",
