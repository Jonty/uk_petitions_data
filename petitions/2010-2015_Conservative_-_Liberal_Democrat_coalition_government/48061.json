        "additional_details": "France has recently changed its laws such that non-French ski instructors and guides would be breaking the law by showing tourists around resorts because they are generally not qualified to the ISTD standard even if they hold equivalent qualifications from other professional bodies. However, few of Ecole Ski Francais' have the qualification now required by France's own laws. In effect, the latest iteration of the law France is now imposing, only apply to non-French instructors or guides. This is anti-competitive, wrong morally and surely from the viewpoint of the European ideal - even if not actual European law.   ",
