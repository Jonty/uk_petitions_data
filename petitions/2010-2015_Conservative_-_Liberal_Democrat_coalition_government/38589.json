        "additional_details": "A Request for Public Enquiry into the structure and administration of the Council Tax Banding  System and the practices involved in Band Determination.\r\nSupport is sought from House Owners and others for a Public Enquiry into the determination of Banding. The primary objection over-riding these processes are that they are governed by the Official Secrets Act. It is submitted that this secrecy is out of place in Democratic Government in this area. Secrecy breeds suspicion\r\nIf  there are householders who feel they have been or likely to have been discriminated against even if they are unaware of that since that is of the essence then they are invited to support this petition.\r\nThe objective of the Enquiry should be the elimination of a secretive and subjective tax system  and its replacement by an objective transparent  and clear system devoid of discrimination and where truth is paramount\r\n",
