One way of achieving this might be to restrict the pay of the highest paid Director / Employee of a company (including the banks and utilities) to an agreed multiple of the lowest paid. And whilst we welcome the EU initiative to restrict the size of bankers\u2019 bonuses we believe that where bonuses are involved these should be an agreed percentage of profits (not multiples of salaries) and shared pro-rata amongst all who contributed.",
