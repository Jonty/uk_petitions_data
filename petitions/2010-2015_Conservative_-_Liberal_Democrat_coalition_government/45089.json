Technology for membership cards already exists and is inexpensive.  The membership card would need to be swiped to gain entry to the building and then inserted into the machine in order for it to work.\r\n\r\nThis would be a nationwide scheme - a customer only needs to sign up with ID once.  The customer would then be able to keep a track of their betting spending by logging onto the membership website and problem gamblers would be able to set betting limits or \u2018self-exclude\u2019 to all gambling premises nationwide.\r\nCurrent self exclusion does not work as a customer can simply go to another betting shop or casino. Having a nationwide scheme will help problem gamblers stop gambling.\r\n",
