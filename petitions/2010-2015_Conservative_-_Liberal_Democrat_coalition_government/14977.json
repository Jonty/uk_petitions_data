        "additional_details": "At present mobile phone network operators such as Orange can lock new mobile phones so they cannot be used on other rival networks with a new SIM card. They will \"unlock\" the phones for a \u00a320 fee. This is iniquitous and anti-competitive and should not be allowed. I ask the government to stop mobile phone network operators from selling or distributing mobile phones locked to their network.",
