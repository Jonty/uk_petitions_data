By cutting the number of mp's in government, and cutting the wages and budgets of all of their departments. this might make the rest of the country think he is trying to make the cuts equal. At this time it looks as if the only cuts he is making are to the long term sick and the lowest paid. Most of the cuts he has made at this time have not affected any of the highest paid in this country,  all the fat cat bankers and mp's are sitting pretty, while people like myself end up by losing \u00a390/week",
