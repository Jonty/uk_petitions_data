        "action": "Ban the sale of cosmetics tested on animals",
        "additional_details": "The EU banned cosmetic testing on animals in Europe in 2009 however we can still purchase products which have been tested on animals.\r\n\r\nWhen the animals are tested on they are kept in appalling, unnatural conditions and they cannot live life to their full potential and I feel that no living creature should be treated like this.\r\n\r\nYou might say that its the safest way to test the cosmetics but this is wrong due to animals having different genetic structures to humans and something that may be not harmful to an animal could be harmful to a human. Also companies such as Lush have used other methods to test their products rather than using animals so the other companies can do the same.\r\n\r\nI really hope cosmetics tested on animals will be banned so please sign this petition.\r\n\r\nList of comapnies testing on animals\r\nhttp://www.thevegetariansite.com/ethics_test.htm\r\n",
