        "additional_details": "Caravans are used all year around, these vehicles have mechanical parts and tyres that wear with use and degrade with time. Most caravans are over 1ton in weight and they need to be road worthy. Caravans are not required to have an MOT test at present and many older caravans are never serviced. There are plenty of caravans with tyres well over 5 years old which is the recommended time to replace them. An MOT will ensure these vehicles are road worthy and safe, hopefully reducing the accident rate seen in the summer months. Yes I am a caravan owner.",
