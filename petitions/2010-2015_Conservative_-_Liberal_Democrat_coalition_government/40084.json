        "action": "Alternatives to Enforced Pension Annuity",
        "additional_details": "A consequence of QE to stimulate the economy is further decline of Annuity rates for the current crop of retirees. Rates have fallen from 15% in the 90's to less than 5% today, and yet we now auto-enrol workers into these failing pension schemes.\r\nOther petitioners have proposed State backed annuities might offset some of the damage caused by State sponsored QE. This proposal is for a wider (and urgent) debate about making alternatives to annuities available to retirees. This could be win-win for the right solution.\r\nFor example, leveraging pension pots into the house-building market as an investment with a return, liberates a stagnant financial resource into an area likely to trigger economic growth. This might be via buy-to-let, which many have embraced instead of personal pensions, or a stake in a housing trust with defined return. [This differs from proposals to leverage parental pension funds as guarantees on mortgages of offspring, as it generates pension income.]",
