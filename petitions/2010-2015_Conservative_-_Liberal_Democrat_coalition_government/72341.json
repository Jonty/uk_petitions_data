        "additional_details": "We need to establish a Cornish Assembly that will function similar to that of the London Assembly. We believe the people of Cornwall have the same democratic right to self-determination as the residents of Scotland and Wales. In 2001, over 50,000 individual declarations calling for a Cornish Assembly were presented to 10 Downing Street. But the Government, which had delivered devolution settlements to Scotland and Wales, ignored the declarations and refused to consider demands for greater powers for Cornwall. How come the London Assembly & Mayor of London role has been created yet Cornwall has been deprived of its own assembly and directly elected mayor. The Liberal Democrats have promised a 'Devolution Enabling Act' in their manifesto but why not introduce a Cornish Assembly while still in the coalition. ",
