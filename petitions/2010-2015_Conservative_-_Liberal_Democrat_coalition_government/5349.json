        "action": "Maintain Disabled Mobility Allowance for Care Home Residents",
        "additional_details": "The Government propose modernising the mobility component of Disabled Living Allowance. Under their proposals, residents of care homes (the most vulnerable in society) are having it removed completely. This will reduce their weekly income from around a maximum of \u00a370 down to \u00a320. A far greater cut than any other section of society would be prepared to accept. Please help to keep this essential allowance intact so care home residents can continue to interact with the outside world. The removal of this benefit would save the exchequer around \u00a3150 million a year. Far less than the cost so far of our intervention in Libya.",
