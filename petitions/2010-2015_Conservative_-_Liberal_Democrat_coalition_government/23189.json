        "additional_details": "To increase the minimum seat pitch on aircraft from 28 inches as measured by the airlines,  (26 inches as measured by BATA) to a minimum of 30 inches on short haul flights (flights within the EU/EEA) 31 inches on medium haul flights (flights of 4 to 6 hours) and 33 inches on all flights of over 6 hours.\r\n\r\nCurrently the charter airlines operate generally to the absolute minimum giving cramped uncomfortable unpleasant flying conditions, it also has an impact on safety where larger passengers cannot leave their seats quickly or unaided in the event of an emergency thus putting fellow passengers in danger.\r\nAs a regular fllyer (60 plus flights a year) i notice this more and more frequently.\r\nOver the years i have noticed a steady deterioration of passeger comfort particularly in the charter/low cost airlines, people have a right to travel in safety and comfort, please support this petition for a change in the basic minimum standards required by law to the airline regulations.",
