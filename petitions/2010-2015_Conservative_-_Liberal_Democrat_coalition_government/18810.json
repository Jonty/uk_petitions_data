        "additional_details": "I would like to see a debate in The House of Commons into the governments policy on illegal drugs. I think the government need to justify their refusal to legalise some narcotic substances that are already rife in our communities, yet go unregulated. It is a fact that illegal drugs exist and are used by millions in the U.K. This country is broke and the drug trade in a multi billion pound business that goes untaxed. I think we would all like the logic explained.",
