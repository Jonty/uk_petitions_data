So it really is about time that the taxpayer was alleviated of the cost of medical treatment for those people who need to be treated, as the result of a crime.  The person who committed the crime and, if necessary, his/her extended family need to be the ones to pay for the medical treatment.  THAT WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE DETERRENT AND COULD PUT A STOP TO VIOLENT CRIME IN THIS COUNTRY.",
