This event brings tourists from all over Essex and London and supports the local economy in massively increased revenue.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the few events many families of the surrounding areas enjoy year upon year and attend with a vigour of seeing our military and RNLI in public display.\r\n\r\nI hope to appeal that seeing a combination of military, private aircraft and the RNLI not only boosts confidence in the ability of these services but also brings much valued income to Southend-on-sea.",
