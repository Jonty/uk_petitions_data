Children living in urban areas are more likely to be obese than those living in towns and villages. Whilst obesity among children aged 4 & 5 has been sporadic during the last four years,  obesity among children aged 10 and 11 as continued to increase. Between the ages of 4 and 11 children are gaining weight at record levels. They are many factors contributing to this, one major factor being the decrease in outdoor play versus the increase in usage of electronic devices. It is time we reconnect our children with the outdoors.",
