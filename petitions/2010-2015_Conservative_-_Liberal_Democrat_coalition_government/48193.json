        "additional_details": "The Remembrancer is an ancient post answerable to the City that sits in the House of Commons. He has 6 lawyers, a budget of \u00a35.3 million a year and the right to see every draft law before it\u2019s passed. It is unacceptable that the City of London is given a special position in Parliament from which to lobby. We want the Remembrancer barred from the Chamber of the Commons, and their special rights removed.",
