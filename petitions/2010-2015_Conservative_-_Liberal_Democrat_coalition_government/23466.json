        "additional_details": "The high cost of stamp duty is crippling an already struggling housing market.  Property prices have soared in the last 10 years, yet the stamp duty rates have remained virtually unchanged.\r\n\r\nBuying a home is made unachievable for most, especially in cities like London, due to the need for large deposits and unfair stamp duty demands.\r\n\r\nThis has an overall effect on the economy.  If people are not moving home, then they don\u2019t buy new furniture, employ tradesmen to decorate and renovate etc.\r\n\r\nStamp duty MUST be reduced to kick start the housing market and economy.\r\n",
