The other 3 days of the working week will be spent 8 hours a day in a community work project. (Cleaning streets and beaches, working with council authorities to improve their community). This will then encourage the long term unemployed to work harder at finding full time employment, whilst gaining a sense of pride and belonging in their community.",
