        "additional_details": "At present, a landlord selling an investment property pays Capital Gains Tax on gain in value even if intending to roll the proceeds over into another property investment. This could deter some from making their own pension provision through property investment. In the light of the failure of previous government pension policy, a landlord should be permitted to roll the proceeds of sale  over into the purchase of another and perhaps more suitable property investment. In the event that all the funds are not rolled over, Capital Gains tax could be charged proportionately.  When the landlord's investment in property ceases, Capital Gains Tax could be paid on the total gain achieved from first investment to last. ",
