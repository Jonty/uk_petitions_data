I suggest the government uses the full force of the Army to stamp this out now. Rubber bullets and water canons should be used and when the suspects are within reach, the Police can make arrests with the backup of soldiers. If this does not happen, the government will show they have no idea how to sort this out. This is how we should Police this country in a time like this. Not a few bobbies on the street talking to the community.",
