        "additional_details": "With the ever increasing amount of household poverty due to bring home wage (following tax) having levelled out over past few year. Majority of the working population have seen a minimal or no rise in their wages they bring home. However the cost of living has increaesed. Fuel prices continue to rise and this has cause the cost of transporting food and goods to supermarket, thus meaning household food bill to rise as these cost are pasted onto the consumer.\r\n\r\nPeople are now stuggling to make ends meet to feed, clothe, and pay household domestic utility bill (Gas & Electricty, Water, Council Tax). Often leading to use of Credit Card, Payday loan etc. This I feel needs to be addresses.\r\n\r\nChild are also suffering due to household poverty, children are have to go without essential educational provission, under nourished/nutritients not due to deliberate abuse, but because the average household can't make financial provisions meet all the bills.",
