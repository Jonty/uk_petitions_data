        "additional_details": "NHS staff have only received a 1% cost of living pay increase over the past three years. During this time they have endured the financial impact of high inflation, at times over 5%, and in real terms much higher. Their take home pay has also been reduced due to pension contribution increases resulting in an actual pay cut irrespective of inflation. NHS staff are facing the most challenging working conditions in recent times and are frequently forced to work many unpaid hours due to the weight of bureaucracy caused by a quantity, not quality, targets culture. The Department of Health\u2019s proposal to enforce another year of pay freeze is unacceptable, unfair and unjust. I call on the DoH to reinstate the 1% pay increase due to NHS staff. ",
