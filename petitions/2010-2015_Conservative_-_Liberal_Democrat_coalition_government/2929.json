        "additional_details": "In 2004 the department of health raised the age for cervical smears up to 25, this was reviewed again in 2009 and the board came to the same decision. Since 2004 the mortality rate of women between 25 and 30 with cervical cancer has risen and many young women under 25 have also died without ever being tested. Even if they are lucky enough to get a smear the chances are the labs will throw them in the bin without even testing them! Its time now to take action and protect our young girls as they are being discriminated against due to their age. So please show your support and sign our petition. Thank you",
