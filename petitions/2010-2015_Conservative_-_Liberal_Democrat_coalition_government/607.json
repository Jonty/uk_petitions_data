        "additional_details": "Existence of state projects and programs supporting religions means discrimination of non-religious population.\r\n\r\nAlso, it means delegating authority to unelected religious leaders at home, as well as de-facto to foreign religious establishments, as many religious organizations have links to centres abroad.\r\n\r\nAmong citizen, religious divisions create crisis of loyalty undermining law-enforcement, police, and national defence forces, and generate social tension.\r\n\r\nFor the national educational system, the following steps are proposed:\r\n\r\n1) Cancel access to public funds for religious institutions such as schools, universities, educational charities, and alike\r\n\r\n2) Ban transfer of money from foreign sponsors to religious organizations\r\n\r\n3) Close existing theological/clerical departments and religious centres in publicly funded universities\r\n\r\n4) Close corresponding departments and broadcasts in Government-sponsored media (BBC)\r\n\r\nReligion must remain private matter of citizens.",
