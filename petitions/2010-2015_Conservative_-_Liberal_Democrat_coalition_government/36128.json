He defended his kingdom on numerous occasions against invasion when he was outnumbered and the only monarch to accomplish this in his time. He founded the English navy,established a code of laws,reformed coinage,translated books from Latin to Anglo-Saxon and his dedicated promotion of education. I call upon the treasury to ask the Bank of England to strongly consider placing \"the father of England\" on our \u00a35 notes.",
