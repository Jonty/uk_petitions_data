        "additional_details": "Many local authorities like North Kestevn District Council introduced local residents to start recycling their waste and have three dustbins, thus to try and stop landfill. And now want to cash in and make a \u00a325 a year charge to empty garden waste bins. And if your a new member of such a scheme the charges will be much greater around \u00a335. We call upon the government to stop this hidden council taxe charge - This will only cause more landfil with residents stopping recycling",
