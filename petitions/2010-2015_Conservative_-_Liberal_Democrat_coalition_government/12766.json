        "additional_details": "The UK has already signed up to a ban on cluster munitions, however that does not prevent them being transported via the UK to countries that still choose to use these horrific indiscriminate weapons.\r\n\r\nCluster can be used as mines and stay live for decades after they are laid, long after the troops have gone. Consequently the main casulty of whom is civilians, and in particular children.\r\n\r\nIn addition, and even more unforgiveably, major UK financial institutions, including many of the main high street banks, continue to invest and finance in the companys who produce these weapons. How any lender can do this and still maintain it has a commitment to corporate social responsibility is absurd.\r\n\r\nThe UK presents itself as force for democracy, liberal freedom and morality on the world stage, with this in mind please support this petition and help stop these weapons from maiming more innocent people.",
