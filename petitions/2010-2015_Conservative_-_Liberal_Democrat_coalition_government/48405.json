        "additional_details": "The proposed Tax-free Childcare scheme is welcome as it will provide support to working parents to help them pay for registered childcare.\r\n\r\nUnder the new scheme, working parents will pay 80% of their childcare bill; the government will contribute the remaining 20% and this will apply to childcare costs of up to \u00a36,000.\r\n\r\nThe current average cost of childcare is circa \u00a37,500 per year*, therefore the \u00a36,000 capped limit is already out of date.\r\n\r\nIt will take over two years to implement the new scheme and by this time the gap between the \u00a36,000 capped amount and the average cost of childcare will have widened further.\r\n\r\nChildcare costs rise each year in line with staff costs. Therefore, in order to preserve the value of the Tax-free Childcare scheme, there should be a commitment from Government to review and increase the cap annually in line with the annual increases to minimum wage.\r\n\r\n*Figures derived from Laing & Buisson Children\u2019s Nurseries UK Market Report 2012",
