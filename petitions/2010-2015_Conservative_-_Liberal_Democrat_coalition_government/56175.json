Their excuse for this is to allow users to condemn the actions (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24608499).\r\nUsers as young as 13 years of age can see these videos with no filters in place.  The undersigned wish the UK Government to make a bold stance and challenge facebook about its policies, removing the allowance to upload this kind of footage.",
