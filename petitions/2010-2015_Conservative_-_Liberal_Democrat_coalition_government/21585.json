It is inequitable that public servants do not justify their claimed expenses as they are receiving public money and should be accountable.  As many countries have dubious standards, coupled with what happened with UK MPs expenses, how do we make the EU publish the expenses for the public to view and question?\r\nThe only real item that will make the EU take notice is to STOP making the payments.  . They should be given 3 months to publish and then Government  should stop making the payments.",
