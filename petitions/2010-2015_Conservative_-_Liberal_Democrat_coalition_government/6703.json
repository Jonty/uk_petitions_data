        "additional_details": "The Coalition government has drastically reduced Britain's defence capabilities, to save money.  It is the first duty of every government to ensure Britain's defences are adequate to meet all foreseeable circumstances.\r\nThis generation of politicians rarely have had 'real' jobs, let alone performed military service.\r\nThis Petition requires that all Members of Parliament must have served for a minimum of 3 years in the UK's reserve armed forces before being eligible to stand for election and must agree to remain in the reserves while serving in Westminster, Holyrood, Stormont or Cardiff.\r\nNo more unjust or illegal wars, no more threadbare defences and a much better understanding of the realities of life by those who govern!\r\n",
