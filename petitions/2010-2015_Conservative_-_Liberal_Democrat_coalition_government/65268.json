I have been paying them up to certain point when I felt like it is becoming too much and it is not safe to stop anywhere as I've been trader for 8 years. I found out that at least half of the tickets I got were issued by breaking 1 or more regulation(law). there are some handy website where you can study and save a lot.\r\nI win about 70% cases now, but it cost me time and effort which I'm not getting paid for.\r\n\r\nMy proposal would be for council to pay compensation for our spend time. example: I get ticket of \u00a355 and win appeal, council would have to pay up \u00a355 (or at least half of it) to me. In this case they would stop breaking regulation as it would cost them money to break them.\r\n\r\nThis has to stop now. Please join me\r\n",
