        "additional_details": "The recent issue of the extensive rise in energy prices, due to be implemented by the end of this calender year by an average of over 8% (among those who have raised prices), it has become clear that something must be done to protect the millions of consumers who will be disastrously put under economic strain.\r\nThe average gas price for a UK household has risen by a  consumer index of 272.4 (100 set in 1990) and by 200.7 for electricity, whilst water, has risen by just 138.1. What is the difference? The regulatory body.\r\n(Source: http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/statistics/energy_stats/prices/prices.aspx)\r\n\r\nOfwat has had a history of managing to control the increase of prices, whilst Ofgen has not. What needs to be done? It is time to reform Ofgen to grant the proper authority to keep these companies in check, and this starts with the government.   ",
