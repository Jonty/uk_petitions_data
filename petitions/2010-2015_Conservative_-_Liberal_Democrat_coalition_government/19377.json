Meanwhile, we have to live with dwindling fossil fuel reserves being used to create \u201cdirty\u201d power to meet increasing demand, with the inevitable price rises.\r\nThe solution is simple: like food, there is a minimum amount of fuel that everyone needs for survival.  I ask the government to set a basic quota of fuel for each household and the price of this fuel \u201callowance\u201d should be as low as possible. Any amount used above this basic limit can be charged at or above market rates.  So the biggest users will pay a surcharge for the extra amount they use (to heat up their swimming pools etc), which can be used to subsidise the low end consumers\u2019 essential needs (cooking, washing, and keeping warm).\r\nShould this government be sensible, caring, and shrewd enough to take this step today then it could prove to be a historic policy change with worldwide ramifications.",
