They also receive expenses to cover the costs of running an office, employing staff, having somewhere to live in London and in their constituency, and travelling between Parliament and their constituency.\r\n\r\nWhat is this \u00a366,396 for if they have free London accommodation, more free accommodation in their constituency, free transport to and from their constituency and free staff for their free office.\r\n\r\nNot only are we constantly reminded that our local MPs don't do their jobs properly in discussing the needs and concerns of the citizens from their constituency, they also seem to forget that they work for us.\r\n\r\nThis is to show that we have the right and the power to ultimately determine how much MPs are paid out of our money. They work for us and have no power to debate this decision.\r\n\r\nWe, the citizens and owners of this county the United Kingdom demand a 40% decrease on the salary of all Members of Parliament.",
