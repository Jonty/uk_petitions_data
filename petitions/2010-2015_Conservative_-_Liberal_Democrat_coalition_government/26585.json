        "additional_details": "With the advent of a knee-jerk reaction by the Prime Minister over his ordering of minimum pricing for alcohol he graphically demonstrates his inability properly to deal with the problems of a minority of individuals making a choice to undertake activity which damages them.  The response is ALWAYS to issue new rules and regulations which damage the majority of the population.  It has been said that sun-beds should be banned because 1 in 4 of users abuse them and end up giving themselves cancer.  The fact that 3 out of 4 users do so properly and do not end up with cancer is ignored.  The minority of miscreants ought to have action taken against them, NOT the majority.  Deny the 1 out of 4 who give themselves cancer access to free medical treatment; deny binge drinkers access to free medical treatment - stop asking taxpayers to fund the self destructive activities of these people they should NOT be visited upon the majority.",
