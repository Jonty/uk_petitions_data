        "additional_details": "Release Sgt Alexander Blackman and not give him a life sentence. It would be very appropriate for the government to step in. A few points has been left out and that was not mentioned:\r\n1) He has been on multiple tours of duty\r\n2) He killed the insurgent near the end of a tour during which 23 servicemen from 3 Commando Brigade died, while Taliban fighters hung the limbs of British troops from trees as sick 'trophies'.\r\n3)he was still mourning the death of his father Brian at the time of the incident, with the 73-year-old Parkinson's sufferer having died just a few days before his son was deployed to Afghanistan\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, please listen to the voices of the public, and be more lenient to Sgt Blackman\r\n",
