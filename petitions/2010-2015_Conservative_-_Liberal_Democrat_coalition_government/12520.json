Every man, woman or child living in this country, whether born here, or not should have their DNA available on a database.\r\n\r\nThis would help resolve crime and would be a deterrent to those committing crime, knowing their they are traceable.\r\n\r\nI'm sure that the civil liberty people would be up in arms, but they are greatly responsible for how parts of our community behave now and sure law abiding citizens or visitors, who have nothing to hide, would accept that we would all be safer knowing that the Police have a Database at their disposal.",
