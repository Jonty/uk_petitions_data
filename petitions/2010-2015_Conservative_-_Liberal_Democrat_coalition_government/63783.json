We feel that our local council is incompetent, and have wasted a vast amount of our money.\r\nIt has just cancelled a contract for an Incinerator project which will potentially cost local taxpayers \u00a335 million pounds, and which will mean more savage cuts in services for vulnerable people.\r\nWe want the opportunity to express our opinion in a local vote on the matter of the council's competency, and, if the council loses the vote ALL elected officials should stand down, and fresh elections held.
