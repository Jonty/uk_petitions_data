Eros centre, or Lauf Hauser style prostitution as seen in many , many, other clued up, modern cities, such as Frankfurt, Mannheim, Hanover, K\u00f6ln/Cologne ,etc.\r\n\r\nProstitution isn't going to go away. We believe that a modern, forward thinking, accepting society should realise this. Designate certain areas in cities that want this type of prostitution. Ensure all girl's are checked for STDs every two weeks and that taxes are paid. This extra tax will surely help the country in these times of austerity. Drug addicts should not be allowed to work in these facilities and should be helped. But girls who wish to do this job should be given somewhere safe and clean to ply the oldest trade in the world.
