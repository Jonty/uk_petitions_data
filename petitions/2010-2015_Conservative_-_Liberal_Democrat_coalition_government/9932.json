        "additional_details": "All long-term unemployed in our community should be given dignified productive work to earn the benefits given to them by the government. This would instil a feeling of self-worth and provide a workforce needed by the communities in which they live and small businesses who need casual workforce but cannot afford to consider employing staff due to cash flow. The person would have to work under the local authority and applications from community groups, charities, SME or the authority itself can tap into this workforce for three days a week allowing the person time off for medical need, seek work or interviews. This is outside the rules for minimum wages. People who use this workforce are required to provide testimonials and this can be used to show prospective employers the character and determination of the individual. In our communities we have many tasks that are pushed down the priority list due to other work demands or budgets.",
