I think she would understand that we cannot possibly celebrate her jubilee with a bank holiday, and instead need to ensure a constant rate of production within the workforce.\r\n\r\nI would like to see the government debating the worth of a day off to celebrate Her Majesty which will undoubtedly cause untold economic carnage.",
