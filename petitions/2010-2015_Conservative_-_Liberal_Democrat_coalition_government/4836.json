        "additional_details": "Terrance Dicks is a prolific author of a couple of hundreds of books for children and young adults. His novelisations of 'Doctor Who' stories in the 1970s and 80s were a mainstay of school and public libraries, and were responsible for getting thousands of young people into reading. As well as non-fiction he has written many reference works for young people.\r\n\r\nTerrance Dicks has done more than any other single person to increase the literacy of children and young adults in the UK, and we believe he should receive an honour in recognition of his years of sterling work.",
