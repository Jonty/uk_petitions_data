We should not be forced to stop smoking in our own property because anti-smoking campaigners want to control what we do.\r\n\r\nWe know the dangers of smoking but its OUR property and they are OUR children. It is down to the parent how to raise them, by all means make people aware of dangers but banning smoking in OUR cars will be in violation of our rights.\r\n\r\nLets stop this legislation going through before they ban us from smoking in our own homes too.\r\n\r\nIts our lives and we choose to live them that way. DO NOT let them tell us how we should raise our own children and how we should act within our own properties whether it be our houses or our cars.",
