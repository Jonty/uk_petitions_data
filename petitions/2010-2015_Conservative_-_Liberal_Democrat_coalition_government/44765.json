To leave a home of 20/30 or 40 years and be forced to give up most of your possessions in order to `fit` into a bungalow is traumatic and abuses the very principle of human rights! If they have an empty room, They should not be forced to move or have a huge amount slapped on their rent as punishment.  ",
