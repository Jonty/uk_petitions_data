The media plays a huge part in those with a predisposition to eating problems and low self esteem. It is estimated that 1.1 million people in the UK are affected by eating disorders with young people between the ages of 14-25 being at risk of these types of eating disorders. This is set to increase, let's stop this now once and for all, let\u2019s tell regulate the media responsible and eradicate such unhelpful images and bias information regarding extreme diet. Through regulation and following an ethical code of practice they can present models of a variety of body shapes and therefore be representative. By giving the reader accurate information about extreme diets and its affects they would also minimize physical and mental health problems. ",
