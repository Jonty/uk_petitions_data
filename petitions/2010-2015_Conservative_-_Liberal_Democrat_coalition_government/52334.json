        "additional_details": "I am dismayed at how over the years Gardeners World, a program that has been enjoyed by a widely diverse audience for decades, is being progressively downgraded and pushed out of the scheduling and now only lasts 1/2 hour. There is insufficient time to get through the topics that are current. It does not reflect that gardening is for all year not just spring/summer. Nowadays it  does not even run consistently - cancelled not even put back to a later time for Snooker, Wimbledon, Proms - all of interest- but please BBC give this great British pastime the air time it used to enjoy.\r\n\r\nPlease ask a Minister to raise this with the BBC\r\n",
