        "additional_details": "Currently a student attending UWE is considered a full-time student exempt from council tax while an Open University (OU) student is not. This is not fair to OU students who are working equally hard to improve their career chances. We want equality and recognition by being recognised as full-time students for council tax purposes when studying 90 to 120pts simultaneously (full-time).\r\n\r\nA current UWE student attending <20 hrs face-to-face lectures per week on a 120pt per year course is exempt. An OU student on an equivalent course studying 32 hrs per week does not get this exemption.\r\n\r\nMost \"ordinary\" students are single with no financial responsibilities and many live at home. Most OU students have children and partners who rely on them financially and have to reduce hours or cease employment altogether in order to study.",
