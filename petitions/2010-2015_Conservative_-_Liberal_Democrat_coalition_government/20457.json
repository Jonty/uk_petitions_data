        "additional_details": "We petition the Government to enact legislation to make it mandatory for landlords to install and maintain smoke alarms in all rented accommodation.\r\n\r\nUnder current legislation, HMOs (houses of multiple occupation) are required to have smoke alarms in all bedrooms and communal areas.  There is currently no requirement for private landlords to do so.\r\n\r\nThis requirement has been highlighted by deaths of the Jenkins brothers in East Sussex, whose lives could potentially have been saved if legislation required private landlords to correctly install and maintain smoke alarms.\r\n\r\n",
