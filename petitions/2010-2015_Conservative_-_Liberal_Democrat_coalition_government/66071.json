        "additional_details": "FOP is a physically and mentally debilitating disorder. It is where muscles, ligaments and tissues grow into bones and the people affected are left scared, depressed and frozen.\r\nDue to it's rarity, it is often misdiagnosed as cancer and  incorrect medication is given - which often worsens the bone growth.\r\nResearch is needed quickly and research into FOP could also help cure arthritis and many other military injuries.\r\nIt is extremely important that funding is assigned to the location and administration of a cure for FOP, before future generations are left as a healthy mind in a frozen body.\r\nDon't let more people be turned into human statues.
