My reason for this is that when West Ham United where originally chosen as the preferred owner they complained about Newham Council giving them a loan as part of their plan to rebuild the stadium for them to move in, What is the difference between the deal with the Mayor of London they appear to be getting and the deal West Ham had with Newham Council?",
