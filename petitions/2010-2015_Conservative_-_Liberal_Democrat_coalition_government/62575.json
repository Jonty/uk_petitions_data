Currently people with epilepsy, diabetes, any type of cancer and several other medical conditions are entitled to free prescriptions. I suffer from a life limiting heart condition and take warfarin daily but despite this being the most used anti coagulant in the uk is not available free. Please help my cause and sign this on line petition.",
