This leaves the UK extremely vulnerable to outside influence and political change elsewhere. Also consumers are increasingly being asked to contribute more in bills; this money goes towards infrastructure costs which should be born by the companies who reap enormous profits; add to this the huge incentives being offered from the taxpayers coffers and the whole situation is so absurd as to be untenable.\r\n\r\n ",
