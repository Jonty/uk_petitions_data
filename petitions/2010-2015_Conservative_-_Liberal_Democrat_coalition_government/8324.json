        "additional_details": "Under UK law, all farmed animals have to be stunned to render them unconscious before their throats are cut. However, a special legal exemption (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/731/contents/made#sdiv12) which applies ONLY to Halal and Kosher slaughter, means that animals slaughtered, \u201cby a religious method\u201d  for halal or kosher meat - are exempt. We believe that on animal cruelty grounds, that this exemption should be removed. This method has now been found illegal under the legislation but those in power refuse to change the law or press charges.This group is not racist, is not anti Muslim or anti Jewish. It is concerned over animal welfare in the UK. Pre-stunning of animals is not sufficient to render the animal fully unconscious until it is dead.",
