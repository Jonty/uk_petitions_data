        "additional_details": "\r\nThere should be discussion, held in conjunction with Romany Gypsy people of English, Scots or Welsh origin and Irish Travellers, to draft a more useful definition with regard to 'gypsy'status, for the purposes of planning law. The present definition puts Gypsy women in an unequal position as carers for their family, or left widowed or divorced. The present definition is not a fair or equal one under the Equality Act 2010.\r\n\r\nIn light of the drafting of the new National Planning Policy Framework and the new Planning Policy Statement, this is an ideal time to look at this issue, which is of great detriment to Gypsy women who care for their children as opposed to pursuing careers of travelling for work purposes. There should be protection under statute\r\n\r\nThe Petitioners request that the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, together with the Equalities Minister, discuss this matter urgently with, representatives of Romany Gypsies and Travellers.\r\n",
