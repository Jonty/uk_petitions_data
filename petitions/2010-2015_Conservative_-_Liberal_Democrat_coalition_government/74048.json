It is entirely unreasonable for the public to pay this premium only to have an inferior service delivered. Particularly when such a service is already available at a lower cost.\r\n\r\nWe petition the Government to impose a mandatory discount of no less than 50% on all train journeys which are, in whole or in part, completed by a bus replacement service instead of a train. This ban to be in effect even if the service is as a result of planned works.\r\n",
