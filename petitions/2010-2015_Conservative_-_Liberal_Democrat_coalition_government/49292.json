Why must Builders pay if they cannot sell because of Gov failure to fix the economy & mortgages.Government to Stop council Tax on New Build Homes. No taxation before sale of product.\r\nStop Stasi Councils taking over business & imposing deadlines so they can grab this out of control tax. They are also being assisted by the Courts to a NO DEFENCE stasi legal system. Yes unbelievable isn't it, no defence (I have it in writing) in a so called Democracy! How dare they preach to the rest of the world! This Tax is a mess because Magi's failure to impliment her poll Tax! This is what we get. Its now a free for all and must be debated in the house and got rid of or made Equal.Many more than builders are affected by this! Even Solicitors can't sell unless we build, plus everyone connected to manufacture, sale or transport of household goods will be affected. I & my employ are already out of work your next. Vote now to end this TAX.",
