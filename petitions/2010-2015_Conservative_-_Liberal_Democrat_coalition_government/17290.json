        "action": "Ban ALL Premium rate telephone numbers.",
        "additional_details": "The adoption of premium rate telephone numbers by organisation of all kinds within the UK is steadily increasing, with many either not publishing an alternative 01,02,03 number or effectively \"hiding\" them if they are available at all. As many of these companies also operate tedious automated answering systems, with menu driven responses, the overall cost to the caller is significantly increased.  Further, customer complaint lines often have the same premium rate numbers so the customer even has to pay to complain. This is not in the public interest. I propose that all 0845, 0870, 0871 etc.should be banned and that all companies should by law use standard rate telephone numbers.",
