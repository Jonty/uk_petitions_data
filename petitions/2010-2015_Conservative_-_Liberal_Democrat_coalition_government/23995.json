        "additional_details": "In this time of 24-hour news we have seen the never ending supply of financial stories that can either make a market rise or fall. The fact is that Financial Journalism has become embedded into our society and is not only having an effect on our domestic stock market; it\u2019s even having effect on national governments.\r\n\r\nA lot of the Financial Journalism is of a poor standard with many of the stories concentrating on the negative rather than giving a balanced point of view. You could even say that the Journalist in question are trying to make the stories more dramatic than they actually are, after all, this is becoming not news but entertainment! The problem with this type of reporting is that many ordinary savers are losing money, while the people in the know are making millions. I would therefore want to see an amendment to the Financial Services Marketing Act 2000 to include Financial Journalism in respects for Journalists to provide a balanced point of view to readers and watches.\r\n",
