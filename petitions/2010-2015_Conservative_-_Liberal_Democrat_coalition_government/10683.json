Stripping them of benefits and council houses will just lead to people being on the streets, breaking up families and more crime - all things that will cause more problems and costs to the government and the tax payer more money.\r\n\r\nIf these people want to fight, I say let them - rather than custodial sentences I say coscript them into the armed forces and put them on the front line. They can repay their debt to our country and society by defending it.",
