To convert 3 ex-cruise ships into high security prison ships which are then towed 10 miles into the North sea and anchored to the disused 'Brent Spar' ex-oil storgae facility.\r\nThe 2 ships could be leased and refurbished and each one offering 2000 - 5000 prison places.\r\nThey could be online within a year.\r\nThis idea is much better than building prisons on land. Planning permission is difficult and often takes years to go through - also very expensive to build. - people don't want a prison in their area.  Prison ships could take hardened and violent criminals - there are no mobile phone signals out there and only regulated use of communications would ensure that Prison is a major deterrent. Prisoners would be flown by helicopter - as would the staff to do duty.\r\nPrison ships are not a new concept and they were used in the Irish sea many decades ago.   It is time to revisit this method of creating a huge deterrent to commit crime.",
