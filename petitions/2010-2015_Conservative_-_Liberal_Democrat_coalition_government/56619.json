Zero hour contracts are being abused and offer no security in a time where economic growth is key.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to end zero hour contracts so that working people can be guaranteed an income to support themselves and their families to help rebuild the economy and reduce the reliance on Social Welfare. People need to be able to earn an income but zero hour contracts offer nothing to them.\r\n",
