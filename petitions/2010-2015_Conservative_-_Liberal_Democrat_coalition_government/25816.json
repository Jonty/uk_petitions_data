        "additional_details": "The time has come for the Scottish Parliament to have real economic powers.\r\nAfter years of centralisation we finally got the Scottish Parliament in 1999, this parliament only has powers to spend money but not to raise the money it spends.\r\nA parliament can only be truly accountable if it raises the money it requires itself.\r\nThe devolution of the crown estate in Scotland to the Scottish Parliament would ensure that revenues raised from offshore wind energy in Scotland go to Edinburgh instead of London, we have missed out on billions of pounds of our own money from oil revenues flowing into the UK Treasury and cannot afford to miss out on the benefits of the renewables revolution.\r\nWe call for the immediate devolution of the administration and revenues of the Crown Estate in Scotland!",
