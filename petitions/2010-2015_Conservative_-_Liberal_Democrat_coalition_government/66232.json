        "additional_details": "In a time of a 24-hour news cycle, both in print and online, privacy for children should be absolutely guaranteed and properly enforced. No one should have to battle powerful media organisations and their lawyers in the courts to protect their children's right to grow up out of the media spotlight.\r\n\r\nAs we approach a general election, parents are asking their politicians to act now to protect their children's privacy from the media. The media should only be able to publish photos of children with the permission of the children\u2019s parents or legal guardians. If the media does not have permission, the photos must be pixelated.\r\n\r\nPlease sign our petition and allow our children to enjoy their childhood.\r\n",
