        "additional_details": "Stop paying child benefit in Poland. The Polish Government should be taking care of the Polish children not Britain.  As a Disabled person suffering from fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis of the spine and continually fighting to get justice it is out of order that millions are being paid in Child Benefit in Poland when British people are in need.  The British Government should be taking care of the British people and not punishing us and disregarding us. I have paid tax for more than 40 years and I do not see why funds are being given to Poland. Each time I apply for DLA I am turned down as they enjoy making the disabled suffer by making us fill in unfairly questioned forms.  Poland is prospering whilst we are dying through your lack of responsibility and lack of moral conscience with regard to the disabled.",
