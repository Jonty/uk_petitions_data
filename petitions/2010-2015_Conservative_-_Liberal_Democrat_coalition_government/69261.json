        "additional_details": "On 18 September Scotland will hold a referendum on independence. The result will be counted in 32 Scottish regions and there will be large variations in support between these regions with areas such as the Borders and Shetland expected to be strongly against independence.\r\n\r\nIf there is a Yes vote it is vital that all regions which vote No are given their own individual referendum on whether to join the new Scottish state or remain in the UK. No region should be forced to leave the UK against the wishes of the people who are living there.\r\n\r\nIf there is a Yes vote then Scotland will remain in the UK until at least 2016. The UK government should make it a priority to organise and hold these self-determination referendums before the date of independence. Any region choosing to remain in the UK should then be entitled to opt out of the new independent state and remain a part of the UK with the same rights it currently enjoys.",
