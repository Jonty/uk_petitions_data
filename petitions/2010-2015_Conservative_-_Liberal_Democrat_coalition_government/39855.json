Many children as a result of this brutal bombing have been made permanently disabled.\r\n\r\nWhy international community and champions of human rights not raising their voice on this?\r\n\r\nAccording to UNs Convention on the Rights of the Child Article 6 Children have the right to live but American drones are snatching this basic right from innocent children of Pakistan.\r\n\r\nIf you love your children then raise voice to stop killing of innocent children in Pakistan.\r\n",
