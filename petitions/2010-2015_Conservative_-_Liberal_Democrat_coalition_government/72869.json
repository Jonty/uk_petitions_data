        "additional_details": "We need a platform for graduates of film, television, drama and creative writing to get their first break in the North of England. Unfortunately, BBC-type schemes only help a handful of artists, while the majority are ignored.\r\nThe 'catch 22' issue that new artists have to overcome is quite despairing and contributes to the country's unemployment and benefit figures. For example, agents need commissioned writers. New writers send their work out and hit a wall because producers want writers with agents. Many creatives find it extremely hard to get their first break and end up having to give up their dream careers.\r\nHelping new artists get on their feet means we can harness more ideas and skills. Help make our country more competitive in the ever-changing international movie industry.  Sign this petition to help fund a new venue somewhere in Yorkshire where creative graduates can come together and create projects for screen, which can count as their first professional commission.\r\n",
