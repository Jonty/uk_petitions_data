In contrast, the widely-recognised London Living Wage rate is \u00a38.80 an hour. As an example to the nation, the Royal Household (which employs 1,200 people in a variety of occupations) should become a Living Wage employer. Ministers, on behalf of the public, should urge palace officials to make this happen immediately.",
