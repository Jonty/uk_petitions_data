        "additional_details": "The Department for Culture Media and Sport gave birth to UK Sport and Sport England. These organisations now employ so many people, and control so much money they have the ability to set up \"grass roots\" initiatives with the sole intent of protecting their own jobs.\r\n\r\nRather than supporting sport and recreation, they squeeze out voluntary activity. They have produced so many mini quango's, they can claim consultation simply by talking to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the DCMS on voluntary sport is now so pervasive and self serving the entire department must be closed.",
