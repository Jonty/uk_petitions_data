        "additional_details": "Hastings Borough Council state in the Local Plan that Harrow Lane Playing Field is no longer used and is surplus to requirements and that there are other green space facilities in the area.  There are no other recreational facilities in this area despite there being over 1500 homes and the field is used constantly throughout the year by sports groups, dog walkers and families. To make use of another green space area would necessitate a 10 to 15 minute car journey which is at odds with  the Council's own environmental policy. Furthermore this is already a severely traffic congested area and when traffic from the Bexhill to Hastings Link Road diverts through Baldslow and past the playing field area this will only exacerbate the problem.  We want the government not to give its approval to this playing field being sold off by the Council for development and for this valuable green space to be retained as a playing field for the use of the local community.",
