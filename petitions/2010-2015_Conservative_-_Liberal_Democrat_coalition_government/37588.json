        "additional_details": "Arrunden Kennels & Cattery is being threatened with a noise abatement order due to complaints about noise from 2 tenants in newly built houses. The kennel has been there for 31 years and has had no complaints until these houses were built less than 10 metres away from them.\r\nIf the order is not complied with it could result in huge fines through the courts, which in turn could potentially lead to the business having to close due to bankruptcy. It is obvious the kennel is there and should be apparent to anyone choosing to live there that they will hear dogs barking.\r\nIf you think that the houses were built too close to the kennels and they should not be served with a noise abatement order then please sign the petition.",
