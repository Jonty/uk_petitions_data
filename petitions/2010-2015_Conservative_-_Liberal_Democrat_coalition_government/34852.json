        "additional_details": "The E-petition is in regards to the recent story about Mr David Cameron left his young defenceless daughter in the pub late April after enjoying what seems to be \u201ca few too many drinks\u201d. To have taken this young girl to a public house and then forget about her shows that David is not responsible to look after his children.\r\n\r\nThe law says that parents can be prosecuted if they leave a child unsupervised \u2018in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health\u2019. (https://www.gov.uk/law-on-leaving-your-child-home-alone)\r\n\r\n A public house with a licence to sell alcohol to the public is a dangerous place to leave a child unattended. \u201cLicensing Act 2003 states that children under 16 must be accompanied by an adult at all time\u201d\r\n(http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/17/contents/enacted)\r\n\r\nWe hear by ask you to enforce the law you was voted in to uphold, the law applies to everyone and not just those from different social backgrounds.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks\r\n",
