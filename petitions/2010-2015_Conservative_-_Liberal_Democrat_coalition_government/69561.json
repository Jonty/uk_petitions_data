The problem is if a man discovers he is not the father under csa rules he can only be refunded from the date he protested.\r\nThe rules need to change. Too many men are being informed that they cannot have refunds.\r\nI myself have had a claim against me for children that are not mine as my ex was pregnant when I met her. I have to prove I am not the father and am not entitled to a refund.",
