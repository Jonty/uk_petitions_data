Stop wasting our cash on things like the Olympics that the majority did not want. Stop wasting our money on Letting people get away with cheating the benefits system. Stop wasting our money on a legal system that protects the wrong people. Stop wasting our money on immigration (just look at Russia's policies on benefits).  There are many other things we should not be spending on so stop it now.",
