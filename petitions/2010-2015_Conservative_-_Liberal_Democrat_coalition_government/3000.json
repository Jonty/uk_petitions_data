        "additional_details": "There should not be one single rate of fuel duty that applies to every petrol station in every location in the UK. Fuel stations in cities should charge the most amount of fuel duty as the population there are less dependant on the use of cars and can use public transport for a large number of their journeys. Fuel stations located in rural and sparsely populated areas should pay less as there are few other viable options than to use a car. In the future all current and new stations should be given a percentage that they should charge under or above whatever the base rate is at the time.",
