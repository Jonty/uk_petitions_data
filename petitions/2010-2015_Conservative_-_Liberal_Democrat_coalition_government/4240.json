        "additional_details": "This petition requests a complete ban on all animal testing in the UK. Every year thousands of animals needlessly die in painful circumstances throughout the UK and it's time to stop this barbaric practice. I think many would be shocked that this still occurs frequently in the UK and that animals such as beagles are used in these tests. We are meant to be a nation of animal lovers, lets prove it and stop all unnecessary suffering to animals.",
