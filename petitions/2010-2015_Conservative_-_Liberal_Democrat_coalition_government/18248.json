        "action": "To censure the Government for abusing UN Resolution 1973 by pursuing regime change in Libya",
        "additional_details": "UN Resolution 1973 set out the protection of civilians and the establishment of a no-fly zone. It set out an arms embargo and affirmed the integrity and national unity of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. The United Kingdom Government both affirmed this resolution and abused it by pursuing regime change through military attacks, and, probably, by providing training, weapons, intelligence and military support to the rebels. This petition asks for full disclosure of this support and for a censure motion for not following UN international law.",
