Why should they get a vote and we don\u2019t?\r\n\r\nScotland's vote for independence simply put is the same as saying \u201cwe are a group of friends, but do we want to carry on being friends with this lot or should we form a new group of friends away from this lot?\u2019 Regardless of the outcome I find the whole vote slightly hurtful and what makes it worse is the fact the rest of the UK doesn\u2019t get a say, so in the interest of equality the rest of the UK should get a vote on whether we allow Scotland to stay in the UK with our result overriding a potential no vote for independence from the Scottish people.",
