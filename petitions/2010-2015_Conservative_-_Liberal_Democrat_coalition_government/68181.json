        "additional_details": "The RAF have now increased the tour of Duty for military staff from four months to six. Including tours of Faulklands and other areas which are not directly in conflict.\r\n\r\nThis means that not only are they paid poorly, they are now away from their wives, children and other family members for six months at a time. Usually in uncomfortable living conditions with very little contact with their families.\r\n\r\nPetition to reduce this to three/four months which it used to be. Make the six month tours voluntary as I know there are tons of single officers and staff who enjoy this time away whilst those with families and children on the way dont. Some dont even get to see their children being born and six months away is too long to be away from your child. Its also not good for the children.\r\n\r\nThere is no call for them to be away for half of their lives!!. They didnt sign up to this but have had this forced upon them. Give them a voice amd vote against this. ",
