        "additional_details": "The NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2005 & 2012, forbid a doctor\u2019s dispensary, in a controlled locality, from dispensing medication to patients when they live within 1.6km, as the crow flies, of their nearest pharmacy.This archaic rule dates back over 100 years as it was originally feared that doctors/patients might collude in order to obtain inappropriate medicines. Today it forces patients to use a pharmacy if they live within 1.6km of one rather than collect their medication from their doctor\u2019s dispensary as they walk out of the door after a consultation. Recent auditing by Primary Care Trusts has led to a tightening of the rule resulting in many patients being informed that their doctor\u2019s dispensaries can no longer provide their medicines.\r\nThe effect is to replace a fast effective and efficient service with a slower and less efficient one. We request the government amend the Regulations to bring the law into line with the wants and needs of patients of the 21st century. ",
