Filling the \"black hole\" in there scheme and not in other government run departments is unfair and greedy. MP\u2019s make contacts when in power to benefit their own businesses and very often after leaving office themselves by becoming sleeping board members or speaking at events.  After all, we have to work 40 years to receive half salary pension, MP's are entitled to full pension after only ONE term in office. It was reported recently that the average MP's pension was \u00a321000 per year. Give it back to the taxpayer its only pocket money to a millionaire (and greed).",
