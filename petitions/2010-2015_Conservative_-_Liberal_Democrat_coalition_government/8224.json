        "additional_details": "There are currently problems with youth unemployment and public disorder, mainly caused by the young unemployed.  There are also problems with shortage of personnel in the armed forces so young people unemployed for more than 9 months should undertake a period of time (minimum 12 months) in the armed forces.  This would not only help the country out at a time when we have army personnel deployed all over the world, it would also reduce the state benefits bill and teach people about discipline and respect.  It would also save the country a fortune in policing and in the court system and there would be less spent by local authorities clearing up the mess caused by disaffected youth.",
