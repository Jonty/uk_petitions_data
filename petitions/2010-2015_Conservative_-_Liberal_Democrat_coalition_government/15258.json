        "additional_details": "The law currently allows, but does not compel Local Authorities to provide toilets. The situation is worsening;  40% of Public Toilets have closed in the last decade.\r\n\r\nMany people lead restricted lives because they cannot rely on access to a Public Toilet in the places and at the times required. There are rarely sufficient toilets for women, resulting in lengthy queues; elderly and disabled people cannot always find accessible toilets; provision for babies and children is inadequate; many toilets shut at inconvenient times. Lack of toilets can lead to street fouling; a major public health issue. \"Community toilets\" (toilets in private business premises) do not meet everyone's needs.\r\n\r\nGood public toilet provision will enable everyone to participate fully in civic life and will attract visitors and boost local economies.\r\n\r\nWe want a law requiring Local Authorities to provide and maintain suitable, safe, clean and appropriately located Public Toilets with realistic opening hours.\r\n",
