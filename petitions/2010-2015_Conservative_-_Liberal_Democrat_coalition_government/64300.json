        "additional_details": "Bees are under pressure worldwide. Causes such as habitat destruction are well-established but other threats such as vulnerability to neonicotinoid pesticides are less so. What is not up for debate is the importance of these keystone species, which provide intangible benefits to human societies through their role as pollinators of various crops. Many of us also believe they have intrinsic value above and beyond the instrumental value placed on them by humans.\r\n\r\nWe call for the designation of all UK bee species as 'Protected Species' under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (WCA) 1981. This would afford them more robust protection and provide a legal framework for the punishment of individuals and corporations not adhering to the legislation. Bees are amongst the most vital of all known species in the various interconnected ecosystems that characterise our beautiful planet. Let's show that we understand their value and importance by enshrining their protection in law.",
