        "additional_details": "It has come to my intention that we have to stay in college/sixth form once our exams are done rather then go on holiday and start again in the new term. Many teenagers across the nation have worked impeccably hard and deserve a rest. They are old enough to travel and experience new things and six weeks is not long enough. Many teenagers need to exercise their relaxation due to many hard months of work rather than starting their A2's once exams are done. I would like you to make it legally binding that we finish sixth form/college once exams are done which will make teenagers be in your favor. ",
