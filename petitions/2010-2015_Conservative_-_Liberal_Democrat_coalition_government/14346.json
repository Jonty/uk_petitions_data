For example the shutting down of Hospitals, the closing of A & E Departments, the unavailable drugs due to cost, the car park charges, etc etc etc.\r\nOur forefathers worked hard and built us this great NHS , are we prepared to let it disappear? I believe if we the people who run this country stand up to those who we have put into these decision making jobs and let them know that enough is enough and that we deserve our health service back. Better hospitals, more drugs available, health before money, get rid of the fat cats , cleaner hospitals, no more cheap cleaning products used the list goes on. Lets see how many people care for the health of our nation.\r\n",
