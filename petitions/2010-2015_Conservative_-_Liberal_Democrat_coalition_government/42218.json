The current cuts to local authorities show a bias again areas which are northern, recognised as deprived, or Labour voting areas.\r\nThe cuts to the local authority of Newcastle upon Tyne will result in the closure of over 10 libraries, the city poor, numerous Sure Start centres and historic buildings, and the end of all arts funding in the city, resulting in the closure of numerous venues and projects.\r\nWe believe that cuts to local authorities should be carried out with equal cuts per capita to all UK regions.\r\n",
