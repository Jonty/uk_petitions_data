        "additional_details": "With an ever increasing aging population the National Health Service can only expect to see levels of elderly A and E admissions rise. Simply ask a paramedic what are the most common calls they receive and they will say 90% are due to the elderly falling. The cause of the majority of falls are caused by dehydration. This will not only lead to falls, broken bones, the inability to stand etc. but also hallucinations and at worst death. The initial signs are with changes to or out of the ordinary speech patterns. An awareness TV campaign would go a long way to show just what the effects are and how they can be prevented. ",
