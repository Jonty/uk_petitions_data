This is because the options available to them are limited and unrealistic: imprisonment, fine or unpaid community work.  Those options are often unworkable with single parents.  There are now more separated parents than ever; too many children are going without contact with a parent.  This inevitably causes long term damage to children.  Damaged children= damaged adults.  Damaged adults will cost money:  treatment for depression, alcoholism, drug abuse, etc.  When children want to see their other parent why not spend money on sending plain clothed officers to enforce the order, by reasoning or using force if necessary, to hand the children over.
