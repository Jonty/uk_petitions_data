Hester's package meanshe will be paid in three days what a soldier in Afghanistan, \"risking his life\", earned in a whole year.\r\n\r\nSince he joined in November 2008, the bank has cut 33,000 jobs.\r\n\r\nIn tghese times when people are feeling the pimch and losing jobs this cannot be ethically and morally right! Shame on him!",
