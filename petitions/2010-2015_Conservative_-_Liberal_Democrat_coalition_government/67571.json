Security forces killed thousands in \"the worst mass unlawful killings in Egypt's modern history\" (Human Rights Watch).\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call on the UK government to:\r\n1) Stop exports of arms or other material that can be used in repression, torture & killing of civilians.\r\n2) Ensure bi-lateral economic aid & investment are conditional on a return to true inclusive democracy & respect of human rights.\r\n3) Apply diplomatic & economic pressure on Egyptian authorities to:\r\n - Release thousands of illegally arrested political prisoners & stop state torture.\r\n-  Repeal mass death sentences against political opponents in grossly unfair trials.\r\n4) Support the opening of an international inquiry into massacres of civilians & try the perpetrators in front of international courts.",
