        "additional_details": "This e-petition highlights the discrimination faced by Self Employed people wishing to adopt children.\r\nAs an `employee' it has been recognised that there is an entitlement to Statutory Adoption Pay, as there is for Statutory Maternity Pay. For Self Employed people there is Maternity Allowance. Therefore it should follow that a Self Employed person adopting should be entitled to Adoption Allowance \u2013 however this is not the case \u2013 there is NO allowance! With the current drive to address the shortage of adoptive parents the lack of financial support is staggering. This is particluarly the case when single adopters or one partner of adopters are required to take a minimum of 6 to12 months off work!\r\n\r\nI petition the Government to introduce an Adoption Allowance comparable with Maternity Allowance for Self Employed people. This cost would support adopters who are rehoming children in loving families which has a massive social benefit for all.",
