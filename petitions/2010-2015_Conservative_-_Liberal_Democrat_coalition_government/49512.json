        "additional_details": "Please stop goldfish being given as prizes at funfairs. These fish are often kept in confined conditions for days on end and once won, may not have a suitable home to go to. It's not right you see children swinging the goldfish about in their bags after they have been won, then what happens to them when they get home? While some may have an existing aquarium, most will not. While some will be cared for carefully for years, many will be placed in a small and inadequate bowl, flushed down the toilet or illegally introduced in to a local canal, pond, lake or river on the way home or a day or two after. As a non-native fish species covered under ILFA 2000, they can readily hybridise with Crucian Carp resulting in their decline. The release of goldfish is not only illegal, it can impact on the environment. Please put an end to this. A Goldfish in the form of a cuddly toy is more appropriate. Thank you.",
