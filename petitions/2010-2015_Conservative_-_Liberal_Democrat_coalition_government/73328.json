        "action": "Create an astronaut corps for the UK space agency",
        "additional_details": "This is for the creation of a small uk astronaut corps in order to allow greater freedom in UK space exploration and give british people a greater opportunity to see people from their own country achieving the great thing that is space travel.\r\n\r\nWhile their is the European astronaut corps it has only one british astronaut and he is the first British astronaut they have had. And I very much believe that a small british astronaut corps could encourage greater development within the UK space industry and inspire many people to the fields of science and engineering.\r\n\r\nAs to what these astronauts should do. Well if we donated funds to iss  we could send astronauts up there on missions. Also when it comes to funding I would point out that the candian space agency which has similar funds to the uksa has a small astronaut corps and contributes to iss so it is very possible.",
