This means any students who take more than 1 of the following: Fine Art, Textiles, Photography, 3D... will only be able to be entered for 1 qualification and render the other course useless. Some students thrive through the Arts, especially if not academically inclined.\r\n\r\nThis should be withdrawn and student's freedom to choose their subjects to study should be reinstated.",
