It should be strictly based long term performance and service provided.\r\n2) Bank's abuse of power. Closing accounts, denying accounts, pressurising customers to buy wrong products... Their preying mentality, specially affecting in-debt. Financial ombudsman is a toothless body. They have no powers to punish banks for persistent and repetitive bad behaviour.\r\n3) Comprehensive look on all the charges levied by banks. All charges be delcared as illegal. Charges should be approved by an independent body consisting of Consumer Focus Groups and jury of Common people.\r\n4) Full transparency in all transactions. Libor rate is just one example.\r\n5) Uncover the full rot in the system by a enquiry and a criminal investigation.\r\n6) Introduce competition by offering more products and offering current accounts from an organisation similar to NS&I.",
