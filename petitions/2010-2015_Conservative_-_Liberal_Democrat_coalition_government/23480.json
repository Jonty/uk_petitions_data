There will be more choice at London 2012 than at any previous Games or major UK sporting event.\r\n\r\nAdvertising is just one aspect in determining people\u2019s choice of food and can play a positive role in promoting healthier choices.  The Government\u2019s aim is therefore to create a framework which allows people to make the changes that will really make a difference to their lives, by helping them to take better decisions so that they can enjoy greater health and well-being though life."
