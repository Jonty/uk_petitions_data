        "additional_details": "We are sick of seeing any kind of unregulated flags hanging in tatters on our streets. This is a call the remove ALL flags off the lampposts in Northern Ireland. They symbolise territory and sectarianism which we are all sick of in this country. It is time to deal with this issue so we can move forward. The only way a flag should fly on a lamppost is if it designated by the local government for an allotted time period. They are left to blow in tatters and soiled. Public land is public land and should made to appear friendly for all of the public. Hang the flag on your private property not in public spaces!",
