        "additional_details": "I believe as a parent of a young infant, that parent and toddler bays should be JUST for those with small children. If you are to park in a disabled parking spot, you are issues with a ticket, so why should this not be the case for parent and toddler bays? The whole idea of a parent and child bay, is that parents do not have to struggle all the way across the car park with shopping and an infant, hence the reason why they are located so close to the store/destination, so what gives just pure lazy people the right to park there and then those with a child have to park miles away! People who park in these bays without a child, should be issued with a penalty ticket! No car seat, no parking! ",
