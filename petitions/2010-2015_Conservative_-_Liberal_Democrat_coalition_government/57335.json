        "additional_details": "A bill has been passed recently which is supposedly used to improve our language. This is banning certain Phrases and slang from various schools across the country. An example of this is the word \"Gonna\", it is understood and accepted that this slang cannot be used written on paper such as tests. However this is now being banned from being spoken. In some schools in the  UK a student can be punished by simply saying \"gonna\" (instead of going to), \"Shouda\" (as in should of) and pronouncing words with out the H (\"arry\" instead of Harry). We should not have to remove our accents. I (and many others) want the government to get rid of this rule and let us keep our accents.",
