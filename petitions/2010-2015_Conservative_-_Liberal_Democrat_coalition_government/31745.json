These families will be statistically degree educated and the very individuals our government is turning to resolve the country's economics.\r\n\r\nThis is an arbitary level aimed at voter appeasement for lower income voters than either a regional weighting or alignment with income taxation levels and consistency for hard working, young and growing families.\r\n\r\nAt its base level, this is cyncial politics and mis-representing the electorate.
