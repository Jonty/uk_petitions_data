        "additional_details": "i am setting up this petition up because many perants are sick of cars running red lights on traffic light crossing near schools. we teach our kids road safety yet when the green man comes on cars still drive through the red lights and don't care about the safety of the children. today my child and his friends crossed the road when the green man was there and was nearly hit by a car and this was not the first time. you have fines when cars go in the yellow box on a cross road and when they speed or park where they shouldnt so why cant we have fines when cars cross red lights and put our kids in danger. our kids lives matter more than where a car parks!",
