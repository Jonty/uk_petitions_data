Permits for subsequent vehicles should not be charged over \u00a350.\r\nVisitors passes should also not be charged over \u00a350 and should be for an unlimited time period.\r\nThose over 60 should not have to pay for visitors passes or the 1st household pass to enable family visits and visits for carers and medical staff.\r\nPasses should be free for those with mobility vehicles and those requiring daily carer visits. It is not right for those providing medical services or help to family etc to risk being fined for taking time with those they are visiting.",
