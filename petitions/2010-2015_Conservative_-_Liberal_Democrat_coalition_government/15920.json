We believe that this lifetime ban is discriminatory and perpetuates the myth that AIDS is a \u201cgay disease\u201d.\r\n\r\nIt's time to end this blanket ban on gay and bisexual men donating blood, and use selection criteria based on high-risk behaviour, and not on sexual orientation.\r\n\r\nThis highly dubious, legally-contestable stance by the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO), who will ultimately decide any change in the NBS\u2019 policy, should be given national debate in the House of Commons.
