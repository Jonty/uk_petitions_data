        "additional_details": "In October 2011, the French government passed a law that severely restricts the food choices of French school, kindergarten and college pupils, and there are reported plans to extend this law to other government-run institutions such as prisons, hospitals and elderly person's homes.\r\n\r\nReports claim that it will make being a vegan nearly impossible, and being a vegetarian on a daily basis very difficult, as packed lunches are reportedly also banned.\r\n\r\nThis is an abuse of human rights as it restricts free expression, and there is inadequate scientific basis for the move. The NHS agree that it is possible to raise a child healthily on a vegetarian or vegan diet, as long ad they receive the right nutrients.",
