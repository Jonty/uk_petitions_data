        "additional_details": "Id like the home office to offer Hendre Fourie, a former England rugby player, a visa to prevent his deportation.\r\n\r\nFourie is 33 years of age, has lived in the United Kingdom for 8 years and has represented England 8 times at the highest level. Due to a career ending injury he suffered, his club Sale Sharks have been forced to cancel his contract, thus making his visa invalid. He has a wife and a young son, who was born in England, and has continued to contribute to society ever since he emigrated to England, yet he has been let down by our immigration system.\r\n\r\nTo conclude id like the home office to re-consider their stance on this matter and offer Hendre a visa to stay in our country.
