        "additional_details": "It is time that we stopped confusing our offspring and consolidated all things considered \"Adult\" to the one \"entry level\" age i.e 18!! We currently have too many different levels of age to which they can do things i.e. 16 - smoke, sex and marry (with permission); 17 drive; 18 - vote, drink, adult movies/pornography (even though this is 2 years after they can legally have sex!!). Please let us finally see some common sense and make all the entry level \"Adult\" age groups conform as one i.e. 18 (which is also the age that they can now legally leave further education).",
