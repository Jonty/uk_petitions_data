        "additional_details": "Health impacts caused by low-frequency noise (infrasound) from wind turbines have been known to US and Australian researchers and the renewable energy industry for more than 25 years, yet many people who claim to suffer from \u2018Wind Turbine Syndrome\u2019 because wind turbines are placed to close to their houses are being ignored or even ridiculed.\r\n\r\n In light of this, it is imperative that the government immediately implements an independent survey into low-frequency noise and infrasound. Until this survey reports the government must immediately place an exclusion zone of at least 3 kilometres between wind turbines and any residence in the UK. Any turbine within this exclusion zone should immediately be switched off, and the structure removed within 90 days.\r\n\r\nThe survey should be undertaken by experts in low frequency sound who are totally independent of any power company or the renewable industry.",
