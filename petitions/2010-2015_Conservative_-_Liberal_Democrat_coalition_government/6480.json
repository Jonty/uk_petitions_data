        "additional_details": "Many banks around Europe and around the world have been bailed out by the Governments (the taxpayers). It is now time that banks worked for the people who have saved them. This petition is to call for the British Government to push for a worldwide agreement to tax banks around the world the same amount so that they would not be able to escape from new fines and taxes placed upon them from only 1 state. This needs to be a worldwide agreement in order to protect the people from ever having to suffer another recession at the hands of risky and highly profitable banks. Let us stand up to the banks now!",
