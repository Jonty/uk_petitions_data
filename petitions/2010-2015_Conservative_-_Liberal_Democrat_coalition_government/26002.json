        "additional_details": "We the undersigned want the Government to make the teaching of Breastfeeding part of the National Curriculum.\r\nThe benefits of Breastfeeding are numerous, extensively documented and proven by healthcare professionals and fully endorsed by the WHO.  It is a sad indictment of our culture that the natural method of feeding babies is still seen as unusual or niche and sometimes even as disgusting and perverse.  The best way to teach our future generations about the normality of Breastfeeding is to do exactly that - teach them.\r\nWe propose that Breastfeeding should be taught in schools alongside sex education, child development and any other healthcare subject.  This will help to normalise Breastfeeding and educate our future parents; thus improving the health of our future generations.",
