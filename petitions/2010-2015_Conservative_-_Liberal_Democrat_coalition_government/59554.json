What ever your and my belief is, let us not kill and tourture innocent civilians. What are our leaders doing?  Where is the dignity and honour? Syria, Bashar Al-Asad, isn't he, snatching not only women and children's rights but he is mutilating men and butchering humanity with his horrendous acts. What has become of our leaders? Is wealth and power really good? Greed has stabbed leaders, how much happiness has it brought to anyone? What is it with our material love? Use wealth and power properly. Aid them. Sign this e-petition to show support for those in Syria. If we can't be there, show them you care from wherever you are.",
