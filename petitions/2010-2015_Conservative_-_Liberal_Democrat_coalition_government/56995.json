        "additional_details": "The problem.\r\nThe less well off in our society are finding it difficult to pay for energy.\r\n\r\nThe proposal:\r\nScrap the standing charge and load this cost onto the price per unit for both electricity and gas. This will significantly help those on lower incomes.\r\nMake the initial units used cheeper for the first set of units used. This limit should be set annually for all suppliers and be for half of the average units used in the UK.\r\nThe initial units should be priced at 60% of the standard charge for units used over the threshold.\r\n\r\nThe expected results.\r\nPeople who do not use very much power will pay very little. The more power you use the more you pay. It would be expected that as people realise that they are paying more for the greater use of the power they will economise. . It you heat your swimming pool with gas then you will end up paying a lot for the privilege. This will also help address the carbon footprint.\r\nThis should also make it easier to compare suppliers.",
