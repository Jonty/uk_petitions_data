However, we think the Goverment should halt plans for a High Speed Rail link between London and the West Midlands and instead use the funds that are available to invest in our childrens future and rebuild those schools that lost out when the Building Schools for the Future programme was axed last year\r\n\r\nThe Goverment are currently considering spending a reported \u00a318 billions on a high speed rail link that will benefit  comparitively few people by saving a matter of minutes on the journey between London & Birmingham yet in comparison it has announced a much reduced allocation of \u00a32 billion for only the \"most in need schools\"\r\n\r\nWe believe that Children not Trains are our future and that our taxes should be spent on providing First Class School buildings for the many BEFORE First Class Rail carriages for the few",
