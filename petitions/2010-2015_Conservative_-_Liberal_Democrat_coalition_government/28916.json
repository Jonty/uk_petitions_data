It can't then happen that the pump \"clicks over\" by that extra penny (which you might not have in change, as happens so often,) and there is also no danger of rogues filling up and driving away without paying. They would be so much better than the current system, since it would still be possible to buy petrol using a card when the petrol station is not actually open or manned. Yet you don't see them in the UK. Shouldn't they be brought in? ",
