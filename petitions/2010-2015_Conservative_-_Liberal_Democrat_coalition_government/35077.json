It is very poor show if the only response you receive to a reference request these days is their dates of employment and last rate of pay.\r\n\r\nThe employee should be entitled to see that reference and have a right of appeal via ACAS.\r\n\r\nIn doing so:\r\nBusiness will suffer fewer losses and improve productivity\r\nEmployees will be aware that rogue behaviour will follow them from job to job\r\n\r\n",
