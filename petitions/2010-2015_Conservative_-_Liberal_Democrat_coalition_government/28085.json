However the UK was first created by agreement between the Scottish and English Parliaments so only the properly constituted National Parliaments of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would have the democratic legitimacy to negotiate any new constitutional arrangements.\r\nTherefore we call upon the United Kingdom's Government to hold a referendum in England, within the same timescale as that in Scotland. This referendum should ask the people of England the following questions:-\r\na) Do they want to have their own Parliament and Government with the same powers as exist in Scotland?\r\nb) Do they wish to remain part of a political Union with the people of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland?",
