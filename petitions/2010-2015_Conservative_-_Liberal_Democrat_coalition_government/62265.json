        "additional_details": "All flood damage repair and flood defence build work is subject to full rate VAT.\r\nThe VAT exemptions that apply for new build properties and home insulation upgrade work do not apply.\r\nInsurers claim that householders forced to carry out repairs to their water-ravaged properties due to last summers flooding paid \u00a3525million in VAT for the work. Because the Government contributed only \u00a3 86million to help affected areas, the Treasury netted \u00a3439million.\r\nMany flood victims are either not insured or chose not to claim in order to keep premiums affordable so the actual VAT return is much higher.\r\nThe estimates for VAT return due to this years Winter floods will be much higher\r\nThis petition is to allow households to reclaim their individual VAT spend for flood repairs and flood defence work when this work has been completed.\r\nFlood victims need help to recover and protect not for the Government to exploit this situation\r\n",
