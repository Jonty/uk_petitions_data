What we do in our own homes should not be monitored or filtered if we are not breaking any laws.\r\n\r\nFor example, the pornography filter and what a ridiculous idea it is. Pornography is not dangerous and/or disruptive. If schools had effective and open sexual education classes, people wouldn't feel the need to watch pornography.\r\n\r\nIf the government put as much money in to the education system as they did in to these RIDICULOUS filters and bans, stopped spending stupid money keeping us in a union we DO NOT WANT or NEED to be in, maybe people wouldn't turn to these alternatives!",
