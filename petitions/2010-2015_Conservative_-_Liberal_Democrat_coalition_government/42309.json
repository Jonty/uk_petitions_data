        "additional_details": "The British Government has made a proposal in June 2012 t reduce immigration into the UK via the family route. The proposal introduced a minimum income threshold for sponsoring a spouse or partner coming into the UK via the family route. If someone is not able earn enough money then they cannot legally be able to have their husband/wife joining them in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis policy is discriminating applicants who are unemployed and work with a low income. This is a discrimination matter concerning UK citizens on low income who are not able to bring their partners over and who are not willing to move abroad. An example, where I am not able to bring my husband over yet because of the gap between the minimum salary and not being paid during holidays. Which has had an major impact on the relationship.\r\n\r\n I call upon the government to end such proposal and consider the effect on relationship of family members and the income based discrimination.\r\n",
