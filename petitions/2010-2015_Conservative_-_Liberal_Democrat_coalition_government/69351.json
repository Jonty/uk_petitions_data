Working with international partners it should challenge much more robustly his use of power and illegitimacy as Russian leader.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of urgency It should build an international coalition to publicly critique his actions in Ukraine and more widely. It should talk specifically of his threat to world peace, and call on Russians to rise up against him.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, It should urge the free world to put aside economic interests and put in place plans to function as a global society without Russian resources, as a matter of urgency.",
