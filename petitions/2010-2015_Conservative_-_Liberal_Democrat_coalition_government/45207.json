This may seem daft and over the top, however i drive for a living, some cyclists ride in a ridiculous fashion. The day me or one of my colleagues hit one of these we loose our jobs, homes, and are sent to prison, all because a cyclist is riding dangerously, which we cannot control.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want the goverment to improve laws, administer harsher punishments, and enforce the laws.",
