        "additional_details": "I am currently a resident of Greenlea Close in Bebington. As many people are aware there is a footpath at the top of the road, it leads straight onto the field.\r\n\r\nOver the last year that I have lived there we have had youths running away from police and using the field and pathway to drink. They have kicked at the panels whilst walking past, even using the washing line as target practice and launching glass bottles over. Dog walkers have chucked over the fence their waste bags as there are no bins to deposit it when leaving the path.\r\n\r\nI am aware that many people use this pathway as a route to the field with their dogs or to use the Oval facilities, that is why this petition is not about closing the path completely just moving it to the bottom of the street where it is safer and a more built up area.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and hopefully with enough signatures we can finally get this resolved.
