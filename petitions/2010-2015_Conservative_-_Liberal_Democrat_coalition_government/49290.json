        "additional_details": "In 2010 there were 650 MP's elected with 649 taking seats. Each one earns approx \u00a365,738. With additional benefits and payed appearances they earn around \u00a377,738. This roughly translates to \u00a31595 a week. If each one took a cut of \u00a3385 a week or \u00a320,000 a year this would leave 13 million pounds.\r\n\r\nConsidering the cuts to the NHS, education, public services and tax rises I think the least our MP's could do is stand by the side of the country they serve and accept they need to accept cut's too. Most people would kill for a 50K job a year. So asking them to reduce their wages to 57K pa I think is a sensible request to make.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand the work these people put in for our country and while I can understand they might assume they deserve such a high pay check. I think that at this time we need them to stand by our sides and put there love for money aside and put there love for our country first. ",
