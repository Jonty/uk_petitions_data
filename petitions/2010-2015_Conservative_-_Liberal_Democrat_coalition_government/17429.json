        "additional_details": "I believe that the EMA should be reformed and reintroduced, because, as it stands, only a limited amount of people are now entitled to it. Only the absolute poorest are entitled to it and they have to attend a state school (they aren't allowed to receive it if they go to a public school, even if they can only attend due to a scholarship). I propose that the 50% of students who receive the lowest household income should be entitled to varying amounts of income support (depending on that student's household income) from the Government.",
