        "additional_details": "Petition for government to discuss measures for keeping schools open during snow or bad weather\r\nSchools should remain open during snow protecting our childrens education & lost income due to school closures.\r\nDuring snow, shops remain open, deliveries are made & transport runs, however schools close, sometimes even when snow is expected & not even arrived.\r\nSchools often cite bad approach roads or slippery pavements as reasons.  Parents will take responsibility for our children whilst out of school, in the same way that we do every day\r\nPerhaps teachers cannot get in?  How do teachers know when school is closed often before journeys are made & how do they cover for situations such as teacher illness during the year?  Perhaps use the same process?\r\nSchools take the easy option to close, causing lost education & income to parents, children & families\r\nThis needs to STOP.  Schools have a duty to provide education to our children, whatever the weather!",
