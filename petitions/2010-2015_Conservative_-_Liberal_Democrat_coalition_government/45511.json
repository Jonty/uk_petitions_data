        "additional_details": "This Government should remove the homophobic restriction that doesn't allow for gay or bisexual men to give blood, unless they've not had sexual contact with another man for a minimum of 12months.\r\n\r\nThis is so stereotypical, in 2011 the Health Protection Agency (HPA) estimated that 96,000 people were living with HIV in the UK.\r\n\r\nOf that estimate, 40,100 where Black African men, of whom are Heterosexual. This is shocking.\r\n\r\nAll blood donated is screened regardless of who the donor may be.\r\nSo a heterosexual male or female can give blood freely. But a homesexual or bisexual cannot, regardless of whether they've got HIV or not.\r\n\r\nWhen blood supplies are constantly below demand, surely it is only right to remove these restrictions and open up the barriers to equality.",
