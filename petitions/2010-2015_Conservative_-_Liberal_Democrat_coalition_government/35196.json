When a government becomes a threat to the rights of the people, it is the people's duty to reinstall a government which is not a paracite and one that will not harm the country it is elected to serve. With the coaltion not even elected and basic rights being stamped on along with them making the gap wider with the rich (them and their friends) getting richer at the expense of the public. It is time for the government to resign and the people to elect a government with a legitimate mandate and one that will not harm the country it serves!",
