        "additional_details": "This e-petition is in support of Early Day Motion 2382 which states:\r\nThat this House regrets that the Family Justice Review resulted in a Family Justice Panel that was not representative; notes that the response to the final report from groups campaigning for change has been almost uniformly negative; further notes that it will still cost grandparents between 5,000 and 10,000 to simply ask whether they are allowed to ask a judge if they can see their grandchildren; further notes that the remoteness from reality that plagues family court decisions will remain; and calls on the Government to establish a new panel, including representation from groups that are not financially dependent upon the family justice system, to properly review the system.",
