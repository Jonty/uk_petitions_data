        "additional_details": "I felt that it should only be fair that the government should lower the provisional license age to 16 as it is currently 17 for people who don't have a medical condition. I feel that people who don't have a medical condition are being deprived and are having to wait longer to start learning how to drive so people please sign this petition and help make the government change this law.",
