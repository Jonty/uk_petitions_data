Foreign Aid simply takes money from the poor people of a rich country and gives it to the rich people of a poor country.\r\n\r\nFor every \u00a31 spent on Foreign Aid, approx \u00a36 is voluntarily donated to overseas charities by UK residents.  This money actually goes directly to help the people who need it most......not given to foreign governments to spend how they please.\r\n\r\nBasically, stop spending the peoples money.\r\n\r\n",
