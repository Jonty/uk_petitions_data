        "additional_details": "There is not enough activities, places and environments for the youngsters of this country to fullfill and enjoy their time rather then hanging around precincts or not knowing what to do with their time after school and at weekends. In my day we had Youth Clubs. This may not be appropriate now but I think the Government should assign a person or team to firstly ask what the teenagers would like and then assess the cost of this implementing in Villages, towns and cities. I am happy to be that person on behalf of the Government. We need to do something for the youth of today including encouraging more sport activities. ",
