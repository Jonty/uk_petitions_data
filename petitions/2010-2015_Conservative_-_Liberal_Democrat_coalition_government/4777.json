This is all happening whilst troops are fighting wars in Afghanistan and borrowing helicopters from the Americans because we don't have enough.\r\n\r\nThe money should be spent in the UK improving the lives of the people. Increased money to cancer research and heart research can help thousands of people in the future and not only saves the life of the sufferer but saves the life of a child whose father may have otherwise died of cancer. We could give free childcare so parents can go back to work. We could improve schools. We could put more police on the beat.\r\n\r\nAlthough it's hard the simple fact is we can't save the world, no matter how much money we spend.",
