        "additional_details": "Thousands of unwanted Staffordshire Bull Terriers are destroyed unnecessarily each year. Many of these are loving pets, no longer wanted by their owners. When their time is up at the pound, they are often put to sleep simply because nobody has claimed them and rescues are at bursting point and cannot take them. There are charities such as Safe & Sound Pound Dogs which are tirelessly working to help these dogs where they can, however they cannot cope with the scale of the problem. Meanwhile more puppies are being bred, are later unwanted and end up at the pound, and the cycle continues. Many people do not realise that this is happening, as such establishments do not broadcast the fact that they are doing this. Those who want a Staffordshire bull terrier can rehome one from any shelter across the country. In the meantime let's stop breeding, which is purely for making money, and break the cycle.",
