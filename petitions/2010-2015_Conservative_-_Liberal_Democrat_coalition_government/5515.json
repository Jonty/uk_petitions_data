        "additional_details": "We call upon Parliament at the earliest opportunity to legislate to reorganise local government so we return to a set of smaller local authorities that represent areas with more of a local community identity rather than the distant type of large authorities we have. The UK has the largest units of local government in the EU aside from Ireland and these are generally remote, do not reflect actual community identity and are generally regarded as distant and out of touch. This is reflected in how so many have needed to create area offices since they were formed to manage such large areas. Going back to a system where large towns such as Keighley and Sutton Coldfield had their own local authorities would have the effect of bringing local government closer to those its serves and the UK more on par with the rest of the EU.",
