What we need is the repealling of the human rights act, and the drawing up of \"The Human Responsibilitys Act\", to ensure that the feckless and the shameless of society are encouraged to stop being a drain on the rest of us, with a sense of entitlement, but to behave as good neighbours,and useful members of society. The legislation should have meaningful sanctions for failing to contribute morally, to society. ",
