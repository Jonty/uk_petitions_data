To offer an option of \"No\" to full indepence is shortsighted as the \"seperatist\" party will simply use that as clear evidence of the UK Government interefering in Scottish interests, and risks many rebelling against such a measure.\r\n\r\nThe question as it should be asked (or some variant of);\r\n\r\nHow should Scotland proceed in the 21st century?\r\n\r\nWith two options;\r\n\r\n1. Devolution Max (or similar name)\r\n2. Full Independance ",
