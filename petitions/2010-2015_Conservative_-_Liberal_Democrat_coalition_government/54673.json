        "additional_details": "The UK is broke. \u00a352m in aid has already been promised to Syria by the PM to a non-EU country ruled by radicals with different views of which some threaten this very land. People in this Kingdom are already struggling without jobs or food because they cannot afford to pay for the roof over their head and the council tax imposed on them. This GREAT BRITAIN where we are 'all in this together' is not getting a say. Why don't you ask the people - the people that vote, the people of this Kingdom that are the spine of it and helped it through World Wars 1+2, the Falklands and the Gulf war? These are the people that count, not greedy bankers that nearly bankrupt this Kingdom, not corrupt MP's with fiddled expenses. We have no utilities, banks, transport or even blood banks left thanks to our caring government that sells anything that moves or doesn't (airwaves). Please sign. Enough is enough people, time to take a stand.",
