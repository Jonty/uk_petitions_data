        "additional_details": "British Winter Sports funding suffers in relation to the amount of money pumped into the Olympics and other sports and this is discriminatory.  I propose that this should be addressed by the Government and rectified accordingly as these sportsmen and women often have to sourse their own funding and our participation in these sports is virtually non existent.  Winter sports are becoming just as popular in this country, are well followed by the public and therefore funding should be incresed significantly",
