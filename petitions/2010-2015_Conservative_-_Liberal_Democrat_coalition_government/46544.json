        "additional_details": "When purchasing goods or services from UK businesses funds are put on hold (authorisation pending) immediately and the funds are reserved for the business to withdraw. However, when a transaction is cancelled or refunded it can take up to 7 days for this money to be refunded\r\n\r\nAt today's level of technology we are able to transfer money between banks within minutes but still this restriction is still in place when using a debit card.\r\nFor families on a limited income this can be devastating.\r\n\r\ne.g. A family buy their food online and the order is cancelled. This may be all of the funds they have available. This block can be the difference between feeding their family and not.\r\n\r\nWe are petitioning the government to legislate regarding transaction refunds and to have them force banks to refund transactions on the same day so that consumers around the UK are able to spend these held funds with another retailer.\r\n",
