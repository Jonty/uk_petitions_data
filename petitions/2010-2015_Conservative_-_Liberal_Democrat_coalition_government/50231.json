        "additional_details": "Altaf Hussain, the founder and leader of Mutahidda Qaumi Movement (MQM), and a resident of Edgeware - London, has been provided a safe haven by the British government for over two decades.\r\n\r\nOn May 12th 2013 he incited murder and terrorism on Live Television against peaceful protesters in Karachi.  Subsequently tens of thousands of calls were made by concerned members of the public to Scotland Yard to investigate Altaf Hussain.\r\n\r\nThis petition now asks the British Government to take the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  Place Mutahidda Qaumi Movement (MQM) on the proscribed list of terrorist organisations.\r\n\r\n2.  Table a resolution to have Mutahidda Qaumi Movement (MQM) listed as a terrorist organisation at the UN and it's leader Altaf Hussain put onto the UN list of terrorist individuals.\r\n\r\n3.  Revoke the citizenship of Altaf Hussain who is also a Pakistani citizen and deport him to Pakistan after all UK-based Police investigations, charges, and sentences have been served.\r\n",
