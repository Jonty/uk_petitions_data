        "additional_details": "Oral cancer is mainly caused by smoking and drinking; but there is another, more silent cause that is known as Human Papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is the most prolific sexually transmitted disease that no one has ever heard of.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that 80% of adults are thought to have had HPV at some point in their lives. In the UK, young girls at school are offered the Cervarix/Gardasil vaccines on the NHS which help prevent many strains of HPV, but boys are not. Consequently, as the taboo against oral sex is no longer applicable in modern life, men dating women or other men who have not had the vaccine are at serious risk of deadly strains of the HPV virus.\r\n\r\nOne of the Government\u2019s reasons behind females only being vaccinated is that their vaccination will help protect the males. This naivety precludes homosexuals and males that have relations with international visitors to the UK.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the HPV vaccine be freely available for everyone of all ages.\r\n",
