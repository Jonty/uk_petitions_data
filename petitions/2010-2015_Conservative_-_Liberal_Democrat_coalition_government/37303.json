        "additional_details": "To re evaluate prisoners rights who are serving life sentences in prison to include, money they make, the fact that they can smoke, play on electronic game systems, the amount and type of contact with the outside, and the bill tax payers pay for family members to visit them. Since they will never be free and have committed serious crimes against society why should they enjoy things that a lot of working people can not afford, why should the tax payer be liable for the cost of family visits. Also the call for basic human rights is always used when discussing prisoners rights, what about the basic human rights of their victims and their families.",
