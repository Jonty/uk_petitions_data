        "additional_details": "Benefit Fraud is costing our country an untold amount of money. A large area of fraud comes from the inadequate checks for the childcare element of tax credits.\r\nMany childminders are aware that payments are being made through their registration numbers but can do nothing about this, it is the 'claimants' responsibility to inform tax credit of change. I am sure the same will be happening with other childcare providers. People are using this registration number to gain more money than they are entitled by providing false hours/costs or even use the money to pay non registered Childminders (working illegally) or family/friends. This may be putting children at risk.\r\nWe propose that the system is amended allowing us to use a unique login to confirm children who attend our setting, hours and fees paid as well as if payment is actually being made to the carer to help reduce the number of false/inaccurate claims.
