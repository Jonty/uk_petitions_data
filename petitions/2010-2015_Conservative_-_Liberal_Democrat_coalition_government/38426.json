        "additional_details": "As the price of fuel continues to increase almost exponentionally, almost day by day, this petition proposes a cap on fuel duty.  It is proposed that the government set a maximum fuel price of \u00a31.60 per litre for the next three years.  This will be effective in urban and rural environments.  The \"tax take\" will be reduced accordingly to make sure the price can go no higher.  \u00a31.60 is \u00a37.28 per gallon, surely high enough in anyone's estimation.",
