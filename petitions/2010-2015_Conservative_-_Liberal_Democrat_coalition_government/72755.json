        "additional_details": "On 11 September 2014, Manchester Dogs Home was set on fire in an Arson Attack. More than 100 dogs were rescued, but sadly many lost their lives and died a very painful death. The home, which cares for more than 7,000 dogs every year, received an Amazing \u00a32m in donations from the public.\r\n\r\nA 15 year old and a 17 year old boy were arrested for the suspected Arson. These \"Minors\" murdered over 60 dogs in the attack.\r\n\r\nOn 04 December 2014, it was announced that \"No charges for boys arrested\"\r\n\r\nThis is a disgraceful and disgusting decision. Justice has NOT BEEN SERVED!\r\n\r\nWE WANT JUSTICE for the dogs that died in the Manchester Dogs Home Fire.\r\n\r\nThere should also be some law introduced were not only Adults get procecuted but also minors can get named and procecuted!\r\n\r\nThese minors turn into Adult criminals",
