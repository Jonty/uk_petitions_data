By large, football clubs are no longer regarded as to serve the community they are in and are purely for money making purposes. This is ruining a game loved by millions.\r\nKeeping our clubs not-for-profit organisations will ensure all profits are reinvested into the club and guarantee that success is shared by the community and not kept by wealthy individuals.",
