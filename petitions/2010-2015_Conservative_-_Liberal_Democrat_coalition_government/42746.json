        "additional_details": "This is a petition to remove city councillors from Belfast City Hall for Disturbing the Peace through use of language likely to incite violence.\r\n\r\nThe needless vote on removing the Union Flag from City Hall has resulted in a loyalist protest in Belfast.   Police have reported injuries sustained, and a spokesperson has acknowledged that, because of this needless and inflammatory vote, the city has had to deploy additional resources to deal with disorder.\r\n\r\nCouncillors are elected to represent the people, not push for their bigoted agenda. Job creation, foreign investment has been undermined by this senseless provocation of Belfast's citizens.\r\n\r\nWe call for the Home Secretary to dissolve the sitting Council and order another election.  Belfast needs a Council that can adequately promote stability and seek to successfully attract capital for infrastructure and foreign investment to create jobs \u2013 a task our current Council has shown itself incapable of doing.",
