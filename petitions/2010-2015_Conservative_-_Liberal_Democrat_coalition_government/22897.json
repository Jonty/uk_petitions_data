        "additional_details": "I wish to propose to implement Dog Owner Licencing, Compulsory Micro chipping and to get the Breeds Specific Legislations removed. Every owner to take a practical and written test. (Much like learning to drive). Some would try and avoid this but if random spot checks where done and anyone failing to produce the licence would have the dog seized. The owner given 48 hours to produce the licence to release the dog if not the dog is passed either for rehoming or destruction dependant on the dogs overall behaviour in this situation the owner should then be prosecuted. Compulsory to have every dog micro chipped numbers added to licence database that way roaming or out of control dog owners could be prosecuted.\r\nNo matter what breed of dog you have, it has the potential to harm and seriously injure someone or something.\r\nFor full details visit our Facebook \u2013 Dog Licencing Petition",
