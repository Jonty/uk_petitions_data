        "additional_details": "There has, recently, been yet another case brought to court where a student has accused a teacher of assault.  As with so many of these cases, the charges have been dismissed as the prosecution was without any merit whatsoever.  The Magistrate\u2019s deciding the case \u201cfully accepted\u201d the defendant\u2019s case as true.\r\n\r\nAs is usual for such a case, it was reported on in full by local press with the teacher\u2019s name, address and picture printed.  The teacher\u2019s name and address has also been printed in the national press\u2019 websites.  The student\u2019s name was not printed as per the court\u2019s order.\r\n\r\nWe believe that teachers or carers should receive complete anonymity until a case is proven against them.\r\n\r\nWe believe that perpetrators of these false accusations should be automatically subject to prosecution.\r\n\r\nWe believe that perpetrators of these false accusations should not be granted anonymity and should be subject to the same public reportage as the true victims currently are.\r\n",
