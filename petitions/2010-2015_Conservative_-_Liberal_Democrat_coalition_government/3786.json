This will assure a true interest in parcipitative democracy over enrichment, from a pool of people who can relate to most citizens and not just an elite.\r\nThis will also ensure that the poorest receive a decent minimum wage.\r\nObviously,  expenses necessary to job function will be additional\r\n",
