        "additional_details": "Altaf Hussain is a leader and proponent of violence, hatred and sectarianism. His frequent broadcasts from London inciting hatred in his home country of Pakistan is not only alarming, and in violation of British law, but it also makes a fool of Britain and sends out a message to those in Pakistan and beyond that this country is a safe-haven for people who incite religious, ethic and cultural hatred. If Britain wants to maintain its position in the world, and saver some shred of respect, then it should act on those individuals like Mr Altaf Hussain who incite hatred and violence.\r\n\r\nFor democracy's sake, and for the innocent victims of Karachi and the world, sign this petition.",
