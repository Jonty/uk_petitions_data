Cannabis has time and time again proven how useful a commodity it is; whether that is as a substance, fuel, clothing, health amelioration etc. The list is endless.\r\nLegalising Marijuana and the control of the substance in Britain would not only create an amazing array of jobs (builders, designers, growers, logistics, sellers...) but also decrease greatly the disgrace of alcohol and other drugs that are abused.\r\nIt is time to take the billions of pounds yearly, out of the hands of street dealers.\r\n",
