        "additional_details": "In this recession, to many are losing their jobs, yet millions are receiving benefit for doing nothing at all.  I feel that while benefits are essential for people to survive, the government should give benefits as a reward for doing work in the community, if already unemployed, or if about to be made redundant, the choice to remain in their existing job for a few hours a week, but be paid by benefits office. There is so much potential work that can be done around our country that is neglected due to government or local budget cuts etc.  There is no such thing as no work out there, trees can be cut back to see road signs, graffitti cleaned,working in the libraries so that they don't close down.  Every day you see something that could be cleaned up, tidied up or worked on to improve the area, why is it not being dealt with?  Most people on benefits want to go to work, and this should be made possible to them.  The government pay out benefits but the country gets something in return",
