        "additional_details": "There are over 350,000 empty homes in the uk, they are left abandoned not because they are useless but because the government is not giving the amount of funding needed to reburbish these homes. There are thousands in the waiting list for homes. for example a family with 7 children living in a damp 2 bedroom house whilst there is empty homes across the uk! people are homeless, how can this be? when theres 350,000 empties!. Stop funding olympic stadiums that will be demolished after 16 weeks and stop wasting valuable tax payers on portrait painting of MPs its irrelevant!.",
