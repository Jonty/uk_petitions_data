        "additional_details": "Currently the law states that babies born before 24 weeks alive a not viable for birth and death certificate, this has to change. I won the right to my son certificates for he was born at 18 weeks and was alive for 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nThey are currently a loop hole in the law that these babies do not come into a group. Babies born sleeping before 24 weeks are classed as miscarriages, babies after 24 weeks are classed as stillborn. If so a baby born alive before 24 weeks deserves a birth and death certificate, even if they only survive for a short while.\r\n\r\nAfter all these special babies are human, and deserve the right to be acknowledged, for they were here and lived to for no matter how short a time. They are a person to, no matter how small.\r\n",
