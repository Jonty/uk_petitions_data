        "additional_details": "We have reached a time in our evolution where we should know that smoking is bad for one's health and that it can even kill, so, I say, BAN SMOKING ALTOGETHER.  If Sainsburys or Tescos put on display on their shelves in the supermarkets stating that this \"chicken\" can seriously damage your health or that it can kill you, the Government would order its immediate withdrawal from the shelves.  Likewise, a car showroom stating on the windscreen of the car that this car can seriously damage and kill you.  Yet, the Government clearly states on the cigarette packets that smoking kills or can damage your health and still allows that product to be sold to the public.  All it, now, takes is for a cleaver firm of solicitors to prosecute the Government.",
