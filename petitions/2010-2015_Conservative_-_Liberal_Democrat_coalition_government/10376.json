This is not what government should be listening to.\r\n\r\nFurther, if Members of Parliament were doing their jobs and speaking to their constituents regularly, they would get a much better picture of what the public cares about.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we petition the government to abolish e-petitions and get MPs back out on the doorstep.",
