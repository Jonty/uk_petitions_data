There should be a policy that individuals sign when they have capacity to be given an injection by medical professionals, when they have disease such as dementia or in a coma etc Families have no right to appeal to the courts and medical professional will not be prosecuted. The paper is a legal document and should be given to a  solicitor. When a individual does not having capacity it should be given to the courts to proceed with the individuals wishes of ending their life.
