        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to save the historically important housing estate of Longlands in Bradford from being partially or wholly demolished and replaced with private housing, as is the current plan of social landlord Incommunities.\r\n\r\nLonglands is considered to be the second oldest surviving municipal housing estate in the UK, the oldest surviving also being in Bradford, and thus has enormous heritage value.  The surviving housing on the estate is of an entirely different architectural style to most council housing that was later developed and its importance is reflected in how it is part of a conservation area and there is an application by a third party for the estate to be listed.\r\n\r\nWe ask that the Government persuades Incommunities to drop its plans which are contrary to its legal duty as a social landlord, especially during a time when demand for social housing is outstripping availability, and to put pressure on Bradford Council to block any demolition work on the estate.",
