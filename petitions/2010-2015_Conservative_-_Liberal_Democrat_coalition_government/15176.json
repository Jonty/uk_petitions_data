        "additional_details": "People dislike paying council tax because they have to pay for it out of money they receive from work. This has led to the policy to freeze council tax. If all taxes were collected in the same way as council tax this would make people think about what they receive for their taxes and thus lead to a lowering of taxes overall. PAYE takes money off people before they receive it thus they hardly notice it. Similarly petrol is 133p per litre, no, it is not most of the price is tax. This policy would also encourage saving as people would have to save money to pay for their tax bill at the end of the year via an online form. Anyone who didn't pay in the allotted time should be jailed to stop tax avoidance. This method would allow Warren Buffet billionaires to over pay if they so wished via a donate to government part of the form.",
