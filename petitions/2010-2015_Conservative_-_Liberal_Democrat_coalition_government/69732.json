        "additional_details": "Many rural homes do not have excess to gas mains and reply on tanks to store LPG gas for heating cooking etc. The regulations have been relaxed to allow gas tank users to switch suppliers to keep the market competitive.\r\nHowever so have the guidelines on where tanks have to be positioned, these guidelines do not effect consumers who already have tanks but do if consumers wish to migrate to a new supplier. Many consumers can not comply with the new guidelines on tanks storage which locks them into the contract with their current supplier, the guidelines are therefore creating local  monopolies which could lead to unfair pricing and suppliers taking advantage of the knowledge their customers can not leave them. Change is needed to ensure consumers with existing tanks can switch suppliers without the need to comply with new position regulations.",
