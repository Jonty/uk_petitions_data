As on south west trains there is only room for three cycles and none at rush hour.\r\nHow are people supposed to cycle to work if they cannot use the trains at the times they go to work?\r\nDidly little folding bikes are expensive, not meant for any serious distance or terrain & are uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nI call for the government to make south west trains have bicycle only carriages on all their trains. Without levelling the cost of train tickets as they're already too expensive for the crowded, uncomfortable, out of date service the nation gets.",
