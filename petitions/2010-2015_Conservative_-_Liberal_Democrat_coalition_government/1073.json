        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom is not a Democracy; it is a Demi-Democracy. As a country we advocate the archaic ritual of birth right to select our head of state and head of the Church of England. Many think that our elected Parliament protects us from tyrannical dictatorial rule, this is not true. The Royal Prerogative is a set of powers which can be exercised without Parliamentary authority and against the will of the people. The only way that we can secure a truly Equal and Democratic society is to enact these 2 basic yet fundamental principals from the top down. Many people have great admiration for our monarchy, and it would be foolish to petition for its abolishment, however, it is fair to demand that whilst ever there is a monarchy in place it should be secular from Politics and Religion. By signing this petition you are declaring that when it comes to Equality and Democracy there can be no half measures. The Royal Prerogative must be abolished and our monarchy must be secular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
