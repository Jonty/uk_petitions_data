        "additional_details": "If everyone did this then pedestrians could get around during periods of heavy snowfall.  The pavements in my Borough were dangerous with compacted snow.  If everyone did this people could walk about safely and using public transport becomes a more viable option during the winter.  The Councils' focus is on the road network and they have no obligation to keep pathways clear at the moment.  This severely disadvantages the pedestrian who has to take their life in their hands to get to work/take the children to school.",
