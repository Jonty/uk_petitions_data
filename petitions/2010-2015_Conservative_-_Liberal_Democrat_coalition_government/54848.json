        "additional_details": "Last year Royal Mail made a profit of \u00a3403Million, yet, recently, the government have decided that the company will be floated on the stock exchange to raise capital for the modernisation of the business. What the government have not told us is that modernisation has been going on for about 3 years which has resulted in the massive profit for last year. Why would the government want to sell off what is now a very successful business. My feeling is that the shares for Royal Mail would be a very profitable to those that can afford them at the cost of 150,000 Royal Mail workers whose contracts will be reviewed after 3 years.",
