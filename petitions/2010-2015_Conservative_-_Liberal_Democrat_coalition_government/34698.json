        "additional_details": "For the Queen's jubilee, unemployed jobseekers were bussed into London and forced to work 14-hour shifts as security without being paid; but instead given the threat of losing their benefits if they didn't comply. They were denied any dignity and were forced to sleep under London Bridge, change in public without access to public toilets for 24 hours. The same thing is poised to happen for the Olympics.\r\n\r\nWe ask for an end to the \"workfare\" scheme which clearly is a form of modern-day politician labour. How can the cabinet justify the above? Or do the poor of society not deserve the dignity which a decent society should afford to all its members?\r\n\r\nWe ask that the government secures dignified working conditions for all it's employees - especially at the Olympics. This means reasonable pay and living conditions.",
