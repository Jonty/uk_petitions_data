        "additional_details": "We would like to request that the DfT, DVLA and JAUPT jointly carry out a full review of the current implementation of the Drivers CPC. It is requested that drivers from all backgrounds be consulted to obtain their opinion, concerns and issues on the implementation presently in place.\r\n\r\nTraining is beneficial and helps to promote better standards of driving and safety on the road. Many drivers consider that the implementation has many flaws which makes it unacceptable and will not benefit them or the public in general. This is demonstrated by the very slow take up on the training.\r\n\r\nWith a full review and consultation with drivers, changes can be implemented to make it more acceptable, thereby giving better results which will be more beneficial to all road users.\r\n\r\nA full review is needed before the country loses many long term, highly qualified, experienced, older and part time drivers who help the new drivers entering our profession with help and advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
