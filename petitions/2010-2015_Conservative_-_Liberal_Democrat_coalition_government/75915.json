        "additional_details": "Due to local council cut-backs the gates of Queens Park, and many others it has become apparent, are being left open. This has caused a huge increase in the number of youths entering the parks at night and driving cars dangerously, causing damage, drinking and smoking, hanging around in huge gangs, thus causing local and regular park goers to feel threatened, intimidated and distressed.\r\nQueens Park is a fantastic area with plenty of space and many facilities, providing the community with ample opportunities to enjoy the outdoors - playing, running, football, county cricket, cycling, walking etc etc  in, what was, a safe environment. I call for action to simply lock the gates each evening, as they were before the cut-backs,  to preserve Queens Park and every other park subject to the same cut-backs and prevent them from becoming an area avoided by parents and children, runners, walkers, and sports enthusiasts.\r\nThank you - the majority of parents and children in Great Britain!\r\n",
