        "additional_details": "There is a VAT exemption on children's clothing and shoes.  However, most children aged 12 and over these days end up in adult sizes of shoes and clothing, due to the increase in height and size of children over the last 50 years.  The VAT rules need amending.  My 9 year old nephew wears size 6 shoes and therefore VAT is payable on his footwear.  I would like the government to refund VAT on children's clothing and footwear on production of a birth certificate to show that the wearer is under 16 years old.",
