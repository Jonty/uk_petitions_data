Clarification is required regarding the protection of children from UV rays during school hours. Currently schools in England do not follow a standard policy and therefore there is no uniformity or clear directive across schools.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for a debate in the House of Commons to seek clarification on the responsibilities of the school that would establish a policy on the administration of any skin protection procedure for children during school hours.",
