        "additional_details": "The government insist children are not taken out of school. Hard pressed families struggle to afford a summer holiday because flights are so expensive in July and August. Much of the price is made up of tax. From mid July to first week in September, where there is at least one child travelling with up to two adults, air passenger duty is nil on that group of passengers. The number of children who would qualify for nil duty is unlimited (as a family can have many children) but accompanying adults capped at 2 ( to prevent abuse by non parents).",
