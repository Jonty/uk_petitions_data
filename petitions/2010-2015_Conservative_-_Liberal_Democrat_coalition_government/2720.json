These holidays should be what they are called and therefore stores should be closed on these days to restore family time that 7 day trading has robbed us of.\r\nThe retailers do not even pay a premium for staff that work them any more, and also force staff to work these days.\r\nIt is now the right time to allow families sone quality time together by enforcing closure on ALL public holidays.",
