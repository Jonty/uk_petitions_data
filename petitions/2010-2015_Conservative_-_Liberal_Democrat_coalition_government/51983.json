This petition is for Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Maria Miller to work alongside the BBC to find a decent representative for the United Kingdom at the 2014 contest. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport should be more involved in the final decision for who represents the United Kingdom whether it be a nation wide selection or an internal selection process. Each year the United Kingdom loses some of it's credibility of being know as a leading country of musical talent. It's time the governmental helped bring back some national pride.",
