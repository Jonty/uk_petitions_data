        "additional_details": "The restrictions that are placed on horse racing at the moment are simply not enough, they are extremley intelligent animals and do not need the constant caning to make them move. This petition is to get the treatment of horses before and after races improved. To drastcially restrict the cane or remove it entirley, to lower the fences they are made to jump which often cause injury which may result in death. This petition also wants to ensure if a horse breaks a leg, the killing of that animal is used as a very last resort. Please help ensure these magnificent animals get a voice.",
