How can csa make people homeless by saying they are more important than bills? Child benefit is \u00a380.20 per month per child so why should paying parents pay \u00a3500-\u00a3600 a month??\r\n\r\nSurely government says a person should live on \u00a370 a week CSA payments leave paying parents with less than that.\r\n\r\nThe receiving parents (mostly unemployed ) rent and bills paid for by the government why should they get extra living on more than a working paying parent.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and make these changes - many paying parents are close to sucide with such payments being too high?",
