        "additional_details": "I ask for further support from the Government and relative departments such as DEFRA to support the petition to take action towards sites and persons preying on those that trust in these people and fall subject to their lack of remorse and goal of financial gain regardless of the welfare of any animal involved.\r\n\r\nFurther action to combat such issues should be enforced with the governmental laws already legalised to prevent such suffering and criminal acts regardless of direct and indirect effect on an animal. For example the Pet Animals Act 1951, Animal Welfare Act 2006, The Breeding and Sale of Dogs (Welfare) Act 1999 and many more legislations should be re-evaluated and enforced to such sites and persons.",
