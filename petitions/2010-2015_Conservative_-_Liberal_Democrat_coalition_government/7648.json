A fund should be created for those who had their livelihood affected by shameless attacks their home or business. Claims should then be made and apportioned accordingly.\r\n\r\nOffenders found to be directly responsible for a specific attack that materially affects the livelihood of a member of the public should be held completely responsible for the payment of compensation, regardless of their benefit income. Parents of the younger offenders should be held responsible for any damages - with their benefit payments liable for relinquishment for compensation.\r\n",
