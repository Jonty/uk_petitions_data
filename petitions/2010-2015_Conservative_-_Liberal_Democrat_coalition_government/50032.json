America for example are very close with the UK and have shared a great united friendship for many years. Yet the requirements for an American citizen to stay and live in the UK are by far very hard and unjustified. I my self am with an American Lady who currently Lives in the US, for her to live here the requirements are very hard and demanding on both me and her. the Visa Options are very Limited in terms of Practical choice for us to use. for example the financial requirements state in our case I would need to earn \u00a319500 per year to show I can support her. the demand and pressure in finding a job that pays at least that is very difficult.
