Children who are not interested switch off, misbehave and don't see the point in learning. I petition the government to include training for children, from the age of 11, who would like to take this path, alongside basic life skills in numeracy and literacy. The training could include practical skills such as plumbing and bricklaying etc. Let's start a generation who are happy, successful and employable.",
