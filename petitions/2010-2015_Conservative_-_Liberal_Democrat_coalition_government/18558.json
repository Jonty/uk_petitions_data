And that 48 superior claimants, their heirs and successors, were thus removed from their right to succeed in 1714.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding: That the Act of Succession passed down by Charles II cannot be revoked by parliamentary interference. And the senior royal is thus represented in the person leading the House of Stuart; the Duke in Bavaria, Francis.\r\n\r\nCalls for: the full restoration of the House of Stuart to the Throne of the United Kingdom, and its dependences; in the person of Francis, Duke in Bavaria, his heirs and successors (as per the succession laid down by Charles II)",
