        "additional_details": "The current model used on the UK's rail network is clearly flawed. The west coast rail fiasco and now more above inflation price rises for tickets. The UK now has the most expensive rail system in Europe and one of the only to be fragmented into pointless franchises.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned propose that the rail network is once again brought under the control on one operating company. A Co-operative/mutual company, where all users and staff are stakeholders, will remain in the private sector and much like Network Rail, the track owners, can be state backed to reduce borrowing costs. Any profit made will reinvested back in to the railways and/or used to supplement travel for its stakeholders. This model will provide funds to increase capacity, upgrade infrastructure and potentially depoliticize the railways.\r\n\r\nUnder this model inefficiencies can be reduced and provide a greater value for money delivered to the British people.",
