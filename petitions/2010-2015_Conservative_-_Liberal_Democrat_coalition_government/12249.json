        "additional_details": "The e-petition \"Convicted London rioters should loose [sic] all benefits\" has, at the time of writing, 197,743 signatures. This is about one in every 250 adults.\r\n\r\nAs any petitions with 100,000 signatures could get debated in the House of Commons, this retrogressive measure that will do nothing to tackle any of the root issues behind the riots could soon be wasting our MPs' time. The bigger problem though is that some Conservative MPs may back the measure. An adviser to Iain Duncan Smith says IDS feels that such sanctions \"send a strong message\" - yes, a strong one, but a wrong one. They send a message that we live not in a compassionate society, but in one where the gravity of a punishment no longer matches the gravity of a crime, and where we are prepared to create an even more isolated underclass and exacerbate inequality.\r\n\r\nPlease help this petition get more signatures than \"Convicted London rioters should loose [sic] all benefits\".",
