Titan prisons do not work; they are dangerous and fail to rehabilitate prisoners directly risking the protection of the public.\r\n\r\nThe government should debate the closure decisions and realise that local community prisons work Titan prisons do not and realise the damage these closures have done to the local economy.\r\n\r\nplease support us.",
