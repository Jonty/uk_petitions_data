        "additional_details": "The Government are considering bringing in a charge of \u00a3250 for a claimant to appeal a DWP decision after a claimant has had their benefits affected following a Work Capability Assessment carried out by ATOS.  The Government are also thinking about bringing in a charge of \u00a3950 if a claimant wants to attend an appeals hearing.  These charges are totally absurd as claimants have either had their benefits cut or stopped altogether.  Where are claimants expected to obtain this amount of money?\r\n\r\nWe want the Government to abandon any thought of bringing these or any similar charges in to law.",
