        "additional_details": "I propose that the C3 domestic dwelling house use class  in planning law be changed to stop Care homes being opened by the back door by exploiting the section where unrelated adults can live as a family unit. Domestic dwelling houses should be just that. They should not be allowed to provide social care and accommodation in the C3 use class. All social care should be in the B2 use class automatically. This will stop the get rich quick property developers who have started using their unsold houses to milk the tax payer for social care of often very disturbed mentally ill service users and bringing them into communities where they pose a real risk to children and the elderly.",
