        "additional_details": "Education Minister Michael Gove has stated that he wanted to make the examination system harder because it is \"too easy\" on pupils.\r\n\r\nAs someone sitting A level exams, my opinion and the opinion of my friends is that Mr Gove is wrong, exams are hard for all pupils across the country.\r\n\r\nMr Gove wants to scrap the modular system in favour of one intense exam at the end of the course.\r\n\r\nIn response I propose three exam periods at the end of each school term, this will mean that pupils have less work to revise for, this should mean that that pupils are less stressed and should perform better in exams.\r\n\r\nCertain subjects would be better to remain in the current system, such as English and history. However if this system was applied to other subjects such as science and mathematics it would be beneficial to the pupils studying the courses as it aims to lessen the stress on pupils which can affect their final grades.",
