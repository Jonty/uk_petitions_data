Failing that the public should have the facility to register their number to ensure that they do not receive any nuisance/unsolicited calls from the UK or overseas.  There should be heavy fines for Companies infringing these rules and they should be followed through.  These calls are disruptive to everyday life and the public should not have to put up with it.",
