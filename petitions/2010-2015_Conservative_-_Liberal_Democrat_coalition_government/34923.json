        "additional_details": "Bicycle use is becoming a favoured mode of transport around the UK, not only because its free to do but helps to minimise your carbon footprint. Sadly on 27th of May 2012 Alex Fryer a dearly loved son, grandson and friend was killed almost instantly because of coming off his bicycle at speed. Surgeons confirmed that his life would have been saved if he was wearing a bicycle helmet. If its illegal to drive a motorcycle on a road with no helmet then why are we making exceptions for bicycles? With the ever growing amount of cyclists we need to decrease the amount of injury by increasing prevention. Please show your support for wanting to save lives and sign the petition to create a law that makes wearing a helmet compulsory.",
