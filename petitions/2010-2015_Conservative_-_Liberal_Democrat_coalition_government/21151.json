(basically a permanent salary) lower the handout to absolute minimum.\r\n\r\nIncrease for a set timeframe (3 months for example) a higher rate to those that are unfortunate enough to be unemployed.\r\n\r\nThis is one way to solve some of the issues being branded as 'free handouts' and also will give back some respect to those that may have worked for several years and find themselves in a difficult period of their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't expect this e-petition to gather many signatures and it is a pity the current Government do not use their own judgment on such matters.",
