        "additional_details": "I am thirteen years of age and am campaigning for a subject that is rather close to my heart. Recently I befriended a girl whom I found out is fluent in BSL due to the fact her best friend is deaf. I decided to learn some online, and my friends and I became very interested in the language, realising just how important it is. I may have only encountered a few deaf people throughout my travels, but they are humane and deserve to engage in conversation with others as freely as those who can hear.\r\nI also want to point out braille. We may not know it, but braille is on medicine packets, public doors, and more. So why not in schools?\r\nPlease, I only ask for you to take a moment of your time to sign this petition. These languages are interesting and a part of opening doors for the future.\r\nThank you.",
