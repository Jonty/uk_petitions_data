        "additional_details": "The Police Service is facing massive challenges over funding, the government has cut home office budgets which means the police are having to make some difficult decisions in our communities, which has inevitably affected crime levels, and has left our community safety compromised. Police crime commissioners in conjunction with the Police constables have no choice but to affect the neighbourhood policing teams, especially our police community support officers, who deliver an intelligence-led proactive problem solving approach to enable them to focus on, and tackle, specific local issues.\r\nOur government should immiediately pay 100% of our Police Community Support officers salaries, ringfence it so it cant be used for anything else, and to provide extra funding to increase the Police Community Support  officers visible and accessible presence on our streets, thereby providing reassurance to the public, in recognition of the Police Community Support Officers role in Community Safety.",
