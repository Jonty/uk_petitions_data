        "additional_details": "I lost my son at 33weeks due to problems, problems that weren't clearly known but visible (with heart rate monitoring proving his heart beat wasn't right) although a Doppler Test proved blood flow to my son was fine, his heart rate was still flat lining and decelerating instead of accelerating like it should have done. It clearly was nothing wrong with the blood flow but with his heart.Despite the evidence being there they flatly refused to deliver or keep me in hospital (I had been in for 3weeks prior to them finding this problem after finally listening to me that the pain I was in was no longer contraction pain) I was sent home to go back 2days later to be told my son had died.\r\nWhat I want is justice for my boy, and for no family to go through what mine is going through. I feel that if there is enough evidence as there was with me that the child/children should be delivered specially if its after that special deadline of 24weeks.",
