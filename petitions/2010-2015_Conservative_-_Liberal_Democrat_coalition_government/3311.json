        "additional_details": "With so much ill feeling being seen across the nation toward immigration numbers, I would like to suggest a petition for a similar system to those used in some other European nations,  whereby, Any potential permanent immigrant seeking entry into the UK, should have to work for a set period of time (3-6months) in order to qualify for Any state benefits under the welfare system.\r\nThis  I believe would sort out the genuine immigrants who wish to be a productive and contributing part of UK society and those who are giving a bad name to immigration as it stands at the moment.\r\nI also feel this would stop those people who harbor  ill feelings , being able to use immigration as an excuse for everything wrong in the UK, as they seem to see it as a banner to stand under.\r\n",
