        "additional_details": "In August 2011, the UK saw the worst civil unrest in recent memory.\r\n\r\nI keep hearing comments about the 20-somethings feeling like they don't feel part of their community; that there are no jobs; that they don't have anywhere to go or things to do and that they can't afford to buy the things they want. Fine! Let's give them something to do.\r\n\r\nWhy are we giving benefits to people who don't want to work when there is so much that can be done to improve our communities.\r\n\r\nI was born in Australia and came to this country with a work permit in 1998. In that same year Australia began its work for the dole scheme and has been running it successfully ever since.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see how it works visit:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.deewr.gov.au/Employment/JSA/EmploymentServices/WorkExperience/Pages/workForTheDole.aspx\r\n\r\nWhy don't we have something similar here?\r\n\r\nIf you think a 'work for the dole' scheme should be at least debated, please add your name to our petition\r\n",
