        "additional_details": "Did your water bill increase last year?  Have you ever wondered where that money goes?\r\n\r\nWater company shareholders take huge payouts, customers are forced to pay increased bills, taxpayers are asked to cover the cost of improvement works. We live on an Island, desalination should provide cheap water in today's age. But we still have droughts.\r\n\r\nThis is unacceptable for an industry which is fundamental to life itself and customers cannot choose their supplier. By signing you are calling for MPs to hold an inquiry into the profits made by the water industry. And if tax payers should be funding the expansion of an industry that we feel little if no benefit from financially.\r\n\r\nWith many companies owned by private equity funds there are no public meetings to hold executives to account. MPs questioned executives from many large corporations recently over their tax affairs following a public outcry. It's time water company executives were also called before MPs to answer to the public.",
