There is no excuse and justification for it and the punishment must be swift and severe.\r\n\r\nThe sheer criminal acts being carried out are putting innocent lives at risk yet heaven forbid if one of the perpetrators gets injured THIS IS NOT JUST.\r\n\r\nHow many hospital beds, nurses, baby units, medicines could that money buy?\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you agree that the police (and maybe the army) should have all options available to them to stop this WAR on decent honest innocent people.\r\n\r\nFor once in this country, let us protect the victims and let the perpetrators fall without sympathy, compassion or moral outrage.\r\n\r\nGovernment,act now and act swift, and do what is right for the decent majority, EXTREME policing is required.",
