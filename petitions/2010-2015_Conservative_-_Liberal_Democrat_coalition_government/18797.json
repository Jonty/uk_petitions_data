        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, petition the government to review the awarding of contracts to supply interpreting and translation (T&I) services to private companies and to set up its own T&I commissioning department. Maintaining such a department means better control over which materials are translated, both under own auspices and by local governments, reducing duplication and consequent waste of taxpayers' money. Such departments can also secure the most cost-effective T&I resources from cheaper independent providers, something not possible when it is mandatory for all government work to be placed with a single agency. Creating private monopolies also means that independent professionals are being forced to work for fees which do not reflect their skills and experience, and in some cases are required to work at rates effectively below the minimum wage, leading to some leaving a profession potentially vital to us all (e.g. non-English speaking witness in court).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
