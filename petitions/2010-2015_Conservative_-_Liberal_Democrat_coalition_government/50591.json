        "additional_details": "Following recent events it is now high time that the death penalty is restored for certain crimes and for those convicted of them. The crimes concerned are as follows: The murder of a child under 16,The murder of ANY police officer whether in uniform or not,The murder of ANY member of HM forces(Army,Navy etc). I,along with the vast majority of the country now think that,owing to advances in DNA collation,the margin for error is now so small as to be negligible and it will send the strongest deterent to those that wish to commit such crimes.
