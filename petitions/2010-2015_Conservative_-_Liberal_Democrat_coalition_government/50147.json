        "additional_details": "This petition is all about ensuring fairness to all motorists, who have been suffering at the pumps - perhaps illegally - for too long.  It is not enough for David Cameron to suggest prison sentences for the executives or heavy fines if found guilty.\r\n\r\nWe, Joe Public, are the victims and as such, we should demand justice and re-imbursement - similar to the PPI scandal - by way of enforcing a fixed period of at least 2 years in which fuel prices will be no higher than \u00a31 per litre.
