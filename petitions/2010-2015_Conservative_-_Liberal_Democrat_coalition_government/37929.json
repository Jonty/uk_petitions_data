Childcare costs enough as it is without us having to be charged full price when childcare places don\u2019t even have our children. The Government wants more new mums back to work!! How\u2019s this possible when families are paying extra for childcare they don\u2019t get and losing money by taking time off to care for the children themselves? Its time this was stopped and made illegal. I wouldn\u2019t pay for a taxi I haven\u2019t had a lift in, why should we pay for childcare we don\u2019t get? I want the Government to step in and make this an illegal act so families are only paying for the childcare they actually receive.",
