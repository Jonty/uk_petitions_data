        "additional_details": "It is clear that CGHQ are spying on many things without the agreement of parliament or indeed the people who vote for MPs. Regardless of the many views it is voiced as outside the law or dancing on the edge. This is clearly upsetting that this can happen like a police state without debate or approval and the it is more upsetting that senior politicians are not focusing this and standing in the background. Why ?\r\nWe need to have all spying processes approved at parliament by a committee or a body designed to balance security and private surveillance. Parliament needs to discuss this and arrange an approval or reject process for spying agencies that does a 360 degree coverage of the publics and countries interest",
