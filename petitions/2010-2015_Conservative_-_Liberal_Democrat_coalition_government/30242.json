Border Force being made separate from UKBA would be cosmetic, unless HMG actually ensure retrospective  (regardless of time that had elapsed) correction of blunders like the frequent unauthorised suspensions & downgrading of  border checks on: Eurostar passengers, migrants with student (or other visas) & passports, fingerprints, etc. Over 500,000 Eurostar passengers are not checked against the Home Office index of suspected terrorists & those with adverse immigration histories. The agency had been working through a backlog of 450,000 asylum seekers cases since 2006. Out of 403,000 processed claims so far, just 38,000 (9%) have left UK with 160,000 (40%) asylum seekers given amnesty to stay (with indefinite leave to remain in UK) & 74,500 untraceable. Another 129,000 claims have been recorded as \"errors\u201d.",
