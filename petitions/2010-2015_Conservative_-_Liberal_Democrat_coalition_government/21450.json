        "additional_details": "The Corporation of the City of London is in need of urgent reform. The office of Remembrancer in the commons needs to be abolished, businesses need to be banned from voting in ANY kind of election (no matter how many employees they have), the corporations finances need to be fully transparent (specifically City Cash), and the City of London police disbanded and placed under the authority of the Met.\r\n\r\nWe believe the behaviour of the corporation is wholly incompatible with a modern democratic society.",
