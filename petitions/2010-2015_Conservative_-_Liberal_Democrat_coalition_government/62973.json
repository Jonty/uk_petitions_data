Many simply breed for cash, yet at the same time rescues are begging for money to help take care of the unwanted animals from breeders who just don't care.  Allowing animals to reproduce and not taking responsibility for what happens to their progeny should be a thing of the dark ages.  Make pets traceable, where possible microchipped before being sold on, with both the breeder and owner jointly responsible for that animal for life.  ",
