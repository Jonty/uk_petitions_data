        "additional_details": "Malaria nets are an effective way of reducing mortality from malaria.  They are relatively cheap, and as this country has profited hugely from former colonies in Africa, we have a responsibility to share some of our wealth with those countries. This government could prevent housands of child and adult deaths by either funding the supply of mosquito nets, or better, funding their manufacture and distribution in sub-Saharan Africa, which would provide employment as well as reduce the prevalence of malaria.",
