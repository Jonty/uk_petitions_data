        "additional_details": "As a Teacher I see both sides of this argument - the teachers side and the parents side. And for once let teachers and Parents fully unite to make a difference. The prices of holidays during school holidays are a joke. The Government needs to do something to stop this. In some cases a family of 4 could have to pay 1000's of pounds more to travel at the end of August compared to the start of September. It needs to stop. It needs to be regulated. Parents are fined for taking their children out of school during term time. They wouldn't need too if you start to regulate this area of the travel industry.",
