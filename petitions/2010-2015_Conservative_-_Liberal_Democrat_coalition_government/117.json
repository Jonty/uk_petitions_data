We ask  Parliament to take a new look at and debate fully this absurd situation (many of these 43 forces are a law unto themselves - using inconsistent, archaic and outdated practices and procedures), consulting the appropriate bodies of expertise and experience where necessary - and making recommendations to The Executive, so that we can have a much more effective policing system operating in England & Wales.",
