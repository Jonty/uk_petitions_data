After the war up to 300.000 Tamils, most of whom civilians, were put in internment camps, where  thousands are still being held today.\r\nHuman Rights Watch and the medical NGO Freedom from Torture  have said that the United Kingdom should suspend deportations of ethnic Tamil asylum seekers to Sri Lanka because of documented cases of  abuses in Sri Lanka, also of people who have been deported there.\r\n",
