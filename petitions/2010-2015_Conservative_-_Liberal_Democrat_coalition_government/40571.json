        "additional_details": "In recent memory the UK has never had such a disastrous period of Government as it has since the last General Election.  The immaturity of the Prime Minister is evident on both the national and international stage and that immaturity is damaging UK PLC to such an extent that the UK will be severely marginalised in years to come.  This is compounded by horrendous decision making on domestic policy which is holding back economic recovery and damaging families along with numerous examples of extremely poor judgement relative to personal associations, attitude to females and the elderly and ministerial appointments.  This petition is for a general Election in 2013 to allow the people of the UK to show confidence or otherwise in the Prime Minister and his Government.",
