        "additional_details": "Certain students are disadvantaged by the current expectations of examinations. By having a mixture of vocational and academic tests, similar to those practiced in Europe, a true reflection of the young person's ability will be ensured. The current system only allows the advancement of academically able individuals and forgets the more practically minded students in our society, making them feel inferior to those who can pass an exam with ease.\r\n\r\nThis will benefit the current work employment situation. Companies claim that they need to employ migrants more frequently, due to practical skills many of them have because of the less academically focused education system they have experienced.\r\n\r\nSurely, Britain should nurture the qualities each individual is born with and cater for their needs and those of society.",
