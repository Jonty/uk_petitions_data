        "additional_details": "Vat is charged on all fuels, the poor, the elderly have to pay vat to keep some warmth in their homes through cold winters and so does everybody else, but if you want a domestic flight in this country you do not have to pay vat? Where is the justice in that? Vat has been increased to an unfair 20% on all but domestic fuel, I propose that Vat should be levied at the same rate as we all have to pay to propel our fossil fuelled vehicles. ",
