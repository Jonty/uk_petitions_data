        "additional_details": "I am an older person living in my own home with a miniscule mortgage taken out some time ago. However, my home has a leaking roof, no central heating, no kitchen and is in need of major repair to make it habitable.\r\nLike many older people who worked hard to buy their own home, I am property rich and cash poor.\r\nThe council has said that the work needs doing, but they have no grants available to do anything.\r\nFor all those in a similar position, I propose that the government releases funds in the form of a lien placed against the home. To be repaid when the home is sold or the person dies or moves, the lump sum, plus interest to be repaid at that time.\r\nThe scheme will be self financing after some years as the liens plus interest gets paid back.\r\nCanada already has such a scheme.\r\nIt would mean that people like myself would be able to live in warm comfortable homes and not fall ill or die in Winter, due to cold and damp.\r\nIt seems to be mainly rural homes that are in poor condition.",
