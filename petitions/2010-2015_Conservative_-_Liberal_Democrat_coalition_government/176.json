Plus, too many individuals are sent to prison for non-violent drug offences in this country. Prison numbers are already at record breaking levels.\r\n\r\nTaking control of the supply and demand, within the market, is the key to defeating drug cartels and organised crime as well.\r\n\r\nI call on government to start the process of repealing all drugs laws in the United Kingdom.",
