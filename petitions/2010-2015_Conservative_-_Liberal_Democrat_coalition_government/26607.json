It leads to social fragmentation, despondency, and hopelessness. The nation simply cannot accommodate the social consequences of an increasingly dire employment outlook. The Government must publish, with upmost urgency, a programme for full employment with accountable targets, and must provide ministerial  progress reports to Parliament at regular intervals.",
