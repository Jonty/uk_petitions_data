There should be categories although murder is murder those categories should allow the Courts to classify the murders as to intent. At the top of the tree 1st Degree Murder  (or conspiracy to commit murder) which on a guilty verdict would attract the death penalty. That 1st degree could be classified as going with the intent to commit murder. 2nd Degree murder may be commiting an act where there was an entirely foreseeable outcome that murder would result from it. 3rd Degree where the murder was the result but not ever the intention. There should be an automatic right of appeal for all those convicted of 1st Degree Murder.",
