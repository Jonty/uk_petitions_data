        "additional_details": "There is a huge housing shortage in this country which must be addressed if our children and their children are not going to end up trapped in high-rent properties or with mortgages which are beyond their means.\r\n\r\nIf more housing is not built then we will have a time-bomb of people living in poverty both in the near future and especially as pensioners, unable to afford rents in retirement.\r\n\r\nYoung people are leaving university or college with big debts which stop them being able to save for a deposit.\r\n\r\nAverage house prices have risen massively, pre-recession; but our salaries have stayed around the same over the last twenty years.\r\n\r\nThis prices most young people out of getting on the property ladder. The maths do not add up.\r\n\r\nMore housing is urgently needed. The Government must make this a top policy priority.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you can see that this is a financial time bomb for our nation in years to come.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
