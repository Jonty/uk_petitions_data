        "additional_details": "We have already had digital forced upon us.This meant that many people had to replace perfectly usable tvs in order to watch programmes. Another change to hd will mean that more, equipment, such as digi boxes, will become obsolete , creating more landfill.This, in a time of austerity, will mean that people on restricted budgets, including pensioners, will be forced to spend even more money. For many isolated people, the television is their only companion. Not only is this proposed move wasteful, it is bad for consumers and benefits only manufacturers.Keep sd ,protect the enviroment and consumers.",
