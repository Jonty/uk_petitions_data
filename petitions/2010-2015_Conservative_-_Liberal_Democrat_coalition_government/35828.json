        "additional_details": "Currently many people are plagued by what we term nuisance calls. The TPS will only prevent legit UK based companies from calling you.  What is needed is a law to prevent companies ( in any form) from withholding their phone number. To this end every Telco in the UK should be asked to block any call were the number in withheld, not available or not legit.   For companies that pass on their number each Telco must provide a free to the end user a mechanism for reporting an unwanted call, when 100 reports are made that number should be blocked.",
