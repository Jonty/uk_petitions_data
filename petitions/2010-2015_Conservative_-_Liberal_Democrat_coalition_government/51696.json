I have had to under go a radical hysterectomy and dissection of lymph nodes. At 25!! I think the age should be dropped to 20, so that the cells that are mutating and becoming cancer can be caught early enough. Keeping in line with Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The law was changed in 2003 and it needs to be changed back. Please help me make this happen!",
