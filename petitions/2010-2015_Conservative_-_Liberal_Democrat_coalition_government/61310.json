There is no confidence that justice has been given to an individual who fought for this country and his family.The  Secretary of State for Justice is responsible for improvements to the justice system to protect the public and increase confidence in the justice system while upholding people's civil liberties. If what happened to Christopher Alder after his death is not seen to be investigated then there will be no confidence in the justice system at all and this could happen to anyone.  We understand an investigation was carried out relating to the circumstances surrounding his death but we are calling for an investigation and appropriate policy changes into the appalling mismanagement of Christopher after his death.  Thank you",
