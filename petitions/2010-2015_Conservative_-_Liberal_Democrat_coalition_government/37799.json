Along with thousands of other, who willingly gave up our time, money, patience and effort, we are extremely grateful and priviledged to have been chosen to make history.\r\nWe fully appreciate what the Games Makers have done for these tremendous events, but also feel that although we were mere performers, we too, 'Made London 2012'.\r\nWe were the ones who officially helped kick off the Games.\r\nWe are aware of the event being held in September to commemorate the Volunteers. It would be an honour if you would allow us to attend, not just as supporting members of the public, but in costume, as Olympic Performers, being supported by the amazing British crowd.\r\nThese views are shared by hundreds, and to show you how many of us are truly passionate about this, we have named all the volunteers' who would like to be acknowledged as proud supporters of Team GB.",
