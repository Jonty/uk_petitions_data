We simply cannot afford to keep funding career benefit claimants who keep having children to get more money or a bigger council house while the hard working people of this country are being left high and dry by all the cuts that are happening to get this country back on track.\r\n\r\nI would like the Government to implicate some form of limit on how much these people can receive or even that should you get pregnant whilst on benefits, you will not receive any more money except Child Benefit.
