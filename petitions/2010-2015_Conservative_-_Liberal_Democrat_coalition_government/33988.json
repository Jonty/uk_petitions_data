        "additional_details": "\"In the first six days...2487 drivers were caught in Calder Road, with two cameras.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Willowbrae Road... two cameras...1709 drivers.\"\r\n\r\n\"In London Road, at Jock\u2019s Lodge, 397... with one camera.\"\r\n\r\nIn just less than a week. Mum and Dad both caught - total fine to pay \u00a3120\r\n\r\nMy point is that it is a ridiculous amount of money that people are needing to pay simply because they used the bus lane. For those who are wealthy it may not seem like a heavy fine to pay, but for those on a low income, state pension or only have one wage earner in the family, it is a lot.\r\n\r\nRidiculous amount of money to pay for a foolish reason. Changing lanes because you need to turn left/right ahead was no tension before. Now you got to look out for the cameras, check when the bus lane ends and wait in long traffic queues before it is safe to turn left/right -- to avoid from getting a \u00a360 fine.\r\n",
