        "additional_details": "The government should recognise that fathers are routinely treated as 2nd class citizens in so-called 'family' courts, where even in contested custody cases, only around 10% are won by fathers. Men should also be supported at government level, where there is a Minister for women, and none for men.  The same Minister (always a woman) is also responsible for equality, and that is a clear conflict of interest.\r\n\r\nThe rights of men need an equal footing to those of women, and not just politically-correct phraseology masking reality",
