        "additional_details": "If our politicians are serious about protecting whistleblowers they will change the law to make this possible.  The ONLY way to make people take notice us to tell them THEY will be legally liable for any costs arising out of their abuse and discrimination of their NHS colleagues who are trying to do the right thing.  Sadly we all know our politicians are NOT serious about this but the people MUST be given an opportunity through this petition, to indicate how THEY feel about picking up the tab every time a taxpayer funded employee commits a crime in the workplace.",
