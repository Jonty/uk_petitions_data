The current system is outdated and no longer fit for purpose in many ways.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s wrong?\r\n-Zero tax band vehicles cost the government to tax\r\n-Motorbikes are not treated fairly\r\n-Classic cars did not stop in 1973\r\n-Mileage has no influence on tax paid\r\n-Foreign vehicles pay no tax at all\r\n\r\nThe simple solution should be a couple of pence added to fuel duty to create the equivalent income that is currently generated. This uses existing collection methods so no additional infrastructure needed.\r\n\r\nWhy is this better?\r\n-It directly taxes mileage\r\n-It directly taxes less efficient cars more, and proportionally\r\n-It brings motorcycles inline\r\n-It enables low mileage modern classic cars to be kept on the road\r\n-All vehicles British or foreign will pay their fair share of tax\r\n-Cost savings in administration and computer systems\r\n\r\nThis just seems to be the most sensible and fairest solution to the problem.",
