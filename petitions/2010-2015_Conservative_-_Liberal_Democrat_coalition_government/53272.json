My GP consistently ignores me.\r\n\r\nThe excuse that GP's give is fear of \"addiction\", if you suffer from chronic pain then believe me addiction is the last thing on your mind. If I forget to take my anti-depressants I feel ill from withdrawal but my GP still dishes them out like smarties.\r\n\r\nGP's need to understand the psychological and physical effects from chronic pain, and how much it ruins lives. GP's must stop fobbing people off, it is our tax money that pays there wages!",
