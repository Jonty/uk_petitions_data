An advert was produced called 'think bike' to teach us to look out for motor cyclists whilst driving on our roads, I believe a similar advert should be shown in rural counties to inform people of how to approach horse and riders on the roads.\r\n\r\nMany drivers are ignorant/unsure as to when to slow down when approaching horse and riders many not realising that coming to a sudden stop and speeding away once only slightly passed can cause distress to our equine friends.\r\n\r\nI would like an advert to be produced to make a difference and to lower the number of incidents that occur each year.",
