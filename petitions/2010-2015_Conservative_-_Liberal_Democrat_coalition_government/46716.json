        "additional_details": "The undersigned calls on the Government to force PRS, PPL & MCPS to work together to create one music licence for the purpose of public broadcast. At present the law allows for the issue of at least two licences from two agencies for the same performance. This puts pressure on small businesses who are continually contacted until they pay up. It also stifles new Uk  talent when the licence fees requested prevent  a number of public places from showcasing musician's work.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
