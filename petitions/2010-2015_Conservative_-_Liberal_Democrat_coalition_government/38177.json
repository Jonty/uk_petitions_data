        "additional_details": "Khat is a stimulant drug with effects similar to amphetamine.Chewing it makes people feel more alert and talkative and suppresses the appetite, though users describe an ensuing calming effect when used over a few hours. Regular use may lead to insomnia (inability to sleep), anorexia and anxiety. In some cases it may make people feel more irritable and angry and possibly violent. Psychological dependence can result from regular use so that users feel depressed and low unless they keep taking it.\r\n\r\nKhat is illegal in Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland and many other countries, please support this petition to make it illegal in the UK. This drug is used a lot in some middle eastern countries and among other things does cause aggressiveness and should be banned, for the safety of our society.",
