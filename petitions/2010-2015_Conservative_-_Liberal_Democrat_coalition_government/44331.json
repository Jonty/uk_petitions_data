This is driving the housing shortage. If we build to accomodate them and they then leave, housing prices will crash and we will be left with ghost towns and a ruined countryside.\r\nIf they do not leave, in a couple of decades time, when the world population has increased hugely,and we cannot import so much food, we will not be able to feed them and our society will become violent and intolerant.\r\n\r\nThe government is proposing to sacrifice our farmland which we will need to provide food for future generations. We cannot rely on other countries to feed us, we cannot rely on them to sell us fuel.\r\n\r\nDO NOT CONCRETE OVER THE LAND YOUR FOOD GROWS ON FOR FAT-CAT PROFITS",
