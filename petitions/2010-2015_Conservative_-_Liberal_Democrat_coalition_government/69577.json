        "action": "Democratic deficit caused by the Scottish referendum",
        "additional_details": "The UK Government either by arrogance, accident or incompetence agreed to a referendum allowing only Scottish residents to determine the future composition of the UK, resulting in a massive democratic deficit for the rest of the UK. This situation will be exacerbated because there are no formal arrangements to manage the situation in the aftermath of the referendum. It is unacceptable for the Government to develop the Ts&Cs of the settlement especially with the vested interest of 59 Scottish MPs able to influence the decision of Westminster.\r\nIt is now time for the rest of the UK to have their say and we the undersigned want the UK Government in advance of the 2015 General Election to:-\r\n1) Establish an independent commission to develop the terms and conditions of the settlement between the rest of the UK and Scotland,\r\n2) Present any agreement, in a referendum, to the rest of the UK for approval/endorsement.\r\n\r\n",
