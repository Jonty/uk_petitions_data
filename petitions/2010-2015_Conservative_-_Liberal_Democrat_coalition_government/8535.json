        "additional_details": "Recent events have shown us that some young people in the UK have a sense of entitlement and no respect for authority. They appear ignorant of the hard work it takes to run a business and lack compassion for those in their own communities.\r\nAll children should be made to do service in their own communities during the school year, several times a year, every year!\r\nYoung children should gain a sense of pride early in their school career by creating community gardens and picking up litter from their own local areas. Older children should be placed in local shops, libraries,  sports centres, police stations, fire stations and hospitals in order to gain an understanding of how hard the majority of people work to earn their living.\r\nBy enforcing community service for all we can expose our children to good role models who work hard for their livelihoods and have a true sense of self worth.
