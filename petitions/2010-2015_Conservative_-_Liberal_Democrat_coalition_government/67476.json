They have a right to heard on Welborne.\r\n\r\nWelborne is a massive development on the edge of North  Fareham which will transform the Town  for ever. We demand our right to be part of a meaningful  consultation process so all the facts and opinions on the  Welborne development can be fully debated free from political interference . To date such a process is  merely  lip service to what the government calls localism.\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition if you believe the  Welborne development requires a much wider public debate.\r\n",
