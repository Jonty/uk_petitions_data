        "additional_details": "Since HM Government insists that all Public Sector pensions be linked to CPI rather that RPI, Would it not be fair if MP's pensions were also linked to CPI.  Not only do MP's benefit from the highest pensions in the public sector, but they are retaining the RPI ling that they are denying to others.  Let's have leadership by example rather than greed.",
