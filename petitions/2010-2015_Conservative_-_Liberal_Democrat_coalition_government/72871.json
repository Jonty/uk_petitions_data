        "action": "Stop Demolition Of Hertswood Academy in Borehamwood",
        "additional_details": "In Borehamwood, there are plans to demolish Hertswood Academy and make more houses and flats. Making more flats and houses will not only be a stress to already crippled infrastructure of Borehamwood, it will also lead to deterioration of the town and its life. Already the local surgeries are struggling to cope with the number of patients, there are constant traffic jams. These new developments will be the downfall of Borehamwood.\r\n\r\n\r\nAction proposed:\r\n\r\nThrough this petition I would like to propose that Government should intervene and stop this development from going forward. Instead retain Hertswood Academy as a school and develop it further as a school or a community centre. Department of Education needs to stop this and help retain the schools we have. If not stop it please atleast take a vote of local residents as to what they want rather than destroying the town altogether.",
