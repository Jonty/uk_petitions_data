Purely circumstance and timing of a ill judged and mismanaged policy. I strongly support the refund of all contributions to the graduate endowment by all payees as an urgent matter.\r\n\r\nFACT:It is estimated that around \u00a312.7 million has been paid back in cash from the three cohorts of graduates liable to pay the fee, with \u00a326.3 million being added to loans. Of this, \u00a326.3 million, only \u00a357,000 has been returned to the taxpayer.
