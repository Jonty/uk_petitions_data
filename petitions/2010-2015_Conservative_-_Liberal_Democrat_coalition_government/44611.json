        "action": "Commit that the UK will remain a member of the EU",
        "additional_details": "The proposition of this petition is that the Government should make it clear that the UK intends to remain a fully committed member of the EU.\r\nIt should be prepared to fight for the National interest, to reduce unnecessary legislation and the current levels of bureaurcracy and ensure budgetary control, but do so as a supportive member of the EU.\r\nEU member states are the UK's largest trading partners and as group have a significant political voice to challenge the influence of other world powers. Were the UK to become isolated it's influence would be much less certain.\r\nCurrent economic conditions require we encourage both inward investment and growth of existing business opoerations. Both are likely to become cautious to commit funds if our links to the EU are uncertain.",
