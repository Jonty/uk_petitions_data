        "additional_details": "Much of our law is born in Brussels.  Membership of the European Union makes that inevitable.  What is not inevitable is that it should receive such little scrutiny from British legislators. The low levels of turnout and interest in elections to the European Parliament prevent that body claiming a true mandate. The Government should call for the abolition of the European Parliament and for national Parliaments to take over the scrutiny, negotiation and final say over European legislation.",
