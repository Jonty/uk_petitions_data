        "additional_details": "Reduce welfare budget by placing tight spending controls on welfare recipients. Provide a welfare \"debit card\" only to be spent on approved items, the recipient never has access to cash. Restricting spending habits should motivate them to work so they have access to items not available to them on welfare. EG: Only allow healthy home brand foods from supermarkets, approved by nutritionists for a balanced diet (fruit, vegetables, low fat, low GI, low salt items. No crisps, sweets or sugary drinks). Cigarettes, alcohol, fast food, restaurant food are not available to welfare recipients - this will also have a positive affect  on the health system, reducing obesity, alcoholism, heart disease, cancer etc. Rent, energy and water is direct debited to the landlord / utility. Clothes and furniture is given a limited quarterly budget of credits which can be spent at approved low cost stores. Welfare recipients get free public transport, but not given money to run a car.",
