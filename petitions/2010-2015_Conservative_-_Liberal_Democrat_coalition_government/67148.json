        "additional_details": "I would like the government to re-consider the refusal of fertility treatment for couples who need it.\r\nMany couples face devastating news that they may never conceive a child naturally and are refused treatment due to unfair barriers.\r\nI do not believe it is fair to discriminate due to social status of whether or not either partner already has a child, or they don't meet the criteria for their area.                                                                Couples who suffer with  fertility issues should have the right to be treated no matter what.\r\nIf someone has a medical condition, why is if fair that they should be refused treatment needed?\r\nRefusal is not in compliance with N. I .C.E guidelines and are a breach of Articles 2, 3 , 8 ,12 and 14 of the 'European Convention of Human Rights'\r\nI ask on behalf of desperate couples that you re- consider and allow them their right to 'found a family'\r\nThank you\r\n",
