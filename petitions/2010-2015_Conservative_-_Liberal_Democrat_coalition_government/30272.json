It strongly recommends that the three\r\nprincipal stakeholders, being Liverpool City Council, Peel Holdings and English Heritage, reconvene around the table.\r\nThe government must not let Liverpool lose its WHS status for a speculative scheme that lacks the skill to create a 21st century city that respects its heritage assetts.",
