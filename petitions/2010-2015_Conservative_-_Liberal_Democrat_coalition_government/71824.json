My brother is doing all he can to see his son however due the present laws his access is limited and restricted. My brothers ex partner is allowing him access if and when she feels like it . She will not allow more than a few hours a week access and overnight stays are out of the question. Whilst I appreciate this matter has been raised as a concern for many years I urged the law to be changed in the best interest of all children who have a right to a relationship with fathers who love them dearly.\r\n\r\nChildren have a right the love of both parents and it's time for change.\r\n\r\nAgain thank you for taking the time to read my petition.
