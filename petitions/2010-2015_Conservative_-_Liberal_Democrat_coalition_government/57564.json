This is taken from the BBC website:\r\n\r\nThe basic facts are that Scotland accounts for 8.4% of the UK population, 8.3% of the UK's total output and 8.3% of the UK's non-oil tax revenues - but 9.2% of total UK public spending.\r\n\r\nScottish Executive figures for 2009-10 show that spending per capita in Scotland was \u00a311,370, versus \u00a310,320 for the UK. In other words, spending in Scotland was \u00a31,030 - or 10% higher - per head of population than the UK average.\r\n\r\nI would like a vote on Scottish Independence as I believe all UK taxpayers contribute to their society.\r\n",
