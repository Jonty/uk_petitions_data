        "additional_details": "This petition calls upon HM Government not to legislate to permit 'same-sex marriage'. It affirms the biblical teaching that marriage can only be between one man and one woman. Marriage cannot be redefined because it is not a human invention but an institution ordained by God for the good of mankind. The Christian understanding of marriage is at the heart of family life, is good for children and is a vital part of our country's heritage. We therefore call upon HM Government to support and protect the uniqueness of marriage, for the good of all in our society.",
