        "additional_details": "Prime Minister's Questions, rather than an opportunity for the public to see our politicians debate the most important issues facing our country, has turned into nothing but a cheap points-scoring exercise. The persistent shouting from both sides stifles any chance of a real debate and shows a complete disrespect for every British citizen who takes an interest in their country's politics. This petition is not motivated by any political bias - governments and oppositions past and present must shoulder the responsibility of turning PMQs into the farce it is today. It does nothing whatsoever to enhance our democracy or reputation abroad, and should be abolished.",
