        "additional_details": "In a multi-national, multi- cultural nation such as we are, we feel (or should feel) that equality is a must. We elect our politicians, weather they be representing our communities or our country, on the ideology that they will do this for all members of their constituency.\r\nDiane Abbott, on her twitter page has demonstrated her lack of representation for all people in her constituency or country with her segregating and racist comments. Even if these comments were taken out of context I think their is enough viable doubt to her motivations and her ability to do her job.\r\nI therefore feel that Ms. Abbott should resign or if not, be fired from her position as a politician or any other public representative position.",
