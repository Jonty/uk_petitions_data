        "additional_details": "England, Scotland and Wales have maintained their own identities even after over three centuries of union. England has subsidised the rest of the UK for centuries and got very little in return. The most recent public spending figures show that Scotland receives 14% more than its fair share of UK public spending.\r\n\r\nThe animosity between the home nations has reached epidemic proportions. Our differences are irreconcilable, it's time for divorce. Let's be good neighbours instead of unwilling partners trapped in a marriage of convenience. Let England have its independence.",
