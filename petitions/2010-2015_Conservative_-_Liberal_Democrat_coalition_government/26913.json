        "additional_details": "Compulsory DNA testing consists of all the citizen DNA samples taken which would be recorded on a database. This database would be used to identify suspects of crime. DNA left by a criminal e.g. blood, fingerprints etc would be scanned on the computer system and matched with the similar DNA. This would make it easier for the police to catch criminals. It would save a lot of police time and money and also innocent people would not be suspected.",
