        "additional_details": "Currently, doctors, nurses and nursing home staff are allowed to smoke in between shifts or during lunch and coffee breaks. This means they have toxic smoke and dust on their bodies, hair and clothing. Effectively, this means another form of passive-smoking. Also, many people are hyper-allergenic to cigarette smoke and dust even in small quantities. It often causes them difficulties with breathing and streaming irritated eyes, which makes it difficult for them to see very well.\r\n\r\nIt would seem a contradictory paradox for doctors, nurses and nursing staff to be allowed to smoke, when they are professing to help make people better and healthier. They are also a role model for people of all ages, so seeing them smoking plays a significant part in encouraging or condoning others smoking.",
