        "action": "Bring the Dartford tolls into the 21st century by offering online / mobile payments to reduce lengthy, persistent and worsening congestion on the M25!",
        "additional_details": "The congestion caused by vehicles waiting to pay the \u00a32.00 toll is maddening. It isn\u2019t uncommon to wait for two hours or more, increasing journey times and thus pollution by a significant margin. Why? And for how long will the public have to suffer?\r\n\r\nTechnology has to hold the answer. I truly believe that there is MASSIVE demand for a technology-based solution to the \u201cproblem tolls\u201d on the Dartford crossing. Even if queues are likely during peak times with the new technology in place, if the flow rate is increased and the waiting time reduced it has to be a positive outcome for hundreds of thousands of people each week. It\u2019s a captive audience, granted, but to let this go on and worsen in the future is simply barbaric.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and ask the government to take steps to immediately improve the service offered to all us customers using the Dartford Toll.\r\n",
