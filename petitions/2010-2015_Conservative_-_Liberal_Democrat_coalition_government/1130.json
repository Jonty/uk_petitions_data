        "additional_details": "The significant word is OPTION. No-one is having ANY rights removed, The proposal is that certain crimes could be dealt with by a striped back and release - saving society time and money - AND enabling the criminal the chance to continue working / providing for their family.\r\n\r\nAs the petition advocates a CHOICE - then there shouldbe NO argument that anyone is forced to endure cruel or unusual punishment. They are free to option for conventional sentencing EXACTLY as before.\r\n\r\nThey have a choice to have a sore back for a few days - OR lose their freedom, their job, possibly their homes and arguably risk assualt and abuse in prison.\r\n\r\nFast, simple, cheap and EVERYONE wins.\r\n\r\nI would like the Government to enquire if there is any reason that Europe could say giving someone a CHOICE in their sentencing in ANY way harmed their rights. If they concur that it simply gives an additional choice, then the option should be included where the alternative would be a short prison sentence.",
