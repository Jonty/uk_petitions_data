Many young people suffer from homelessness due family problems and are forced to evict their home.People in the age group of 16-21 have not got many options when they turn homeless and the government does not help them as much due to their age group. also the media has potrayed young people in a negative so many people aren't aware of their life issues.PLEASE HELP!!!!",
