        "additional_details": "Just today we have heard the the Prime Minister wants to introduce measures to make it easier to sack people, and this at a time of serious financial cutbacks, concern about rising inequalities and increasing tensions in our society. The people of this country were not the instigators of current financial problems. The Govt, Regulators and Bankers are responsible for serious mismanagement, yet it is the people at grass roots who are being expected to pay the price. This is essentially unjust. In a Democratic society the voice of the people should be heard and at times of major hardship it is vital that this voice is listened to in order to prevent mass alienation from  the Democratic Process. Parliament should be forced to debate ways to ensure that they are more accountable to the people and to introduce mechanisms to empower citizens if they are dissatisfied with the behaviour of MPs.
