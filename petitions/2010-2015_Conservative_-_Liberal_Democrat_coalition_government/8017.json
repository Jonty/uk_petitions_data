        "additional_details": " Britain does not have a patron saint, but should. St Oswald would be a good choice and should be declared the British patron saint. St Oswald was an English prince who had to flee to Scotland. Returning to Northumbria he introduced and established Christianity. As king he fought pagans and died a martyr. He was a popular saint. He is a unifying character because he was an Anglo-Saxon who was an asylum-seeker and political refugee but his Christianity was that of the Celtic Church. This Christianity is not specifically Roman Catholic or Protestant because it was the Celtic Church which was not tied to Rome and was pre-Reformation. Thus being non-denominational St Oswald can be a unifying symbolic figure. The Christianity he helped establish has been a major building block to centuries of British culture. August the 5th is the day of St Oswald. Let us make St Oswald the British patron saint and mark his day throughout all the British nations.",
