        "additional_details": "Before 1967, Jews couldn't visit the holiest place in Judaism in Jerusalem, were expelled from the city, their holy places were desecrated, and the number of Christians fell by over half. Since Israel took control, Christians, Muslims and Jews all have full religious and cultural freedom in Jerusalem. Arabs inside the city\u2019s municipal boundaries are offered Israeli citizenship.\r\nIsrael has upheld its moral and ethical obligations, earning the right of sovereignty over Jerusalem. Israel's decision, as a free and democratic nation, to designate a united and undivided Jerusalem as its capital, should be recognized by the entire international community.\r\nThe Palestinian call for Jerusalem as their capital breaks with the established pattern in the Islamic world where holy cities are NOT capital cities (e.g. Riyadh in Saudi Arabia \u2013 not Mecca/Medina; Baghdad in Iraq \u2013 not Najaf; Tehran in Iran not Qom/Isfahan).\r\nTherefore Britain should move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.",
