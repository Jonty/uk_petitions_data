        "additional_details": "Cleft lip and palate is a Medical condition that some babies are born with, they need to undergo surgeries to repair/correct the lip, nose, gum and palate - these are usually done within the 1st year. But most babies with full cleft struggle to feed without special soft bottles and shaped teats, it is important that these are provided for the continued growth and development of the child.\r\n\r\nWhilst most hospitals will provide a starter of 2 bottles, the additional cost of buying extra bottles and teats are not covered by prescription making it difficult for parents on a low income to source and afford these costly bottles and teats.\r\n\r\nWe feel that as babies and children under the age of 16 are generally exempt from costs associated with medical condtions within the UK that special care bottles for Cleft palate should be also provided.",
