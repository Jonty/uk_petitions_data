This attitude is hindering their purpose. The public needs to be reminded they are a service as opposed to a business and that we are not 'customers.'\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must no longer pay to contact a service we are funding.\r\n\r\n\"Strengthening the Civil Service - including ensuring value for money to the taxpayer.\"",
