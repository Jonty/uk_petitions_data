        "additional_details": "I want to try and get diet companies like Slim fast, Weight watchers, Diet chef eg. Because people are talking about obesity in the uk and no one helps the diet chef is 100 per week and people on benifits couldnt afford this amount so there fore they cant diet which mean they will have to stay over weight. If the diet companies became available for people on nhs then people wouldnt get that bad where they would have to get gastric bypass, liposuction and have to go have excess skin removal. This would benefit alot of people. I would like this to be taken forward and to see how the member of the public feel about this ?",
