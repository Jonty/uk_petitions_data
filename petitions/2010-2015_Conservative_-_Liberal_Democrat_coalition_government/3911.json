        "additional_details": "Too many petty crimes are unpunished, the perpetrators know the police cant convict them all, stealing odd items from shops, causing a nuisance, joy riding in car parks, drunkeness etc. Petty crimes lead to bigger crimes, the problem is to big to lock em up. Or is it? To the Government I say let  private companies run local lock up hotels, yes hotels with old style jail doors and windows, the Police call the hotel to collect the criminal, and the hotel charge him \u00a3 per night, room and board, released on payment or increasing nightly (or goods siezed)\r\nNo cost to the public purse, private companies make profit and we finally teach some lessons.",
