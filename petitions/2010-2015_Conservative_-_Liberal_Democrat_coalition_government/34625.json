        "additional_details": "This petition has been formed to rally for the abolishment of the use of Article 4 directives to stop properties being used as Houses in Multiple Occupation.\r\nSince its introduction these measures have been used by local councils to effectively ban new HMO's  and has had a drastic effect on the one area of the housing market that has otherwise remained bouyant despite the recession.\r\nThe measures have been put in place without listening to property professionals who all disagree that it is a good thing.\r\nThis legislation is not only bad for the economy as a whole but also is also unfairly labeling students and those on low income as a sub-class that are prone to anti social behaviour and is potentially forcing them into substandard accommodation in areas they do not want to live.\r\n\r\n",
