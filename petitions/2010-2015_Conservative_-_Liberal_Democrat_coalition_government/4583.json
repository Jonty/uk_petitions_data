Your own emotional or mental state, values or personal view of the employer can be overridden. Who knows how much stress, divorce, homelessness and suicide this is influencing. And enforced/coerced labour ought to be against our human rights.  Stop scapegoating the unemployed for a lack of industry and good jobs and stop this ability to sanction (stop) benefits.",
