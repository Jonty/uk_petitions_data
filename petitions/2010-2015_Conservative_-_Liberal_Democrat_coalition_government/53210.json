        "additional_details": "Bringing in tribunal fees would  go against EU law by making it \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d for workers to exercise their rights under employment law,\r\n\r\nNew fees for bringing a claim to an employment tribunal or the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT)\u00a0are due to come into force from 29th July. Under the new structure, parties will have to pay an upfront fee to raise a claim with a further \u2018hearing fee\u2019 once the case is referred to a tribunal. Flat fees will apply to EAT cases.\r\n\r\nThe amount payable to refer \u2018level 2\u2032 unfair dismissal or discrimination claims will be \u00a3250 with a further hearing fee of \u00a3950, making a total of \u00a31,200. A full hearing for an administratively simple \u2018level 1\u2032 claim will be \u00a3390. The remission system which currently operates to exempt people on low incomes from having to pay the full fees will be extended to apply to employment tribunals. This is grossly unfair to emloyees",
