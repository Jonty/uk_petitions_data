Local Authorities are placing our vulnerable relatives into sub-standard homes because they are the cheapest which makes it impossible for these homes to provide the level of service required.  My mother has weeks to live because of failings - the Care Quality Commission failed to publish a report on the failings of a nursing and the Local Authority ran no checks on the home before sending my mother there.  How many more people will die or suffer before something is done?  I would like a judge led enquiry into care home neglect and abuse and the failings of the system to protect these vulnerable people.",
