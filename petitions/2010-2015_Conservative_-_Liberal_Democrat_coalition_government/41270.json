        "additional_details": "The current level of central government grant awarded to the Devon and Cornwall Constabulary fails to take into account the unique characteristics of the constabulary, such as the fact that it is geographically the largest force area in England, has the highest mileage of roads and that 8 million tourists visit the area every year.\r\n\r\nSince the last round of reductions, there has been a rise in some crimes and the number of fatal road accidents has already reached last year's figure, with the winter months still to come.\r\n\r\nTherefore we call on the government to recognise the uniqueness of the Devon and Cornwall Constabulary and increase the grant in order to prevent community safety being put at risk.",
