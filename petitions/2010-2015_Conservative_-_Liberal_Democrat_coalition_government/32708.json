Smoking is LEGAL in this country, but smokers have been turned into a persecuted minority. Now, we are going to even struggle to buy cigarettes  because we're to be prevented from seeing the products 'to protect the children'.  Stop persecuting us!  We have a right to smoke, we pay MASSIVE taxes for the privilege, and the persecution has now gone too far.  Please stop this!",
