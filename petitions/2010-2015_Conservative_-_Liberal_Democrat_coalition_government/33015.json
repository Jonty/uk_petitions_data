        "additional_details": "Students currently enrolled on teacher training courses in England were promised by universities that qualified teacher status would be awarded at the end of their courses, providing that students pass skills tests in English and Maths. The government has now changed the number of attempts that teachers can make on their skills tests in the final year of their course. This means that some students who have been studying to be a teacher for up to four years will finish their course without Qualified Teacher Status. We think that the changes to the skills tests should not apply to students who are already enrolled at university. ",
