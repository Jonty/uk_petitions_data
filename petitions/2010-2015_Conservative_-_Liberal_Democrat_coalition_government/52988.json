He is a mindless, arrogant, moronic bore who will continue to cost the BBC money and affect its reputation. He endlessly makes an embarrassing fool of himself on TV and WILL one day hurt someone with his pathetic juvenile stupidity. It is our money the BBC is spending on this ignorant village idiot. Encourage the BBC to sack him now before the it suffers any further harm.",
