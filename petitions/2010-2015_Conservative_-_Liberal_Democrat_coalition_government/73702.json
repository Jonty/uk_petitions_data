        "additional_details": "A common motivator for persons commiting acts of terrorism around the world is 'religious martyrdom'. These individuals frequently make video messages to explain, magnify or glorify the impact of their intended actions.\r\nThe decision to broadcast these video messages reinforces acts of hatred and plays a significant role in motivating more individuals to do the same.\r\nBy signing this petition, you are asking the UK Government to create a Code of Practice with the British Press, specifically focussed on the non-publication of video messages by any person suspected of committing any 'hate' based criminal offence anywhere in the world.\r\n",
