        "additional_details": "Trying not to be political in this, it has become obvious in recent times that corruption and lies is considered acceptable in Parliament. I don't believe that this is acceptable to the British public. Sometimes 5 years till the next election is too long. Corruption needs dealing with the second it arises. We need a way for the British public to express their lack of confidence in a government and recall them from power as swiftly as possible, one parliamentary session at the very maximum.\r\n\r\nI propose a permanent petition be created which expresses no confidence in the current government, and calls for their immediate resignation and the dissolution of the government.\r\n\r\nSignatures for this petition should be time sensitive (i.e, signatures should be removed 1 month after their addition unless renewed). 500,000 signatures at the most should guarantee a new election.",
