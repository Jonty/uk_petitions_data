        "additional_details": "A section of the foreign aid budget should be diverted into the creation of a British hospital ship. This ship would be able to travel to countries around the world at a few days\u2019 notice to help with natural disasters and other emergencies.  This would not only reduce the amount of money lost to corruption but would also ease pressure on the MOD, whose budget is decreasing all the time. A hospital ship would also act as an ambassador to the UK and a force for good around the world.\r\nThis hospital ship would ideally have a capacity for up to 400 beds and have much other lifesaving equipment on board such as X-ray machines and MRI scanners. This ship could not only be confined to helping foreign nations but our own in times of national emergencies, such as a terrorist attack or natural disaster.\r\n",
