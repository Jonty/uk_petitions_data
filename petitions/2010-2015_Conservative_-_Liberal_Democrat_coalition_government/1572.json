        "action": "The current foriegn aid package should be cut and the UK government will only match contributions made by the electorate on each appeal.",
        "additional_details": "This petition aims to stop the use of tax payers money being poorly spent through the flawed foriegn aid budget. The people of the UK should choose which projects we wish to support therefore any event worthy of the publics contribution should have the money raised by private donations matched by the government. The money raised should be managed by the government to ensure value for money is maintained during the response to any crisis. Donations to all foriegn governments should be stopped and only individuals within the conuntry in crisis should be the recipients of aid. It is the tax payers who should decide who is to recieve our charity as afterall this is our money.",
