        "additional_details": "In Russia most people have a Dashcam fitted in their car, this is apparently due to a somewhat corrupt legal system dealing with vehicle related accidents.\r\n\r\nEven though the system in the UK is not corrupt, I believe a use of these small cameras in everyone's car would help reduce dangerous driving, cut costly insurance inquires and generally make people feel more comfortable on the road.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I don't believe these would infringe on peoples' privacy or cause any other unwanted disruption among the general public.\r\n\r\nPolice use dashcams to protect themselves, why shouldn't the public too?",
