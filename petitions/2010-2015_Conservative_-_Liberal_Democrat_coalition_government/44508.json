        "additional_details": "The government must discuss the subject of university lecturers and their lack of correspondence with registered pupils. As tuition fees rise and continue to rise, students will be looking to get value for money and lecturers need to make sure they offer this. Even if their primary reason for being at the university is not teaching, they still have a duty to fulfil their role to best of their ability. This petition has been created to raise awareness of what is an issue for most students. ",
