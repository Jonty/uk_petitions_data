A \u00a360 fine seems to be no deterent as thousands of drivers continue to ignore the law and put the lives of inocent people at risk using phones and even being stupid enough to text. A tougher penalty would make drivers think and remove those that continually flout the law from our roads. Let's save some lives.",
