Facebook,      Twitter, Blogs and email\r\n\u2022  Playstations, Xbox, Wii or any other games console (especially with violent games)\r\n\u2022  Computers and gadgets\r\n\u2022  Mobile phones\r\n\u2022  Junk food\r\n\u2022  Expensive branded items\r\n\u2022  Cigarettes and alcohol\r\n\r\nMany law-abiding, hardworking people (some of them victims of crime) cannot afford these things, which are essentially luxuries.  Whether or not the prisoners purchase these things themselves with their own money, they should not be allowed to have them whilst in jail.\r\n\r\nPrison is a punishment and should not be viewed as free living and accommodation.  Hard work, discipline and education has to take place over entertainment and leisure.\r\n\r\nWe would like the government to ban the presence of \"luxury\" items within prisons and for these establishments to keep within specific, strict guidelines.",
