        "additional_details": "I petition the Government to stop setting unlivable minimum wages and to increase the minimum wage to an actual living wage so that all upright citizens can take care of a 1 child family without financial struggle and thus negating the need for tax credits etc.\r\n\r\nAlthough this may cause short term loss to companies employing people, it will make employees more satisfied, loyal and is very likely to increase output.\r\nA viable working wage will encourage benefit claimants to actually seek work.\r\nAll win.\r\nthe employer gets greater productivity,\r\nmore tax is paid,\r\npeople are more likely to seek work,\r\ncomplicated tax credits are no longer needed,\r\n\r\nI urge the goverment of all departments to consider this as a way to restore our country to profit stability and even economic growth as opposed to our continual decline.\r\n",
