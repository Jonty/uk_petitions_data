I believe that people who live in a council home who have one/two full time wages coming into the household, should not be an indefinite situation.\r\nDepending on financial circumstances, which would be assessed, it could be required a person/household saves so much money per month. After three/five years, the person(s) should be re-assessed to see if they may be in a stable financial situation with a good foundation of savings to allow them to get a mortgage/rent a house. If they were not in a stable financial situation or would be affected negatively by renting, by not have enough savings, they would be reassessed in a few years. It seems unfair for people who could afford to have a mortgage/rent, are able to have discounted accommodation indefinitely.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
