If you can afford to own a property then you alone should be responsible for the rates the building accrues.Several thousands of people buy property knowing the government will contribute a comfortable living for those already with millions in the bank .The property market is desperate for this change as the system in place breeds corruption.Act now by signing this petition and help government save around 6 billion pound per year.",
