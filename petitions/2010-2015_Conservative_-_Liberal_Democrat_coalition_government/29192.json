        "additional_details": "Unrealistic rents in many parts of the country have created crazy benefit pay-outs.  In many places it is impossible to, privately, rent a family house for less than \u00a31200 per calendar month; this means that a salary of over \u00a317000 a year is required just to pay the rent.  This is far higher than the minimum wage and impossible for anyone living on the average of \u00a325000 per annum.  We call upon the government to debate and institute controls on landlords to prevent unrealistic and opportunistic rent increases.",
