        "additional_details": "The government allowed universities to raise their tuition fees from \u00a33,375 to upto \u00a39,000.\r\n\r\nThis change was due to universities placing huge pressure on the government, so that universities could make larger profits. This is not fair business.\r\n\r\nThe changes will now effect a large number of students which are considering going to university. A large concern is that students who do choose to study at university may have large debts after studying, especially with poor students.\r\n\r\nThe government should re-think this concept, as debt can cause huge issues with the economy as a whole. As a result some students may be crippled with debt and struggle to live an enjoyable life.\r\n\r\nThe government should re-think all the above, and provide additional funding to support poor students from families earning under \u00a325,000, along with other funding to support those students from earning under \u00a350,000 who will also struggle to re-pay the debt.",
