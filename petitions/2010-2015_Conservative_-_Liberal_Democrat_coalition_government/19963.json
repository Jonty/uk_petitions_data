However if the construction is not a \"building\" with a roof, walls, windows etc then the charity has to pay VAT.\r\nOur charity has built a skate-park and although our funding all comes from  grants and donations our VAT total could be around \u00a390,000!\r\nAt a Tax Tribunal to appeal against HMRC the Judge commented that \u2013\r\n\"This is a vast sum to be paid out of funds donated by the general public for a recreational facility. We can really only say that in the light of the development in the range and diversity of modern day charitable undertakings some consideration should perhaps be given to the VAT treatment of capital projects which these charities are undertaking which clearly fall within their charitable objectives but do not conform to the current legislation\".\r\n Please help us and many other worthy charities to change this discriminatory tax law.\r\n\r\n",
