        "additional_details": "Lots of doctors in foreign countries don't seem to have a problem making sure that UK citizens can pay, before they administer medical treatment, why should that be a concern of our medics?  Even in other EU countries UK citizens have to pay first and claim it back later, from our own government(?).  That is ludicrous.  Nobody who has not paid into the NHS through taxes or national insurance contributions should receive treatment to a level above what a UK citizen would receive in their country.  Whether or not the incident is an emergency is not a consideration, what is a consideration is that UK taxpayers should NEVER be required to pay for the medical treatment of foreigners.",
