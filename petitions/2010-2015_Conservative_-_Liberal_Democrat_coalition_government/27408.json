        "additional_details": "The preserved Llangollen Railway in North Wales is successfully restoring 10 miles of the former Ruabon -Barmouth railway and already operates along 7.5 miles of track from Llangollen to Carrog.\r\n\r\nWhile steam trains head west out of Llangollen along the preserved line, there is 6.25 miles of former trackbed between the town and the national network at Ruabon, on the Chester - Shrewsbury line.\r\n\r\nReinstatement of these 6.25 miles would have many positive benefits for Llangollen. Llangollen is a tourist destination with associated traffic problems. The valley location offers little scope for a by-pass road and, in the summer season, traffic clogs the surrounding roads and car parks. The reinstated railway would help to alleviate many of these problems, providing an effective, efficient and eco-friendly method of accessing Llangollen and the World Heritage Sites around the Dee Valley.\r\n\r\n",
