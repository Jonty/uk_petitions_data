        "additional_details": "I would like the goverment to quickly evaluate this relatively new product and actively promote their use, even put them in their NHS quit smoking packs.\r\nElectronic cigarettes deliver the experience of smoking and greatly minimize the smells and health risks associated with tobacco smoke, The  benefits could be huge, as millions of smokers that may die in the next 20 yrs could live longer lives.\r\n\r\n So the goverment should promote and make the population aware of this device, saving money for every one and encourage airlines and trains, hospitals ect to allow their use. They should be targeted at smokers only and not to children, youths or non smokers as they are a smoking alternative and not aimed at the non smoker for which their is no substitute health wise. But they are very much the lesser health risk. Many experts have reported no health risks, the benefits are too many to list here. So vote and help millions of smokers just like me.",
