They have many links and friends with English clubs.\r\n\r\nRangers will bring a refreshed excitement and rivalry to the English game, as well as many commercial opportunities for England through it's large fan base.\r\n\r\nThis petition asks supporters of ALL football clubs to restore the link from over 100 years ago and in the spirit of improvement - raise the profile and competitive nature of the English leagues.
