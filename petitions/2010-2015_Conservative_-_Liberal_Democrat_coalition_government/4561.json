        "action": "End religiously sponsored schools in the UK, and implement a secular eduction system.",
        "additional_details": "In the UK, we have an education system where our schools are sponsored by one form of religion or the other (be it Catholic, Muslim, C of E or Jewish), and in many of these schools religious doctrine is being forwarded alongside or even ahead of the teaching of reason and science (such as the theory of evolution). It also segregates children in the earliest and most influential time in their lives, and can have negative effects on tolerance and integration in society. This petition would like to see an end to religiously sponsored state schools in the UK, and the implementation of secular state schools nationwide.",
