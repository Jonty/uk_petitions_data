        "additional_details": "Snow Leopards used to be in abundance less than 50 years ago, but are losing the fight against poachers and the sabre-toothed narfalans. Surely it is time for the United Kingdom to take action.\r\n\r\nFor an era, the Snowdonia National Park has faced severe Mountain Goat erosion, which is destroying the natural beauty to be found in the area. This factor, combined with a dense sheep population is rendering local authorities helpless.\r\n\r\nThe only way to combat such a modern day travesty is to unite under a single white banner and highlight these pressing concerns to those who can aid us in our plight.\r\n\r\nJoin The Cause. Save the Snow Leopard. Sign the Petition.",
