Turing is undoubtedly the most high-profile gay man to have fallen foul of this unjust law, but he should not be singled out for special treatment. ANY person convicted of the same crime should be treated in the same way - so a pardon for should be a pardon for all. Even if you are against homosexuality, this is surely a simple matter of principal. Turing was, undoubtedly, gay. He has not received his pardon because he wasn't gay, but because he was a famous, brilliant, high-profile man. The thousands of other 'ordinary' gay men who have suffered at the hands of the same unjust laws deserve to be treated in exactly the same way - they too should be pardoned.",
