        "additional_details": "The government has announced powers to monitor every website we vist, every email we send and every phone call we make. I realise the intention is to require a warrant and to tackle crime, but history is full of legislation used far wider than its intended purpose. It's also too easy to use the rhetoric of \"security\" these days. No-one seems to care about freedom any more.\r\n\r\nI suggest this legislation have a chilling effect on our democracy. There's a world of difference between the conversations people have freely, and the ones when someone might be listening. It's called a Panopticon, and if we're forced into it, we all lose.\r\n\r\nI propose a simple solution: leave us alone and stop extending the surveillance state.",
