Less frequent users with low mileages or fuel efficient vehicles would pay less\r\n\u2022Infrastructure is already in place to collect tax through petrol sales, so no extra cost in implementing this new system\r\n\r\nDisadvantages\r\n\u2022The increase in fuel prices. However, given the massive ongoing savings from above this should only be a relatively small increase",
