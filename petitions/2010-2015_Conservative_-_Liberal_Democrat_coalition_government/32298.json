        "additional_details": "This petition is has been created to change police forces policies across the UK. so that they can pursue offenders on offroad vehicles.\r\nAfter attending a community meeting with Merseyside Police. The subject of offroad vehicles came up a number of times the police officer could understand the frustrarations of the civilians but pointed out that it is a policy of most police forces not to pursue these offenders as they might injure themselves.\r\nI have seen these offroad vehicles been driven at speed on roads, fields, public pathways and even pavements.\r\nIt is clear that many of these idiots are not only breaking several laws of the highway code, but are also involved in other criminal activities.\r\nWhile the police say the policy is there for the offenders safety what about our safety.\r\n",
