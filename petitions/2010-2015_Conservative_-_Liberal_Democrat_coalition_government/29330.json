        "additional_details": "We, the taxpayers, have spent \u00a3275 billion on quantitative easing so far and it appears that it is not having the desired effect of stimulating our economy and dragging us back from the edge.\r\nIt has just been announced that we are to be indebted by our government to the tune of another \u00a350 billion with no say as to where the money goes. The economy would be stimulated far more with that money in the pockets of the people.\r\nGive us the money- with the proviso that it be spent within 30 days, on whatever we like. If it is not spent it goes back to the treasury and it has to be spent legally- no \u00a31000 drug binges.\r\nIt is up to us, contrary to what the government believes, we are all able to make decisions for ourselves and if we are expected to repay the \u00a3325 billion of debt you have signed us up to then let us have a little bit of pleasure from it first, before we spend the next 14 years (projected) paying it back.",
