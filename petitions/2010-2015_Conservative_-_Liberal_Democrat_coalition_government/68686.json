        "additional_details": "Mass distribution of non-sexual naked (showing genitalia) images of children should be made illegal.\r\n\r\nPublic distribution of such images will innevitably result in these images being used by those who have a sexual interest in children (paedophiles), with devastating effect if/when this is discovered by the subjects of these photos.\r\n\r\nMaking this distribution illegal would also help close the loophole where such images are legally displayed on websites intended for paedophile use as any such publicly available image would automatically become illegal.\r\n\r\nI therefore propose that it is made illegal to distribute images of children (under 18 years of age) showing genitalia except for distribution within closed groups where there is a valid non-sexual reason for this distribution.",
