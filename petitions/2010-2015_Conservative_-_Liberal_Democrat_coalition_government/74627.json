        "additional_details": "David Osborne is a criminal defence Barrister who often represents defendants on rape and sexual assault trials. He recently published an online blog article explaining that drunk women cannot be raped, amongst a vile vitriol of victim blaming, rape apologist nonsense. His comments have outraged survivors and victims support charities- and rightly so. Mr Osborne is governed by the rule of law and the burden of proof within a court room, and yet the rule of law is being entirely disregarded in his views. This man should not be in a position in which these beliefs can be promoted and he should be removed from his position with immediate effect.",
