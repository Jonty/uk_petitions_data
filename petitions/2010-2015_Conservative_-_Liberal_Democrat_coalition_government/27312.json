Devolution has left England paying to support lower tuition fees, free elderly care, free hospital parking, free prescriptions etc. for Scottish and Welsh residents whilst being expected to pay more for these same services in England.\r\nWhy should the English wait for the Scottish to decide whether they want to remain in Union?  Give English people the right to have their say.",
