        "additional_details": "Recently, the media has been broadcasting inaccurate claims from some individuals about the damage caused by Khat. This has angered many members of the khat chewing community who enjoy their social life, work and pay tax like every British citizen.\r\n\r\nThe bad examples shown on TV don\u2019t represent the majority of Khat chewers, these examples were already mental and social struggling. Effect of Khat is similar to any strong stimulant drink and never can be addictive.\r\n\r\nDO NOT ban Khat and stop Khat chewers from experience their right because of the bad behaviour of some individuals.\r\n\r\nThe ban on Khat along side with allowing cigarettes and alcohol, which have scientifically proven serious side effect, will be seen to be based on the ethnicity and background of the Khat chewers NOT on scientific reasons. Yes, the bad practices need to be tackled but a whole ban on Khat would be damaging to our British culture of diversity and integration.\r\n",
