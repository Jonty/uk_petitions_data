        "additional_details": "The Governments cycle to work guarantee is a fantastic idea that is too easily ignored. Any form of physical activity as part of a daily commute is an excellent way to keep fit. I feel strongly that the cycle to work guarantee or similar should be enforced on large companies (large to be debated) and planning regulations on office space should include a stipulation that they must have shower/changing facilities going forward, this should include any refurbishment of existing office space. Thank you for your support.",
