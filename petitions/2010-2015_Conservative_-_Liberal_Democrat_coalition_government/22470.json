        "additional_details": "I would like the government to reduce the budget allocated to circle for the running of  Hinchingbrooke  Health Care Trust. It is only right that as the last management were deemed to have failed on a \u00a363m a year budget that the next management should achieve better. If you are to give a private company \u00a337m a year more then it is unfair. In little over one year this debt of \u00a340m would be paid off if the existing management were afforded the same taxpayer budget, therefore they would not have failed at all.  We can ill afford to just pass \u00a3440m over 12 years to the profits of a private company.",
