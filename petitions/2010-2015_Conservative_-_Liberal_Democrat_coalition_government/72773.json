        "additional_details": "With years more of cuts announced in The Commons on Wednesday the will be severe consequesnces for UK crime. Regards what HMIC and the government say crime will rise.\r\n\r\nDo police forces have the capacity at the moment to even investigate e-crime, which will rise rapaidly over the years?\r\n\r\nWhilst I understand the need for financial stability, emergency services and the NHS are the life blood of the UK.\r\n\r\nThis countries population grows every year meaning more people to police but yet the budget keeps declining.\r\n\r\nSign this petition and lets get another debate happening in The Commons before the next general election. Some of the parties might see protecting police budgets as a vote winner and put in in their manifestos.",
