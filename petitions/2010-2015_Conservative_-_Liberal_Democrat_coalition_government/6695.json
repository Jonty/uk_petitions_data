        "additional_details": "The e-petition calls on the government to give the police the power to use water cannon on the UK mainland in riot situations.\r\n\r\nPublic disobedience seems to be becoming more and more frequent recently. Current tactics that the police use mean that officers have to get very close up to protesters and this can antagonise and flair up a situation.\r\n\r\nWater cannon should be introduced as another tactic the police can use (as they do in Northern Ireland and Europe) in order to disperse crowds of people.\r\n\r\nNobody likes being cold and wet and if used would encourage people to leave the area sooner",
