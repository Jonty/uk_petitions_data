For example how much advertising is aimed at single Mums compared to single Dads. Everywhere you go it is single Mums being talked about. Even the prime minister recently didn't mention single dads which I have still had no response to.\r\n\r\nGovernment need to accept that by ONLY talking about single Mums, there appears a huge lack of respect towards single Dads.\r\n\r\nIt is deeply upsetting when government down to shops and TV does not give single Dads the respect we deserve.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to get the country moving the right way for our kids and for single parents to be the politically correct term. It's about time single Dads were talked about too and by including us as single parents. It will be better for our kids.\r\n\r\nI want single dad's to get the recognition we deserve.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nJim",
