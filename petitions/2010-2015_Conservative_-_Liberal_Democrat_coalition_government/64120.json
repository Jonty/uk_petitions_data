By harboring foreign criminals the system seeks to only reward and protect these inhumane characters.  Have not the victims suffered too much already?They deserve our  honor, respect and treated with the uttermost dignity. Please contribute by signing this petition and for one we are not infringing human rights instead we are using our intellectual morality to confront the issue. This will never be equal to the savagery and brutality they have committed, but let us not give in by handing out privileges. Lets prevent anymore callousness, we must ensure that the guilty should carry this burden on their consciousnesses and not the public.\r\n\r\nFor more information please refer to these sources:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2606128/Illegal-immigrant-murdered-British-teenager-deport-GAY-kept-quiet-packed-off.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
