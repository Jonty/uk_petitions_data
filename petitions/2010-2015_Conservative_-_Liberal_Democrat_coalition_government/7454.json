        "additional_details": "We want the Prime Minister to allow the police to deal with rioters and looters much more aggressively and rigorously. A relaxed approach by the police to riot situations has given our country days of endless rioting, violence and looting (August 2011). Scenes of police officers standing by and watching scores of youth burning, vandalising and attacking property are just shameful and 'wimp-ish'. We want the government to allow police to use more force in public disorder situations. We also want the government to allow the courts to give out harsher penalties and sentences to those who engage in rioting and looting. This is to keep violent individuals off our streets and deter others from doing the same.",
