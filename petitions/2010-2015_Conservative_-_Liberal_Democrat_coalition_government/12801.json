        "additional_details": "Given that Britain's birthrate has risen dramatically in recent years, and the relentless rise in population is continuing, why should the taxpayer continue to subsidise reproduction regardless of parents' financial circumstances or the total number of children they choose to have? Scrapping it would save the country millions, and the funds saved could be better spent on encouraging training and education for the next generation of workers.",
