        "additional_details": "This petition is for those who are opposed to the proposed amendment to the NICE Caesarean section guidelines making elective caesarean section available to all on the NHS.\r\n\r\nWe believe that major abdominal surgery should not be undertaken unless there is a valid indication and that this move devalues natural childbirth and will ultimately undermine women's faith in their own bodies and in midwives to care for them safely during labour and delivery.\r\n\r\nWe hope this petition will highlight the strength of feeling among healthcare professionals and the general public and force the Department of Health and NICE to consider the implications of this proposal and act accordingly.",
