        "additional_details": "We believe that the Scottish Parliament already has sufficient powers to improve life in Scotland. During the recent referendum, additional powers were not on the ballot paper. We call upon all parties to read the referendum result purely as a rejection of separation, and therefore not to devolve more power to the Scottish Parliament that weakens the UK Union or causes harm or prejudice to other parts of the Union. Nor should devolution of more power be done in haste, or without due control and balance.",
