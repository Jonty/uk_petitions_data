        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the disclosure of the minutes for Cabinet meetings of 13 and 17 March 2003 which discussed legality and made the decisions to take this country to war with Iraq. The petition notes that the Information Commissioner's Office and the First Tier Information Tribunal backed disclosure in the public interest in 2007 and 2009 but this was frustrated by imposition of the Section 53 veto on disclosure by the last Labour Government. Now this veto has elapsed, the petition calls for the Coalition Government to respect these earlier rulings and not to oppose the new Freedom of Information requests currently being processed seeking disclosure of the minutes.
