        "additional_details": "Mike Hancock MP, the MP for Portsmouth South, is a self confessed sexual abuser of a vulnerable constituent. There is no way he can be removed as a Member of Parliament without his own consent, however the CBE can be removed from him, and the fact that he continues to use the honour after his name brings the entire Honours System in to disrepute. Please remove the CBE from Mike Hancock MP.",
