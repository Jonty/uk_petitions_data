When charging most state that parking is at the owners risk.\r\n\r\nThis is wrong, if a charge is made the organisation making the charge should be legally liable for damage to vehicals, theft of the vehical or theft from the vehical.\r\n\r\nThis should be brought into legislation, as it will a) reduce the imposition of this unacceptable stealth tax and b) that where a charge is made the organisation puts into place suitable security arrangements.",
