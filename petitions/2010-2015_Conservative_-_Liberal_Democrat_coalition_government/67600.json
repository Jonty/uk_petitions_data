        "additional_details": "The standard of treatment for type 1 diabetics is atrocious. This is a life changing and life ending disease which requires the best possible treatment to allow a type 1 diabetic to have the longest possible life. Type 1 diabetes should not be confused with type 2. Type 1 is caused genetically and there is no possible way of preventing this where as type 2 is preventable. There are many different treatments for type 1 diabetics but in many cases these treatments aren't offered due to the lack of knowledgable consultants and nurses. As well as this many treatments require funding which is very hard to access and have ridiculously strict guidelines which potentially shorten or end someone's life. This needs to be acted on quickly and appropriately to help save peoples lives and allow a better standing of living.",
