        "additional_details": "To have the government make Wicca a fully recognised and fully legal religion of the UK.\r\n\r\nThis is to include our various festivals and rites including our Handfasting (wedding), Requiems (funerals), Blessings (naming ceremony). Also to allow those who follow the Wiccan religion to be allowed days of religious holidays such as Samhain and Imbolc so that we can legally celebrate these days without having to take leave off work. The pentacle worn by many Wiccans should be classified as a religious symbol and should be allowed to be worn in places of work, the same as cruflixs and hijabs.\r\n\r\nI also believe in educating young people about Wicca as we are educating people about a whole range of religions and I do believe it can help to promote understanding of other cultures and belief systems.\r\n\r\nThe basic laws of recognizing Wicca has already taken place in the US and Canada and I would like to see it done here as well.",
