        "additional_details": "The government should not allow Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs to vote on matters such as education and healthcare when these votes will have little impact on their constituents lives. Surely the reason for their assemblies is that this should be the stage where their vote should count. If a policy does not involve other parts of Britain then they should not have a say in its development. This should stop as it is unfair and undemocratic. Devolution has done little but disenfranchise the English; students and patients in particular. ",
