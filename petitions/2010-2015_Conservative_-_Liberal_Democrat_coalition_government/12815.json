        "additional_details": "We urge the government to re-open the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway (DNSR). The South of England is short of North-South railway lines and this hampers expansion of freight and passenger services.  Re-opening the DNSR (with minor route changes, where necessary) would be a relatively cheap and effective solution to this problem.",
