        "additional_details": "The NHS are wanting to close down our purpose built nursery to use it for a car park. The nursery currently employs 23 members of staff  (which would be increased if the nursery was running at full capacity) and cares for over 100 children. As you can imagine this is going to cause disruption to our childrens lives and ours.  Acorns nusery is purpose built and there are no other nurseries in the area like it. The nursery opens at 7.30 to allow parents to start work at 8am. The nursery also has its own chef which provides essential nutritious hot meals for the children which is something that very few local nurseries. All in all this nursery is essential for working parents within the E.R.I and outwith it as it is not just used by the NHS staff. Please help us to keep our nursery open. A carpark can be built anywhere within the hospital grounds our nursery is already there lets keep it there.",
