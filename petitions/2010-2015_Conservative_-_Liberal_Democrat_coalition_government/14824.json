        "additional_details": "The Chief Executive Officer of the National Offender Management System (NOMS) has recently announced that the core tasks of the National Probation Service will be explored and could potentially be open to tender from private and voluntary organisations.\r\n\r\nIf NOMS are successful in their attempt to essentially 'privatise' probation services we are set to lose an organisation, which is over 100 years old, and has a wealth of experience working with some of the most dangerous individuals in our society.\r\n\r\nI would ask both practitioners and members of the public to sign this petition in order for this issue to be discussed openly with the House of Commons.  This will allow for greater transparency for the public to understand what is more important - cost efficiencies or public protection.",
