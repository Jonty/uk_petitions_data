        "additional_details": "The cost of the humble pasty has been increased by 20% in this years budget forcing a price hike that has caused controversy across the country.\r\n\r\nThe \"we're all in this together\" sound bite has never sounded so feeble.\r\n\r\nEspecially since revelations that Prime Minister David Cameron last enjoyed a pasty 5 years ago from an outlet at Leeds Station that has since shut down.\r\n\r\nEven the Chancellor of the Exchequer who has called his budget \"fair\" cannot remember when he last bought a pasty from Greggs - who have seen \u00a330m wiped from their share value since he announced the 2012 budget.\r\n\r\nThe people of Briton and pasty lovers alike know we are not all in this together so please sign this petition to pressure the government into swinging an axe on the pasty tax!",
