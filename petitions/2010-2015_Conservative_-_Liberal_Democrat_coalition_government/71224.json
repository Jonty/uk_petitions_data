We do not see rationally why a human embryo is considered of less value than a born human being & treated as such, given that human life is on a continuum of development from the moment of conception.\r\n\r\nParagraph 2 of Article 18 of the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine states that \"The creation of human embryos for research purposes is prohibited\". We would like for the UK to sign this as other countries have, if it will protect all human life from conception.",
