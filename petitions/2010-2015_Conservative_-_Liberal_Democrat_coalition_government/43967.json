        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to Implement the recommendation of Andrew Dilnot independent commission and impose a lifetime cap of \u00a335.000 or less with the state taking responsibility for its elderly residents care bill. It is not acceptable that people have to sell their homes to pay for their care when they have been responsible and saved and paid into the NHS system. The NHS was created free for all at the point of delivery and there should be no pick and choosing who is entitled to free care, whether it is the seriously ill, disabled, maternity care, or those with dementia, etc The savings can be made by stopping overseas Aid until it is affordable. If we cannot afford to support our own we should not be handing out tax payers money overseas. People in this Country should not be dying from neglect due to lack proper care for the elderly. ",
