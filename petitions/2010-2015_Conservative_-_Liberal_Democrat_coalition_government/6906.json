Why should the Police force be scared of tackling aggressive rioters for fear of being repremanded or sued if they injure a rioter who is attacking them?\r\n2.  Prisoners should not be entitled to human rights during their sentence.  They only need the basic necessities, what gives them the right to luxuries - televisions in their cells etc.  Why do they think they also should have the right to vote or the right to receive benefit payments?\r\nThe government should remove the human rights of anyone breaking the law.
