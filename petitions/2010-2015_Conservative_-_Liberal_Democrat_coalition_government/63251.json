This is whether a condom was worn or not.\r\n\r\nI feel that gay men are being persecuted especially when the latest statistics regarding the prevalence of infection rates show similar figures for both gay men and the heterosexual population.\r\n\r\nGay men are no more of a risk when donating blood than any other member of the public and it is about time that the officials took another look at its policy regarding this.\r\n\r\n",
