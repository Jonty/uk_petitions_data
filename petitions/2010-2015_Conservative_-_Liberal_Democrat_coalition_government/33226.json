The elderly and vulnerable deserve to be treated with dignity and compassion.\r\nAll care workers should be given appropriate training and the interview process should be stringent in order to ensure that only people who are genuinely interested in providing good care are offered positions.  Too many care providers take on anyone in order to fill vacant positions frequently resulting in people becoming carers just because it\u2019s a job and not because they care about people. Low pay and unsociable hours mean any good staff feel undervalued and stressed.\r\nThe Government should increase the basic pay for all care workers and legislate that relevant qualifications are required for any type of care work.  This should also apply to the recruitment of Health Care Support Workers within the NHS. ",
