        "additional_details": "Under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, it is illegal to own Pit Bull type dogs in the UK. The government gives an option for the owners to keep these dogs as long as they're kept on a lead and muzzled at all times in public. If the owners refuse this, the dogs are put to sleep. In my opinion, I think this is wrong. It may be true that many years ago people bred and raised them to fight, but this doesn't mean they were born mean. Yes, there have been many \"attacks\" on people. However, this is mainly due to the fact that they were mistreated as puppies. Any dog breed can be dangerous! I have much experience with Pit Bull type dogs and currently own a Pit Bull & Staffordshire Bull Terrier mixed-breed. He is no trouble at all! The meanest thing he can do to others is lick them and ask them to tickle his tummy. If it's possible, the government should make all owners who own these Pit Bull types attend a class to train their dogs safely. Please sign if you agree this act should be made useless!",
