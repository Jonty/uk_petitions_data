The PM anticipates that frontline services will not be affected however police chiefs report in reality this will equate to a loss of around 16,000 frontline posts.\r\nGiven the events of the last few days, tensions that escalated to violence through recent demonstrations, and large high profile events like the Olympics, could we debate the impact and implications of not reducing police funding until after the next general election.",
