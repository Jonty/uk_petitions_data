        "additional_details": "The Burton and Derbyshire College have applied for outline planning permission on the college fields at the rear of Westbury Estate, Twentylands and Walford Road. The proposed development is for 120 homes though experience shows this number is likely to increase significantly when sold to a developer.\r\n\r\nA development ir this size will have a very negative impact on the village of Rolleston on Dove in many ways including increased traffic, loss of recreational land, impacts on local schools, school class sizes, impact on our small and limited facilities such as shops, increased parking issues throughout the village and of course a further step towards urban sprawl!\r\n\r\nWe object to this development going ahead, please support us and protect the village of Rolleston.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and help our environment, our home and our village, thanks",
