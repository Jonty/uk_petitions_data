        "additional_details": "Goal: to make dog registration and chipping a legal requirement for all dog owners, all breeds included.\r\nAny potential breeders must be licenced to do so after animal safety checks (eg.cruelty to animal charges ect) have taken place and potential parenting animals are free from heriditary health issues that may cause needless suffering to a litter. Any pups sold must be chipped before purchase, and the new owners details registerd. Any dog found to be not suitable for breeding will be sterilized.\r\n\r\nBenefits: \"back street breeding\" will become illegal, cutting down on unwanted dogs and strays. Abandoned dogs will be more easily traced and irresponsible owners accounted for. People would consider rehoming animals more carefully, and give the animals the respect and dignity they deserve. ",
