        "additional_details": "I read recently how the British Airline & Pilots Assoc. (Balpa) are to meet with government regarding essentially banning modern day flying Remote Controlled hobby drones without the pilot holding a CAA certification.\r\nDrone technology has the future potential for real benefits, including medicine delivery to remote locations, search and rescue operations, land and property surveying, etc. By enforcing heavy rules for beginners means widespread realisation of these benefits will be quickly stifled as less people will be able to take up the activity commercially.\r\nReports of public injuries or property damage resulting from hobbyist drone use are negligible to zero. It's a shame that consumer devices seem to be lumped together with military drone tech in the eyes of the press and, seemingly, Balpa.\r\nPlease do not force us responsible hobbyists from practising a well established generally safe activity, which would cost us thousands of pounds to pursue.",
