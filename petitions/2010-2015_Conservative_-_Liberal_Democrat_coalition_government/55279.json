        "additional_details": "As there are fluctuating cost of a same product from a same company at different shopping centers. I believe that the cost of the same product would be more transparent and clear if \" Maximum Retail Cost\" (MRC\") of the product would be printed on the product. The \"MRC\" would haveTransportation Tax included which may vary from one country to other country in the UK and hence all countries in the UK may be included on the product with its respective MRC.\r\n\r\nBy this way there would be transparency in trade and hence no hidden cost from which the middle man gets benefited. Apart from this, the sellers can make profit by ordering the same product in bulk from the manufacturing companies which would turn out to be more cheaper in a long run.\r\n\r\nThere has to be a Consumer Court system which can keep the hidden cost checked.\r\n\r\nHence, I request the Government to kindly take steps to initiatiate this process by ammending the rules and regulations for the manufacturing companies.",
