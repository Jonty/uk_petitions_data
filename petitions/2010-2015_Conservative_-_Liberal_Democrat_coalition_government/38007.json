        "additional_details": "Paediatric and Health care staff involved in young peoples care are struggling to understand the needs of children who have disabilities, such as ADHD, Autism and Asperger\u2019s, these syndromes all fall under the FASD umbrella. It is apparent staff have very little knowledge or no understanding of FASD. It is vital to educate and train all Health care staff involved in the care and welfare of our children in England about FASD.\u00a0\r\nIf our children do not receive the appropriate Health Care this will impact on their future.\r\nFASD my daughters say should be more understood so that meetings \u00a0with staff should be less about explaining FASD and more about looking after their needs.\r\nHealth Professionals need to identify that this is a Life Long Condition, an external brain will be necessary for support throughout their lifetime, when parents are not there to protect and guide these young people.\r\n",
