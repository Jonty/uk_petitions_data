        "additional_details": "The game is up. The IPCC's climate modellers have been exposed as deliberately misleading the public by exaggerating the impact of global warming to further their own vested interests. The BBC is required by its charter to remain impartial and objective. This it has demonstrably failed to do. There is evidence of both commercial and political interference. We demand a public inquiry into the BBC's propagandising of the threat of Anthropological Global Warming.",
