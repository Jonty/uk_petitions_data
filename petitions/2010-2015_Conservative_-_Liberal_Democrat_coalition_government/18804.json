It is an outrage that a person will be banned from a nation for a mistake that he has paid for time and time again and is truly remorseful for. The action we want the government to take is to fully re-analyse their reasons for denying Chris Brown's entry to the United Kingdom and take into consideration his remorse, it was his first and only crime, the fact it wasn't seen as prison time worthy and the type of people the government has allowed into the country such as those with felonies for carrying or using a fire arm or knife - these are the type of people that would make the British public feel uneasy and unsafe.
