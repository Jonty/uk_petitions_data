        "additional_details": "The Americans are proposing a friendly fire incident against our banks over the Credit Crunch and the toxic debts which our nations have inherited from the 1980s from Mrs Thatcher selling off council houses at half market price.  This means that not only will we be suffering the same consequences that concern the Americans, but our banks will have that problem while being attacked by the USA as well.  The problem was not the fault of the banks who like everyone else are copying Mrs Thatcher.  Rebuilding the sold houses was not the solution.  Our allies should be informed of the cause of the problem so that we can all address that cause.\r\n",
