        "additional_details": "I want the law changed in regards to a child's birth certificate. My daughter has recently been taken by her father which now means she isn't at her school, her ballet. He has stopped me seeing her or being able to contact her. Now this as police and social services have told me is a cival matter which means i now have to pay 1000's of pounds to get my daughter back and back in school etc. This is all fine and he is left to destroy our lives including effect my daughters schooling because he is on the birth certificate, not the fact that i have brought her up all her life !! This needs to change my life will never be the same and my child will never get this time back in school etc !!!!! Please support my cause. I do not wish this shocking situation on any parent ",
