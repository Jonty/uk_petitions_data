        "additional_details": "Due too changes in 2010 to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, disciplinary offences and crimes under military law automatically carry over into civilian life.\r\n\r\nThis has caused Decorated Soldiers who have served this country on many operational tours to be refused Citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe minimum term to gain Citizenship is four years, with examples of one Fijian individual serving up to 13 years and being refused. In 13 years one situation arose, he pleaded guilty, served the punishment, paid the fine.\r\n\r\nWho can say in their right mind, in 13 years they've never done something wrong?\r\n\r\nThis individual has come to this country, served in four operational tours overseas fighting for this country. I wish I could say there are many British Born individuals that have a greater right to citizenship then he does.\r\n\r\nAs the UKBA is unable to deport 4000 foreign criminals from this country. Human Rights seems to be protecting them, where is the protection for our Decorated Soldiers?",
