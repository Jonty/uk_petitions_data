We further request that all Muslim brotherhood members and supporters be subjected to UK anti-terror laws.\r\nThis organisation has links with jihadist groups and terrorists and radical Muslim organisations all over the world.\r\nThe movement is known for engaging in political violence, claiming responsibility for the installation of radical group Hamas.\r\nThe Brotherhood's credo was and is, \"Jihad is our way; and death for the sake of Allah is the highest of our aspirations.\"\r\nThe Brotherhood's English language website describes the principles of the Muslim Brotherhood as including work to unify \"Islamic countries and states and liberating them from foreign imperialism\".\r\nWe believe that such radical, Islamist organisation has no place in the UK and does pose a real risk in spreading radical Islam in the UK and Europe.\r\n",
