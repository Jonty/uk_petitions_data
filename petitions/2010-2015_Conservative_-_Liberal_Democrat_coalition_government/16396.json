        "additional_details": "After the proposal by the Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond to create a single Scottish Police force, with the aim of pooling resources and saving public money, should the Government now look at forces throughout England and Wales and see whether the same policy can be adopted here. Consider the annual salary for a Chief Constable, their Deputy, and in some instances 3-4 Assistant Chief Constables; when you add annual bonuses this would amount to a figure in excess of \u00a3500,000 a year per force. Depending on the individual pay structure within that Force.\r\nThe Government must look at this proposal and give it serious consideration. Although there would be costs in implementing the changes in the short term; mid to long term those costs would be dwarfed by the savings that could be made.   ",
