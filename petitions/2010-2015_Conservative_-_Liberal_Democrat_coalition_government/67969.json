If England, Scotland and Northern Ireland had a majority in favour of leaving, but Wales had a majority in favour of staying, the vote as a whole should not be considered in favour of leaving.\r\n\r\nThis is absolutely necessary to help ensure that parts of the UK are not alienated and driven to division, and to make sure that if we take such a step that it is agreed to be the correct one by all of the UK's constituent parts.",
