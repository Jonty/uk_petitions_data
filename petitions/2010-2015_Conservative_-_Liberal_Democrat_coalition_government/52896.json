This should cover both the supply chain and the construction of our schools, hospitals and other public funded projects. Construction companies partnering with irresponsible suppliers should be omitted from tendering for public funded contracts.\r\n\r\nIf this is not legal then make it so, alternatively request that using tax responsible companies should be encouraged at every opportunity and will work in the countries interest increasing tax revenue and funding more projects.\r\n\r\nI request that a letter be sent to all companies tendering for public funded projects reminding them of their responsibilities to the country.\r\n\r\nNO TAX REVENUE = LESS PROJECTS",
