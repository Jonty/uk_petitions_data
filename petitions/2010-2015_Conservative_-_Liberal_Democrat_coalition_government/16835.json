        "additional_details": "This title has been gifted to the heir apparent to the monarch of the United Kingdom. It is not a fitting title as Wales is a country, not a principality and the heir to the British throne is usually an Englishman with no vested interest in the neighbouring ancient country. England should not be represented by an individual holding a title denoting leadership of another country, Princes William or Harry would not be considered better representatives if they held titles such as \u201cLord of Australia\u201d or \u201cEmperor of Canada\u201d, the United Kingdom must be represented to the world as one entity, but her monarchy should be proud of their English heritage, there is no reason they should be associated with the history of national cousins. As Wales devolves it seems suitable that the title be removed and replaced with the title of \"Prince of Great Britain\" which would encompass the true duties of a representative of the entire Untied Kingdom, instead of the devolved nations of which it comprises.",
