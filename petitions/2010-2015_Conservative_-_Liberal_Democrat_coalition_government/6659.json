        "additional_details": "The government has over 140, 000 credit cards [known as procurement cards] through out all departments and quangos; they currently account for around \u00a31 BILLION per annum of tax payers money. They were supposed to be used to ease the procurement of small items such as stationary etc. although have been used recklessly for indulgence in hotels and restaurants, luxurious breaaks and even shopping sprees on web sites such as Amazon and other high street stores running up bills to the sum of around \u00a3500, 000.\r\n\r\nMany of the cards which have a monthly limit, although the cards used by civil servants in higher echelons [reportedly] do not have a set limit.\r\n\r\nThere can be no rational explanation as to why there are so many in use nor can they be scrutinised easily as a result of the number in use.\r\n\r\nTherefore a thorough review needs to be undertaken.",
