This group of terrorists have damaged our personal properties, belongings and communities.\r\n\r\nI appeal to every person of every race, of every faith within the United Kingdom to help get the EDL off our streets immediately. We cannot live our lives in constant fear of our family and friends being attacked by the EDL (English Defence League).\r\n\r\nIt is time to take a stand against the EDL (English Defence League) as citizens of United Kingdom. It is time to banish terrorism from our streets. It is time for our views and opinions to be heard in rebuilding our communities and our nation.\r\n",
