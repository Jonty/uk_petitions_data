The UK Government is backing a ban not on welfare grounds but on ethical grounds but the ethics of the animal rights lobby, We believe that a good regulation system is in place to protect the welfare of the animals and that welfare reasons should be the only reason for a ban, as they are no welfare grounds and a ban is not supported by the scientific evidence a ban should not be put in place.",
