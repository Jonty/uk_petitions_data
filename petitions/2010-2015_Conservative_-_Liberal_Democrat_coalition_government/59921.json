        "additional_details": "At present supermarkets destroy vast amounts of food that have passed their sell-by date or which do not look aesthetically pleasing. These foods are not unfit for human consumption and rather than being destroyed should be made available to charities for distribution to the poor and in particularly the homeless. These groups of people do not have the money to spend in the supermarkets anyway, and since the food has passed its sell-by date cannot be sold, so the supermarkets are not going to lose any money by doing so anyway. It will also gain the supermarkets good publicity and popularity by acting in such a socially responsible manner.",
