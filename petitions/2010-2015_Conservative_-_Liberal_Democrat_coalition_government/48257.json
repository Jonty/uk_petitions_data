        "additional_details": "Potters Syndrome is described as a collection of abnormalities developed during pregnancy which means that the baby is 'incompatable with life' once delivered\r\nAs a family, we knew nothing about Potters Syndrome until last year, when our beautiful Charlie Arthur Curtis was diagnosed whilst in utero. We explored the subject and found that there is very little research or support for families in the UK.\r\nWe want to raise awareness of this condition and hopefully initiate some support or research into it.",
