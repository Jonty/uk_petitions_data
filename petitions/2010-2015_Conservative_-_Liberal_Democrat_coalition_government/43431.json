        "action": "Denationalise the BBC and abolish television licences",
        "additional_details": "The BBC, and BBC News in particular, holds many bigoted viewpoints regarding religion, culture, political affiliation and philosophy that children are being brainwashed with.  The UK boasts a large number of broadcasters and given that the Britain is supposedly a democratic nation, would it not be democratic to allow equality of opportunity regarding broadcasting and the media? The privatisation of the BBC and thus allowing other broadcasters to prosper would also contribute to solving the national deficit.\r\n\r\nTelevision Licences are as out of place, undemocratic and as unfair as it would be introduce an Internet licence. The fact that we have to pay the BBC and therefore the government to watch independent broadcasters such as ITV is outrageous.\r\n\r\nI propose that the BBC should come under denationalisation ASAP with shares being offered to the public. As well as this, the licence fee, a charge that hits the poor in society the hardest, should be immediately abolished. ",
