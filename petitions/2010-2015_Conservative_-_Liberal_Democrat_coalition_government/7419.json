        "additional_details": "With the appalling civil disorder experienced in London and elsewhere over the past few days the Police need an effective way to disperse crowds and let those bent on civil disorder know the consequences of remaining on the streets. The current Public Order Act 1986 does not adequately allow the authorities to achieve their ultimate responsibilty to safeguard the Public and their property.\r\n\r\nThe Riot Act once read allowed crowds one hour to disperse and if after one hour there was no dispersal anyone left on the streets faced arrest and a minimum 3 years prison. It also allowed Police or authorities to use physical force to clear streets.\r\n\r\nThis leaves no doubt in the mind of those involved or in situ as to where they stand and what the possible consequences are. It would also reassure the public that the authorities have the power to restore order.\r\n\r\nReading The Riot Act 2012 could be effectively communicated across all forms of media, including Twitter!",
