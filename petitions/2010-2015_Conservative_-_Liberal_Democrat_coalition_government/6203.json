The only right fathers have at present is to try and find the thousands of pounds needed in legal fees to try and apply/enforce rights. It's time this changed and fathers had automatic rights legally recognised without having to pay for them. The govenment\\courts need to change their attitude towards fathers and recognise their automatic rights, and force the courts to take action automatically where those rights are breached",
