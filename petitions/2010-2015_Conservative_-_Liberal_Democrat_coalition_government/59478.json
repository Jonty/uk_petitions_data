        "additional_details": "Architects have to study for up to 7 years ahead of sitting final examinations to a professional level. A course much longer than most courses at university. The costs of study take years to pay back and some students may never clear their debt.  Working through the day the Architect is expected to have a firm grasp of several different disciplines across the construction industry. The responsibilities an architect carries far out way the salary received. The country is going to run out of Architects as there is little incentive to study this dying profession.\r\nIf you agree that Architects deserve more then please sign this petition.\r\n",
