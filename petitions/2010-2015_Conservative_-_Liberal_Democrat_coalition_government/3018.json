I want the government to automatically recognise the sacrifice made by our injuried military personel and automatically have in place the start of their military pension upon recognition of their injury. I am an ex serving soldier who sustained massive leg injuries but it has taken me 20+ years to get recognised for the injuries sustained before a pension was awarded, then it was only awarded thanks to the hard work of SAFFA, ABF, RBL and the Veterans Agency. Please get the pension automatically issued due to injury?",
