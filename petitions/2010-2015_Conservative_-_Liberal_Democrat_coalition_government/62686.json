        "additional_details": "We request an official inquiry and investigation into the ideology and doctrine of all major religions of the UK with the collaboration of these religion's respective leading authorities to identify controversial texts that may influence extremist activities.\r\n\r\nThese texts should be scrutinised and examined and subsequently modified with the permission of these religion's leading authorities. If this is deemed to be blasphemous, then appropriate education and teaching should be undertaken in places-of-worship to explain why these controversial-verses may be inappropriate in contemporary Britain and contradict secular values such as freedom, safety and tolerance.\r\n\r\nReligion often provides justification for people to commit atrocities in the name of God. These reprehensible individuals are predominantly motivated by their religion, regardless of what the politically-correct might say.",
