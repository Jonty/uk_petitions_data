A large number of F1 teams are based in the UK and the country employs a large number of people in the industry.  The BBC is well known as the leading broadcaster in the world and has provided incredible F1 coverage for years - to go to Sky is a disgrace.  Please keep F1 on the BBC - we need to retain the British legacy of this incredible sport.",
