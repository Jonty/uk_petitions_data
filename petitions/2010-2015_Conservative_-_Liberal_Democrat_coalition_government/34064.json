The bill was introduced by Rt Hon Barbara Keeley.\r\n\r\nThe care covers that provided for mental health, chronic and short term illnesses, and also for permanent disabilities.  These people save the country countless millions at the expense of their own mental and physical well being.\r\n\r\nThe act is to be re-introduced at the stage it had previously reached, and be allowed to reach the statute book.",
