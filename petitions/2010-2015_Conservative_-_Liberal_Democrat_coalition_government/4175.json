        "action": "Ban agricultural vehicles from main roads during peak hours",
        "additional_details": "All agricultural vehicles (and any other large vehicles incapable of doing 60 mph) should be banned from using A and B-roads during the peak hours of 8am - 6pm). In the summer when these vehicles are most active (and cause the most disruption) they have access to up to 8 hours of daylight outside of these times. There should also be a new licensing system brought in with strict criteria to limit regular journeys undertaken by these vehicles (weekly or more frequent) on all minor roads during these peak hours. These provisions will regulate and reduce the unnecessary burden forced upon the vast majority of road users by the actions of the selfish few. Road safety will also undoubtedly be improved significantly.",
