        "additional_details": "Sergent Talaiasi Labalaba died in an heroic manner whilst manning a 25 Pdr field gun single handed whilst facing a force of 300+ Communist insurgents.\r\n\r\nThis intense action took place in the small fishing village of Mirbat in the Sultanate of Oman on 19th July 1974. By his single handed effort, the sergeant held the enemy back long enough for his fellow SAS comrades to organise a defence\r\n\r\nSergeant Labalaba was awarded a posthumous \"Mention in Dispatches\" for his action, however, we the supporters of this e-petition feel that he due to his courageous sacrifice, he should be awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.",
