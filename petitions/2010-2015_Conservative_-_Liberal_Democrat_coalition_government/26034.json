Keep the structure if you like but give them proper identities (HM Coastguard, Department for Communities, HM Border Guard). Whilst you are at it give them proper symbols (Crown, Heraldic Crest, Capital letters) and not some modern squiggle or line which has no reference to the country or government.",
