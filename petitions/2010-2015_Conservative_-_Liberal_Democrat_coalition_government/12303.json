        "additional_details": "The basic idea behind the Big Society is admirable - everyone working together to make this world a better place to live in. However, Politicians are too removed from the struggles faced by the people they represent. It is impossible for an MP to properly represent his/her constituency without contributing to the social programs that will drive the Big Society. I am petitioning for community involvement to be a core objective of every MP and their staff whereby pay and right to office is partly dependent upon their success in contributing to community-based projects. I want to see MPs working for voluntary organisations and experiencing life from the viewpoint of the people they represent. This would involve dedicating at least 2 working days every month to a local organisation. Leadership by example is important. If you want the people of this country to take it seriously and not see it as a sly cost cutting exercise, they you need to put your money when your mouth is.\r\n",
