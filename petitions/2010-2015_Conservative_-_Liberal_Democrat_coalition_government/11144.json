        "additional_details": "England is more densely populated than any major European country.  The UK population is forecast to grow by ten million over the next fifteen years.  This has consequences for housing availability, provision of services, traffic and transport congestion, loss of green spaces and wildlife habitat, pollution and emissions, and future food and energy security.  We call on the government to set up a Royal Commission to consider the consequences of continued population growth in the UK and make recommendations on how such growth can be reduced. ",
