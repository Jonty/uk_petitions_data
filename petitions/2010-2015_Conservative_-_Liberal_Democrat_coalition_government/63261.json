        "additional_details": "If someone is given a drunk and disorderly adult cation it should be completely removed from their criminal record after 5 years. Provided it was an isolated incident and the person has not committed another offence. A Police caution for drunk and disorderly are a black mark on someones record that creates a lot of problems when applying for jobs. It is particularly important now as many young people in the UK have had this happened to them. These young people are the UK\u2019s future  and a simple mistake when you are at the grey area between being a young adult and adolescent discovering about alcohol for the first time should not inhibit what has the potential to be a great career.",
