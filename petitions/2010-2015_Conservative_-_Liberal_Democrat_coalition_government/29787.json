This has the potential of doubling the fees for students.\r\nEmployers value this courses and many will pay the fees for their employees but some may not be able to do so. People who wish to change their career will obviously not get the fees paid.\r\nThe courses are at the same academic level (and pass marks are at 50% instead of 40%) as university qualifications but only university students are elegible for Student Loans. This is unfair and will, ultimately. affect the competiveness of the UK.",
