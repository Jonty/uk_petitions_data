        "additional_details": "Working people pay to subsidise NHS Dentists' training and salaries yet most NHS Dentists work only 9-5 and no weekends which requires  the majority of working people to take time off to see them - if they are not allowed that time off, which is common, then they have no access to NHS treatment. This is intolerable. All NHS Dental Surgeries should be required to provide a dentist on at least two weekday evenings and at least one day each weekend.",
