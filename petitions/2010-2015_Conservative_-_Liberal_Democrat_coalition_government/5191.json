        "additional_details": "In the Lib Dems and Tory Election 2010 Manifestos both parties promised to save the Great British Pub. David Cameron even promised a pub friendly government yet so far the Coalition has raised the duty above inflation and 6 pubs are calling last orders everyday and can not afford any more tax and redtape. The pub and alcohol trade industry brings in an estimated 11.4 billion a year and has been a unique part of the British culture for centuries and contrary to some forms of media they are not like a Wild West Saloon and need to be preserved but will need help from the government please sign this petitio.",
