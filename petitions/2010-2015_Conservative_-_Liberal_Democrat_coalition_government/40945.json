        "additional_details": "the children of the baby boom post war era are beginning to take their state pensions, leading to a large burden on the employed sector. Would it be feasible for those of us aged between 60 and 65 to take an earlier , reduced state pension. For instance if at age 63 I was offered a pension of 90% of my potential entitlement at 65, I would be tempted to take that, and change to part time working. This would give increased income to pensioners, yielding more tax and spending power. It would also free up jobs for the unemployed, taking them off benefits, giving them more spending power, and providing tax for the treasury.",
