        "additional_details": "The 30% tax would be paid by all banks and financial institutions that have exhibited excessive corporate greed or shown reluctance to lend to small businesses. They would then have to explain to shareholders why they are in this tax band and what they intend to do about it.\r\nThe 15% tax would be paid by all other businesses as a unwritten contract with the the Government that in exchange they create more jobs, particularly for the young.\r\nThis relatively simple tax change would create massive incentives for small business, curb excess greed, create more jobs thereby increasing income tax collected, reduce unemployment and reduce social welfare payments.",
