        "additional_details": "Outside of Derby Moor Community Sports College, there is a serious problem regarding road safety on Moorway Lane both in the morning before school commences and, more seriously at collection time (3.20). There have been multiple, minor accidents due to the heavy traffic outside the school. Although many have gone un-reported, due to the desperate rush to get home, they show a severe threat to the pupil's safety. Currently the staff at the school are having to act as 'safety wardens', something that is not in their job description, to enable the pupils to cross safely. However, the introduction of a zebra crossing on Moorway Lane would create a safe environment where less staff are needed and there is less risk of an accident occurring. We would like Derby City Council to place a zebra crossing outside of Derby Moor as we feel it would enhance the safety of not only the pupils, but the people living in the community around the school.",
