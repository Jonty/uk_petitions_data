Criminals have nothing to fear at this time, a bit of hard questioning never hurt anyone, and they know it. However if you go out to steal and are armed in any fashion, knife or pistol, then knowing you may lose you life may be a deterrent. The Police must be prepared to use the weapons when issued, this is a training matter.\r\n\r\n There is no reason our police are not. Take the war to the criminals do not let them take it to us. Why should the criminals have all the say, it is time our police were given the authority and ability to fight back. Police should also be given powers to deal with seriouse crimes and have 0 tolerance towards any and have the full backing from the government Society must change its views and stop being soft on crime.
