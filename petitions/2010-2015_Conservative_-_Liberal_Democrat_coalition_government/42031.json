        "additional_details": "In line with the Prime Minister's desire to remove unneccessary red tape and appeals against local development, I support the proposal to transform RAF Brize Norton in the Witney parliamentary constituency into the new international hub airport which the nation desperately needs in this time of 'economic war', a time we have not faced as a nation since the dark days of 1940. I propose that local objections and planning restrictions be quickly swept aside to facilitate this ambitious project, for which I propose the name David Cameron International Airport, in honour of the man who made it possible.",
