But Demand the government restrict the FA from acting as investigator, judge and jury relating to non-footballing matters. It is not the FAs business to judge and punish players on criminal matters especially as they do not hold to the same high standards of behaviour as the courts. As highlighted by the recent Luis Suarez case were players good name has been destroyed on the balance of probabilities. No person in the history of British justice has been convicted or had their good name Besmirched on the balance of probabilities in the court system. Simply because this low standard of evidence would lead to many miscarriages of justice.",
