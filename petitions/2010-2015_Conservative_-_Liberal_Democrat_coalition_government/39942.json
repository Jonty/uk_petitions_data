        "additional_details": "Palm Oil is in 1 out of 10 products in our supermarkets.  The rainforest is being destroyed in order to plant this 'sustainable crop'.  We had no say in adding it to our petrol but we can choose not to have it in our food, scouring all the small print is not sufficient as sometimes it is only labelled as 'vegetable oil'.  This is where the government should help, ensuring it is clearly labelled on the front of our food.  Alternatively I'm calling for the government to put their support in an 'Orangutan' or 'Jungle Friendly' motif on products not containing Palm Oil - similar to the 'Dolphin Friendly' motif.\r\n\r\nThe jungle, particularly in Asia, is being cut down for this crop, destroying the homes of some of the most endangered animals on our planet: Orangutans, Tigers and Rhinos to name a few, as well as the forest itself.\r\n\r\nFurthermore this might encourage businesses to use our locally grown oil such as rape seed to support our farmers at home.",
