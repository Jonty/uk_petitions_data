This will ensure fair unbiased treatment & recognition of all former Prime Ministers & Speakers regardless of political party affinities & persuasions. Of course if a former PM or Speaker was ousted, resign or impeached in disgrace due committing serious offences, then the House of Commons should decide whether or not they should automatically knighted & made members of the Order of the Garter.
