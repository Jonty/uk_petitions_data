        "additional_details": "There is currently a massive shortage of social housing available across North Wales with waiting lists bursting at the seams as families suffering from the effects of the current financial climate are being priced out of the private rental market with ever increasing rental prices, huge deposits and restrictions on acceptance. People are forced into social housing where demand is far above the amount of available properties.\r\n1. more social housing needs to be built\r\n2. government funded LHA's need to readdress their  acceptance policies\r\n3. private landlords and letting agencies must be lobbied to accept applicant's in reciept of benefits, lower their deposits or make them payable over a period of time instead of up-front and rents need to be lowered or the government needs to increase the amount of housing benefit in line with current rental prices",
