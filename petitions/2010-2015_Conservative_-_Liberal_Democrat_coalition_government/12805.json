        "additional_details": "The government should Scrap the Department for International Development and because we live in a developed world but we need more money to tackle the problems facing the UK from gang culture to immigration.\r\n\r\nIn 2009/10 total GPEX (Gross Public Expenditure on Development) was \u00a37,767m.This is too much!\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that Aid doesn't help those that are recieving it but instead makes life worse for the recipient because they become heavily reliant on Aid while ignoring their own economy.Look at the economies of S.Korea and S.Africa and then look at how much aid they were recieving to see.\r\n\r\nThe Money that could be saved by scraping DfID should be used in a more effective manner for example: lessening or even reversing the looming police cuts,making schemes for young people to stop them getting sucked into gang culture and keep them off the streets or the money could be used by the MoD to help our troops in Afghanistan by buying new top of the range equipment.",
