        "additional_details": "In virtually every case a prison sentence given will not be served in full. In most cases a third or a half will be cut off. In some cases even more. It appears that sentences are given to keep the general public quiet, in the full knowledge of the court that a large percentage will never be served. The courts should be honest and give an actual sentence that will be served. In cases of poor behaviour sentences should be increased. Stop trying to hide the truth.",
