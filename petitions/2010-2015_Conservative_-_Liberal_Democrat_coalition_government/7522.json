The ordinary, law-abiding citizen feels, with good reason, abandoned, unprotectected and unsupported by politicians and the police.  Bring in the army, or use water-cannon or whatever means are appropriate to put a stop immediately to the indiscriminate and unjustified rioting, violence and looting.  The current approach is obviously not working, just as the criminals are evolving new methods of organisation (facebook, twitter, blackberry messaging), so must our law enforcers adapt to changing circumstances.
