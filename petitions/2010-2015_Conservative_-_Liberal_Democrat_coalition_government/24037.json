No more \u2018Non Dom\u2019s\u2019 or Bankers holding UK government to ransom over moving to tax free havens.\r\nThis is already in force for all US citizens. They pay taxes irrespective of where they live. They may deduct any taxes paid where they live from their tax bills. Many other countries have the same policy.\r\n\r\nFair tax for all British Citizens!\r\n",
