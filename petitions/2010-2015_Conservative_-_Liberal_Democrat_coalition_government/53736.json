        "additional_details": "Will the government watch developments and even collaborate with Elon Musk's Hyperloop idea he will set out this week?\r\n\r\nHe's releasing the plans as open source and would like to see collaboration on the project. Much the same as our HS2 project, the Hyperloop is being proposed as a faster more efficient mode of transport and would hopefully be cheaper than high speed rail which despite huge expense is not a leap forward in technology or journey time.\r\n\r\nIt's time for the country to lead on innovation! If we mastered this we could implement it all over the world too. Please sign this and at least get it discussed, that would be a great first step.",
