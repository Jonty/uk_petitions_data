        "additional_details": "Given that vital services are being slashed in the name of austerity I find it hard to justify the royal family not being subject to the same level of austerity as public services, particularly in light of their already extortionate levels of wealth and their status as \"face of the nation\".\r\n\r\nIf we really are \"All in it together\" then it doesn't seem unreasonable to expect Kate Middleton to spend \u00a320,000 of taxpayers money a year on clothes as opposed to \u00a335,000. Perhaps Prince Charles can have two chauffeurs as opposed to three?\r\nThere are clear areas where money could be saved, and it seems perverse to exclude the royal family from the austerity measures while demonising benefit claimants.\r\n\r\nI'd like an independent, unsentimental analysis of the royal family's expenditure and whether it really is as essential to UK business and enterprise as it is claimed to be. If not then the Royal Family should see their pocket money reduced in line with cuts across other public services.",
