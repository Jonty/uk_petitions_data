The idea is to educate the public on the effects of the use and over-use of digital technology and allow a day to take part in activities that wouldn't otherwise be available, and that preserve the tradition and culture of non-screen based activities in a society where heavy usage of digital devices is becoming increasingly acceptable. Emphasis would be on encouraging schools, colleges, universities, businesses and public sector organisations to be involved in social, sporting and musical activities alongside distribution of educational materials, much in the same way the Change4Life initiative tackles the idea of unhealthy eating.",
