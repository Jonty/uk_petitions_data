        "additional_details": "In the education system today, an hour a week is set aside to educate students on the importance of eating healthy, exercising, and safe sex. But there is little to no education on the importance of, and how to have good mental health,and the different types of mental illnesses. Often, the only way people know about mental illnesses is unfortunately through personal experience, or through stigma in society.\r\n\r\nIf pupils are better informed, they can learn how to keep mentally healthy, and hopefully be more aware and educated about mental illnesses that they are very likely to come into contact with, whether they have it themselves or a member of the family or friend. It could also reduce the dependancy on the NHS which the mental health services are already under.\r\n\r\n",
