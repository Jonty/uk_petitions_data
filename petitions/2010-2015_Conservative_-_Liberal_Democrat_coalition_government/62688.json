        "additional_details": "Breast cancer is the commonest cancer in women and the second most common cause of cancer deaths in this group. 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer during their lifetime - the chances of you knowing a sufferer of breast cancer are high. Over the last several decades the 5 year survival for breast cancer has risen to 85%.\r\n\r\nThe key to successful treatement is early diagnosis. Studies have shown women who are taught about risk awareness and self examination have a better knowledge of the disease which could help them present earlier and attend screening in future.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that introduction of a formal teaching programme in secondary schools (year 11) and/or sixth form colleges coverin breast cancer awareness, risk factor reduction and self examination could help women present at an earlier stage in their disease. A single intervention of 30 minutes to an hour is all that may be needed to help improve awareness is young women and provide them with skills for life.",
