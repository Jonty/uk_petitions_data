The disability discrimination provisions in the Equality Act 2010 place a duty on those providing a service to the public not to discriminate against them.\r\n\r\nService providers are also required to make a \u2018reasonable adjustment\u2019, so that disabled people are not placed at a \u201csubstantial disadvantage\u201d compared to non-disabled people.  However, the Act only requires adjustments that are reasonable in all the circumstances of a particular situation - and what is reasonable will vary from one situation to another, as factors like the practicability of making the adjustment, the cost of the adjustment, and the resources available to individual organisations will vary.   This is something the Council has to decide."
