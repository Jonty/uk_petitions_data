        "additional_details": "The epetition system is the method that more people are familiar with than any other for raising issues with government, and provides a method by which the popularity of any nomination can be judged (which is not the case with the existing system).\r\nIt is perverse to not allow nominations for honours to be made through the epetitions system, and this needs to change.\r\n\r\nI note particularly the number of rejected epetitions nominating Stephen Sutton for an honour, which is a case which does not have the luxury of time for a decision, yet which could hardly be any more deserving of a major honour (I would suggest a knighthood - people have received them for far less, and in considerably easier circumstances).",
