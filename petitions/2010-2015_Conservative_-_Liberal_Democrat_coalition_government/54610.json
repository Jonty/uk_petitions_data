        "additional_details": "Government has to intervene and get CPS  to overturn not to prosecute 2 doctors prepared to carry out illegal abortions based on gender. CPS say its not in public interest to pursue. There is enough evidence to prosecute, but CPS wants General Medical Council to deal with it.  This is wrong.  A law has been broken and this should go to court not to the GMC. This sets a dangerous precedent which could allow medical professionals to use this as a way of making money from this illegal practice with the knowledge that the CPS will probably not prosecute them.  This could open up a dangerous illegal abortion circuit in the UK.  Morally this is also wrong.  We are critical of other countries who turn a blind eye to this practice, are we now going to allow it to happen here?  Jeremy Hunt has already voiced his concerns, this is not enough, the public want these doctors prosecuted, they have broken the law.  Let the GMC take any further action on top of this not in place of the CPS.",
