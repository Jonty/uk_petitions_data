        "additional_details": "Agricultural land and areas of scenic and environmental importance are being covered in wind turbines, which have a very quiestionable reliability when it comes to generating 'renewable' energy.  We are losing areas that are important for food production and are ruining the appearence of one of the UK's most important assets, its unique environment.  Rather than contributing to community benefit windfarms are only to profit landowners and utility companies, whilst increasing our fuel bills to extortionate levels.  The utility companies in question are largely based outside the UK so they are happy to ruin our countryside whilst taking our money and spending it on themselves.  Why not install small turbines, solar panels, heat pumps etc in households and let us generate our own energy? ",
