        "additional_details": "Political parties should demonstrate their popular support by voluntarily restricting their funding solely to standard membership fees from individual UK citizens.\r\n\r\nThis would remove the questions over influences from other means of donations and the expectation that taxpayers guarantee their funding, no matter how many members they attract.\r\n\r\nIf any party is unwilling to take voluntary action within six months of the end date of this petition, then the government should introduce legislation as a matter of urgency to make funding solely from membership fees a mandatory requirement for all political parties registered with the Electoral Commission.  That legislation should allow a transition period of a further six months.\r\n\r\nIf any party fails to comply within that period, it will be removed automatically from the register and all of its remaining funds distributed equally amongst its existing members, with no right to establish another another party within five years.",
