A Federal Structure is what suggests, and the Union of the Europeans the model for it. Irrespective of size of population in each country such a Union of the British would be a Union of Equals. The English would no longer dominate. In matters of interest and concern to the people of the islands as a whole unanimity would be required. There would be vetoes where appropriate.",
