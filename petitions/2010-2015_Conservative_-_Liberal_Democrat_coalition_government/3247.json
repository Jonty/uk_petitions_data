        "additional_details": "We are all aware that Smoking is the cause of many health issues and therefore a major cost to the NHS. Many will argue that such a law would be unpoliceable and to some extent you must agree with this. However even if there were no prosecutions for many years it would decrease the amount of smoking and pave the way for a total ban in 2 or 3 generations time. England should lead the way for the rest of the world to follow. Why are we allowing our children the choice of whether to smoke or not? The Goverment should make smoking illegal for anyone born on or after 1.1.2013. This would allow those who are addicted to make their own decision.",
