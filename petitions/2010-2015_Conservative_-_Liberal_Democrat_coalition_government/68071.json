        "additional_details": "Putney High Street has the worst NOx in Europe and is more congested than Oxford Street. It\u2019s clear that the constant Stream of cars and buses idling on our high street is the key cause for this pollution.\r\nMy proposal is that when repair works are complete, Putney Bridge is only reopened to cycle, bus and taxi traffic. This will substantially reduce traffic on the High street as we\u2019ve observed over recent weeks. No doubt the general concern will be that this would create congestion elsewhere. The fact is if we want cleaner air, we have to limit traffic in our cities.\r\nWandsworth Council\u2019s efforts to improve air quality so far has been to plant saplings in small holes in the pavement and ask TFL to bring slightly less polluting buses into operation. It\u2019s not enough. The fact is that those buses still sit idling on the high street in queues of traffic. It\u2019s time to take positive steps to clean up our High Street.\r\nClose the bridge to cars.",
