Many have also been known to fake the standardised test and/or get a note from a private consultant in order to be awarded extra and/or a laptop.\r\nNew, much tougher tests must be bought in so as to give extra time/ laptops to those who actually deserve it rather than those who cite 'petty' excuses such as \"poor handwriting\" or \"sore hand\" as this obscures those who really are at a disadvantage.\r\nEnd the injustice ",
