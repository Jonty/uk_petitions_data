        "additional_details": "We would like the government to ignore the proposal to introduce mandatory ID cards for voters.\r\n\r\nA compulsory ID card has every opportunity to discriminate against the poorest. There may be people unable to part with the money required to obtain one.\r\n\r\nVoter attendance is a pitiful thing to behold and this will only create one more barrier for an already disenfranchised public.\r\n\r\nThen there is privacy. We are aware today just how sensitive our personal information is but this isn't another piece of our data flowing out; it is one we will be forced to give. Can the Government guarantee that information collected will be safe and not misused?\r\n\r\nThere is the point made in the report itself that voter fraud, the crime these cards are intended to stop, rarely, if ever, actually occurs. If this Government is intent on fixing this society then it should not be focussing on problems that don't exist.\r\n\r\nAnd how much will this cost? Can the country afford to fix a problem it doesn\u2019t have?",
