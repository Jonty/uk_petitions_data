        "additional_details": "The British Dietetic Association\u2019s \u201cMind the Hunger Gap\u201d campaign highlights that an estimated one million older people in the UK eat less than one meal a day.  Poverty, social isolation and fragmented services have left many older people, excluded and invisible.  This is a major public health issue and the Campaign will focus particularly on the plight of the older and the vulnerable living in our communities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis scandalous \u201chunger gap\u201d contributes to the massive problem of malnutrition that impacts on people regardless of age, gender or race, costing the NHS over \u00a313 billion \u2013 twice the burden of obesity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport this petition and call upon government and politicians to protect at least one meal a day by ring-fencing funding to ensure that meal provision continues to lie at the heart of community care.",
