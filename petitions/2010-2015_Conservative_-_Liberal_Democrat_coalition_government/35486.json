        "additional_details": "A Bill which provides development funding grants relating  to new inventions to be provided in a form of  a financial coupon that can be awarded by THE INVENTOR direct to his or her chosen technology transfer partner. This will make universities much more responsive to the original inventors time scales and the immediacy required by inventors who very often find universities and the like often have little practical experience of operating a day to day business and are rather disdainful to the inventors original approach.  Inventors often have to wait weeks rather than days for a sensible reply to a phone call for a joint-development approach. Universities have a great deal to learn about how inventors actually operate, the sooner they do so, the faster inventions can be developed through to market.",
