        "additional_details": "Proposal to reform party political funding using an intermediary organisation eg OXFAM to hold donations in escrow to be released after a delayed period of at least six months and distributed anonymously to target political party thereby minimising the risk that large donations have undue influence on politicians and policy making.  Any interest earned whilst money is held in escrow can be used to administer the scheme and any remaining profit to be used as humanitarian aid.",
