We need to make a stand against these corporate shills and show them that we will not stand for it any more.\r\n\r\nWe are forced to pay high taxes, astronomically high petrol and energy prices and to expect low wages in this economical \"crisis\" whilst these unbelievably rich people get away with murder.\r\n\r\nIt's time to take a stand\r\n\r\nThe government won't actually do anything about this, as they themselves are tax dodgers and are in bed with most of the corporations.\r\n\r\nBut we need to inform people in our local communities, educate them about what is going on right under our noses. And make a stand, together\r\n\r\n",
