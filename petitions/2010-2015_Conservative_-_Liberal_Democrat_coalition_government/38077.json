        "additional_details": "I think that care for all hospital patients should entail 24 hour care and a Senior Doctor- not a Junior- and also a Consultant should be on site 24/7 365 days. The government pay enough for salaries and should now bring in a shift system that does allow full support by qualified Senior staff to be available at ALL times and not just Monday til Friday 9am til 3pm. Make show Doctors and Consultants earn their salary as it is impossible to gt the relevant care if it is a weekend or a Bank Holiday. The public must be supported at all times- NI is paid for this very system",
