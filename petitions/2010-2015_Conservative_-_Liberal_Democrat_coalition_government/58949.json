        "additional_details": "The Education Funding Agency notified further education colleges of a cut in funding of 17.5% for 18 year olds from September 2014.\r\n\r\nThis cut will affect students from disadvantaged areas and black, minority and ethnic groups. The majority of 18 year-olds who need to complete further study programmes before progressing to work, apprenticeships or higher education will be students who left school with relatively low attainment. The reasons for low prior attainment are many and varied, but include issues such as ill health, poor teaching at school, difficult personal circumstances, recent arrival in the UK, behavioural/mental health issues, at risk of offending, excluded from school.  These young people are the very most vulnerable in the country.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to urge the Government not to implement this cut in funding.",
