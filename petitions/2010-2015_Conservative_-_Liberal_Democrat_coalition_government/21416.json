        "additional_details": "A change in constitution that resticts a coalition government to a maximum of 2 years instead of 5 years. The reason being that no one party won sufficient to rule the country, so a coalition government cannot assume to have the support of the majority of the people. The nation should have an opportunity to form a majority government after just 2 years. This ruling would not apply in times of war.",
