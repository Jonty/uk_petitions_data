        "additional_details": "The Wakefield Express is calling on Prime Minister David Cameron to overturn the decision not to grant legal aid funding to the families of Robert and Christianne Shepherd to allow them to be legally represented at the inquest into their children\u2019s deaths in Corfu in 2006.\r\nAfter eight years the family still do not know the truth about their children\u2019s deaths.\r\nThe coroner, David Hinchliff, has promised a full and fearless investigation.\r\nBut without legal representation the family may not get the answers they so desperately need.\r\nThomas Cook, the world\u2019s oldest tour operator, tried to stop the inquest and called for it to take place without a jury.\r\nThe company can afford to be legally represented and we feel that the families of Robert and Christianne should be afforded that same right.\r\nWithout this, lessons which could save another life being lost abroad may not be learned.\r\nThis is not acceptable",
