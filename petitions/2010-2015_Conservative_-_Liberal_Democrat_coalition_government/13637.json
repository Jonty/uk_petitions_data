        "action": "Increase tax on top 5% of earners",
        "additional_details": "The top 5% of earners combined income is so large that increasing their tax contributions would have a huge benefit to governments funding. Rather than making 95% of people suffer by cutting police, bus services, education, etc, let the top earners pay a few % more. The top earners do not need that few percent and can still live lives of luxury. This tax increase could be applied to the personal incomes of the top earners, not to the business profits so that growth is not harmed.\r\n\r\nThe top earners simply do not need that money, whereas the rest of the population does need it for funding police and other essential services.\r\n\r\nIncreasing the top earners contributions is an obvious and logical solution. The difficulty in this is that the people with the money, also have the power to influence the politicians. It does not matter what your political beliefs are, this is just about what is the right thing to do for the good of the nation.",
