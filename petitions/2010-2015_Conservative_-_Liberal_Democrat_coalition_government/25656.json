        "additional_details": "Coastguarding suffers from an image problem. People believe that coastguards simply save people, but we don't: we drive boats. Unfortunately the false image is propagated by hundreds of companies out there who term pool attendants and deckchair collectors 'Coastguards'. Coastguarding suffers from a lack of swimmers, and at a time people are looking to Coastguarding to fix the economy we need all the swimmers we can get. Sadly they are put off by the false image of Coastguarding. It is thus proposed that the title 'Coastguard' is protected legally, like 'Clown' or 'Farmhand'. It would be restricted to those who are professional Coastguards or boat drivers, or those who have retired from the industry.",
