        "additional_details": "Residents of Lincoln are all too familiar with the long waits for pedestrians at level crossings within the city. If the wait (sometimes for up to half an hour) wasn't bad enough, it is made worse by members the crowd who decide to light up a cigarette.\r\nThe crowds tend to grow quite large and compacted so it is difficult to move away from the smokers, so although it is in an outside area, it is still a nuisance and non-smoking members of the general public are unwillingly affected by this.\r\nI am petitioning for a no-smoking zone to be put in place at both sides of the level crossings within the city.",
