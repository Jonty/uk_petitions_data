        "additional_details": "Peadophiles are getting away with ruining innocent childrens lives, they are not getting harsh sentences, these are the people who get lenient sentences. The sex offenders Act of 2003 needs reviewing, half sentences should not be given to these criminals and their health or age should not be taken into consideration when sentencing. Criminals involved in the riots have recieved harsher sentences. The taxes in our country pay to keep criminals behind bars, i would rather my taxes go to keeping peadophiles, rapists and murderers in prison, rather than letting them free amongst todays children. All children need protecting and this Act of 2003 is not doing its job correctly as we see in everyday newspapaers that more and more innocent children are being abused! please review this law, it needs to be changed !!",
