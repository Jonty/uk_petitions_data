        "additional_details": "It is currently being widely publicized that the English Premier League and FA are considering each club playing a competitive league game abroad during the Premier League season.  The negative feeling that this will create among fans across the country is huge.  Season pass prices will be affected,  'home' advantage will not exist, time zones and climate can have a detrimental effect on a team and this surely cannot be deemed fair play over the course of a season.  Regardless of  the effect this will have on clubs, it is totally unfair on English football fans that have filled stadiums for over 120 years.  It will put further pressure on the working man who will see it as his duty to find the extra money required to travel further to support his club.  I urge the Government to discuss this in Parliament and put a stop to the Premier League's plans to play competitive games abroad. ",
