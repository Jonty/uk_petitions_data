It is also responsible for collecting and spending vast sums of our money.  Yet we, the public, have never had an opportunity to give our verdict on whether we believe that the EU, with it's parliaments, councils and public servants, is of benefit to us.  It is time for the pubic to decide and we call upon our Parliament to vote for a Referendum on the UK's membership of the EU.",
