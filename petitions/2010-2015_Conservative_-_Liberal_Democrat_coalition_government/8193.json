The original protests were as a direct result of this, however, the subsequent violence and destruction is due to a minority in the community believing that the police are ineffectual. it is time to say  'Enough is Enough'. Give the police the right to use reasonable force to quash this civil unrest. It is time to take a stand and say that this behaviour is not acceptable.",
