        "additional_details": "Our armed forces are full of honourable and potentially inspirational people. However, this is not all that it takes to be a teacher.\r\nThere is a reason why people need a full degree in their chosen subject for secondary school teaching - they need this level of skill to effectively teach the subject.\r\nHow fair would it be for students taking, for example, A-level history to be taught by somebody who hasn't even done history A-level? They may receive training, but I fail to believe that it will be sufficient to unleash them on students who desperately need to attain their essential qualifications.\r\nMaybe we should support them in training for other jobs if they wish to, but they should meet all the same entry requirements as anybody else training to become a teacher.",
