Apparently, because my Dad was in hospital for 3 1/2 months after suffering a stroke and after being released he had a fall where he smashed his face and broke a finger within 2 weeks of being released. He cannot get attendance allowance until he has his `condition` 6 months. I have spoken to the social services and age uk and all they do is confirm this. I want the government to address this issue and help the people in this `grey` area. Please help my family and others like us",
