        "additional_details": "This petition has been instigated in response to adversities to the expansion of the University College Falmouth (soon to be Falmouth University).\r\n\r\nUCF is a fantastic story of success. The Fox family were responsible for a great deal of the development of Falmouth; the land on which UCF is situated was kindly donated to Falmouth for an art school. The University has enjoyed so many successes and continues to be one of the best in the United Kingdom, if not the world. By signing this petition you are supporting not only the University but embracing the people of Falmouth and their town, the growth of Cornwall and the reputation of the county, saturated in culture and a place of great inspiration.\r\n\r\nThe intention is to bring everyone together, as people not of different stand points, yet as people who have so much to offer each other. We are all set to benefit and share the triumphs of this great institution, beautiful landscape, rich history and warm community.\r\n",
