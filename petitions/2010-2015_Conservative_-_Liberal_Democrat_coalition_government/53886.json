However it failed to act then and has further failed to respond appropriately to the massacre of egyptian civilians at the hands of the military. With hundreds dead and thousands injured our government can not continue to stand by. We demand that you denounce this military coup and take measures to hold the military accountable of this massacre. Please demand an end this blood coup now.",
