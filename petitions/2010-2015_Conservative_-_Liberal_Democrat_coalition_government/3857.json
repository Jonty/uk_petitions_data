        "additional_details": "This petition calls on the UK Parliament to discuss the legality of the Act of Free Choice (a referendum held in 1969 which resulted in West Papua's  incorporation into Indonesia).\r\n\r\nIt is widely acknowledged that only 1025 Papuans out of a population of 1 million were allowed to vote. This despite the fact that the UN mandate stated that the vote was to be an act of self-determination (one man, one vote).\r\n\r\nSince 1969 human rights groups estimate that over 100,000 Papuan civilians have died as a result of Indonesian military operations. Political dissent and freedom of expression are denied to the West Papuan people.\r\n\r\nThe West Papuan people are calling for a genuine act of self-determination to be held, in accordance with international law so that they can freely and democratically determine their own future.",
