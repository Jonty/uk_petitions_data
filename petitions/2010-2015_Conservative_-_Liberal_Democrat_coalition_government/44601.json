Their stance is that they have no obligation to send reminders it is for the vehicle owner to remember. If they are to issue fines this MUST change and make them just as accountable.\r\n It is NOT acceptable to fine someone just for forgetting an annual event without  a reminder.\r\nThe DVLA are making a vast amount of money doing this and it MUST stop.",
