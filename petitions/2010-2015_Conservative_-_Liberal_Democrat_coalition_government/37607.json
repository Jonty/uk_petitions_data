        "additional_details": "Currently everyone pays the same rate regardless of how much they earn per annum. This has contributed to people preferring to stay unemployed, idle and depressed rather than take up low paid jobs. Also people prefer to live in miserable housing conditions close to where they work rather than live under better housing conditions far away from their work places for fear of paying so much on transport fares to commute to work\r\nI would like the Government to subsidise fares for people who earn below \u00a325,000pa so that they pay 50% to 75% of the maximum fare on train journeys. This can be achieved by providing various rates to reflect different income brackets (e.g. people who earn up to \u00a315,000pa to pay 50% fare, \u00a320,000 to pay 65% fare, etc)",
