        "additional_details": "We demand the government stop handing out taxpayers money in aid to countries without there being any accountability.  Billions of pounds have gone into Africa over decades without any change being made to the lives of the people that need it.  They should all be leading well fed, prosperous lives.  Instead, these funds are being used, as in Ethiopia, as a political tool.  Is our government really that naive that they think it is all going to the needy?  An accountable group needs to be set up to ensure the money gets where it is needed, and not into the pockets of the rich and powerful.  Stop turning a blind eye to this problem and wasting our money.\r\n\r\n",
