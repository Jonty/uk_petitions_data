        "additional_details": "We call on the Government, NHS Minister and Department of Work & Pensions to recognise that Dementia is an illness and as such should be funded by the State not by the Individual's family who can ill afford the cost. Elderly people who need care themselves should not be left to care for someone who is ill and needs special care.  Overseas aid should be cut to fund this and despite statements that NHS and Care would be combined there is no evidence that this is happening in the case of Dementia illness. If Government is happy to fund illegal immigrants why will they not fund Dementia Care for those who have paid into the system. We call on you to change the system now and fund this dreadful disease.",
