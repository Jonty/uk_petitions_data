        "additional_details": "We the undersigned ask the Government to make the selection of railway franchise operators a publicly determined process.\r\n\r\nThe present system of choosing railway franchise operators - Whose actions and manner of operation affect all users of that franchise - Does not appear to involve public opinion in any regard, as the recent situation and public response over the West Coast Mainline franchise serves to prove.\r\n\r\nWe ask that the Government allow members of the general public to vote for their preferred operator of any railway franchise when the renewal of the same becomes due, and to ensure that the views and opinions of railway users are taken into full account and consideration in the selection and appointment of any ongoing franchise operator.",
