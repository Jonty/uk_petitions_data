        "additional_details": "We consider that the pensioner's winter fuel allowance should be at least doubled from \u00a3200 to \u00a3400 to reflect that it has not been increased since introduction many years ago although the costs of energy supplies, electic, gas and oil have gone up significantly.\r\nAn increase from the present rate of \u00a3200 to a minimum of \u00a3400 should be introduced.\r\nPensioner's income free allowance has also been frozen although living costs, particularly food and energy, have escalated greatly over the past several years.   Whereby many pensioners had put aside funds to live on in retirement the minimal interest rates have also significantly reduced our disposable income.\r\nThe last three or four winters have been extremely cold and have seen massive increases in the amounts of energy used  to keep homes at a reasonable temperature over longer periods of time.
