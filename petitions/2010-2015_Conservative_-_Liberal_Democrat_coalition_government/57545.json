        "additional_details": "RAF North Witham was the British airfield used by US Pathfinder Paratroopers during WW2 as a departure point to embark upon setting the radio beacons used as critical marker points for in the entire airbourn invasion force for D-Day.\r\n\r\nThe control tower is owned by the Forestry Commision, and due to its current state of decay is ear marked to be demolished within weeks. Considerd as the heart of an airfield, this building represents a standing memorial to those men and is about to be lost for ever, lost to this generation and the next. As a building of significant historical value it must be saved as a sign of respect to those brave men, air crews and ground staff who made the air invasion possible. Our government bodies, should at least allow the building to remain if not made structurly sound.",
