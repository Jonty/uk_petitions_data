        "additional_details": "Instead of the economy relying on service jobs- why not raise import duty, cut corporation tax, so more manufacturing happens in the UK once more, and the UK looks like a better place for big companies to invest. Reduce products carbon foot print, as products are made right on the users doorsteps, employ more people, better working practices here mean products would have a more ethical background. Working in sheet metal manufacture, I know we here in Britain can out compete with the rest of the world, on qaulity- so making imports more expensive would actually bring manufacturing costs down, as we'd be able to make more, bringing supply costs down, thus investing more back in to plant and ultimately the country with more jobs- meaning more tax paid by workers, and the companies, helping balance the books of the country! Who knows in 10 years the country might spend less than tax revenues bring in if this route is followed.",
