It is simply not fair that EU Citizens are exempt under the EU freedom of labour movement regulations.\r\n\r\nMany EU Nations are keen to insist that UK rules/laws on \"Benefits\" must apply to all EU Citizens resident in the UK.  If that is enforceable under EU Law then the UK must be able to insist on the requirement for Spousal Visas to be applied to anybody resident in the UK.  Registry Offices could then simply ask to see the Spousal Visa or a receipt for an application.  If none is available then this fact should be reported to the Home Office or one of their agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
