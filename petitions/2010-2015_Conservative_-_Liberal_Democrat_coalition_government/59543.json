        "action": "Proposal to ring fence a percentage of all national insurance contributions after the 30 year threshold",
        "additional_details": " This is a petition to ring fence a percentage of national insurance contributions accrued after the 30 year qualifying period for full state pension and used to supplement the state pension or invested in a separate personal pension plan. Most hard working individuals now  work in excess of 45 years and therefore pay in excess of 45 years of national insurance contributions. Once 30 years has been paid you are entitled to the full government pension. I believe those additional years payments, where we pay for other peoples benefits and pensions, should be split between general national insurance payment and a percentage being ring fenced for personal additional voluntary contributions to supplement your own existing state pension or removed at source and invested in a personal pension plan.",
