Especially when you read that this country gives money to India in aid when that country spends money on a space program and itself hands out foreign aid. When this government gives foreign aid to African countries and then you read of these African politicians spending large amounts on fancy real estate in France.\r\nCharity begins at home so they say so let\u2019s start spending the money we pay in taxes on our own people during these times of austerity before handing it out to the rest of the world.\r\n",
