        "additional_details": "The government is not treating the underlying problem after the mass riots in England. Evicting and cutting benefits fo those who participated in the riots are going to leave them in the streets with nowhere to go and less hope than before. This is not a practical solution. The impact on society is going to be far greater than the damage caused by the riots and looting. If the government is not able to provide practical solutions to serious problems affecting all citizens in England and see the consequences of their actions then they should not be allowed to be in power and lead the country to its end.",
