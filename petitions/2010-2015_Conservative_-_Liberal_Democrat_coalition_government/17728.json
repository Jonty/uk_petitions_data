This will require a new law to be passed.\r\n\r\nIn city centres throughout the country, there are huge, multistory office buildings that sit empty. We should fill them, re-purpose them if necessary and prevent any more building taking place until all of these buildings are filled and providing a valid function.\r\n\r\nThis will make great use of what we already have and even please the owners of these buildings, as they will not be stood empty any more. It will also prevent more of our countryside being lost forever, which is a vital goal",
