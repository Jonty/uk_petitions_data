        "additional_details": "Apart from retaining UK armed forces as an effective, creditable and powerful force, the Strategic Defence Review should take into account developing new Hi-Tec defence systems in order to stimulate Britain\u2019s manufacturing jobs, like developing a marine version of aircraft carrier launched Eurofighter Typhoon, stealthy domes ( for surveillance, air superiority and ground attack/precision bombing), nuclear powered aircraft carriers. HMG should also spend money in R&D and updating equipment (like medical, transport, IT systems), infrastructure (like HS2, flyovers, land reclamation, bypasses) and services (like HMG supported investment banking) with the view of stimulating the economy; retaining British jobs, knowhow, skills and manufacturing capacity.",
