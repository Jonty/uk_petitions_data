        "additional_details": "I would like to see the introduction of an off road aspect to the current motorcar driving test.\r\n\r\nNew motorcyclists have to undertake Compulsory Basic Training (CBT) before they can drive on the road,  The the driver theory test and hazard perception then an off road module (Mod 1) and then an on road test (Mod 2)\r\n\r\nYoung drivers looking to do their car test only have to do the Theory and hazard perception test and the test itself, and this is the bracket of driver involved in the most accidents when newly qualified. An off road aspect to the test as with motorcycles would show an ability to demonstrate controlled driving skill and include items such as reversing into parking spaces (commonly done on street in real life and an aspect shown to be problematic), avoidance manouvers, clutch and throttle control.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be more comprehensive testing as part of the motorcar licence process to bring it in line with motorcycles.",
