Nearly had a clip, fall, crash?\r\n\r\nThen sign this petition to make the government make it COMPLUSARY to add the CBT to their driving test. Doesn't matter where, just there. We have to do COMPLUSARY training to make us safe so why can't the car drivers do it?\r\n\r\nWe all know that the majority of motorcycle RTCs are the fault of the car driver becase of complete unawareness or ignorance. Having nearly getting hit myself on average twice a day, everyday, being tailgating in heavy wind and rain and going round bends. It is not on and I urge you to sign this petition to get the motorcycle fatalities down and more respect for us on the road.",
