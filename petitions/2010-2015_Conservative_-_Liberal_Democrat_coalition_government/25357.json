        "additional_details": "The Arctic is one of last remaining pristine wildernesses on the planet, home to polar bears, narwhals and other species that don't exist anywhere on the planet.\r\n\r\nYet it is under grave threat. Climate change is causing the ice to melt, and companies and governments are rushing to carve up the resources that lay underneath the ice.\r\n\r\nI want you to use your influence and protect the Arctic. At the moment the UK is lobbying to water down new European proposals which would ensure that oil companies, like Cairn Energy, have to meet tough new standards when they operate in fragile areas like the Arctic.\r\n\r\nRather than blocking laws in the EU that would help protect the frozen North, the UK should be doing all it can to preserve one of the world's most important natural environments. Please tell me exactly what you intend to do to save the Arctic",
