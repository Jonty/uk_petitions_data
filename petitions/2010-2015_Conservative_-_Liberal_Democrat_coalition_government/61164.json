It should be possible for a property owner to sue the Planning Authority  for compensation where the Planning Authority has granted planning permission, and then subsequently has failed to ensure that adequate and effective flooding alleviation and mitigation measures have been implemented and maintained.  This would have the effect of discouraging Planning Authorities from granting planning permission on a flood plane or area down to be subject to ground water flooding.  Legislation should not be retrospective.",
