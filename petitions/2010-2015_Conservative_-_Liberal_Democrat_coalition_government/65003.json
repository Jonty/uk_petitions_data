Irn-Bru , penguins, Lucozade etc. Since some of these products are by royal approval , the question has to be asked, \"If it is good enough for the Queen, why is it not good enough for Canadians?\"\r\nThe UK should fight for the right for all our goods to be sold to our commonweath partners without restriction. If not we should ban all Canadian products like Canola oil (GM crop) , Maple syrup (high in sugar) and technology like Blackberry\r\n",
