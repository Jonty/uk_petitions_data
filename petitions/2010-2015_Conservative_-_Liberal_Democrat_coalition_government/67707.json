        "additional_details": "As the law stands currently,with regards to social services housing children with adults who have been the perpetrators of sexual offences,especially those classed as less serious as only a caution by police was given. Children can and are being housed with dangerous,vile and potentially dangerous people. The law should change to protect our children from such people,especially if they were cautioned,charged or convicted of sexual offences involving minors or violent sexual offences. Please sign this petition if you believe our children deserve more protection from these vile offenders.",
