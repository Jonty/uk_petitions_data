        "additional_details": "We want Britain\u2019s commercial banks stopped from creating money out of thin air as a debt which we can never pay off, which they do when they issue loans. We want the Bank of England to be the only body in the land allowed to create money out of nothing and that it should do so, and in the amount required for a healthy economy. It should be bold and just say, \u201cThis is such and such an amount of money\u201d  without having to borrow it from anywhere. Ghenghis Khan did it! He just printed money and said, \u201cIn my land THIS IS MONEY and if you owe me money, this is the currency you have to pay me in.\u201d and people accepted it. That sort of money (Fiat money) is a national asset rather than a national debt and the Bank should give it to the elected government to put into circulation by funding projects that fix our infra-structure, train our people, generate power and develop goods and services for export. Then we can get somewhere instead of languishing in debt. That\u2019s when the real work starts.  ",
