NCB (No Claims Bonus) no longer reflect on your policy, as in the last two years premiums have gone up by 45% and will continue to increase, where as NCB doesn't increase and so making your bonus worthless.\r\n\r\nNew drivers are finding it hard to get insured due to this and with no returns from the insurance companies with regards to NCB due to premium hikes, more and more are making full claims, which in turn hikes up the premiums further.\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition, so that we can lobby for a change in the way insurance works. Would you like to see a return of 25% or 50% of premiums for drivers who don't claim during and NCB to also reflect at the same % as premium increase.",
