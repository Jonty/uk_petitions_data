        "additional_details": "The EU Commission has asked the department for transport to consider proposals on the implementation of \"ISA\" for all new cars and potentially the retro-fitment of the system to older cars as well. ISA involves fitment of a computer which issues a series of warnings and voluntary/mandatory controls which can prevent a driver from exceeding the speed limit. An example of one of these controls would be the \"haptic accelerator\" which can apply upwards pressure on the throttle pedal in varying degrees to make a driver feel uncomfortable when trying to accelerate above the limit. This is a breach of liberty and there are already strict laws in place which deal with speeding. We ask that the transport minister blocks these plans and yet another attack on our freedoms from Brussels.",
