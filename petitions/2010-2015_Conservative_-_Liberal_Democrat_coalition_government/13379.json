This is the greater and less divisive definition that by virtue of there being principally two islands of that name forces Britishness equally and unavoidably on English, Irish, Scots, Welsh and assorted others alike and requires of any Government choosing to call itself a British Government that it deliver government for all the people that in such a sense the British are, and in a form with which all can be content.\r\nThis the present Government for the British fails to do. The Structure of Government presently pertaining in the Islands of the British is the Structure of Government of the Empire of the English in the Islands, in what indisputably is the post-imperial world, and past and present nomenclature notwithstanding.\r\n",
