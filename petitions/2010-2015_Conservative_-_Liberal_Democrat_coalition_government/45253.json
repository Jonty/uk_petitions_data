        "additional_details": "After the expenses scandal there are still murmurs around Westminster that MPs want a pay rise. Might I suggest that we give them their pay rise on condition that it is linked to the minimum wage. \u00a36.19 per hour, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week over the year gives an annual income of \u00a312,875. If MPs' salary was six times this figure they would have an income of \u00a377,251. This gives MPs the figure they seek but now they must justify why they are worth six times the lowest paid job.  This will give MPs a monthly reminder what the minimum wage is. In future if they want a pay rise they will have to increase the minimum wage and MPs will have to justify why what they do is worth so much more. As public servants their pay should bear a relationship to the pay of others, and since pensions and benefits track wages why should they be any different?\r\nIf MPs debate this and reject it, it will show their reluctance to have an honest, transparent system of pay.
