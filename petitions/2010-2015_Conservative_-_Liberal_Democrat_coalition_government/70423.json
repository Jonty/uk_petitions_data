Thousands of Yazidi's Christians from Iraq have been driven out of their homes and lost everything because of the ISIL they are now refugees. People are being raped, tortured and slaughtered a the hands of these terrorists. They could attack western countries too, they need to be stopped. I want the UK to send in troops to both Syria and Iraq to stop this terrorist organisation before it is too late and they attack us. The people fighting at the moment need help. Please send in UK troops to stop ISIL in both Syria and Iraq.",
