My credit card has increased to 28% with no real warning or reason.The company had a fine for fixing interest rates which they are clearly passing to their customers. This is common practice across the board and should be abolished.safe guards should be in place to protect  consumers from these companies which are tantamount to loan sharks.We keep seeing shoddy practices by the banking industry but the government is simply not doing enough to protect consumers, reducing interest rates and ensuring no sudden unexpected increases in interest are applied this can only boost the economy.
