        "additional_details": "This is a GCSE Citizenship campaign to reduce University fees from approx. \u00a39000 a year to approx. \u00a33000 a year (cost 2 years ago).\r\n\r\nIn the UK, university fees have recently been raised from around \u00a33000 a year to around \u00a39000 a year, not including accommodation. Considering that most university courses last for three years, that will add up to \u00a327,000 for the whole course, which is a lot of money for a student just out of college to have to pay back. If university fees were lowered again to \u00a33000, that would make three year courses more affordable at \u00a39000 therefore more people will have qualifications that will benefit the country.",
