        "additional_details": "This petition is to put forward a law that British people should have the right to know where convicted child sex offenders are living at any given time. The continued secrecy of their living arrangments and movements is putting our children at risk. The fact is that it is impossiable for them to be released back into society after their sentence. This is due to the nature of their crimes, our childrens saftey, and even their own saftey. This is another example of the minority being favoured, their saftey over our childrens. The law and how this country is run should be for the good of the majority,  and I would say the majority of us want to know where these dangerous people live. They gave up there right to privacy when they became a threat to our children. Sign up and help make a diiference.",
