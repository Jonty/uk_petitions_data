We need to teach students that taking the time to find the right answer, even if it takes longer than everyone else, can be more rewarding than always coming first.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, believe that these principals, if taught in schools could also apply to the students' perceptions of stressful, trying situations, even outside the school gates.\r\n\r\n",
