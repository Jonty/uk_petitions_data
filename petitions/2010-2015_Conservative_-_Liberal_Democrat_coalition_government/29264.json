That is an affront to democracy and defeats the stated objectives of the e-petition procedure.\r\nThe reason given (yet again!) is \"E-petitions cannot be used to request action on issues that are outside the responsibility of the government\". That is patently untrue in this case, for the reasons previously stated, and, what is more, there is no such reason given in your terms and conditions.\r\n\r\nPlease reconsider. You will doubtless refuse. If you do, and there is subsequently a withdrawal from the Games by India or other countries, or protests, or other campaigns which require government or LOCOG intervention, you may be sure that I will release all relevant documentation to the media.
