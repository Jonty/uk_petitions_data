However she also tried to get the 'P' Plate introduced as compulsory for newly qualified Drivers.  but is voluntary only. I have spoken to Driving Instructors and they agree with me that the 'P' Plate could save Lives.  The Government must make the 'P' Plate Compulsary for a period of 1-2 Months after passing their Driving Tests.",
