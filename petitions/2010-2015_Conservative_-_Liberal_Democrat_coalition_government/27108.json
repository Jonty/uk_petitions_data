I ask for the day of the 15th of September to gain formal recognition as 'The Battle of Britain Day'. Perhaps for many cultural reasons this day has fallen out of collective memory. But we should not forget that the pilots were not solemnly of British origin. They came from many different cultural backgrounds; men came from Poland, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Czechoslovakia, France, Holland. This should not only be seen as a military victory, but a cultural victory, a triumph of nations, of men and woman of all origins who safeguarded the skies of Britain. I believe this displays a fantastic message that can resonate across a multi-cultural Britain. It shows than in one of our darkest hours, that our friends did not abandon us and that the sacrifices they made were not in vain.  ",
