The smoking ban caused many smokers to stay away and those that still come have to stand outside. The ban may have cleared the air but its destroyed the atmosphere. Its just like you are treating them as\r\nsecond hand citizens.\r\n\r\nOther European countries have had more sensible regulation allowing smoking rooms or exempting small bars and have avoided this devastation",
