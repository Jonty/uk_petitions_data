There are many Welsh  homeless people due the lack of housing and accommodation, You continue to see increasing numbers off Welsh people on the streets. Our people and there issues are our problem and there not being addressed. People from all country's are coming over and getting help and housed left, right and center. I do not believe that if your not British or Welsh then you shouldn't be allowed to live here because that is racism, I just believe that our people are being over populated by other country's and i don't believe that they should share our rights as we don't share there's. We are treated as second class citizens in our own home. ",
