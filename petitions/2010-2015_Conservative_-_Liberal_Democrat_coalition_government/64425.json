        "additional_details": "Brighton is the first and ONLY green council in the UK, however there are no incentives for parents to use real nappies. Many councils give vouchers, start up kits, cash back, free samples...! we have nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's why its good to use reusable:\r\n\r\n2-3% of our household waste is estimated to be disposable nappies, approximately 400,000 tonnes of waste each year (environment agency, 2004).\r\n\r\nThe average person can save \u00a3500 per child(goreal, 2014).\r\n\r\nUsing real nappies instead of disposables means carbon savings of 40% and prevents over 4,000 nappies from going to landfill for every baby using real nappies (goreal, 2014).\r\n\r\n3 billion disposable nappies that are thrown away each and every year in the UK, 90% of these are landfilled.  A baby in disposables will need nearly 2000 nappy changes for every year he or she is in nappies, that\u2019s 4- 5,000 disposable nappies in a landfill site, or 24 Real Nappies hanging on your washing line!\r\n",
