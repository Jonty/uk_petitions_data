A country's head of state should be active and able. Prince Charles would be a good King for 10-20 years after this and should be allowed to take the role.\r\nAbdication is not the same as giving up and Queen Elizabeth has more than earned a peaceful retirement. I believe she should be able to retire and remove any stigma of royal abdications; after all there have been 3 in Europe this year!",
