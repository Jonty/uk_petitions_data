        "additional_details": "There is recent talk of The Pheasant pub on Lane Top sheffield being turned into a Mosque as local muslims are using collection boxes to collect money for the work on it, as seen in the sheffield star on 7/8/12 and as you can imagine the difficulty this would cause with parking etc. i for one do not think it should be allowed so sign the petition in hope of getting the council to deny them planning permission when they apply",
