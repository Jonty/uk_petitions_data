        "additional_details": "The thresholds to ban marches and demonstrations are currently measured in terms of public safety, not economic impact or reputation. We would like to highlight the damaging impact marches and demonstrations have on our community and local businesses.\r\nThere are no restrictions on frequency, location, time/date of marches, effecting our rights to trade. We need others to have their say, when marches happen which impact their lives and trade, so an agreement can be met so that minimal impact occurs. Marches take place in the heart of our towns and cities, and despite the best efforts of the Police and the council to minimise disruption and ensure that businesses stay open, the reality is that significant parts of our towns close everytime, and the shops that remain open do not trade well and are fearful of damage to their businesses. The impact of such protests and marches through our small towns create a devastating impact for our local communities and we need our voices heard.",
