        "additional_details": "This e-petition is set up to ban the selling of pets online on sites such as gumtree, pets4homes and other associated websites, many of the animals sold on these sites maybe stolen or lost pets that have been found and have not had the chance to be reunited with their original owners, this encourages more people to steal animals as they can easily sell them online without any questions being asked and make easy money. Websites such as preloved should not be included in this e-petition as they check their adverts before they post them publicly and there is less chance of selling a stolen pet on that particular website. The point of this petition is to ban websites excluding preloved from selling animals online.",
