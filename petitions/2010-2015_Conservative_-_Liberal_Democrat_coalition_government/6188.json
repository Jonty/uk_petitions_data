I believe one of the rationales for put presence there is to make this country safer and less subject to terrorist attacks; in my opinion it is more likely to have exactly the opposite effect as the Afghans see their people killed and injured and their country over-run.  I would say that the only, or at least main, reason we are there is to help the Americans get revenge for \"9/11\"; understandable they should want this but it was the responsibility of al-Qaeda and not the ordinary, mostly powerless, Afghans.  It is also a colossal waste of money at a time of austerity.  I therefore ask the government to get us out of Afghanistan.",
