        "additional_details": "A British company has found a large quantity of oil around the Falkland Islands and this has created more tensions with Argentina which still claims ownership to the Islands.\r\n\r\nMore recently, we now know that both Argentina and its close ally Brazil are building nuclear submarines. This could be interpreted as an act of hostility.\r\n\r\nThe Navy in its current state could not defend the Islands by itself. We cannot rely on support from the USA as it has sided with Argentina, referring to the Islands as the Malvinas.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call for the cuts in defense to be reconsidered immediately, money to be invested in our Navy and appropriate actions taken to ensure the defense of British territory and citizens.",
