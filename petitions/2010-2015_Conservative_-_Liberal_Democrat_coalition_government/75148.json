        "additional_details": "To introduce a more gradual phasing in of the increase to women's retirement age so that we can make better financial provision for our future. The first we knew about this was in 2010 when the pension age for women began to rise. At that time women expected our retirement age to increase to 63/64.  Whilst this may have been acceptable due to the economic crisis the retirement age has since been raised even more to almost 66. This means that in the space of 5 years our pension age has increased on a massive scale and not been phased in fairly. Women of our age group are being massively financially discriminated against as many of us are virtually unemployable. Please act fairly and remove this discrimination now.",
