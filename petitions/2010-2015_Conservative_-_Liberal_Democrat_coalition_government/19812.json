        "additional_details": "Sex and Relationships Education (SRE) is an important topic for all young people, and the fact that it is not taught in all schools across Britain is a shambles. Being 17 myself, seeing what others are doing, without being properly informed is shocking, and with lasting consequences (such as STI's and Teenage Pregnancies). The Young People in question are from a Catholic school, and thus don't have to do SRE. Therefore, I think that SRE should be compulsory in all schools, including faith schools.",
