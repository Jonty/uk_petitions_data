        "additional_details": "Government to make food labeling on alcoholic drinks mandatory and the same as soft drinks. The only items in my shopping basket not so labelled are alcohol. The government should remove this discrepancy and provide consumers with the information deemed necessary on all other food products.\r\n\r\nAlcohol consumption would reduce if this information was highly visible at the point of sale in pubs and shops, especially in women and their partners.\r\n\r\nGovernment to go public with this debate to raise awareness and support. This should be a vote winner with very many parents and grandparents if handled well.",
