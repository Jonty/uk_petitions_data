        "additional_details": "On the DVLA database, any disabled driver who is allowed to continue driving while with a \"Expired Substantive Licence\" under a Section 88 (medical), DVLA should input the correct full information, and not what they are doing at this moment, which is stating the driver is driving with a expired licence, which entails the driver to eventually get a court summons despite the driver has done nothing criminal, no driving rules or regulation has been broken. Therefore I am asking the Government to change this simple and easy process to avoid unnecessary costs to the tax payer as the courts would have to refund the drivers for wasted fuels costs etc, also saves a waste of tax payers money on court paperwork and most importantly, it helps the disabled drivers from suffering untold stress and hassle due to this lack of information kept on DVLA's database.
