        "additional_details": "Creationism and \u2018intelligent design\u2019 are not scientific theories, but they are portrayed as scientific theories by some religious fundamentalists who attempt to have their views promoted in publicly-funded schools. At the same time, an understanding of evolution is central to understanding all aspects of biology. Currently, the study of evolution does not feature explicitly in the National Curriculum until year 10 (ages 14-15). Free Schools and Academies are not obliged to teach the National Curriculum and so are under no obligation to teach about evolution at all.\r\n\r\nWe petition the Government to make clear that creationism and \u2018intelligent design\u2019 are not scientific theories and to prevent them from being taught as such in publicly-funded schools, including in \u2018faith\u2019 schools, religious Academies and religious Free Schools. At the same time, we want the Government to make the teaching of evolution in mandatory in all publicly-funded schools, at both primary and secondary level.",
