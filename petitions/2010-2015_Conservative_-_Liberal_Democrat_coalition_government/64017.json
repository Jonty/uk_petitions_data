        "additional_details": "I argue that we need to have NO religion in government: Deut.22:13-21 advises that if you find your wife is not a virgin on your wedding that you should stone her to death; the Christian God does nothing to help the world, he is therefore impotent or evil; Christianity is a religion of human sacrifice; the Christian God will punish you to hell if you do not believe in him during your life time, but he manufactured a world where some people live in cultural isolation, then manufactured their deaths. All of the western monotheistic religions suffer from this poor rationale.\r\nThe fact that the Bishops do not practice these barbaric beliefs suggests that there is a humanistic side to morality, not a religious reason; this makes their religion redundant in the process of moral decision making. Therefore, reserving these seats for bishops is no more a wise decision then reserving them for white middle-class males.",
