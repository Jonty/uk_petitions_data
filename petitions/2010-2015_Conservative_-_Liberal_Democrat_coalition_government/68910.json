        "additional_details": "Campaign to save lives by giving social landlords the right legal access to carry out annual gas safety checks\r\n\r\nThe law rightly commits Housing Associations to check that gas appliances and flues in their properties are safe. This is vital to keep people protected from the threat of gas explosions and carbon monoxide poisoning - both those living in the home where the gas appliances are, AND those living in neighbouring homes who could be unwittingly at risk if safety checks aren\u2019t carried out.\r\n\r\nBut, the law doesn\u2019t allow social landlords a swift and efficient way to make sure they can carry out the checks required.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the solution?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s simple \u2013 give Housing Associations the same legal rights as their Local Authority counterparts. Unlike Housing Associations, the law gives Local Authorities the right to enter properties they own. This makes sure tenants are safe and sound and that neighbours can rest easy in their homes.",
