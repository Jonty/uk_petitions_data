        "additional_details": "\r\nI am of the opinion that the proposed \u2018Stanza Stones\u2019 project being undertaken by The Ilkley Literary Arts Festival, is effectively vandalism in the name of art. The last thing needed on Ilkley moor, is to give any encouragement to anyone to carve on the stones, as many of the neolithic cup and ring stones have already been defaced. To many people Ilkley moor, is a sacred place at both spiritual and aesthetic levels, so I appeal to you to do everything in your power, to halt this awful abuse of our landscape. Once destroyed, natural and ancient features are lost forever, and cannot be replaced.\r\n\r\nPlease also contact anyone else, or any other body, that may feel upset, if not outraged by this calumny.\r\n",
