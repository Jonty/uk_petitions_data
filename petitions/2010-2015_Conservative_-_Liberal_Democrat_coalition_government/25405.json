        "action": "Create a (CB) Citizens' Band Radio Service at UHF for high-power use",
        "additional_details": "More radio spectrum should be made available to the UK population for communications use. This can either be walkie-talkies, a base station installed in a building, or in a vehicle for two-way radio use. Walkie talkies / radio transceivers which are available on the consumer market are limited in range and usefulness due to restrictive technical regulation: For example, PMR446 only permits 0.5w of power, making the range useless for communicating across town. The Business Radio Simple UK service is slightly better, but limited to 5w of power and base-stations are not allowed. Sign this petition to create a UHF CB service, similar to that available in Australia, but with more generous technical parameters: 40 (forty) 12.5 KHz channels at UHF, 5w power on hand-held radios, 25w power on mobile stations and base-stations. Repeaters, data, and encryption are permitted. This service should be licensed by Ofcom in the same way as a Simple UK Business Radio License at \u00a375 for 5 years.",
