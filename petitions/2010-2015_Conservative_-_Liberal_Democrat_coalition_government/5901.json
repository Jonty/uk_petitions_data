        "additional_details": "Since the issue of the death penalty has been raised on this site, we feel that the Government should declare that the death penalty will never be reinstated. It is disturbing that in a modern Parliament some MPs agree with reinstating the inefficient and cruel death penalty. This means that should there be any future debate or vote on the matter, the chances of reinstating it are increased. ",
