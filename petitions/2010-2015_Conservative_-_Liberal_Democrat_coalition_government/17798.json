        "action": "British soldiers dying in Afghanistan when trying to deactivate Taliban Improvised Explosive devices have no bomb protection. This must change!",
        "additional_details": "A recent BBC1 documentary stated that The Taliban\u2019s Improvised Explosive Devices (IED\u2019s) caused in 2010 the death or injury of nearly 8500 coalition troops and is No 1 killer of British troops in Afghanistan. British Bomb disposal operators risk life and limb trying to dismantle them untriggered, so that bomb parts can be saved. This allows forensic analysis to help identify their source and prevent worldwide terrorism.\r\nA highly intelligent bomb disposal officer reported that bomb disposal in Afghanistan is not performed in an army issue bomb suit because they are too hot, and if a bomb disposal operator gets shot at in one it is too difficult to run away in.\r\nProper bomb protection suits must be made available to bomb disposal operators. Five operators have been killed in Afghanistan in the last 2 yrs. Bomb protection suits could be air conditioned properly if there was a will to do so \u2013 it is not rocket science. They must also be made bullet proof - the technology exists already.\r\n",
