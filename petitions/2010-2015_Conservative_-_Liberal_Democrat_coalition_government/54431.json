        "additional_details": "I am petitioning for Parliament to debate the topic surrounding the proposal of the Rampion wind farm with the intention of government and the DECC halting the construction. Rampion would stretch, 8 miles from the coastline, from Worthing through to Seaford. At times of financial and economical crisis, I feel as though \u00a32 billion, the estimate of cost for the project, is a far too high sum to pay, when there are far better renewable energy alternatives to choose from. The location of Sussex near the sea with sufficient wind would provide a perfect opportunity to implement a system of hydropower at a far lesser cost.",
