        "additional_details": "On 8 August 2007, 29-year-old Ibragim Gazdiev was reportedly abducted by armed men in the North Caucasus republic of Ingushetia. He has not been seen since, and his family believe that he is - or was - held incommunicado. The authorities deny that they are holding him. The reason for his disappearance is unknown. We fear that Ibragim Gazdiev is in danger of being tortured or killed in secret or incommunicado detention. There is also concern for the safety of Ibragim's family who face harassment for pursuing justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease help us by simply signing this. Ibragim needs help and we can give it.",
