        "additional_details": "It is estimated about 50,000 babies a year are registered without the father's name because they were not present.\r\n\r\nThere is an increasing problem with fathers not taking responsibility for their children. The current law encourages this mindset from the outset.\r\n\r\nIt is not fair that a mother can also register the birth not including a father who wants to be named on the certificate.\r\n\r\nChildren born outside of marriage have a right to have both parents named on their birth certificate. They should not have a blank space or \"unknown\". It is demeaning and unfair.\r\n\r\nThe 2009 Welfare Reform Act contains a provision for requiring mothers to name fathers, and for it to be classed as perjury for falsify information.\r\n\r\nThe provision in the act should be law and retrospective changes to birth certificates must be allowed so that all birth certificates can be complete. It is the right thing to do.",
