In 2014 I would expect for the amount of money I spend to travel to work to do so in comfortable conditions.\r\nThe Gospel Oak to Barking Line is overcrowded, unbearable, hot and  personal space is of non existence.We require additional train services at busy periods to be run every 5 minutes instead of 15.\r\nThe lay out of the seating prohibits people getting on and off the train safely without being pushed shoved or elbowed everyone has no where to go so they are congregated at the door which prohibits people from getting off! Any one who has sense whom steps off the train to relieve the pushing and shoving so people can get off the train is meeted with the doors closing on them before they have got back on\r\n",
