An oath that all MPs can honestly swear is a step towards greater integrity in public life.\r\nThe debate should also include discussion on whether the oath should specify that MP's are expected to live cleanly with the highest of morals, and strive to inspire and act as a role model for all.\r\nSuch an oath would clearly state why MPs are elected and whom they should serve.",
