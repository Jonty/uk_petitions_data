        "additional_details": "When planning permission is required for new building or change of use of a building or plot of land then that planning permission must be sought before any building or change is made.  To make any change without permission is an offence, whether turning a warehouse into a mosque or green belt land into a caravan park.  By granting permission retrospectively the local councils are complicit in that offence and effectively let the offender get away with a crime.  Granting permission after the event must not be allowed and appropriate measures must be taken to restore the property to it's orginal state.",
