This is taxpayer's money and governments should not have the right to spend our money without much tighter controls on how the money is spent. Furthermore if there is money left over one year, it should not be a spending free for all by unelected civil servants to make sure all the money is used. We, the British public, are extremely generous anyway in case of disasters, so to see our money spent just to eliminate a department's end of year financial surplus is not acceptable.",
