        "additional_details": "Proposed banding changes by Royal Mail of packet post that come into force on 2nd April 2012 are potentially increasing small businesses daily spend on mail by 30% due to the additional charge of VAT also being added.\r\n\r\nAn item which weighs 50g that qualifies as a packet will cost the same as an item that weighs 700g.  Eliminating bands parcels up to 250g,  251g to 500g and 501g to 750g.  Replacing with a band of 0g to 750g.\r\n\r\nSmall retail businesses will have to completely restructure pricing to take into account increases in mail bill which may lead to a decrease in spend and prevent any growth and spend in the economy.\r\n\r\nI call on the Government to call on Ofcom to VETO the proposals by Royal Mail to protect small businesses and potentially individuals who use the postal service.",
