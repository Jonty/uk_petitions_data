        "additional_details": "Even though Section 28 was abolished in 2003 teachers in the High Schools across the country are still not teaching about the LGBT community in classes such as PSHE. I am an ex-student at a High School in Norfolk and am gay. Even though I knew for myself at the age of 13 I went through a long stage of denial because I thought it wrong to be gay. If we teach about the LGBT community in high schools then we will reduce bullying (which is a major issue in almost all schools across the county).\r\n\r\nTherefore, I believe the teaching of the LGBT community in high schools is a necessary addition to the curriculum.",
