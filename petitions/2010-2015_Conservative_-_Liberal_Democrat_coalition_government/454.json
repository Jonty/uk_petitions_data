All venues providing hustings opportunities must give equal opportunity to all candidates.\r\n\r\nThe production, distribution and display of all canvassing materials (leaflets, posters etc.) must be equal - no candidate should be permitted to gain advantage by reason of funding or other means.\r\n\r\nWhere candidates or adverts need to appear at different times or dates the assortment must be random.",
