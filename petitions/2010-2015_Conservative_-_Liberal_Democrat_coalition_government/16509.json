        "additional_details": "Charges for a bottle of water once a traveller has gone through to departures in an airport are far too high, taking full advantage of the security restrictions in place on passengers. It seems vastly unfair that we then have to pay very high prices for water which is required by all, and is a clear example of customers being ripped off.\r\n\r\nAs such I would like to propose that the government intervene and introduce legislation that blocks shops from profiting from the sale of bottles of water when in the departures lounge.",
