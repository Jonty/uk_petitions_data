However, very little is being reported about how the Government intend to tackle the social problems that lead to the riots in the first place.\r\n\r\nLet's stop talking about how we intend to punish people should they riot again, let's look at how we can prevent another riot from taking place at all by tackling the social problems that lead those to care so little for their community for example the ever increasing devide between the rich and poor in our country.",
