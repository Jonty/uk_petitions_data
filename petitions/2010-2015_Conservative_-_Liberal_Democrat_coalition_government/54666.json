        "additional_details": "As of Monday 9th September, all of SLP College students (who are living in rented accomodation in Garforth) will lose their housing benefit. This is due to the council not recognising the Level 6 National Diploma in Musical Theatre as a higher education course, claiming it's an equivalent to an A Level course (which is Level 3). The College, which has over 120 students, needs this money to fund their three years at the college as many receive no other forms of funding. This is disastrous to the students of SLP College, and will cause many to have to give up their dreams of joining the Musical Theatre and Dance industry. ",
