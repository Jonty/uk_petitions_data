We are being denied, because of light pollution, access to one of the most amazing sights any human can see. Can we introduce a one hour (that's all) blackout, maybe midwinter, where people can unite in this awe inspiring sight? I put it to the Department of Education because that is exactly what it would be, educational for children and grown ups.. It would also help us to realise how wonderful creation is and therefore , hopefully, inspire people to be brilliant. ",
