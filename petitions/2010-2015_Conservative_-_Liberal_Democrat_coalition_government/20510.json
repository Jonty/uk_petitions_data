International treaties such as Kyoto have too often being ignored and used for a business as usual approach whilst warnings from scientists fall on deaf ears. The Rio conference in 1992 established the idea of sustainability. The government should use Rio +20 next year to propose and support the establishment of an ICE to ensure that treaties and obligations are followed and to increase global environmental protection and awareness.",
