Furthermore Default Costs Certificate Judgements are not compatable with Article 6 Human Rights Act 1998 right to a fair trail because no hearing of the parties takes place so a dishonest party I.e Medical Defence Union has and can obtain a default costs certificate based on a dishonest paper application for a default costs certificate judgement.  Please get rid of default costs certificate judgements and make sure all legal costs claims must go before a judge with all parties present at the hearing to stop solicitors abusing their position to obtain default costs judgements in the future.
