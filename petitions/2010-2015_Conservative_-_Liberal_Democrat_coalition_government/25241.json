        "additional_details": "It is common practice for pre-prep and primary schools to charge registration fees ranging from \u00a350 to \u00a3200 per applicant. A parent would normally pay this fee to a multitude of schools upon the birth of their child. These fees do not guarantee a place, but simply allow for the child to be assessed upon reaching the required age. Should the applicant fail the assessment, the fees are non-refundable. Private schools are profiting off the high levels of demand and parent\u2019s emotional determination to try to get their children into certain schools of choice. This practice is morally wrong and fees should be refunded should the applicant not be admitted. It is impossible to argue that the fee \u201ccovers the cost\u201d of registering applicants. I propose that the fees are made refundable and this petition is to vote whether or not you are in favour of introducing this practice.",
