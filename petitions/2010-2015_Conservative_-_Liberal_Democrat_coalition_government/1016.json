For example some dogs are overbred (staffies and the demand isnt there for the amount of people breeding carelessly).\r\nThousands of animals are put to sleep or abandoned every year due to irresponsible breeders out there to line their own pockets.\r\nWe ask that more laws be brought in. A license to breed to the demand that is out there and a large fine for those who ignore it. ",
