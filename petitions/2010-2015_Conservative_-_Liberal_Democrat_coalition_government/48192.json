        "additional_details": "The government has made an effort to target individuals and organisations that are stealing money from the British Government and Taxpayers through tax evasion, but it needs to do more, in the UK alone it is projected anywhere between 14 billion and 109.2 billion pounds a year is lost through tax evasion. This money could be used to ease austerity measures on the poor and vulnerable, as well as helping our economy recover from this large recession.\r\n\r\nWe propose an increase in the severity of charges for individuals and organisations committing tax fraud. As well as this the legal obligation to pay back 150% percent of tax avoided (the extra 50% being punitive).\r\nThese punishments will be enforced by a HMRC that has been given 50% extra funding, which will be payed back over time in money recovered.\r\nThese measure will act as a deterrence for those willing to commit tax fraud.\r\n\r\nIf this is implemented, society as a whole will feel the benefit.\r\n\r\n",
