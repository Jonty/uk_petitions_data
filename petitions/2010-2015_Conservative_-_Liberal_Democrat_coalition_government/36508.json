        "additional_details": "This petition is aimed at Facebook pages which discuss child pornography, violence towards children and jokes about dead babies. Facebook do not seem to look at the contents of its pages that these people set up. We have witnessed discussions using babies in pornographic films and threats to parents and their babies and to parents that have lost their children. Facebook and the Government need to take this issue seriously. We have police, media and CEOP also.",
