        "additional_details": "Air Passenger Duty Tax (APD) is just another completely and utterly unjustified revenue-raising tax for the Treasury.\r\n\r\nIt fails in its primary purpose of combating the climate change, which is already addressed through the EU-wide carbon trading scheme (ETS).\r\n\r\nFurther, this tax disproportionally hits ordinary people as it adds up a significant (and already the highest in the world) cost to each ticket. And people have little choice but to pay it - as most of the travel in and out of the UK has to be done by air.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Government fails to listen to the heads of the British Air Transport Association, the Airport Operators Association, UK Inbound, the Association of British Travel Agents, and the heads of major airlines and tourist boards calling for a review of this unfair tax.\r\n\r\nPlease scrap Air Passenger Duty Tax (APD).",
