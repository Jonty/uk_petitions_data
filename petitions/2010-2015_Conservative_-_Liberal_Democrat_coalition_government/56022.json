        "additional_details": "Today, British Gas announced price rises of 8.4% on gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices, co-incidentally (?!) just before the highest usage period of the year. The increases are some three times the rate of inflation, and come after many other recent prices rises.\r\n\r\nDavid Cameron's response was to insult customers by suggesting they switch suppliers, a clearly pointless exercise as other suppliers will all also soon increase their charges - as demonstrated after the many previous price rises.\r\n\r\nBritish consumers do NOT benefit from market competition when the market is clearly a price fixing cartel\r\n\r\nThe government must act to regulate this industry NOW",
