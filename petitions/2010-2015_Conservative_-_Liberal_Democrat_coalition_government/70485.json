        "additional_details": "Schools should offer at least the option for children to learn the key things needed in general everyday life. Life Studies would teach students how to write a CV, open a bank account, good practise concerning debt, writing checks, public speaking, and general car maintenance.\r\nChildren leave school with good grades yet they are left not knowing the basics of how to live their life to their full potential. What are students meant to do with A* grades when they don't know how to apply for sixth form or college, university or a job?\r\nThese lessons would prepare students for independence. The government should establish this subject, which currently isn't available, so that students are prepared and able to tackle the obstacles real life presents.",
