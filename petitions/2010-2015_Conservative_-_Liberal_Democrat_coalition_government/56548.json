        "additional_details": "I would like the Home of Commons to discuss the effects that legalising cannabis will have on drug related crime. Previous discussions of cannabis remaining illegal have focussed on health benefits. To use health benefits as an argument for cannabis to remain illegal, it is vital to address the benefits that legalising cannabis will have so that we can understand which benefit will have a more positive effect on the nation.",
