        "additional_details": "Planning regulations need to improve as currently there are a lot of flats being build in busy towns and no improvements to the roads and other resources / facilities. More people results in more traffic issues - added stress, more accidents and the list goes on.\r\n\r\nDevelopers also should cater for sufficient off street parking as many already use the spaces that are noted in planning applications and on street parking reduces the ability to keep 2 way traffic flowing resulting in a longer journey time and more toxic exhaust fumes going into the air.\r\n\r\nInstead of adding more buildings to the towns, rather use the space on the outer edge of the towns. We strive to keep green areas but this only results in more stress and chaos in the built up areas.",
