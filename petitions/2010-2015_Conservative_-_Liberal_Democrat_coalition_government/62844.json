Even though I am not financially responsible for my step-son, they take into account my income- which is fine. But they do not take into account the money I pay  for child maintenance for my daughter, for whom I am financially responsible for. Time to change this clause.\r\nI propose that child maintenance payments should be taken into account for non-resident children which is paid by the partner of the parent of the resident child for whom the student loan is required.",
