I am personally sick of this country segregation and lack of understanding. I think we need more universal religious buildings to integrate religions.\r\n\r\nFor example instead of building a mosque, church or synagogue. We build what is known as the house of one. http://house-of-one.org/en/idea\r\n\r\nPlease support this to bring the British people all together and make this country proud.",
