        "additional_details": "Sirs the current tolls on the Dartford crossing are in contradiction of the original outline concerning the time limitation originally in place to recoup the original costs of the structure. It is also against the envromental stratagy to have needless holdups causing uneccessary polution due to the bottlekneck caused by the toll booths. I suggest that the original promises are upheld and that the bridge should now be toll free as promised.",
