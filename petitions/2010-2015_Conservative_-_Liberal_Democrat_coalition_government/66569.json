No free access to any more people even based on family already being here.\r\n\r\nIndividuals can only apply to come to UK when they meet a skills shortage in the UK AND have a job.\r\n\r\nMigrants will not be eligible for any benefits until 40 quarters of contribution to UK economy have elapsed.\r\n\r\nNo free NHS care.\r\n\r\nAny crime committed by a non UK national should be punishable by a prison sentence and subsequent deportation with no option to re-enter UK at any point in the future.\r\n\r\nAll asylum seekers are illegal as they have passed many safe countries to get to UK, this must stop. We cannot afford this and we are too small. Many just come to UK and become involved in crime.\r\n\r\nWe could reduce costs and invest in our own people for the benefit of our own economy in the long term.\r\n\r\n",
