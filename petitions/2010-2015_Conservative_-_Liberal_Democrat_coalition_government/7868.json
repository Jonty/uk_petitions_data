Lets assume a criminal(or two) breaks into a couples home, breaks the back door, nicks the cd player, thumps the old man of the house and scarpers. First thing is get a Government Assessor round to cost up the damage to the Building, cost of items taken and the physical abuse to the house owners. When the criminal(s) are caught and when found guilty, they will be issued with a custodial sentence and a Sentence of repayment. So when the sentence is read out it will be along the lines of:-  18 months in prison and \u00a3850.00 compensation (as identified by the assessor) whichever is the greater. prisoners will need to perform work duties. If the prisoner refuses to work then at the end of their sentence they will need to stay in the prison until they have worked off the payment. that way the criminal always pays and the victim always receives compensation. initially. At the moment Victims lose out every time that needs to be stopped. ",
