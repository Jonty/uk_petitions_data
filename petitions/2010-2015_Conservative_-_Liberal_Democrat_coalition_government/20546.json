I want the UK to review their human rights obligations and do the same for all foreign criminals in our jails. Not only is there a large percentage of immigrants costing the UK taxpayers large amounts of money to house in jail, but when they are released they are treated as innocent, claiming more benefits, often committing more crime, and becoming a burden on our country. If diverse countries such as Australia, Thailand, and Cambodia can send our criminals back, so should we.\r\nhttp://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16097278",
