Depression is the early signs of a possible suicide and many people may be depressed but keep it to themselves. The government needs to address this issue and actually fund help centers country-wide where anyone can turn up and get free anonymous help with their depression, including depression youth clubs for the troubled teens to make friends and help each other get over depression. 10% of young people self harm in the UK, this figure is not one that the government should be proud of.",
