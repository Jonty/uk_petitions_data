        "additional_details": "We are first taught about sexual health in detail in year 9, during secondary school.\r\nHowever, I know a lot of people who have had sex before year 9. The fact that they were not taught about sexual health before then means that they were much more at risk of falling pregnant or catching an STD or STI because they have not learnt about any contraception available, or teenage sexual health clinics that can help them.\r\n\u201cBut this obviously shows that young teens under that age should not be having sex.\u201d You may be thinking. But some young teenagers think they are mature enough, and so without knowing anything about sexual health they have sex.\r\nAs we can not convince them to not have sex, we can at least educate them so when they do make that decision, they can do it safely.\r\n\r\nPlease take just a moment of your time to sign on to our petition!",
