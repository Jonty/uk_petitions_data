        "additional_details": "We would like to see the loophole closed that allows Care/Nursing Home Providers to evict residents from their homes for no reason using the 28 day clause. This clause is being abused & residents who have lived in these Homes for many years are being evicted because either they or a relative have complained about their care/a staff member or state of the home. They use the excuse of a resident going into hospital & then stating their needs have changed when they are due to return. They then refuse to have them back even though they don't tell you how their needs have changed. There is no appeal procedure & as we found out there is nothing you can do to get your loved one back to what they class as their home. People who suffer strokes or have other ailments do not like change in their lives & when moved usually die shortly after. Please sign this petition as hopefully we will grow old one day & may end up needing to live in a home ourselves. Vulnerable people need to be protected.",
