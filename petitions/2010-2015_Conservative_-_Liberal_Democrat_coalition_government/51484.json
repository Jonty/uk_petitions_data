We are aware you are co-conspiring with the Americans, taking private data about the people that decide your fate as a democratically elected party for what you say is in the public interest.\r\n\r\nThis data is open for misuse and there is a concern you or any successive government can use this information collected against us, even the non-incriminating information. You should not be using scare tactics against the people you need to be in power after the next general election!\r\n\r\nThis is why you must stop using PRISM immediately and write a law to prevent this kind of invasive espionage happening between the government and  the citizens of the United Kingdom.",
