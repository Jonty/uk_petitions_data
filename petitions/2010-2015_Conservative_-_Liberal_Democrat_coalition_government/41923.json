        "additional_details": "The Equality Act 2010 contains provisions that prohibit discrimination due to a combination of two protected characteristics. This would mean, for instance, that an organisation that treats white women and black men fairly, but treats black women unfairly, would be in breact of the Act. Without this provision, they could claim that they do not discriminate against black people, nor against women.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Government has chosen not to bring this provision into force, and has stated that they have no intention of doing so. We do not consider this acceptable, and believe that evidence of fair treatment of each characteristic separately should not be a defence against claims of discrimination against a person due to multiple protected characteristics.",
