        "additional_details": "We live in a volatile world.  Recently there has been a spate of executions by the Islamic State of British Citizens, the most recent being Alan Henning, an aid worker who was an innocent trying to help people in great need.  His executor was British.  Our government has promised justice for Alan's death.  This means prison and 3 square meals a day.  These murderers have no deterrent for their actions, no fear to prevent them carrying out such atrocities.  I propose that we reinforce Capital Punishment in such cases.  True justice to match the crime will perhaps deter these cowardly murderers from committing such horrors.  It is the family of the victims who suffer.  Our government must prove to us that they will not tolerate the murder of our own people.",
