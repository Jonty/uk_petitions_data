        "additional_details": "The DfT is planning to spend some \u00a345bn+ of what are realistically borrowed funds on HS2, a scheme to ease getting people into London.\r\n\r\nIn our opinion, this will lead to <>\r\n\r\n- More businesses centralising in London.\r\n\r\n- Loss of any supporting/complementary businesses from outside London.\r\n\r\n- Increased demand on transport links, allowing for premium fares for HS2, increased pricing (through higher demand) for non-HS2 services (normal rail, M6 Toll, etc.), and further increases of pressure on the road network.\r\n\r\n- Continuation of the imbalance in measures such as shop vacancies (<3% in London, nearly 30% in areas of the North West) and house prices.\r\n\r\nWe would like to see some investment into proper business outside London, near where people actually live/can afford to live, thereby reducing overall transport demands (and its carbon footprint), and allowing supporting/complementary businesses to regrow sustainably.\r\n",
