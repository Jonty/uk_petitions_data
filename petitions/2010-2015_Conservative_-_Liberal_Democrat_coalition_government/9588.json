The UK is virtually a secular country and where faith exists in our diverse population, religious days fall on a range of different days of the week. The UK should be permitted to become a fully functional and modern 24hour society.  There is no justification, logic or reason for prohibiting the length of time a larger shop can trade. The public includes day workers, night workers, shift workers. Current Sunday trading hours reduces choice and freedom, and stifles business innovation. I would like shops and businesses to be released from these archaic trading restrictions on Sundays.  Please sign to support, Thank you.\r\n",
