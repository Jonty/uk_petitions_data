        "additional_details": "Adhesions are scar tissue from infections/surgery which cause organs to stick together. Organs slide against one another but adhesions hinder this. They cause pain,infertility &obstructions. They affect 46% of c-sections meaning that severe formation can cause only 50% sucess rate when pregnant a 2nd time. It's costing 10 million|year as precautions aren't done, barriers unused & doctors aren't aware/educated enough on them. Patients return after surgery with a new problem but are told 'we can't see anything' and left suffering. I became ill from appendicitis that was ignored and caused my adhesions. Mine returned but couldve been avoided. I had to hunt for someone to believe me.Im petitioning to raise awareness, that barriers are used in surgery, this will save money/lives. It needs to be studied deeper in medicine & consultants/surgeons to fully be aware & take them SERIOUSLY. Help a girl make a difference there must be a prevention!\r\nThank you all      ",
