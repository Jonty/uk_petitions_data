However, MP's are now pushing to receive an 11% increase of their basic pay as was suggested by the I.P.S.A. This increase of over \u00a37,000 p.a. is in addition to the other generous expenses they can claim, from second houses to porn films and paper clips. They get subsidised meals and have even deferred their own pension contribution increases. Vote if you think this is abhorrently wrong as they've repeatedly told us 'we're all in this together'. They have to be brought to book and dragged out of the trough!",
