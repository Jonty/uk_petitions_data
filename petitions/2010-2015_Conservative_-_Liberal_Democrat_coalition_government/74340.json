At present anyone living in a dwelling attached to what appears to be vacant land, with no visible owners/caretakers, can apply for Adverse Possession rights through the Land Registry, once certain conditions are met. When this is granted the true owners only have recourse through Law to regain their land, with all the time and exorbitant expense involved. The law should be changed.",
