        "additional_details": "Today, 06/10/14 you will note roadworks causing chaos on the M23 & M25. Time and time again I note roadworks being carried out during peek traffic times, why? Surely it would make better sense to carry out this work outside of peek times not within the core hours of 8-5pm. Congestion caused by roadworks being carried out during core hours is damaging to the economy, staff arriving to work late business' suffer. Cars stuck in traffic on the road greater full consumption adverse affect on the environment. It is the belief of this petition and those who sign it that roadworks on major motorways should be mandatory carried out out of hours. ",
