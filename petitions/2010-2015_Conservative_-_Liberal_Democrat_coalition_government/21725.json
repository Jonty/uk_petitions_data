        "additional_details": "Too many get women get pregnant without being in a stable relationship and decide to keep the child for many different reasons even if a father does is against the pregnancy continuing. Males have no rights to make a decision in this and then the women go on to have children (costing the uk taxpayers money) and then taking the father for CSA money even though he decided the pregnancy was not for the best. The child is bought up without a father and the mother without support. Its easy for women to get carried away at the thought of having a baby and will do so at any cost. It is so easy for vulnerable men to get trapped into these situations which are not ideal circumstances for anybody involved. This also goes for theen who do not get a say in whether they would like to keep their unborn child. Please sign and give men a chance to have their say on abortion and save some children being born into a downward spiral. Thank you ",
