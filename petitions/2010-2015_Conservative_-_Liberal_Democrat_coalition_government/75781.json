Camden School for Girls is the only non-selective state school to teach Ancient Greek.\r\n\r\nThe government should provide the small amount of finance required to maintain access to this subject which should not be limited to a select number of schools.\r\n\r\nThe government have encouraged the teaching of ancient languages in primary schools and need to support the continuity of such teaching in schools such as Camden.\r\n\r\nThank you for your support.",
