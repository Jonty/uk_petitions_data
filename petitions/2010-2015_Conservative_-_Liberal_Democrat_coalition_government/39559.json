        "additional_details": "Women who have already arranged their working lives to retire fairly at age 60 are being denied their right.I refer to an age group of women who are being coldly swept aside by this government. Surely someone will see sense that we in this catagory with only 2 years to our 60th birthdays should not be denied our right to retire at that date. The length of time until our normal retirement age is too short to allow alternative  arrangements in our personal circumstances. Most of us have worked well over the governments threshold of 30 years. Please sign today to urge a change of heart from this government.",
