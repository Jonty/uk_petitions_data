The show would work by voters nominating the worst 20 MP's in the country.\r\n\r\nThey then appear on a TV show whereby they are set a number of Governmental tasks. If they fail these tasks, they are either booted off the show (hence losing their job) or go to a public vote in order to save their job. The winner of the show gets to keep their job and remain as an MP.\r\n\r\nNot only would this be fantastic entertainment, we would be able to weed out all of the poor MP's and keep the rest on their toes! It would also ensure that only the top candidates are selected by their constituencies.",
