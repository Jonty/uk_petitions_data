        "action": "Stop placing unnecessary obstacles in the way of the fracking industry, instead, support it with funds reallocated from inefficient green schemes",
        "additional_details": "This petition proposes that the government does not use a regulatory scheme that forces fracking to stop if a tremor of 0.5 magnitude on the Richter Scale is felt. This is as 0.5 is hundreds times less than 3.0 on the Richter Scale, which is considered the minimum for a tremor with noticeable surface effects. 0.5 magnitude can be produced by a hand grenade. It instead proposes that the German Safety Standard be used, with tremors of 1.7 magnitude being a cause for mitigation measures & caution, and 2.6 magnitude tremors being a cause for halting fracking.\r\n\r\nThis will bring a \u00a33.3 bn boost to the economy and bring energy costs down, which will help prevent so many of the Nation's elderly dying in the winter months.\r\n\r\nThis petition also demands the government redirect funds intended for green energy to the fledgling Fracking Industry. This will help it to develop quicker & allow it's benefits to be felt sooner. ",
