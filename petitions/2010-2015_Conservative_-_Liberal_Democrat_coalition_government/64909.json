        "additional_details": "Dog owners are required by law under the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 to clean up after their animal (exception: guide dogs for the blind). They are the only animal keepers who are required to do this. Any other animal, which is kept under the control of a human or for which a human is responsible, can foul a public place without consequences. This is obviously grossly unfair. Neither can it be argued that dog owners should have a special duty. Dog waste is surely not more harmful than the excrements of other carnivores (cats, ferrets, etc.). Nor would the amount of produced waste count as an argument. Much bigger animals, produce far more waste, e.g. horses, mules, cows, etc.\r\nSo, the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 is obviously unfair, regarding a dog owners duty to clean up dog mess.\r\nThe Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 should be changed to make all animal keepers responsible for their animals and require them to clean up animal waste.
