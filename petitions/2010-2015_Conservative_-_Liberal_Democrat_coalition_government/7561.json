        "additional_details": "Currently visitors to our country use our roads without charge, yet if we visit Europe we have to pay tolls and abide by their rules. Many of these vehicle's also purchase fuel before entering our shores - so again avoiding our taxation system on fuel.\r\nIf we were to introduce a taxation system this would raise much needed revenue.\r\nThis could be check at the dock side by the customs departments, and if needed issued with a charge to cover administration.\r\nAny charges made would allow our own haulage companies to complete against the foreign truck fleets, and would also ensure that every vehicle enters the country with valid insurance.\r\nMy suggestion would be:\r\n\u00a3100 per week Commercial Vehicle\r\n\u00a350 per week for Light Commercial Van and Caravans\r\n\u00a310 per week for Car\r\n",
