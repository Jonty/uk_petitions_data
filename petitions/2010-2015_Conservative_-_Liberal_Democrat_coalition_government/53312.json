The warranty is against the formation of corrosion (rust) on the vehicle.  But no car maker is honouring the warranty.  once the paintwork warranty which is a secondary warranty runs out (normally  3 years) the car maker will simply refuse to accept there is a problem because, in their own words to be called corrosion rust must come from the inside of the vehicle to the outside.  Not the other way round.  Corrosion is corrosion no matter which way it happens.  I would like the see a law passed which forces car manufactures to repair and replace rusted panels and parts on a car up to the full term of the warranty.  Regardless of a full dealer service history.  Cars should not rust within the length of the warranty!",
