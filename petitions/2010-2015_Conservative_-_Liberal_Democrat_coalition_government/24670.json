It annoys millions of Britons when they are told that they haven't plugged in a USB device when they know fine well that they have, an example of this is when a computer can't detect a webcam. They are told, without fear of contradiction that \"There is no webcam connected to the computer\", I personally believe that this is far too rude a way to treat computer users, I think that the government should work with computer companies to create a British operating system which would say something along the lines of \"I'm very sorry, I can't detect a webcam, my fault, not yours\". WAKE UP BRITAIN!",
