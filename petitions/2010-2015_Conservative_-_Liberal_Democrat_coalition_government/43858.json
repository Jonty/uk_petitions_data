        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the government to reject the STRB's proposals regarding teachers' pay.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the proposed rules will lead to a lower standard of education in Britain. They will drive good people away from the teaching profession by creating a competitive and demoralising work environment.\r\n\r\nThe government should reject the proposals, as the current system is fit for purpose, offers a clear system of rewards for good teachers and provides financial stability for schools and teachers alike.",
