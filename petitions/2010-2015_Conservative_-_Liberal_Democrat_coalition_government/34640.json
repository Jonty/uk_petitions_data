        "additional_details": "This e-petition is created to hopefully get all baby mocking pages removed from Facebook e.g Dead Baby Jokes page which mocks and ridicules not only dead and stillborn babies but is also racially and culturally abusive and also aims 'jokes' at abusing children.  We want the pages shut down and for Facebook to monitor groups and pages more closely.  This page had been allowed to continue to ridicule parents who go through the most horrendous & worst nightmare without being shut down and have a 'laugh' at the expense at the little memory we have left of our own flesh and blood.  We and thousands of others want these pages gone",
