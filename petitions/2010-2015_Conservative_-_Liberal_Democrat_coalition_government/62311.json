        "additional_details": "This petition is to stop all dogs from being let loose from their leads in public. Although some dogs may be pleasant around other dogs and other people, their behavior is unpredictable and nothing can be done to stop a dog attacking another dog or person if they are not on their lead.\r\n\r\nSimple things like keeping a dog on their lead may prevent a lot of bad things from happening. With a lot of dog attack stories in the headlines at the moment, now is the right time to bring this into action.\r\n\r\nIf a dog does try to attack somebody whilst on a lead, the owner will have more control over the dog rather than it being on its own away from the owner, where the owner will then have a limited time to get to the dog.",
