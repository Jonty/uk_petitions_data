        "additional_details": "BBC Light and Home Services were abandoned in 1967 to accommodate the modern teenage music.  Radio 1 was for the younger listener and Radio 2 was for the parents and grandparents.  There is currently no BBC radio station with music for those teenagers who are now the grandparents!  Radio 2 should be retained for the older listener and Radio 1 remain for the younger.  Most Radio 2 programmes are now inappropriate for our generation.  BBC should revert to its 1967 remit.  ",
