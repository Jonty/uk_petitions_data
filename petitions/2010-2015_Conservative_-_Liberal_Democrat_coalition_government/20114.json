        "additional_details": "It is becoming quite clear in the UK that our representative governments are not representing the people of this country, instead they are representing themselves, & corporate interests above all else.\r\nI propose a referendum on whether to change our political system to a Direct Democracy (Pure Democracy) similar to the system used in Switzerland with a single majority for town/city level policies & a double majority at national level.\r\n\r\nDouble majorities are, first, the approval by a majority of those voting, and, second, a majority of cantons in which a majority of those voting approve the ballot measure. A citizen-proposed law (i.e. initiative) cannot be passed in at the national level if a majority of the people approve but a majority of the cantons disapprove. For referendums or propositions in general terms (like the principle of a general revision of the Constitution), the majority of those voting is enough.",
