        "additional_details": "The Edinburgh City bypass is running at capacity and costing Scottish businesses and the Scottish economy tens of millions in wasted time on journeys. This needs to be upgraded to 3 lanes urgently.  A short term improvement could be:\r\n a) introducing variable speed limits using average speed cameras at peak times - this allows traffic to flow much more smoothly as, currently, due to the large number of junctions. average speeds vary causing (especially where vehcles join the carriageway) 'bunching' and 'backing up' and eventual loss of flow entirely. Average speed cameras would not prevent this entirely when the road is at peak capacity but it would reduce the time of 'loss of flow' substantially.\r\n b) Use of a hard shoulder during peak times, this is successful south of the border and could be tried here.\r\nThis would be an infrastructure project which would benefit the Scottish economy greatly.",
