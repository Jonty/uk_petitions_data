        "additional_details": "It is currently a statutory requirement for Local Authorities to advertise details of Listed Building Consent applications in the Local Press. In many cases this costs Local Authorities in excess of \u00a3100,000.00 p.a. This money could provide improved conservation consultancy services within Local Authorities. With the advent of web based information services this requirement has little or no use in the modern context.\r\nThis requirement should be abolished.",
