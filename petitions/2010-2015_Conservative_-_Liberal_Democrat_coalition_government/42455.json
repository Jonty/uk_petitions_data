I dread to think of the number of trees that are felled in order to provide agents with posts which could easily be removed and re-used.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to encourage the government to take action:\r\n\r\n1. Estate and Lettings Agents shall be required to number their posts, keep a log showing where their posts and boards are located and when they were removed.\r\n\r\n2. When a property is sold, let or under contract the board shall be removed within seven days and re-used by the agent.\r\n\r\n3. Parish Councils to be given the power to inspect board logs upon request, serve notice for removal and fine those in breach of the legislation with revenue retained for work within the parish.\r\n",
