Some taxi companies in the south has already got this system to stay in record all the time but not other parts of the UK for example the north east, only a couple of taxis in the north east hold at least 2 cctv cameras. Somewhere in the north east was held at knife point in 2014 in result of drunken behaviour  after a night out now if this man had cctv in his car then they would of been able to use that for evidence.\r\n\r\nI believe that cctv cameras should be mandatory to keep the drivers safe from idiots they are only doing heir job ",
