I am a student and as guilty as many others, but there are huge repercussions of drinking alcohol that we should be actively educated on immediately.\r\n\r\nThis is fundamental to the health and well-being of a huge portion of the population, and a fundamental action which should be taken to improve public awareness of the regulated substances which are being ingested, often on a daily basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
