        "additional_details": "The government must review the lights out policy for residential streets in Adur. We are unable to use late trains and night bus services as the walk from the stops after midnight is now too dangerous. Shift workers are making their journeys in dangerous unlit conditions and dog fouling has increased ten fold as under the blanket of darkness owners can not be seen being irresponsible owners. This results in pedestrians walking on the roads in both light and dark to avoid the dog foul. I believe there will be a serious incident if we don't turn the lights back on.",
