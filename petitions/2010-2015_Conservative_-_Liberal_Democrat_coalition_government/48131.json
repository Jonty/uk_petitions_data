        "additional_details": "That HM Government reinstate the funding for the rebuilding of schools. If the National Curriculum is to be updated for the twenty-first century then it is not right for this to take place in buildings which were built before the First World War as these are not conducive to learning; they are often cold, draughty, ill- lit by windows and lack the flexibility which modern buildings possess. It is also unfair to compare the performance of children in very old buildings with those children in new, bright, modern and better designed buildings.",
