        "additional_details": "Lowestoft has two bridges, one in Oulton Broad and the other in town. We can spend an hour in traffic jams when these bridges are used. We need a third crossing, located between these two bridges so the bottlenecks that are created end for good. If we all sign this petition, we will demonstrate how frustrated the people of Lowestoft are. We have waited forty years for a new bridge, which is too long to wait! We have been ignored for too long so sign this so we can change things for the better.",
