        "additional_details": "As someone who travels on the tube a lot I have noticed that many tube stops do not have access to them besides escalators/stairs. As someone who has a disability that does not allow me to use escalators I am often stuck in my use of the tube.\r\n\r\nI have noticed the same thing with other people who are disabled and have trouble using the escalators.\r\n\r\nI have seen mothers put their buggies/pushchairs/prams into dangerous situations because they can't get on to the tube without taking the escalator.\r\n\r\nI have seen people who are using crutches or other supports to walk with get into uncomfortable positions just so they can get on the escalator.\r\n\r\nWhat I am asking for is that lifts be added to all tube stops. Or at least all major tube stops to make mobility easier for the people who would like to use it. It would be much safer this way for mothers with babies, people with disabilities and others who may need them. ",
