        "additional_details": "There are more than enough parking spaces in the Woodside area for everyone to park on their own roads.  So lets ask the question why is the council insisting on making us pay to park outside our own homes?  The first and most obvious reason is money, the fact that we will have to pay for the permits proves that this is a money making scheme, surely if it was to keep non residents from parking in our roads then why not give us the permits for free - there is no reason to pay for them.  Now, lets look at non residents, if it is to deter commuters then why the all day restriction?  Surely a two hour slot (like in Crouch End) would be enough to deter them.  So let's say it's to stop people parking up to go shopping in Wood Green, first of all they are looking at just under a one mile walk, so no point in that, also if it is to deter shoppers, then why are the proposed restrictions only Monday to Friday, when 99% of shoppers do it on the weekend?",
