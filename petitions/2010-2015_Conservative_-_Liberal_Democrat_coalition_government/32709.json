The Head of State to be renamed to a modern name such as President or Leader. Judicial Activism to be endorsed in the UK Courts, and clear separation of power between judicial hands and political ones by virtue of new legislation introduced by the Government thereby providing a country based on law and not democracy: unpopular decisions will be made and observed as they may be upheld by the Court.\r\n\r\nSupport for these measures in this forum shall be a \"vote\" for change, modernisation, to make Britain a fighting force in a global market.",
