        "action": "Scrap Renewable Obligation Certificates",
        "additional_details": "The Government should stop all payments of Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) for intermittent supplies of renewable electricity. This kind of electricity relies on fossil and nuclear generated electricity to provide back up for up to 75% of the year.\r\n\r\nCoal, for example, will run out as early as 2035 and there will be no more constant supply of electricity if there is nothing left to burn including all bio-fuels.\r\n\r\nBy supporting this petition you are forcing the renewable energy industry to invent and develop non-intermittent supplies of electricity without burning anything to ensure the planet's survival for future generations.\r\n\r\nDoing nothing will ensure that we will have obsolete wind turbines and no electricity\r\n\r\nVote Now before it is too late",
