        "additional_details": "After the recent riots in the United Kingdom David Cameron put a part blame on \"Absent Fathers\" Both this government, the Labour government before and the Conservative Government before that have side stepped a major floor in the family courts system that there are many fathers out there that actually want to be involved in there child's life on and equally shared basis to their ex-partner only for the family courts system to deny them that right because Judges are either to afraid to make a decision or need a direct bill passed through parliament. Many High Court Judges are now approving shared parenting as the future, however this needs to be pushed through to the commons that family law must be looked at now and the decades old children act 1989 must be totally re - written.\r\nPlease sign this petition and kindly ask anyone you know who feels strongly about this to sign it.\r\nThank You",
