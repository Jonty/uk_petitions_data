        "additional_details": "Lets have a referendum in the UK on a new voting system to ensure people know who and what they are voting for. Simply allow us to introduce a system for which a vote is made, but only counts if the voter can pass a simple multiple choice test on what the different parties represent. This in no way infringes a persons right to vote, it merely ensures that only votes from informed people count (anyone can research this - and in reality should be well enough informed) to pass this test.",
