        "additional_details": "It is irresponsible to cancel construction of a third runway at Heathrow, when it is already very congested & inevitable that soon will not be fit for purpose. A hub airport is analogous to a large central rail/ bus station, with huge enormous opportunities & facilities for connection/transfer onto other hubs or regional stations or airports. A major London airport should be always a hub airport as befits a major capital city of the world. Airports on artificial islands would reduce noise & smog pollution, congestion & acting as a barrier against flooding. There is already a design for a \u00a320bn four-runway airport (twice the capacity of Heathrow) in the Thames estuary. Another \u00a330bn to build an integrated transport links, a new tidal wave power generating station & a four-track high speed rail route system that circle London, linking the airport. This will be money well spent on acquiring real estate & infrastructure for UK, stimulating industry, economic activities, employment, etc.",
