Small children and adults alike run the gauntlet of encountering dog mess while using our beaches.\r\n\r\nLast summer, in a half mile stretch of beach it was almost impossible to avoid either standing in it or scooping it up from just under the surface while playing with the little ones making sand castles or pitching a wind break.\r\n\r\nThis petition is for complete ban of all dogs from our beaches during spring and summer and force councils to enforce and heavily fine those ignoring and breaking any existing rules and to implement such rules where they do not exist.\r\n",
