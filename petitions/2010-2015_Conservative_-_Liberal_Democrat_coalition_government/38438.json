As with other public sector workers such as Police- they cannot seek additional private consultancy work, we believe that the same rules should apply to Judges in England and Wales.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to act regarding the legal  loopholes that allow Judges to obtain additional consultancy work.\r\n",
