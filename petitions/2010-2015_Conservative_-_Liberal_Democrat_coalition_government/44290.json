It\u2019s time we made a stand against these archaic laws and took steps to reshape our own future by bringing them into the 21st century.\r\n\r\nIn a time when, as a nation, we have never been more open minded, liberal in our views and passionate for what we believe in why can't we get all just get naked?\r\n\r\nWe have the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, freedom of press; why shouldn't we gasp in awe at the natural sexy bodies out there?\r\n\r\nShagatUni.com believes that it\u2019s time to stop being prudish about something that is so natural. The human form is a beautiful thing and we were all born into this world naked. As a nation, let\u2019s be proud of the beauty of the human body and show off what we were born with before we become a nation of prudes!",
