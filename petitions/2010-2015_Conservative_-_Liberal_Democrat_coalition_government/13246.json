        "additional_details": "Over the years school playing fields have been sold off and less time has been devoted to physical activity, especially team games.   This does nothing to combat obesity.   It does not help our national standing in the field of football, cricket, rugby and other games.  It is detrimental to the general education of boys particularly, for whom team games provide a constructive outlet for their energies, encourage co-operative endeavour and respect for leadership.\r\n\r\nThe Government is urged to adopt and implement a policy that will ensure all schools have access to playing fields and that a minimum of one and half hours a week is given over in the timetable to competitive sports and team games.",
