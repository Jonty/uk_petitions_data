We have talked to industry and have been alerted to the concerns of those effected. We are very grateful for the feedback received.\r\n\r\nSo far, the Commission proposal has been discussed in a series of working groups chaired by the Cypriot Presidency.\r\n\r\nWe have expressed reservations about the Commission proposal in the strongest terms both at working groups and more recently at the EU Transport Council. At Council the Minister was clear in stating that we believe that there are many elements of the proposal that result in unnecessary costs and bureaucratic burdens being incurred while failing to result in significant improvements to road safety in the UK. This includes aspects of the proposal dealing with the historic vehicles and the way vehicle modifications should be treated.\r\n\r\nThe UK has and will continue to oppose those measures that place unreasonable burdens on businesses or citizens.",
