        "additional_details": "I am calling on the government to help motorists by removing the average speed restrictions extension on the A13 Tms Gway/Kent Av to A13 by Scrat Terr IG11.This extension is a speed trap for innocent motorists because it\u2019s been put on the section of the A13 where there is a national speed of 70MPH, which suddenly becomes 50MPH for the average speed cameras.There are no signs leading up to the average speed camera.This has caught out many innocent motorists because they have extended this section without any warning. A lot of drivers are not aware of this new extension and are driving towards the old average speed restriction starting point.Therefore by the time they slowed down for the original speed restriction starting point they have already exceeded the average speed limit.This is just a moneymaking scheme by the local authority (Barking and Dagenham ) who are more interested in making money than the safety of motorists.They have breached our human rights to use the roads safely.",
