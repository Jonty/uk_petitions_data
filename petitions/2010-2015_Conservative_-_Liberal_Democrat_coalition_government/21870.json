        "additional_details": "I want the government to look at increasing their control in the use of Xenostrogens in foods/food packaging/personal products and also look at ways to remove them from our water supply at sewage treatment plants so there is less impact on wildlife.\r\n\r\nXenoestrogens have been linked to a range of unwanted health issues and problems, from reduced sperm counts in men to a potential increased risk of breast cancer for women as well as early maturing of young girls.\r\n\r\nXenoestrogens are increasingly becoming a health concern among experts. They are in our water due to being in the urine of women on the pill, they are in the food chain via the use of certain plastics like phthalates etc used in packaging / cooking utensils; food additives (including sweets), non-organic meat and dairy products; they are in personal care products such as lotions, shampoos, soaps conditioners etc; they are also found in some insecticides, herbicides and fertilisers.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
