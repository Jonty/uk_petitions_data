        "additional_details": "Many patients with hypothyroidism continue to have symptoms on levothyroxine (T4) but find that their symptoms are often greatly reduced when they take liothyronine (T3) or natural desiccated thyroid.\r\n\r\nNatural desiccated thyroid is only manufactured in the US and Canada but can be prescribed in the UK on a \u201cnamed patient\u201d basis.  Many doctors will not prescribe it because there are no randomised controlled trials as it was manufactured before licensing of medicines came into being.\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that some patients have benefited from natural desiccated thyroid but there needs to be more research done to investigate whether this would be a better treatment for patients.\r\n\r\nMore research also needs to be done on the addition of T3 to T4 because previous research has been inconclusive.\r\n",
