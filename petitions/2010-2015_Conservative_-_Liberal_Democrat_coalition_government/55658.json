        "additional_details": "All of us suffer from trucks and cars that no longer care about speed limits, this is symptomatic of a non caring society but it should matter in one key area. 30 and 20 MPH limits are to protect the most vulnerable and enhance quality of life to the residents living there.\r\n\r\nAnyone breaking the 30MPH speed limit by more than 3MPH should receive an instant driving ban of 4 weeks, for 20MPH 2MPH over the speed limit same penalty. for second offence 8 week ban and so on. This will allow people to claim back their communities from commuters and hauliers.\r\n\r\nAlso any company found over 30MPH has their truck operating licence revoked for 4 weeks, i.e. Co Op truck doing 34 MPH in a 30 MPH no CoOp trucks operate for 4 weeks same for Tesco Tarmac etc.\r\n\r\nIn the case of vans the company will send all driving staff on a compulsory speed training course every time a penalty is issued to one of their drivers\r\n\r\nLet the people re claim our villages and  housing estates",
