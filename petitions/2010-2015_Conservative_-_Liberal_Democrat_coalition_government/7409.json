Approx. 60,000 prisoners are jailed for <12 months; costing taxpayers \u00a3300m; an average of 6 weeks at \u00a34,500. 60% reoffend within a year, with social/economic cost forecast at >\u00a37bn a year.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to ease an overcrowding system with 82,000 prisoners, and contribute to society is to consider how the criminal can re-contribute with not a prison term sentence but a monetary term sentence.\r\nE.g. instead of a 2-year driving sentence; with the usual ban/points -- A two-year reduced income sentence with ... increased national insurance, increased income tax, higher savings tax, benefits reduction; of which to contribute to the taxpayer/victim, rather than a jail sentence and a bill.\r\n\r\nIt would take a short period of time for criminals to understand they face the negative from their actions.",
