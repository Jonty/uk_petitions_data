We currently have a culture which gives free handouts with little incentive to change for those receiving benefits. Everyone who is physically able to work must do full-time community volunteer work. We can help the country, and help the people on benefits find at least a working lifestyle, give them work experience, and in the long term save billions in benefit payments as the culture of free handouts is removed.\r\n\r\nI propose full time work for the community, in return for benefits from the community,  for all those physically able to work.",
