Well I would like to make a stand about Free From Food products need to be controlled and brought into alignment with the regular foods.\r\n\r\nI am Lactose and Wheat intolerant, and my loaf of bread costs avg \u00a33.00, regular loaf costs \u00a30.75 that is a 400% increase! This is normal and is NOT fair\r\n\r\nBeing a vegetarian is a choice which is highly catered for, however intolerances are a way of life and have the choice taken away.\r\n\r\nWe need Free From Products to be limited on the cost and not to be taken advantage of.",
