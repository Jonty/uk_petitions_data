        "additional_details": "My mother in her 70's worked in the UK for over 50 years and contributed to the UK. She received almost zero in benefits from the state. A distant relative of similar age worked all his life in Arabia paid no tax to the UK and has saved all his cash overseas. He has recently claimed EC nationality through a loophole via a Portuguese passport as he is Indian origin but was from an old Portuguese colony. When he comes over he never declares he has savings overseas but gets a free bus pass and NHS and benefits. IS THIS FAIR TO MY MUM. STOP ALL RECENT EU NATIONALITIES CLAIMING BENEFITS HERE UNLESS THEY HAVE CONTRIBUTED AT LEAST 10YEARS OR ARE OF UK ORIGIN>",
