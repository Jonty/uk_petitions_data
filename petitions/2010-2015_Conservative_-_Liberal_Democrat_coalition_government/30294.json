        "additional_details": "We the undersigned want more frequent local trains for Greater Bristol and the surrounding region. We believe the Great Western Franchise specification should include Four track at Filton Bank, a commitment to re-open the Portishead Line and the expectation of frequent, half-hourly trains across the network with high-quality modern rolling stock. Bristol and Bath are the best used stations on the Great Western with 90 per cent growth around Bristol. We need more capacity and we need more trains.",
