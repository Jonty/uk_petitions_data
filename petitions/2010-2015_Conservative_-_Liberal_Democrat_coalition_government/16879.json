        "additional_details": "In the USA there was a law called the \"Stolen Valor Act\" which was passed in 2006 (but subsequently repealed due to being against their Constitution).\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom we have no such act or law and this is causing uproar in the Military and Civilian communities alike.\r\n\r\nMany Military veterans feel that these fakes (Walts as they are known - named after Walter Mitty who is a fictional character) are doing a grand disservice to the Services and everything that they stand for,\r\n\r\nMany civilians also dislike these fakes as they use the stories to create sympathy and con people. In a fair amount of cases these fakes have also done the 11th November Parade which aggravates the Royal Legion and the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nPlease bring in a law which makes it illegal to claim military service and medals to which people are not entitled too.",
