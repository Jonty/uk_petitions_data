        "action": "Abolish the fines parents receive for taking their children on holiday in term time.",
        "additional_details": "Families are facing fines based on the new laws implemented in September 2013, head teachers are no longer allowed to authorise up to 10 days leave for holidays and now if parents take their child/ren on holiday parents face a \u00a360 fine per parent, per child! This is unfair to all, those on low incomes can't afford holidays outside of term time due to high prices and parents will struggle to get joint time off especially if an employer has several employees with school age children. If a child has excellent attendance then a one week holiday will not cause issues with schooling, as long as it's not in exam time. This new legislation is threatening families with the prospect of not being able to go on holiday! Give headteachers the discretion back!",
