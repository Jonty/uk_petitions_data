This is perhaps the unions last chance to come up with a solution to the discontent with the current system before it is too late.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to ask the government that a public consultation on the future of the United Kingdom be launched so that the people of this nation get their say on our future. With the final report, conclusion or proposal for the United Kingdom being put to the people in the form of a referendum, taking our future out of the hands of the politicians.\r\n\r\nSigning this petition is not an endorsement of any particular plan for the United Kingdom such as a federal union, an English parliament or so on. A signature is simply a message to the government that we the people want the say on the future of our United Kingdom. ",
