        "additional_details": "I am petitioning for what some may call a radical change in the UK calendar. I am proposing that the ideas and traditions of Christmas be changed to \"the worlds birthday\". Christmas will remain the same i.e Christmas dinner, Christmas tress, decorations, however NO PRESENTS. Instead, UK residents will celebrate \"the worlds birthday\" which will take place on New Years day when PRESENTS WILL BE EXCHANGED. The economy will not be affected, neither will school holidays, most tradition etc. All it will be is a slight change of tradition on that day in that celebrations will be more focused on the real meaning of Christmas for Christians. I am not a Christian myself but everyone wins here. It's really very simple! I would like the government to consider these proposals and see how they benefit everyone. Traditions change all the time, why not now? ",
