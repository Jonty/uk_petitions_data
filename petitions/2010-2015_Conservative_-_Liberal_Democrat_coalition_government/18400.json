        "additional_details": "Charity funding by the government  is often used by foreign criminals and war lords under the the name international aid. Charities such as Oxfam just mean that a country relies on aid for its survival. They distort the economy of the country receiving aid. By giving international aid the UK is ensuring a country only knows how to recieve hand outs rather than develop its own economy. For example, African doctors are being trained by UK charities but then working in  the UK NHS. Yet charities do not complain about that as long as they get their money.",
