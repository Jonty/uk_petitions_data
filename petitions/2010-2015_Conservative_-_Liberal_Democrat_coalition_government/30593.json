        "additional_details": " We are concerned about the inadequate response of Liverpool Football Club (LFC) to the findings by the FA regulatory commission that determined Luis Suarez was guilty of racially insulting Manchester United player, Patrice Evra.  LFC's actions, in rejecting the findings of the FA inquiry, their public displays of support for a player found guilty of racist abuse and his subsequent refusal to shake Evra\u2019s hand is unacceptable and has led to an increase in racist incidents at football matches.\r\nWe call on the Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport to table a debate in parliament on the issues, work with the FA, anti-racist and black and minority ethnic (BME) organisations to root out racism in football through a programme of action so that recent events are not repeated,  seek a public apology for Evra from LFC, organise an International conference on the issue of eradicating racism in football in partnership with anti-racist and BME organisations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
