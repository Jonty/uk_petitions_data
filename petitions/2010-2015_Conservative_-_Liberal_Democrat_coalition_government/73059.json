Cutting bus services will result in the most vulnerable in our society being isolated, depriving them of access to shops, services and health. This cut targets the elderly, disabled, those with children and the poor.\r\n\r\nHands off Our Bus Services!!\r\n\r\nTown services identified for closure: Armagh,   Ballyclare, Ballynahinch, Banbridge, Carrickfergus, Cookstown, Downpatrick, Enniskillen, Limavady,  Magherafelt, Newcastle, Newtownabbey, Omagh and Strabane. Other services to be cut: Antrim, Ballymena, Bangor, Dungannon, Lurgan, Portadown and Newry.",
