        "additional_details": "Milton Keynes currently offers a portage service to children with disabilites which picks up needs before they go to school and helps them to develop to be able to go into mainstream schools. It is a very valuable service which if not provided will mean that children with special needs will be set back in their development. We are supposed to be moving forward with helping children with special needs and intergrating them into society no moving 20 years back. I would like to goverment to insist thank Milton Keynes council stop this reform going ahead.",
