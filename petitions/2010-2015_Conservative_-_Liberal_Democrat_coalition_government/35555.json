        "additional_details": "The multi-stage fitness test introduced in April 2001 for all new entry level prison officers should be abolished. The test is unfair to staff joining after this date and discriminatory against both mature and female officers.\r\nThe prison service fitness test is neither age nor gender specific (as are the fitness tests used by the armed forces) and has only resulted in the loss of some very good and capable officers.\r\n",
