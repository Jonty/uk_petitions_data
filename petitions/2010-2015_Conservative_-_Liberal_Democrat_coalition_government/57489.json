They rarely give a straight honest answer to the question asked.\r\n\r\nI propose that a new law is created that makes it an offence for a politician to evade, avoid or  refuse to answer truthfully any question of National Matters excluding National Security that they can reasonably be expected to know when availing themselves to television media voluntarily.\r\nThis offence should be deemed against public interest and made a criminal offence with a mandatory prison sentence of a minimum of seven days. Any member of the voting public should be allowed to bring this charge to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Malicious unfounded charges brought by the public should be subject to the same penalty  that applies to offending politicians.\r\n",
