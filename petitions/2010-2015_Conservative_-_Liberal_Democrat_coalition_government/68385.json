Without aid, these displaced people risk fear of starving to death within 24 hours and there are claims this Yazidi community could be wiped out if the necessary aid is not supplied.\r\n\r\nAccording to an Al-Jazeera report, 70 children have already died of thirst (06/08/2014).\r\nIn addition, approximately 500 Yazidi men have been killed and 500 women abducted by the Islamic State group.\r\n\r\nPLEASE SIGN. THESE PEOPLE DESPERATELY NEED OUR HELP. WITHOUT IT TENS OF THOUSANDS CAUGHT IN A HARSH CONFLICT RISK DEATH BY STARVATION, THIRST, AND MURDER. ",
