        "additional_details": "As people know the rules on car tax are changing. One change is that when ever you buy a new car (also used cars) you the buyer have re tax the car, even if the previous owners tax would still be vaild for how ever long.\r\nThis is pure rubbish, there is no need to change the way we tax our vehicles, it is just a way for the government to earn even more money! It will also mean harder business for local dealers (as they will have to re tax every car they buy to sell! owners won't be able to sell their car for quite as much.\r\nPlease sign this petition if you agree this certain new tax law should be abolished!
