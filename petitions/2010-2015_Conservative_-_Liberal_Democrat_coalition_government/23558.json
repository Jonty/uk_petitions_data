        "additional_details": "Small children in cars are dangerous. Their incessant cries of \"Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?\" are clearly a distraction to drivers who are forced to turn around - thus taking their eyes off the road - in order to slap said children about the knees (if such action is still legal) whilst shouting \"Shut up!\"\r\n\r\nSmall children in cars are far more distracting than mobile phones and smoking.\r\n\r\nTherefore they should be banned from cars and forced to either walk or get the bus. This will have the added bonus of forcing the little fatties to get some much needed exercise.",
