        "additional_details": "I am appalled by the lack of action being taken against the perpetuators and those in a position of responsibility who allowed such abuse to take place.  If we can go to war over human rights abuses in another country why is it so difficult to start properly tackling such horrific abuses in our own country. Senior councilors, police officers, care workers and head teachers who ignored repeated cries for help, or blatantly covered up the abuse or failed to act when a crime was reported to them should be investigated and prosecuted. Otherwise the victims suffering will continue and more scandals will emerge in the future. I do not want to live in a society where it is acceptable for thousands of young girls to be repeatedly raped, beaten up or abused. Some real action needs to happen now. Every victim should be given proper support and the opportunity to have their case properly investigated by a different police force",
