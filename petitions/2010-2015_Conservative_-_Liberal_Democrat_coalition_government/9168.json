        "additional_details": "Currently vehicles are tested when they reach the third anniversary of registration, and are then tested annually (so called 3-1-1). The government (DfT) has proposed a change to first test at four years and then retest every other year (4-2-2) and claim it would \"reduce the burden on the motorist\". It is hard to see what this burden is. The current test is a vital part of keeping the UK's cars safe, road-worthy and environmentally compliant. Any reduction in testing would lead to increased road casualties (deaths and serious injuries), increased pollution, and have employment consequences. The system was reviewed in 2008 and seen to be appropriate and any relaxation in testing seen as unrealistic. Let's stop this ill-considered proposal before its too late!",
