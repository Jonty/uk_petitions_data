        "additional_details": "To reduce the legitimacy and influence of religion in society by calling it\u2019s precedence  to an end. This isn\u2019t to oppress or persecute those with religious beliefs, it would simply mean that if they wish to believe in a magic man in the sky, it won't be recognised in culture. If you said \u2018Elvis lives\u2019, in a job interview, you'd lose favour. The same doesn\u2019t apply to religion because it is given a disproportionate amount of respect. Sign this if you wish to make faith in society negligible. ",
