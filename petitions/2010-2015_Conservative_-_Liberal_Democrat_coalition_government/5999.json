        "additional_details": "Although we have no objection to the party system of politics Per Se  we do regard the use of the whip system within the house of commons and the house of lords to be against a true democracy. Elected members should be free to vote on matters which effect their constituents in the manner in which they believe their constituents would want them to. A recent example is the fact that many Derbyshire MPs would wish to vote against the tendering of the rail contract to Seimans but were forbidden to do so due to the party whip system. We believe that all members of parliament should act on behalf of the voters and not on behalf of a handful of powerful grey suits at the head of each party. By removing the whip then democracy would in our opinion be one step closer.",
