        "additional_details": "Tennants have limited to no rights whatsoever when signing a new tennancy agreement. When a new tennant arrives to the accomodation they have paid for the tennant should be allowed a 15 day cooling off period if the accomodation does not meet the standards the tennant requires.\r\n\r\nLandlords have all the rights possible, while tennants have virtually none. A tennancy agreement is incredibly difficult if not impossible to break. Most countries have a 15 day cooling off period to allow the tennant to change their mind if they need to.\r\n\r\nI propose the Government enshrine into law the right for a tennant to legally break the contract without incuring any legal action or penalty.",
