        "additional_details": "The government has issued 105 licences to private companies for non- acute/emergency work in healthcare.  It is also suggested that Mental Healthcare will soon be shaped along the same paramenters as the probation service.  Theses type of creeping changes are, then, cash cows for private speculators.  Please sign this petition if you agree that nhs services are owned by the taxpayer (since 1947) and if anyy tendering or shares issues take place it should be within a local co-operative model where users are, effectively - the stakeholders.  Thanks",
