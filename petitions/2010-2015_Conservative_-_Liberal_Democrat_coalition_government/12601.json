They allow the public to learn, understand and appreciate the past and heritage in a friendly and well maintained environment.\r\n\r\nSome museums however  are starting to charge, in the belief that this will maintain the standards we so foundly love. This does not need to be case; these alongside Art Galleries can generate funds in exibitions, work days and other projects without the need for an admission fee.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of the past and the passion, excitement  and an intrigue for art does not need a price. Let Museums and Art Galleries be free!",
