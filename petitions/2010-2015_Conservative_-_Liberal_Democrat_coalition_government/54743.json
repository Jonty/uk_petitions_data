What this means is that they are potentially being paid less than the UK minimum wage when it is averaged out over a day/week etc.  There are around 2 million care workers in the UK and around 10% received less than the current UK national minimum wage due to unpaid travel.\r\nI would like to have it made law that companies pay all their employees atleast the minimum wage for all time spent on the road traveling between customers/clients/site etc.\r\n ",
