        "additional_details": "We believe that good quality compulsory sex and relationship education is needed in order to educate young people, not only about safe sex or the dangers of sexually transmitted infections but about the importance of stable relationships.\r\n\r\nYoung people have been consistently let down by the poor standard or complete lack of sex and relationship education. Britain has the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Europe and one of the highest STI rates in Europe, its time we changed this; the only way is with compulsory sex and relationship education from primary school. In the Netherlands SRE is taught from age 5 and they have the lowest teenage pregnancy rates in Europe, this is down to the education they receive.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the government to instate compulsory sex and relationship education from primary school.",
