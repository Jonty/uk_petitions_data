I believe if we were to make real steps to equality this practise should be banished from our society . I propose that all \"groups\" or \"therapy sessions\" for the purposes of turn a gay men/woman straight should be made illegal in the U.K . We claim to live in a very liberal country and I will only believe this if this law is put in place . These groups are physiologically damaging and push people in to denial and have no place in the modern world",
