        "additional_details": "The number of Root treatments has dropped since the new contract for NHS dentists has been in place. The contract provides the same financial support to dentists as it would for a single filling or extraction. This makes it difficult for dentists to provide the highest quality root treatments because the procedure is a highly skilled, time consuming and expensive in terms of materials (single use).\r\n\r\nIncreased financial support would mean that NHS dentists can provide high quality root treatments and in turn help to maintain the natural dentition of the general population.",
