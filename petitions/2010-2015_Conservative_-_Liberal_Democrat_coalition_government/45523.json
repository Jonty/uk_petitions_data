        "additional_details": "I as a Born-Again Christian I would like to contest against the Government Approval of marriage within gay people which I understand has taken place today.  In the eyes of God this is WRONG.  God created man and woman for marriage and not man and man or woman and woman...  God Help them and the future generation.  This whole thing makes me sick.   I hope and pray that people will come to their common senses and do the RIGHT thing.\r\nGod is the Master of every human being and He is the Master of every thing.  God is Able and He can TURN THINGS AROUND.  We serve a Living and Loving God.  Every one shall account for their actions, there will be a judgement day.  I plead with you HM Government and Members of the Parliament\r\nto give this some very deep and careful thought and re-consider.  Brothers and Sisters in Christ, please join me in this e-petition, all for the Glory of our Heavenly Father.  Amen.",
