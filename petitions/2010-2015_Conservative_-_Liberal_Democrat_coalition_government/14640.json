        "additional_details": "\"From May 2011 a new privacy law came into effect across the EU. The law requires that  websites ask visitors for consent to use most web cookies.\" This requirement has a huge impact on the web industry. There is a negative impact on the usability of websites as users now have to confirm that they are happy for the site to create cookies. There is a negative impact on cost to make websites as developers need to allow extra time to implement this functionality which in turn harms this part of the economy. There is a negative impact on improvements to sites as measurements will not necessarily reflect most users' behaviour. This law was created to help privacy but has been poorly thought through. The undersigned move that the law be rescinded or altered to include an allowance for analytics pertaining to the owner of the url/website that the user is currently visiting.\r\n\r\nMore info on the law can be found at http://www.silktide.com/cookielaw",
