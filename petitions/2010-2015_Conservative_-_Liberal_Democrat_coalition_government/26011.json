        "additional_details": "Since the economic downturn the UK has seen high unemployment numbers especially with our youth, With the number of youth not in education employment or training approaching 3 million, Action should be taken to get them into work asap, I don't want to typecast but youths without money are more likely to commit criminal acts than old people! Meanwhile old people often give free childcare when parents have to work. Wouldn't lowering the retirement age open places for our younger members of society to get started!? Wouldn't they be more productive workers than a our weary elders!? Idle hands do the devils work, Get our youth into work and allow our old dears to retire just a year or so early, I don't expect this to be a permanent measure but doing this for just a year or two could: Boost moral, Get young people into work, Boost business production, Lower youth crime, And allow pensioners to offer free childcare to their loved ones.",
