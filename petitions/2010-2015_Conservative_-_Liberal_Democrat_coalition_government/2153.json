        "additional_details": "I propose we withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights and introduce HARD LABOUR in all prisons.\r\n\r\nMake prisoners generate electricity by taking shifts running on treadmills and if they stay out of trouble then they can be rewarded by working in sweat shops making goods that would normally be produced in the far east.\r\n\r\nThey will be paying back to society so reducing sentences for economic reasons will not be necessary. In fact sentences should be increased from where they are now.\r\n\r\nAll luxuries like playstations and tellies should be taken away and only basic food and shelter provided.\r\n\r\nIf all these measures are taken reoffending rate will go down - I promise!!!!",
