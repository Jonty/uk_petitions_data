        "additional_details": "\r\nType 1 and Type 2 diabetes are different - but the media treats both conditions as the same. Articles complaining of burdensome diabetics draining NHS resources are harmful and hurtful and are refering to patients with often preventable Type 2 diabetes, but the media frequently fail to make this distinction prefering the single term diabetics. There are approximately 2.6 million diabetics in the UK and of these it is estimated that 350,000 have Type 1.  The name of Type 1 diabetes should be changed so that sufferers can be treated fairly and with the seriousness the condition deserves.\r\n We also wish for Type 1 Diabetes to be recognised as a chronic disease and that of Pancreatic failure.",
