        "additional_details": "My hope is stop anti islamic pages on facebook , which are inciting hate towards islam. Islam is a tolenrant and peaceful religion, calling Mohammed a dog na' uz' billah. When reports are made to report these pages facebook does not deem these pages as inciting hate towards islam. They post pictures that are so obscene that friends who are non_muslim were in shock and disgusted.  I believe facebook should either block these people behind these pages or we will take matters further. There is freedom of speech but to incite hate is absolutely out of order.\r\n",
