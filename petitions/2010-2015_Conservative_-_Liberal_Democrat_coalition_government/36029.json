Will G4S suffer severe financial penalties for this? The ministry of defence has deployed some three thousand soldiers at short notice to cover this. Will G4S be forced to compensate late changes in holidays,weddings or any other financial losses incurred by these soldiers or anyone closely associated with them.\r\nHow do you compensate for emotional stress?\r\nI would like to see HM Government enforce these charges and ensure G4S are not listed for any tender contracts in the future.\r\n  ",
