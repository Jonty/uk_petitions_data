With a \"Do your bit\" approach we could boost morale by encouraging every house hold to sell \u00a3100 worth of second hand goods online (ebay) to a foreign buyer. Anything could be sold and it would bring in foreign money into the country and give the system a boost. If 60 million people gaining \u00a3100 from abroad might help.\r\nIt's a bit of a long shot but it would not cost much and there is no risks involved.\r\nNo I don't work for ebay :)",
