We believe that the proposed reforms will still leave doctors with pension arrangements that are hugely more favourable than the majority of professional people, in view of  economic developments over the last decade which though regrettable are a fact of life.\r\nWe call on the government to stand its ground and to convey to the BMA and its members the strength of public anger at their selfish industrial action.",
