Energy companies seem to be able to put up prices at will, citing increases in the wholesale cost The chief executives get huge bonuses, but often they are their own wholesalers.  I want the government to introduce measures to restrict these companies' ability increase prices at will, or find some way of channelling money back to consumers. The idea of a pool for electricity generation has been mentioned recently or perhaps the introduction of a windfall tax with the proceeds used to raise personal tax allowances merits consideration. Something must be done to curb this greed. ",
