Why not, then, allow the BBC to go FULLY commercial (it appears to want the best of both worlds by keeping the BBC Licence Tax) by scrapping the BBC Licence Tax and letting them operate on a flat playing field in direct competition with the rest of the commercial TV providers.  Why should taxpayer money be put into an organisation which is struggling to establish itself as a player in the commercial television world?",
