The worst of these crimes, of course, being murder.\r\nJudges and magistrates should be held accountable for these decisions to release and be liable to be sued and or sacked.\r\nA driver making a poor decision and causing a death will be charged and punished, why are our judges and magistrates any different?\r\nShould they make a serious error of judgement then they should be held responsible for their actions.\r\nI am certain that this will save lives as they will certainly think twice about bailing someone.",
