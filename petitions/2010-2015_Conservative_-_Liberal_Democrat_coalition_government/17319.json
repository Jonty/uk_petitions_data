        "additional_details": "Microchipping MUST be compulsory for all dogs as well as all new puppies.  This WILL in turn make the owners/breeders accountable for the dogs they have responsibility for.  Far too many dogs are abandoned without microchips and most are taken in and cared for others unfortunately face the fate of being PTS as there is no room in the rescue centres, and even with a network of foster carers are still unable to save all of them.   There is many options for rehoming a dog but one of them should NOT be abandonment.  Microchipping also will help to trace owners in cases of biting, as the training and welfare of the dog should lie with them.  Puppies should have to legally be microchipped before being sold and new owner details taken.  Too many dogs are suffering because of irresponsibility.  Please support this like the Welsh Assembly has and together we can all take responsibility for the welfare of the dogs in our country and prove that we are still a nation of dog lovers.\r\nMany Thanks.",
