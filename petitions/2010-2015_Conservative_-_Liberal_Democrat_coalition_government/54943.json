Whilst referred to as a psychoactive narcotic, the latest research shows that it actually destroys the mind. Any cannabis use at a time when the user may come into contact with other individuals risks murderous results. The user has no idea of the likely effect.\r\n\r\nFor preference, any cannabis user would be restricted to a controlled environment and be subject to medical and psychiatric tests before be allowed to come into contact with others.\r\n\r\nAlso, double all sentences for trafficking, importation, possession, use. And no more police \"cautions\". Automatic 3 months up to 5 grams. Extra month for each additional gram.\r\n\r\nDefend our country!",
