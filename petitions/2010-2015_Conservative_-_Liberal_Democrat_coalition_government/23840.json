        "additional_details": "There have been a number of high profile cases of social services ignoring serious concerns in Scotland which have resulted in serious abuse or death.  In the Highlands the amount of cases that are totally ignored is RAPIDLY rising.  In one recent case social services and health visitors totally ignored a father who had concerns that the mother of the child was drugging the baby with anti psychotics in order to make her calm so that people would think she was a \"good mother\".  This is just ONE example, the cases are rising and in most cases getting a lot more serious.  Social services shouldn't get away with ignoring the concerns of people, police reports of domestic abuse, both mental and physical.  It needs to be made a lot clearer at what point in these cases do they start to look after the interests of the child when the child can't talk,.",
