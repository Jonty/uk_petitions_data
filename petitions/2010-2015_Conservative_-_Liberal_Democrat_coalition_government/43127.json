        "additional_details": "An advert does not simply sell a product; it sells an image and a way of life.\r\nWe are shown images of \"perfect\" and \"beautiful\" bodies on a daily basis.\r\nMany of these models underweight, meaning the public's idea of a beautiful, healthy body is actually unhealthy.\r\nRising numbers of people who suffer from low self-esteem, anorexia and bulimia are arguably direct results of advertising which uses underweight models.\r\nIf an adult's BMI is under 18.5, they are considered to be underweight.\r\nThe Advertising Standards Authority is there to take action against \"misleading, harmful or offensive advertisements\".\r\nWe are petitioning to ban the use of underweight models in advertising, as using these images is misleading and harmful.\r\nStopping using models with a BMI of less than 18.5 would be a massive step in the role advertising plays in the lives of many in modern society.",
