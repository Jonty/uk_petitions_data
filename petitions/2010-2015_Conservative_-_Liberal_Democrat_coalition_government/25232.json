        "additional_details": "As reported in The Guardian, a proposal has been put forward to the Coalition to change policy which will start forcing cancer patients (currently around 7000 people), who are going through the intense treatment of chemotherapy, to have to take medical tests and back to work interviews in order to claim benefits (particularly ESA). They are also proposing to automatically stop their benefits after 12 months even if they are still going through this treatment. SIGN IF YOU'RE AGAINST THIS!!",
