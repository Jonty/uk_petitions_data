        "additional_details": "The government are discussing changing the use of Diplomas in schools and making students take traditional GCSEs and A-Levels. Diplomas give access to  GCSE/A-Level education to students who may struggle with the traditional route. Diplomas give students a chance to see what the industry is like (e.g the creative and media industry or catering and hospitality industry) and give them the opportunities to get a head start in their chosen career path.\r\n\r\nI am in year 11 and currently undertaking a creative and media diploma myself. I chose to do a diploma as its the career path i want to go down and also, I'm dyslexic so its a different more practical learning environment. ",
