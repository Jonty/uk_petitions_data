        "additional_details": "The archaic leasehold laws not only need reviewing but ought to be abolished.  Leaseholders in the UK do not have enough rights over the properties they purchase to live in and deserve full rights such as that of a person owning a freehold property.  Leaseholders in particular who are that of a local authority have lesser rights than that of a private landlord as the local authorities are exempt from acting on themselves and therefore these leaseholders have lesser rights.  It is time for a total review of this hideous law and to abolish it once and for all. ",
