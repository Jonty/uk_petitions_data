        "additional_details": "State that people who have been diagnosed as having thyroid disease are NOT held accountable for loans as they can't always think straight- (such as bipolar suffers) It is unfair that they are judged on credit when they could be well under active and therefore unable to make decisions. I was judged like this after taking credit of 3500 then later that year being told by my GP that if I had been any lower on my thyroid function I would have been in a coma! She then continued to say that she didn't know how I was able to function at all! Please sign this it could change lives. Thank you for your support",
