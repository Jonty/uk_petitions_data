        "additional_details": "Some people would of seen this in the news recently, and it's absolutely disgusting. For those who don't know what's happened, someone in government changed Wikipedias liverpool anthem to 'you'll never walk again', and also commented 'blame the liverpool fans'. This is abuse towards the families of the 96 who died, survivors of the disaster, victims and the Liverpool fans! They have started an inquest but who knows how long that will be? It's not good enough. Someone in government wrote those comments and they shouldn't be allowed to get away with it. The comments were written from Whitehall computers on a secure government network. It's sickening and absolutely horrendous that someone could do that and they need to be found out! They won't get away with it.. With you help hopefully government will view this and speed up their inquest to find the culprit, please sign, I need your help.",
