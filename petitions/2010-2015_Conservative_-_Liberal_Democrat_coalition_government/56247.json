Many people are confined to constant pain and frequent trips to Hospitals. Many have to have 4 plus different medications per day and these are NOT free, so this is very costly. Please make these medications (prescriptions) free, it will cost more to the NHS if these sufferers have to be admitted to Hospital. Come on, its the right thing to do.",
