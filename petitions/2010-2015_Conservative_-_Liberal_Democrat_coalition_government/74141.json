        "additional_details": "Periods. No one wants to talk about it, and we shouldn't have to. All women have to deal with it, put up with the pain and the feeling of uncleanliness.\r\nThis petition is to make sanitary products available for free. It's not to make them all free, just available at clinics for those in need. Condoms are available to purchase AND at sexual health clinics for free. And sex is an OPTIONAL thing.\r\nMenstruation is not optional. Yes we can buy the slightly nicer products, but what about people who struggle to afford such things.\r\nHomeless women have no such luxury. They are unable to access sanitary products.\r\nThink of yourself being unable to afford a home and food, and then imagine having to live in dirty clothes because you have no products to help with something you cannot stop.\r\n\r\nPlease share this around and make the government see that women across the country should not be living in such quality. If we cannot give them beds, give them hygiene.",
