This debate should not take away from the universal concern with the children at risk from Kony and the rightful debate about what should happen to those children if the campaign is successful; many of whom have no family to return home to.\r\n\r\nThe UK government should respond with its position on the Kony 2012 campaign with specific reference to what it is doing currently and in the near future to address the issue of children living without parental care in Africa, including the child soldiers in the LRA, and who are at the highest risk of being left on the streets of the continents capital cities in the event of Kony's arrest.\r\n\r\n",
