        "additional_details": "I would like to see universities giving Medical Doctors a lot more nutritional training. I think doctors should understand what foods are most likely to cure patients before they consider prescribing pills. I think a doctor should be able to prescribe food in order to get a cure, and give well aimed diet advice just as heavy as medicine advice. So you can truly trust your doctor. It seems these days it\u2019s more about selling pills, than actually helping patience, it almost seems like patience are not patience, but customers for the next new drug and I fear soon people will lose all trust in Doctors due to the fact it seems they\u2019re more bothered about prescribing pills, than getting too know their patients diet and what a patient does in general in order to make a better judgment on the treatment. I have in addition heard a lot about vegan diets curing a lot of illnesses. A good nutritional site that explains this information well is. NutritionFacts.Org ",
