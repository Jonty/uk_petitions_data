Where is the Respect our brave fallen deserve?\r\n\r\nOur laws need to reflect the sentiment our animals carry.\r\nThey are our guardians when Police and Soldiers Mount our Trusty Steeds and when our Dogs detect Bombs. Memorials and Medals are not enough. We need the laws to not only protect them from abuse and neglect we also need the punishment to go with it. Do not class our animals in money and as property class them as the beings that they are that help protect our Monarchy and Country from mayhem. Give us our rights as Guardians to protect our animals from harm and prosecute for crimes against them as beings.",
