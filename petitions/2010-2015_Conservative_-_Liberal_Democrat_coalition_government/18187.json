        "additional_details": "I think in order to mend our broken society, it's important for new generations to have a sense of national pride. Much of today's generation does not have it, and I think this lack of unity and solidarity is damaging to our nation. I would like the government to make it compulsory for the National Anthem to be taught in schools. It's a small step, but it's a start. I also ask the government to ignore any protests of this issue by people stating it's 'unfair' on foreign residents. The fact is, they're living in this country now, and should be prepared to learn about British things - just as a British person would do if they lived in America, for example. Thank you.",
