        "additional_details": "It appears Christian values are being sidelined. Many comedians..tv shows and broadcasters deem it fine to allow jokes about Jesus to be fine but jokes about other deity or religion are classed as abusive and racial hatred.\r\nIn the UK where our Sovereign is head of a Christian church and where Christianity is the main faith I ask jokes about its deity be outlawed. They cause offense to many practising Christians as much as jokes about Muhanmed would muslims.",
