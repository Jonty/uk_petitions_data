        "additional_details": "This petitions proposes that supporter's of all British football club's, if their club enters administration, should be given the first option to buy their club from administrators - via Fan Ownership vehicles, in association with Supporters Direct.\r\n\r\nGive your club the best chance to survive and exit administration, should the situation arise, and sign this petition.\r\n\r\nCoventry City, Leeds United and Rangers are just three who are still suffering from administration. All three clubs have been passed on to people who do not have the clubs best interests at heart.\r\n\r\nPortsmouth and Hearts, recently, managed to save their clubs, but in the case of Portsmouth, they had to wait a long time and suffer many difficulties.\r\n\r\nAll supporters of all clubs will benefit from a law to protect football clubs. Fan ownership is sustainable, as being shown by Swansea City, Portsmouth, Hearts, Clyde and others.\r\n\r\nBritish football clubs need you.",
