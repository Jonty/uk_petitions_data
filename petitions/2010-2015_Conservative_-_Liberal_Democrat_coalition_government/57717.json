They do not need the constant pressure of having adverts thrust upon them everytime they are at home or out and about. Try this experiment. How many times in a day can you tick off the times alcohol has been advertised in some form to get you to partake! Why do we set ourselves up for a fall by allowing the advertisers to get away with this. Watch out for the Xmas deluge!\r\n\r\n",
