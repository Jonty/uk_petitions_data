        "additional_details": "There are many in the UK who 'automatically' have the State Pension paid to them, but who do not need this payment as they are financially buoyant.  They would not, through choice, request this payment, but do not know how to stop payments, or never get around to putting a stop to the payments.  I propose that an 'OPT IN' scheme be put in place, so that ONLY those in need would 'opt in'.  It is ludicrous that everyone, regardless of how wealthy they are, should automatically be paid a State Pension.  Most wealthy, philanthropic people would not choose to have this money paid directly to themselves, but would rather such payments went to those who would most benefit.",
