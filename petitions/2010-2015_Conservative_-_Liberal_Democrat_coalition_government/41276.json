Learning to be assertive can only improve society attitudes and beleifs about themselves and others.\r\nFirst Aid is also a valuable life skill.   It gives better understanding of the anatomy and physiology therefore a better understand of the damage that can be caused, better understanding of how to treat minor ailments and better understanding of whether this is an emergency or not, therefore saving NHS Ambulance service money when going to minor injury cases.\r\nMy examples are only a few of the benefits society will gain through learning these two skills.
