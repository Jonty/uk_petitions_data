It is critical to the maintenance of this freedom that laws are only ever made where absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the hacking scandal, people broke existing laws and will be punished for that by a court.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, believe that the law as it exists in sufficient to control the press and that any new watchdog body does NOT need to be backed by any new legislation.\r\n",
