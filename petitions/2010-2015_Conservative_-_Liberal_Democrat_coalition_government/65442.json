        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition to help stop door to door sales, telesales,  and even in store sales people tp bully and pressure sell to vulnerable people who can't make a correct dission without help. I have had an experience with this myself with my father got pressured into getting a contract phone and because a certain company said even when you turn the phone on you have used it and there for cannot be replaced. This obviously upset my father who is mentally ill and instead of going forward he has fallen into a deep depression.  To some people it maybe a little thing but for people who understand will know what it feels like.  So please sign my petition it would mean a great lot. Thank you",
