        "additional_details": "IT IS TOTALLY UNREALISTIC TO STILL EXPECT PEOPLE TO PAY TO OWN A TELEVISION.\r\nWith so many pay to view and free to view channels, it is wrong for the BBC to insist that the public pay a licence fee which is also seen as an offence if no licence is obtained. Demanding we pay to own A television licence is as stupid as demanding we pay for a licence for other home appliances such as a toaster, radio, washing machine or dvd player.\r\nSign this petition NOW to help abolish the Television licence fee.",
