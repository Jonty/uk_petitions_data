        "additional_details": "Schools which have longer holidays (Independent) seem to out-perform those with shorter holidays (State). This also seems to be the case when compared with schools in Europe - for example British state schools have shorter holidays and longer days than German state schools, where standards of literacy and numeracy are higher than here. Contrary to some people's beliefs, pupils do not forget everything over the summer, and it seems that allowing them to switch off completely and have more time with family and friends away from school increases school performance.",
