        "additional_details": "Council Tax should be reduced for the elderly, starting at age 60. The elderly make few demands on council services if still in their own homes. They may have lost their life partner but still only be entitled to a 25% reduction. Therefore, from age 60, give a 5% per year reduction, in addition to any single occupancy reduction. As a result, at age 65, a single elderly occupant would only pay 50%. In addition, remove consideration of savings/assets of less than \u00a3250,000 for housing benefit and reduce council tax by any housing benefit eligibility, whether or not housing benefit has actually been claimed by the householder.",
