They do nothing extra to get this payment, it doesn't matter how hard they do or do not work it's purley based on the date they joined the police!\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nThe youngest serving officer to still receive this payment will have about 20 years service, which works at about \u00a326400 for their final 10 years service. or \u00a379200 for their full 30 years service.\r\n\r\nAny officers who joined later do not receive ANY housing allowance.\r\n\r\nThis payment should be abolished saving the government millions, giving the rest of us a chance to save the pensions that we signed up to have!",
