        "additional_details": "I am firmly against the banning of cars in tottenham court road, this will create problems for many workers travelling through and around the area. i also believe that this will be a spring board for other bans which i believe is wrong as , we as a country are having our freedom to do what we want taken away piece by piece, without people realising it. it is in the governments interest to ban cars on the road as it will increase their profits from bus and train services. It is not necessary to ban cars around the area or anywhere. The money used to have a full redesign would be better used to improve the road layout. If you ban cars from places, it will stop people using restaurants in areas and shopping in areas among other things, by doing this the government are shooting themselves in the foot, who wants to go shopping and have to take their shopping on the bus or train?",
