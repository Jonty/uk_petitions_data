        "additional_details": "As recent events have painfully demonstrated, our Police force are under resourced and ill equipped to combat mass criminality and law breaking by gangs. We propose that the option to use water cannon, tear gas, rubber bullets and all other means of riot control be taken out of the hands of politicians. Local police commanders must be given greater powers to protect the communities they serve. Police must be permitted to physically engage looters without the fear of prosecution.",
