No such outrage as been given to women's magazines i.e Cosmopolitan, many of which feature misandrist, explicit sexual phrases on their covers, which could be harmful if seen by children. If lad's mags are to be covered up then in the interests of gender equality, women's magazines should also be covered up. ",
