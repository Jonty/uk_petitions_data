        "additional_details": "Since Hounslow Cricket & Sports Club folded their ground has lain empty. Another local club, Indian Gymkhana, has offered to take over the site, develop it for cricket, build a new changing and shower facility (the previous pavilion was burnt down by vandals), provide a fulltime groundsman and use the ground at weekends for their own benefit \u2013 including a local junior section \u2013 allowing the local schools to use it during the week.  Hounslow Council have flatly refused to agree to this very generous offer.\r\n\r\nEveryone should be very concerned about the loss of sports grounds: once a ground has been sold off or built upon, there is no going back and, especially in densely populated urban areas, there are no alternative sites available for redevelopment as sports grounds. Accordingly, and in conjunction with Indian Gymkhana CC and with the support of various major sporting bodies, we believe far greater support should be given to our threatened sporting facilities.\r\n",
