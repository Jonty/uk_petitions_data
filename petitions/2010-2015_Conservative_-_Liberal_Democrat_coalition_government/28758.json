        "additional_details": "Please can you give Shepton Mallet's railway back.It should never have been taken away.Everyone here wants one and it will reduce traffic on the roads.I have never had driving lessons and cant afford ones now.It's so difficult to get to places like Bath or Bristol from Shepton as they have cut all the direct buses.Please can you give East Cranmore Railway some money so they can extend their line to Shepton and Wells etc.It will be good for tourism and bring  money into the economy.Most of the staff at Cranmore work there unpaid and are working so hard to keep Cranmore open.Thank you",
