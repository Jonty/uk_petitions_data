In their report on 2009 the auditors found that five areas of Union expenditure, agriculture and the cohesion fund, were materially affected by error. The European Commission estimated that the financial impact of irregularities was \u20ac1,863 million in the European Court of Auditors report.. If this was in the UK there would be an outcry.\r\nThe European Arrest warrent was supposed to be used in cross border crime. I cannot think of a much larger one. Get the City of London Police who have expertise in international fraud to investigate the European Union Accounts.",
