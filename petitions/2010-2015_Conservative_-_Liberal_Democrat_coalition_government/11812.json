        "additional_details": "I undersign this petition to the Government to ask for a change in the terms used, and rules of issuing and implementing \"life sentencing\" when it comes to custodial sanctions for a crime under UK law.\r\n\r\nCurrently, life sentences, last for 20 - 30 years, only to be then reduced further at a later date for good behaviour, or upon the successful application of Parole.\r\n\r\nI feel that this is not realistic and is not actually doing what it says, If a life sentence is given, this should mean that an offender is imprisoned and punished until death or indeed until health implications take precedence.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am asking the Government to make the necessary changes, to seek clarification, and stricter sentencing lengths in UK Prisons and the Justice System.\r\n",
