Do you want your child to understand their options fully?\r\nUnderstand the range of careers available and salaries achievable if they apply themselves?\r\nWhy keep this information from them?\r\nIsn't education designed to equip the future workforce? Then why is this piece of the jigsaw missing?\r\nWhy is understanding French more important than understanding what It takes to get into Cambridge or study medicine?\r\nAre these careers reserved for those privileged to come from professional backgrounds? Give all young people the opportunity to aim high and see what's out there, understand their options, excite and enthuse them and improve their life chances!\r\nHelp young people understand the relevance of their studies!\r\nThis is a call to the government to implement careers education as part of the national curriculum for all ages from year 7 onwards. Who else will provide this information to young people? ",
