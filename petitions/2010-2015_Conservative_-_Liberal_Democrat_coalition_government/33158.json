By electing them it would result in greater transparency, and the relevant organisations being run for the actual benefit of the local community rather than the current paternalistic 'we know best' approach that currently operates where the local community is effectively ignored. It would also allow the public to scrutinise how effective the individuals holding their respective posts are. ",
