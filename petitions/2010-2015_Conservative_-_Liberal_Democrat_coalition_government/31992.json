        "additional_details": "I believe there is a lot of waste occurring due to the amount of fruit and vegetables being delivered to Schools in the UK for this scheme.\r\n\r\nYes children need to eat their 5-a-day but the parents do or should provide them with what they need,  maybe schools have an obligation to educate children into eating healthily and provide some fruit and veg, but not as much as we are doing. I believe alot is being wasted due to children not eating the unusual/expensive exotic fruits and vegetables, also a good communication between the suppliers for reasonable amounts to be delivered and stock control. The schools should be teaching how to use this left over produce and make things from it, to aid in further life skills, not throwing away or taking home. We should reduce the amount being ordered and thus reducing the waste being thrown away but also the money spent. Educating will ensure children are healthier.\r\n",
