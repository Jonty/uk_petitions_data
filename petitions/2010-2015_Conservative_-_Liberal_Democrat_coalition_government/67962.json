Should there be a national emergency or a bombing, the networks would ho down because of the sheer volume of calls. It will also make it easier for terrorist to hack the system. There aren't enough ambulances to start with, but doing this will mean there will be less chance of any response at all. The government are putting people's safety at risk, by trying to save money in the wrong place.",
