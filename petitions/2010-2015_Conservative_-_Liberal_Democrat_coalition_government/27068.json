        "additional_details": "Sad to hear about people who think that by having falling pregnant or having a dog entitles them to go up the housing priority list even when one of a couple is working on a decent wage with tax credits and cash pay jobs.. There are homeless ex service men who need this. Other people have to pay normal rental rates. This loophole must be stopped.\r\n1. People working should not be entitled to social housing where their income is able to pay private rent, regardless of pregancy.\r\n2. Prohibitions should be put on the ownership of pets in social housing. This way properties may be looked after better. And if they cant afford rent then they cant afford a dog!\r\n3. In line with private, and the state social housing is abused bring back housing inspectors. 6 monthly in the private sector I would recommend. ",
