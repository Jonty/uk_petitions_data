Whilst your dog is being checked on whether it is a danger to the public your dog will either be release or kept in kennels (You are NOT allowed to visit YOUR dog if being kept in kennels).\r\nOnce at court it is your responsibility to prove your dog is not a banned dog, if this fails you yourself face a \u00a35000 pound fine or 6 months in prison whilst your dog regardless of its breed and behaviour will be put to sleep.\r\nChange the dogs act so banned breeds are judged on their behaviour and not the breed (DEED NOT BREED).
