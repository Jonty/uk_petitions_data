        "additional_details": "Like many scandinavian countries, such as sweden and finland. Make it mandatory when driving a vehicle on the roads to have side lights on.\r\n\r\nThe cost of replacing bulbs is minimal and it will not reduce efficiency of the cars. It will save lives as many motorists drive around in Fog, dust and dawn with no lights on making them life threatening hazards. Even when it rains cars often have no lights on. Spot fines should be awarded and potentially points on the license.\r\n\r\nStop allowing people's lives to be risked for those who are incapable to remember their driving lessons.",
