        "additional_details": "In the UK there are 13 500 injuries and 500 deaths every year due to domestic fires.  If new build properties had a fire escape installed as a secondary means of escape from the first floor lives could be saved.  There are many discreet and simple solutions on the market for this purpose.  Current regulations stipulate that it is deemed \"acceptable to exit a first floor window from a height of 4.5 metres\".  Installation of a fixed fire escape would enable occupants of a building to exit the Secondary escape route safely if the primary route is blocked.",
