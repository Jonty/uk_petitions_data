        "action": "LEAVE OVING LIGHTS ALONE A27 West Sussex",
        "additional_details": "The closure of the traffic lights across the A27 known as \"Oving lights\" has been judged a prequisite by the Highways agency and the developers as part of the planning requirements for the developement of 500+ house at Shopwyke Lakes adjacent to the Shopwyke road and the A27 in West Sussex. This petition seeks enough signatories so as to convince the relevant goverment department to overrule the Highways Authorities inisistence that the traffic lights be closed. Closure would cause traffic chaos through the proposed housing development and the further annexation of villages to the East of Chichester. The current \"intelligent\" light phasing causes minimal interrution to A27 trunk road traffic while providing safe and speedy tranisit for traffic wishing to cross the trunk road.\r\nThis petition has no objection to the housing developement.",
