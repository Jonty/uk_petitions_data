Any member of the public in a similar situation, not only would be thoroughly investigated by the police, but would liable for prosecution.\r\nThe government should insist the full \u00a345,000 taxpayers\u2019 money should be returned, with costs for investigation.\r\nFurthermore, she should be immediately removed from office.  We must end MPs claiming fraudulent benefits, -that is the taxpayers money.\r\nAn independent body, not answerable to Parliament, with real powers to fine public servants, should be set-up.  MPs cannot police their own.\r\n",
