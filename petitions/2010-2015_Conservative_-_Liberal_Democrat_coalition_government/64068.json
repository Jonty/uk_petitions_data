The 'small print' is baffling, even to a barrister - and they sell 7% bargain loans which are in truth Loans of Last Resort for people of poor credit etc., and they seem answerable to no-one.  Litigation is expensive and time consuming, & businesses are failing, homes are being lost, yet still the scams continue.",
