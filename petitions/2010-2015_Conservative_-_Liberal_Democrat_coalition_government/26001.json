Ironically thus will come at the cost of millions to the tax payer.\r\nWe do not know those who have nominated her, nor those who have agreed.None of our elected representatives campaigned on this issue.\r\nWe therefore have the right to decide whether or not it should go ahead so there must be a referendum.
