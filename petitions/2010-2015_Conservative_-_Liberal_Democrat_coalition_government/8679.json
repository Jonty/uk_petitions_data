        "additional_details": "Please see sense and not listen to the previous Labour Government's rhetoric on 'disaffected youth'. This has been proven time and again to be Political Correctness at its worst!\r\nWe have given children rights, but not responsibilities. Taking away parental rights, teachers rights and police rights to even shout at a naughty, unruly child. The riots are just a taste of what is happening now all over the country every day. They are not bothered at all by ASBO's or recent measures. They are laughing at the Criminal Justice system. We need to bring back the rights of parents, teachers and police to chastise children for wrongful behaviour now. Before it's too late.",
