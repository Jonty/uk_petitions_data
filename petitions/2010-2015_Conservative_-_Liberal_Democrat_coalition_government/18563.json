        "additional_details": "The BBC reported on 3 October 2011 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-15149806 that tube workers will receive pay rises of 5% this year followed by inflation plus 0.5% for the next three years. This is on top of a 'bonus' for doing their jobs during the Olympics. Most of the public sector, including doctors and nurses are seeing pay freezes, rising pension costs, and job cuts! Meanwhile the fares are going up by RPI plus 3% or 8%!! from January 2012 to pay for supposed 'improvement's'. Delays are up and trains are packed! Clearly this money is not being spent where it should be and is being wasted placating Bob Crow. It's time to stop the madness!!!!! We request that the Government intervene and cap tube workers pay at this years levels.",
