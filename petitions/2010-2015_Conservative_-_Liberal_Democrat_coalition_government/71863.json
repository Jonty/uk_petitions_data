We the people, know that it is nothing more than tongue in cheek laughs, enjoyed by a wide ranging number of the British audience both men and women. Although some viewers may find the content of the show offensive, this should not be an excuse to deny the vast majority of viewers the oppotunity to enjoy an otherwise harmless bit of fun.",
