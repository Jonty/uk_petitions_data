        "additional_details": "The Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) is put into place by a medical team when a patient is classed as 'near death'.   The patient is then supplied with continues pain relief, and all food, liquid and other medication is withdrawn until they die.  Sometimes family's are not notified of this and can not intervene even if they are the next of kin.\r\nThe medical team use a tick box checklist before opting for LCP, and most of symptoms in the 'check list' of near death patients could be the side effect of many other factors including;  reaction to medication, infection, dehydration, generally felling unwell....etc\r\nThe LCP takes many lives each year, some of which are unnecessary, preventable an taken prematurely!\r\n\r\nI propose that Doctors, nurses an Care Staff should not be given the choice of playing God, and that the government should withdraw/ban the LCP on non-terminal patients.\r\n",
