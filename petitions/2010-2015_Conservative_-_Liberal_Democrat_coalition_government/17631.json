        "additional_details": "We the undersigned propose that speed limits should remain in MPH and road signs must continue to use Miles and Yards. Nearly all UK drivers are opposed to metric road signs and most people think in MPH when concerning speed and Miles when measuring distances. This has been concluded in multiple surveys over the years. In 1998 the AA conducted a survey in which 83% of 18-24 year olds were opposed to Km/h + distances measured in Km. It would also cost around \u00a3565 million according to the Department of Transport to replace these perfectly good signs. Money that could be spent on improving the road infrastructure and road safety. Also the hassle to the average motorist of having to learn a new system and facing potential speeding fines will cause confusion, danger and anger. By converting road signs and speed limits to metric Km and Km/h, we are destroying our culture and traditions that date back thousands of years. If we do so, we might as well drive on the right like the rest of Europe",
