I think the solution to re-engage people with poiltics is to give the them more power and responsibility, this is way Direct Democracy comes into it, where issues are solved by the people, this will give the people more hope that their vote means something. I also wish to see mandatory voting as-well, so we get a true representation of the people, instead of having these miniorty selected governments and councils.",
