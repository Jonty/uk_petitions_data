It is childish and inappropriate that MP's within the House of Commons insist on shouting when each side of the opposition is debating policies.\r\n\r\nThis results in an unhealthy debate and really undermines the professionalism of politicians.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned agree that the House of Commons should implement rules regarding the attitude and behaviour of MP's within the House of Commons, that control their childish and distracting 'shouty attitude'.",
