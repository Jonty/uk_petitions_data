        "additional_details": "The Network Rail level crossing in Wem, Shropshire is listed as one of the top 10 most dangerous crossing in the UK.  At 10.39pm on 01.03.15 there was yet another near miss, when the automated barriers failed to deploy.\r\n\r\nThis petition is for action to be taken in order to safeguard members of the public, rail users, road users and pedestrians alike.   The current automated system has failed on more than this one occasion and it is time that the crossing becomes manned once again and appropriate safeguards made in line with legislation. We would like the crossing assessed.\r\n\r\nPlease sign if you agree.",
