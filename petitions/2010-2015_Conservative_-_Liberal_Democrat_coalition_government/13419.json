        "additional_details": "VAT is a tax that bears no relationship to the persons ability to pay and treats all income groups the same. It is indiscriminate and hits lower income groups the hardest. The switch to indirect taxation (stealth taxes) has been a convenient tool for successive governments who wish to hide the true level of taxation levied in this country. If these stealth taxes were to show up as income tax deductions on our pay slips as opposed to collecting revenue by indirect taxation there would be an uproar in this country and demands for cut-backs in public spending.",
