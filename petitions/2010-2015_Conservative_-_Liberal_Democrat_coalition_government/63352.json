But we have seen that when a student is en-rolled after few weeks or months in the mid way of student education college is with drawn from the home office list which effects the students education and he has to look for another college within 60 days pay fees again and start from scratch again.\r\nWe trust home office when we go to a highly trusted college so at least a student should be given time to finish his education for what he is en-rolled before the college can be with drawn.",
