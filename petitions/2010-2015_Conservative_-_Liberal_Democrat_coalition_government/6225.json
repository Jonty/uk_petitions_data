Small prizes should be available for those reaching the bottom in the fastest time.  These would be paid for out of the savings of not having to maintain and operate down escalators.\r\n\r\nA separate petition will be submitted calling for the replacement of up escalators with catapults.\r\n\r\nThe government should:\r\n- alter Health & Safety Gone Mad legislation as required\r\n- Direct Transport for London to get a bleeding move on\r\n- supply the very small amount of funding required to carry out the changeover.\r\n- set a good example by using the slides regularly.\r\n\r\n",
