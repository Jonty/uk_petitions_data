        "additional_details": "Serps and SP2 cannot ever be a 'benefit'. They are bought by workers and employers as a financial investment like any other private pension. They are the chosen extra pension vehicle for low paid workers.\r\nThe full state basic pension becomes a benefit only when awarded for less than 30+ years' contributions. Anyone who has worked and contributed for more than 30 years has earned 'entitlement' to a full return on their investment plus the Serps/ SP2.\r\nThe government wants us to believe that 'work pays'. This cannot be true if Serps/SP2 are stolen at the point of delivery.",
