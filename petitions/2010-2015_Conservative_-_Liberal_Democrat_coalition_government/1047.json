        "additional_details": "This e-petition proposes that the government resolves the 'West Lothian question' by ensuring that only MPs representing English constituencies can vote on matters which affect only England and none of the other three constituent countries of the United Kingdom. At present, Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish MPs can vote on issues only affecting England. But because of devolution, English MPs cannot vote on issues affecting those countries. This petition asks the Government to resolve the issue by changing the system so that in order to vote on laws that only apply to England, an MP must represent a constituency in England. ",
