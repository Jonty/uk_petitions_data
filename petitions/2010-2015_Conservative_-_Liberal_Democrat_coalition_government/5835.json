        "additional_details": "The global financial crisis continues, borrowers and lenders are both to blame they must take responsibility for this.\r\nGlobal debt cancellation is the only way to restore certainty to financial markets, ensure economies grow and reduce global poverty. To ensure that economies do not continue to boom and bust, the global cancellation of all debt should occur at regular 50 year intervals.\r\nThis petition asks Parliament to:\r\n1) Undertake a thorough review of the effects of a policy of global debt cancellation as an immediate economic measure and also an ongoing one.\r\n2) Use its position as a leading economy to support this economic measure globally.\r\nThe solution sounds simple but is complex and requires the resources and position of the government, the global financial situation is rapidly getting worse and action is required immediately so I have set the time to collect signatures at only 3 months so tell your family, friends and workmates about this petition.",
