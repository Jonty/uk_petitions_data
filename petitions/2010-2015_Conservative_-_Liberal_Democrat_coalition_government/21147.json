        "additional_details": "The poor should no longer have to choose between eating and heating. This can EASILY be done WITHOUT RAISING TAX by reversing electricity tariffs. (Electricity is the only fuel that goes into every home). The amount of heat required to warm (say) four rooms in a well insulated home must be established. The electricity for this is sold to ALL homes at a very low price. Electrical consumption above this attracts an increasingly higher cost such that conspicuous consumers subsidise the impoverished ones and the fuel companies can claw back the early losses. A side benefit is that the pensioner fuel allowance can be abandoned.",
