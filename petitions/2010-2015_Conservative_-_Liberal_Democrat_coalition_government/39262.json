The assessments are often done privately and do not involve the families and do not recognise the full extent of the illness. My father worked all his life, paid all his taxes and NI. His care fees are \u00a32300 per month and what will happen when his money runs out. You could be in his position. Do not wait until it happens to you and your family members. Support funduing for dementia sufferers now",
