        "additional_details": "I can't be the only one who feels wayne rooney gets overhyped from the english media to the point it makes me angry, he has let his country and club down so many times and people still regard him as \"world class\" he gets rated on his workrate more than his ability to play football and never gets criticised when he doesn't turn up, he is a bad example for the future of this country as he always moans and pressures refs and cheats on his pregnant wife with a prostitute, he has had no real competition in england for a starting place upfront since the emergence of Daniel sturridge and theo walcott, he is truly the most overated footballer of all time who has played in the premier league for 10 years already and you wouldn't of thought it",
