        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom has often been accused of having a southern, or London Bias. Therefore, it should be moved closer to the centre of the United Kingdom. It is not essential for a parliament to be in a capital city. The old Palace of Westminster could be turned into a museum with a new Parliament being in a new prupose built building with a semi-circular chamber and electronic voting in the nearest town or city closest to the centre of the United Kingdom. Only by moving parliament will politicians notice the rest of the country beyond London. Paid ceremonial officials would not be needed.",
