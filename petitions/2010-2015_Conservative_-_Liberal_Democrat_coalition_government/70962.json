        "additional_details": "I urge the government of the UK back calls for Israel to be tried at the Int'l Criminal Court. Israel on many occasions have proven its disregard for human life! We live in a democratic country; law & order is our way of life! How can one country follow the rules & one country be exempt? How does Israel get away with these crimes in view of the int'l community? Where is the justice? During Israels recent offensive on the Palestinian people it has been suggested that chemical weapons had been used which is an Int'l war crime! During the offensive Israel gave no regard for life of women, children & the elderly & had murdered civilians in view of the world-one does not need to look deep to discover Israels genocide on the Palestinian people. We humbly request you take this matter to the commons & in turn back the calls for Israel to be tried at the ICC.It is time for Israel to fairly & justly explain & give the world answers. The ICC is an independant body.",
