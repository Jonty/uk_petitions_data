Those excluded and mis-construed include the Young, the Retired, Disabled people, the Unemployed, the Homeless, Ethnic minorities - well nigh-on half of the citizenship of this country, locked out of consultation and Listening from a wholly unrepresentative, elitist, out-of-touch administration.  I wonder for how long the Lame ducks are going to cover their tracks by pointing the finger elsewhere every time their failings are exposed.  Stereo-typing is an abysmal substitute for Listening to the Electorate.  ",
