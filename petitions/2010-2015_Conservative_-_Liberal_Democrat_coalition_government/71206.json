        "additional_details": "The undersigned demand an official independent investigation into the coincidence of a rejuvenation in the north sea oil industry sparked by fresh discoveries announced less than a month after the Scottish independence referendum. Given all 3 main UK parties campaigned heavily on this point against independence, there must be a focus of the investigation into collusion between the main political parties, and those in the business world with a commercial interest in timing reports. It is important for future referendums that the UK public has confidence in what arguments are being presented to them to influence them to vote. It is also important to gather whether the political parties had knowledge of these reports before the referendum. ",
