        "additional_details": "The monarchy should be independent of party politics, but the Lord Chancellor - a party politician - is one of the five people who can vote on whether the Queen should stop doing her job and hand over her responsibilities to the next in line to the throne. The others are independent of parties: two judges, the Speaker of the House of Commons, and the Queen's husband. The Government should amend the Regency Act 1937 to replace the Lord Chancellor with the Speaker of the House of Lords or another judge. (This would not need an Act of Parliament, they could do it today by making an order under the Constitutional Reform Act.)",
