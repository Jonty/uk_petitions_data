        "additional_details": "Lord Coe and his committees have made a mockery of the Olympics and the way tickets were allocated. Now it turns out the the taxpayers will pay out thousands of pounds so foreigners and other companies who can afford to buy their own to get free ones. One Olympic flunky called this just giving 'hospitality'.\r\n\r\nI believe that Lord Coe should be stripped of his peerage because he has made a mockery of ticket allocation and he is patronizing when giving answers if he does answer any questions regarding this topic with a straight and truthful answer.\r\n\r\nIf the government is so incapable of removing the peerage then this petition should be sent to the Queen.
