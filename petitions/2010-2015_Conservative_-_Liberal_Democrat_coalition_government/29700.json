Even if those retailers state that they will refund the money it will normally take 5 days before those funds are returned to the customer's account. This deprives the customer from making an alternative purchase because their funds are unavailable.  It should be made law that money can only be taken from your account when the goods purchased are ready for dispatch.  ",
