        "additional_details": "Why build an expensive outdated train system that will put a scar on the nations most beautiful countryside (HS2) when you could build a modern, faster, cheaper, low emission train. This mag lev train also produces a lot less noise pollution due to there being not contact between the train and the track. The track can also be integrated along side major roads creating a train line that could take you from Birmingham to London in 20mins.
