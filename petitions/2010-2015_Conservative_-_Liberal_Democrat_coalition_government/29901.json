For a service that we pay TV license for, it should remain completely unbiased, unfortunately this is not the case and the BBC is well known for making the viewer's mind up for them.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned want to see a completely unbiased service that holds absolutely no political view and reports on fact, and not a political lean.",
