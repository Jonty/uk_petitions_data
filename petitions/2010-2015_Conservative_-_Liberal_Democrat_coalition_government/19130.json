This totally dehumanisez unborn children. Such language is obviously designed to mislead those who may not have planned to have unborn children, it also potentially offends those who did plan to but may miscarry.\r\n\r\nI wish for the government to make it unlawful for any organisation (especially health)  to dehumanize existing unborn human children this way.",
