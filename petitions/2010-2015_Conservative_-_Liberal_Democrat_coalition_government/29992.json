If you are in charge of a tonne of steel travelling at speed then I happen to think it it very dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe punishment should be a \u00a35000 fine, lose your licence for 1 year and be logged as a criminal offence (so you'd have a criminal record).\r\n\r\nNobody should be injured or die because someone cannot stop their car to make a phone call.",
