        "additional_details": "Age related benefits paid to pensioners in a time of economic depression are unfair when the younger and working age population are struggling to get on.  Such benefits should be based on need rather than age: benefits solely granted on the principle of age are ultimately discriminatory.\r\n\r\nPensioners with an income greater than \u00a352,000 a year should not be entitled to a free tv licence, winter fuel allowance, cold weather payments or the bus pass.\r\n\r\nThis could be administrated through the same system as the reforms made to child benefit, which the income treshold could also be raised to \u00a352,000 rather than the current \u00a350,000 limit.",
