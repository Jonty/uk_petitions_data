        "additional_details": "The Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service are proposing the removal of fire engines from Oakham Fire Station. This will have a significant impact on safety in Rutland. We cannot be left with just one full time fire appliance supported by the Uppingham appliance crewed by retained firemen \u2013 and therefore not always available.\r\n\r\nRutland have a significant number of high risk sites \u2013 including 3 major plastics factories as well as the trunk roads of the A1 and A47.\r\n\r\nOutside bodies tend to forget just how big Rutland is in terms of distance. They forget that you could drop the cities of Leicester, Nottingham and Derby into Rutland at the same time and have room to spare. If we don\u2019t have appliances in the county, the travel time from other stations will threaten lives, property and community safety.\r\n\r\nPlease support this petition by adding your name to say NO to taking away any of Rutland\u2019s fire engines.\r\n",
