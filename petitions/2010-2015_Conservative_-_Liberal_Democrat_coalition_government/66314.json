        "additional_details": "isn't it about time to get rid of the dated sorry excuse of a national anthem we have. First of all God save ? Why do we have to sing about god in it anymore we live far past the times were religion was forced upon us and many of us have a mind of our own God should no longer have a place in our national anthem. Second The queen? Its been along time since any British monarch had any power in this country so why do we still have her in our national anthem. Third its bloody boring its time for a new anthem. Our national makes me cringe when our national teams sing it and by the looks on there faces they don't feel proud to sing it. Give us a song that Britain can relate to a song that can move us forward from our days of old a song that has a bitter past with our Scottish counterparts and had to be changed. Its time to move forward in to the next generation with a new song for our country. ",
