        "additional_details": "A four-year sentence given to a man for the manslaughter of an Asperger's sufferer in an unprovoked attack was not unduly lenient, leading judges have ruled.\r\n\r\nAndrew Young, 40, died after being punched once by Lewis Gill in Bournemouth on November 6 last year.\r\n\r\nHis sentence, imposed in February at Salisbury Crown Court, was referred to the Court of Appeal by Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who argued today that it was not a proper reflection of the gravity of what Gill did.\r\n\r\nBut three judges in London decided there should not be any change to the four years being served by Gill, 21, of Sutton in south London, who admitted manslaughter.\r\n(Source 'Mirror.co.UK')\r\n\r\nHe should be given 10 years at least. The British public need to be heard, this is our country, too. Judges need to stop being so lenient.\r\n",
