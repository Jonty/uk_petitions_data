        "additional_details": "I would like to see Road Tax deducted at the pumps and not having to pay a premium at 6 or 12 months.\r\nI beleive it would be a fair system as a person who clocks up 20000 miles a year would then be paying more than a person doing only 5000 miles a year.You would be taxed according to the milage you are doing. It would encourage economical car selection and also everyone would be paying Tax.No Tax Dodgers. So come on Government Road tax on fuel at the Pumps and do away with Road Tax as it stands now please.",
