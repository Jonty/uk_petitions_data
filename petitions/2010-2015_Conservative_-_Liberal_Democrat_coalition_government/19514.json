        "additional_details": "During the Great War, the United Kingdom lent it's allies a sum of \u00a32.3 billion. This money was lent to such nations as France, Italy and Russia.\r\nWhen adjusted for inflation using the RPI method, that figure is today in excess of \u00a3110 billion.\r\nGiven the dire circumstances the British economy faces itself in, this petition calls for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to get our freeloading so called allies to finally begin paying back this almost century old debt. If they are unable to pay back in cash, this petition calls on the Government to accept mainland France as adequate settlement.",
