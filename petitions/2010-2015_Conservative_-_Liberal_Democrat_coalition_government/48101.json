ITV and Channels 4 and 5 survive without any contribution from a TV license Why Should the BBC be any different.\r\nThey have over 50 years of archive TV material as an asset that can be used to finance their ongoing operations.\r\nIt is time to stop charging this unfair tax which is punitive to those on lower incomes and not supported by the majority of the public.\r\nWe have privatised utilities, the railways, the bus services, it is time to privatise this dinosaur and allow other TV broadcasters an honest chance to survive in the market rather than compete with a monolith that has unlimited resources and skews the market place.
