This isn't quite national service but will help reform persistent offenders.\r\n\r\nIt will also stop prisoners being a drain on society in prison costing thousands of pounds each year to keep them there.\r\n\r\nIt will also free up prison places for people who deserve to be there for more serious crimes like GBH, murder, rape, child molesting and so on.\r\n",
