        "additional_details": "as a learner driver you can find it very hard to find a full licence holder to come with you every time you want to use your car that's if a learner  has one learners should be allowed to drive on the road on there own without getting points on there licence  providing they have had a lot of lessons and are confident in the car and on the road like they are allowed on there own in the USA. they should have a limit of how many passages they can have in the car and only use the car when the road isn't at peak times  and display L plats like mopeds do.  your allowed to drive alone on a moped and there's still a risk of you getting injured or injuring someone in a crash its still got risks as much as a car. but if learners were  allowed on there own without a full licence holder next to them every time you would have a lot more confident and safer drivers on the road. . thank you and i hope you take my petition into account\r\n",
