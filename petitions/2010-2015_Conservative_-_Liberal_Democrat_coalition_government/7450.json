        "additional_details": "The renewal of British passports for overseas citizens has always been available at British High Commissions worldwide. However, throughout the caribbean it is now no longer possible to do so. British citizens residing in all of the caribbean region must travel to Washington DC in the USA to renew passports. Not only inconvenient and expensive but offensive and subjects British citizens to the US's xenophobic immigration policy at entry ports. This practise unless stopped will eventually affect British nationals in other regions of the world. Passport renewal should be reinstated at all British High Commisions, even if only as a 'via diplomatic package service' Citizens should be able to deposit their passport at their High Commission and collect it at a later date.",
