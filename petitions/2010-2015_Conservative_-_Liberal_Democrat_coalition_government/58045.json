        "additional_details": "Quarterly capitalism \u2013 a system that drives far too many CEOs, directors, investors, and analysts to focus on short-term performance and return on investment \u2013 is on a collision course with reality and should be reformed by the government. In the risk/reward equation that fundamentally drives capitalism, the majority is heedless to the long-term risks of climate change, water scarcity and other game-changing environmental and social threats that will also be financial game changers for the global economy.\r\n\r\nA group of top asset managers attending a recent Morgan Stanley sponsored conference were asked about their investment time horizon. Fifty-five percent said a quarter or less; only 20 percent said more than a year and so on. The government needs to hold a review on future of quarterly capitalism.",
