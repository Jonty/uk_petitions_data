As a care assistant in this sector a min wage is paid to sometimes inexperienced people to provide personal and palliative care to clients. A good carer deserves a good pay. We look after people who are frail and need 24 care. We are not pushing fruit and veg through a machine which pays more by the hour! Please help by signing this e petition to protect good carers and our clients in the future!",
