        "additional_details": "Hendre Fourie is a retired English professional Rugby footballer who finished his career playing for Aviva Premiership side Sale Sharks after signing from Leeds Carnegie in the Summer of 2011. His preferred position was at Flanker. Although he was born in South Africa, he played for England but was forced into premature retirement by putting his body on the line for England, but now finds himself and his young family facing deportation from his adopted country. Lets help him and his family get the right to remain in the UK. If a rugby player represents England surely that makes him English? Lets stop this injustice from happening.",
