Mr Peter Lordy Mandelson has had his offer on an \u00a38Million home in London accepted!\r\n\r\nComing from a very humble background his father manager of the local rag he joined the Young Communist League to devote his life to helping Old Labour ReNew itself.\r\n\r\nHe has not disclosed how he has come about his circa \u00a38 Million pound fortune (which excludes stamp duty) working flat-out as a dedicated communist but if as suspected it bares any resemblance to how he got his first mortgage of \u00a3150,000 as Trade Secretary - then it leaves little to the imagination.\r\n\r\nIf this petition is accepted, the Government should carry out a full investigation as to how he has come into his fortune - when working so hard for generating business for this country on behalf of the Labour party from 2009 to date.\r\n\r\nPlease vote for this ePetition and face down those who misuse their office for personal gain.",
