        "additional_details": "l propose that illegal immigrants or overstayers in UK over 10 years should be considered to stay legally in this country, provided they have not committed any crimes except being here without documents and working illegally.\r\n\r\nSome of these people are well educated  behaved but due to hardships and  other reasons decided to come here for a better future not to sponge but to earn and honest living. Proper criminal checks can be carried out and everyone of them finger printed. They is a lot of suffering and abuse being faced by a lot of these people , they suffer in silence and surely they have paid for wrongly entering UK illegally.They have no links in the countries anymore. Each case can be dealt with on an individual basis.\r\nlf you agree with the above please sign this petition.",
