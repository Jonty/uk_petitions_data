        "additional_details": "There are thousands of internet professionals in this country that can produce web applications that are much more scalable and reliable than this site and yet we watch as the government repeatedly pay massive bills to big agencies to produce sites that spend more time down that up. The functionality required to produce this e-petitions site and to keep it up for millions of hits an hour is very simple and cost effective and yet we watch it fall over constantly.\r\n\r\nProcurement procedures need to change to ensure that work is awarded to smaller agencies and professionals that are competent at producing scalable web applications rather than big agencies that are competent at bidding for public work whilst being incompetent at delivery.",
