        "additional_details": "Many jobseekers surveyed believe they are unable to afford to take up employment because they do not have enough money to pay for increasing housing costs, transport costs for the first month and the following month and other costs like food, clothing, and prescription costs.\r\n\r\nThese rising costs on the jobseeker are not covered by the Job Centre when job seekers starts work and cause unnecessary stress on the new employee at work and often prevent jobseekers from taking employment from advertisements in the jobcentre or paper.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this e-petition is all new workers starting employment are paid fortnightly for the first 6 weeks of employment before being transferred to Monthly Pay as existing worker. This would reduce the barriers and costs for jobseekers taking employment.\r\n",
