        "additional_details": "I firmly believe that Great Britain should exercise its right to put a cap on the numbers of E U migrant workers. Whole communities are being inundated by workers from the E U, stretching public services and accomodation to breaking point and keeping U K citizens out of jobs by flooding the markets with unnecessary numbers of job seekers, etc. If the government are concerned about unemployment, then they should act. After all they seem hell bent on reform, so if they genuinely want to get nearer to full employment then I think this would be a perfectly reasonable step.",
