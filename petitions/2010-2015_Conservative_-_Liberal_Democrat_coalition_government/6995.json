        "additional_details": "Signatories to this petition require government to establish free on-line tutorials for maths, English, and single science subjects to AS/A2 Level.\r\n\r\nMany UK citizens are unable to reach their full potential due to an unsatisfactory experience at school.\r\n\r\nThose wishing to enter Higher Education or study with the Open University may have failed to acquire sufficient skills to enable participation.\r\n\r\nFree on-line tutorials would help students and ex-students to catch up and achieve their full potential.\r\n",
