It seems the weed smoking hippie, who has miraculously made it as the judge overseeing his case, has decided the poor little pettle, who selfishly, disgusting took something irreplaceable from 18 incredible, dedicated people, worthy of utmost respect, doesnt deserve a just punishment. Having served 6 weeks of his six months sentence, this floaty air headed \"judge\" has not only ignored the general concensus amongst decent human beings, but has also chosen to protect the imbecilic stain on humankind from the horrors of his terrifying, war torn homeland....Australia. Wonderful, we can keep this charming addition to our society for another few years. Step your game up Australia and take this moron off our hands. ",
