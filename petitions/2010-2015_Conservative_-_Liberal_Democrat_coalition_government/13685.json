See www.aboutmyvote.co.uk\r\n\r\nThere is also a second register, the Edited Register, which is sold for commercial use, including marketing. Your name and address is added to this register unless you opt out.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, petition the government to make the edited register an opt-in register. Ensuring that names and addresses are, by default, excluded from it.\r\n\r\nWe also request that, should an individual opt-out of the current edited register, their details are removed from previous edited registers also.\r\n",
