This act effectively enshrines into law the right to commit a crime without facing the consequences.\r\n\r\nCreated by foreign lawmakers and enforced by a foreign body which is unrepresentative and unaccountable to the British Public, this Act should be scrapped and replaced by a UK Bill of Rights more comprehensively compatible with the wider existing UK Laws and Interests.
