I feel it would be most beneficial on the national trails as it would give people greater access to them, I feel it would also encourage more people to take UK holidays and help the local economies around the trails.Surely in the age of obseity we should be doing all we can to encourage people to get out and about.Other areas that could also be considered for allowing wild camping are forrestry commision land, national parks and MOD land.\r\n\r\nI want the govenment to LEGALIZE wild camping\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
