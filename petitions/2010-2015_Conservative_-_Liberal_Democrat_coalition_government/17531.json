        "additional_details": "I call upon the government to promote better usage of the UK's road network by us, the drivers.\r\n\r\nWe were probably all good drivers when we first passed the test but, whilst our skill at driving increases with time, our etiquette and courtesy to other road users doesn\u2019t. With congested roads, this leads to selfish driving and dangerous driving which only serves to make things worse for everyone. I propose a television campaign of short (5 minute) programmes and advertisements to encourage all drivers to adopt a considerate style of driving in accordance with the highway code - keeping left on the motorway unless overtaking another vehicle, keeping a sensible distance, etc. These things can make the roads we have run better and ultimately keep us safer, ultimately get us to our destination quicker and make the experience better. This has got to be good for the economy. Such a campaign doesn't need to be dull or lecturing - it could potentially make good use of all our TV comedians.",
