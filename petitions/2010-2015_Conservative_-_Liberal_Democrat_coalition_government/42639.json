Ofcom is the Office for Communications, and deals with the broadcasting media, not with the free newspapers.\r\n\r\nTougher non-statutory independent self-regulation perhaps along the line of Lord Hunt of Wirral's proposals, with the power to issue fines would be much better in keeping a free press.\r\n\r\n",
