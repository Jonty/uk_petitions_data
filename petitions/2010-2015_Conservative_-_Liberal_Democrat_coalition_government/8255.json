This can range from 8% increases to 3000% increases in profit before tax for 2009 to 2010. Evidence for this is clear and when many thousands of people live in fuel poverty in the UK these large companies continue to profit at the societys expense.\r\n\r\nIf OGEM can no longer control year on year price increases forced on customers the government should step in and control the market as many 1000s of people in the UK can no longer live with this situation of year on year increases in price.\r\n\r\nSociety understand the need for alternate fuels but these profits are exessive and are of no way beneficial to the working man of the UK only the shareholders of these companies.",
