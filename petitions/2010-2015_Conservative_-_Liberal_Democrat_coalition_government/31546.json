        "additional_details": "The consultation document currently being used by the government to guage views on the proposed change to the definition of marriage to include same sex couples arguably contains leading questions and does not allow all members of society to have their say on certain parts of the bill by aiming some questions at gay couples only.\r\n\r\nWe petition the govenment to make the consultation fairer.  It should allow one to make comments to clarify one's view on each page of the document, it also should not contain questions that could be perceived as leading, or which force one to agree/disagree with individual parts of the proposal and phrase all questions so they may be answered by all members of the public.   Only this way will the views of all society be heard.",
