        "additional_details": "The transition from child to adult epilepsy care needs to improve! Epilepsy specialist nurses are not always available for adults this is a concern for women during pregnancy. GP practices should have a duty of care to provide pamphlets to all. This information is readily available if they are active members of epilepsy action. This would enable all suffers to obtain adequate information on the care that should be available to them, as it is sporadic. Not all areas within the UK follow NICE guidelines by reviewing patients adequately on an annual basis. 1 in 130 people have epilepsy in the UK and the lack of consistent care is not acceptable. Every individual should have access to a specialist nurse.",
