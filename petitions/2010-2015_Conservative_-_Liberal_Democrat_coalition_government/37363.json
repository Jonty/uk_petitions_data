        "additional_details": "Those who are 16-24 and not in education, employment or training, need something to be proud of, need a sense of achievement, a sense of self worth, and a sense of direction. National Conscription would do all of these things. At the same time, they could learn a trade/skill like engineering. it would boost the numbers of the Reservists and the TA. So if anyone aged 16-24 who were a NEET - (not in education/employment/training), then this would be the next option. If they are not qualified for Uni, then let the Services mold them. This would alleviate boredom, anti social behavior, the potential for riot, and would give our youth a much needed change of attitude and perception in the the community. It would be partly funded by redirecting their Jobseeker Allowance / ESA to cover some of the training costs.  ",
