        "additional_details": "Bring Bail Recovery Agents to the UK! Certified Bailiffs to take on warrants on people on HMP recall. To track, secure and return offenders to free up Police to deal with other roles within the Community. This would produce more jobs and crack down on crime before the wanted person can do anything again. The Police are way to over stretched dealing with this. I think the Bailiff / Agent should have ONLY the information they need to arrest the wanted, and work in partnership with Police force in that area. Have the same laws set out for them as US bail recovery agents and it works\r\n",
