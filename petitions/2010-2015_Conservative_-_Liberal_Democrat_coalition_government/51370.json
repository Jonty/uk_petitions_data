We're in sixth form through choice so we should choose how we dress, given that it's sensible. It's expensive and we cannot afford it. It's impractical and for year 12's entering year 13 is a waste of money. Does this mean we will have to work part time to pay for such business wear? When will we have time to study? It will cause difficulty for those doing creative subjects who will have to wear a suit solely to walk to school and change as soon as they arrive - pointless and a waste of money.\r\nIf the school want us to dress smartly, are they willing to fund it for everyone?\r\nWe want to keep the current dress code! Fight the change!",
