If someone objects to the e-petition they click vote-against.\r\n\r\nI don't think that an abstention button is required but this is a further refinement if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe criteria for passing to the back-benchers may need to be redefined:\r\n\r\neg retain status quo - more than 100,000 fors\r\n or more than 100,000 net votes\r\n or more than 100,000 total votes\r\n\r\nPerhaps the arbitrary 100,000 should be replaced by 0.1% of UK population (approx 70 million) ie 70,000.\r\n\r\nNB. A low net vote with high total votes indicates contention and may need to be debated anyway.",
