Today the HR act is abused by criminals who flout our laws and we suffer as a consequence.  I propose that the act be replaced by a UK bill of rights that better reflects our culture and our collective sense of fair play.  You break our rules and you are out no questions asked.  Abide by our rlues and you are welcome to this country",
