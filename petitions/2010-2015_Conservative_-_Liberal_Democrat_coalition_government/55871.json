        "additional_details": "We,the undersigned,call on the Uk Government to do everything in its power to protect the beautiful and valuable greenbelt land around Kibblesworth VIllage in the Borough of Gateshead from inappropriate development. If the developers go ahead and build the proposed 225 dwellings on the greenbelt to the west of the village, it will cause traffic chaos, blight Kibblesworth with urban sprawl and overcrowding, it will also destroy much loved fields, hedgerows and wildlife. The Government and Gateshead Council must insist that brownfield sites in the borough are built on first before even considering the destruction of greenbelt land.",
