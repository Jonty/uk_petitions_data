In addition, while 1/8 of UK drivers are under 25, they are involved in 1/3 of fatal accidents (source: The AA).  This also impacts upon insurance costs.  Some simple restrictions, successfully used in other countries, can create a safer environment in which newly qualified drivers get the experience they need to become safer drivers, whilst removing some factors that can cause them to be in situations they may not yet have the skill to either avoid or successfully negotiate.  Possible restrictions include:\r\n* mandatory display of 'green P' plates, indicating newly \u2018passed\u2019 driver *speed restrictions * restrictions on passengers under the age of 23 * limitations on driving hours (eg late night and/or dark driving) * 'zero' blood alcohol reading",
