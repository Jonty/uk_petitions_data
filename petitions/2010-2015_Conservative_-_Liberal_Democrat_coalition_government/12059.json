Should any one preach hate about our way of life then they should be made to leave this country and enjoy the hospitality of a country that indulges the same ideologies of that person. Should anyone go against the laws of this country while enjoying our hospitality then immediately they should be deported to their country of origin. Should anyone preach religion that is hateful of our way of life then they should be deported to a country that entertains their views. This is not racial but realistic we have our laws and those who enjoy our hospitality should abide by them. If someone commits a heinous crime and they are not a citizen of this country then they should be deported to their country of orign.",
