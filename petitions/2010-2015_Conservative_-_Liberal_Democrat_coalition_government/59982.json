        "additional_details": "A 1% Levy on Motor Insurance Premiums would generate approx \u00a3200m and would triple the current annual expenditure on fixing Pot Holes.\r\nWho Benefits?\r\nInsurance companies lose 1% of premiums, but recoup this by reducing the number of damage claims which are pot hole related.  Would have a nil effect on profits.\r\nMotorists, no change in cost of motor insurance, but benefit from 'pot hole free' roads. Reduced risk and inconvenience of accidents\r\nCyclists , a safer riding experience, and reduction in accidents.\r\nPedestrians, reduce risk of being splashed from water filled pot holes.\r\nLocal Authorities, could triple current expenditure for fixing pot holes. They could increase workforce at no additional cost.\r\nGovernment, introduce what would be a popular policy at no additional cost.\r\n\r\nThe levy could be paid to Local Authorities in direct proportion to the number of vehicles registered in their area,\r\n\r\n",
