Connect politics and government more with the people\r\n2. Save money on stupid projects\r\n3. Make the country more democratic\r\n4. Remove unpopular governments quicker\r\n5. Reduce or eliminate the excesses of government\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage would be we would have to put up with more elections, but it is a small price to pay for the advantages it gives.",
