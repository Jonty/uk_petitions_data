        "action": "Restore Rochester's status as a city",
        "additional_details": "In 1998, Medway Council conveniently \"forgot\" to reapply for city status for the historic cathedral city of Rochester, and then apparently failed to notice this \"oversight\" until 2002.  More likely it was part of a deliberate scheme so that they could apply (against the wishes of the vast majority of locals) for city status for \"Medway\", which is not even a town in its own right, but a \"unitary authority\" made up of quite separate towns and villages including Rochester.  As they have now deservedly failed in their little vanity project (losing out to the actual towns Chelmsford, Perth and St. Asaph...despite, or perhaps because of, expensively rebranding themselves as \"City of Medway\" two years in advance), I suggest that Her Majesty considers automatically restoring city status to Rochester, thus re-establishing 900 years of history swept away by the self-serving cultural vandals of Medway Council, irrespective of their opinions on the matter, to teach them a lesson.",
