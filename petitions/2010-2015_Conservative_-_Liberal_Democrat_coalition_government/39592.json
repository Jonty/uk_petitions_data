Those men and women have signed up to give their lives for this country, if necessary, yet are treated as 'cannon fodder' by successive Governments, who use them, shamelessly, to further collective ambition, yet treat them as a dispensable asset when it comes to investing in them, financially. To paraphrase Edmund Burke in his speech of 23/4/1770 'For evil to triumph, all it takes is for good men to do nothing!' If only! What these 'good men' are doing, is providing the perfect conditions for evil to triumph! STOP THESE CUTS, NOW!",
