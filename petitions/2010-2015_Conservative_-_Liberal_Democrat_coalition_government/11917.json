        "additional_details": "The Government should arrange 'immersion stays' to Council Estates for key members of Government shaping social policy - including the Prime Minister and Chancellor. Members of the Government would live in social accommodation, shop locally and experience first hand the issues that residents face.\r\n\r\nMinisters lack any formal, structured personal development to help them in their jobs of representing the interests of the electorate. Immersion stays in areas of the UK facing some of the most challenging social circumstances would be one step towards addressing this flaw. The visits could be arranged during recess (holiday periods).",
