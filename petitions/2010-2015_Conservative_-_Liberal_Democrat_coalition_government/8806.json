Helping people in need is a good thing, but doing it and waiting for nothing in return (there are no guarantees from those people that they will start working and paying their own rent) is just mindless. We are basically encouraging laziness and a sort of social behaviour that triggered the riots in the UK these last few days.\r\n\r\nFor example, I know a family where both parents are able to work and provide for their three kids, but they choose not to because they have a better lifestyle now (receiving about \u00a32300/month in benefits) than they would if they would both start working.\r\n\r\nThere are 600.000 people only in London in a very similar situation. How much money do we waste each month? This has to end!",
