        "additional_details": "The government was obliged by the 8th April 2012 to have introduced Mandatory Carbon Reporting, or explained why they have not. Instead, the coalition government\u2019s decision has been that there has been \u201cno decision\u201d.\r\n\r\nCarbon reporting works by encouraging companies to measure and calculate their total carbon emissions. The experience of the Carbon Disclosure Project - which encourages voluntary disclosure - has been that not only have disclosing companies acknowledged their fossil fuel usage, they have in the process addressed issues of efficiency, reduced costs and actively taken positive steps towards reductions.\r\n\r\nHowever, this practice of business action must be spread to all major carbon emitters. The intention of this petition is to demonstrate the widespread grass root support for carbon action; to acquire 100,000 signatures and spark a parliamentary debate that the government cannot ignore.\r\n",
