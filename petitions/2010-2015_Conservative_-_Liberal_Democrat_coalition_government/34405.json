        "action": "Establish a bottle deposit scheme to increase recycling",
        "additional_details": "The undersigned would like to see the introduction of a bottle deposit scheme in order to increase the amount of plastics/glass which the UK recycles.\r\n\r\nThe way the scheme works is that for each bottle bought (eg. at a Supermarket), the Supermarket would then add a small deposit (eg. \u00a30.25) to the bill.\r\n\r\nAfter the bottle has been used, the customer would simply return it to the shop and receive the \u00a30.25 deposit back.\r\n\r\nThe shop would then have to have the bottle recycled.\r\n\r\nSuccessful scheme such as this already operate in Germany, where recycling is common practice. It would instil the habit of recycling and not cost the consumer any extra providing they recycle the bottle.\r\n\r\nThe scheme could be phased in gradually to allow businesses to cope with the implementation.
