        "additional_details": "Since privatisation our rail network has deteriorated into a national disgrace. Victorian engineers such as Brunel would be dismayed to see how their ventures have fared. Nationalisation is the only way to recover the network under one umbrella company , maybe we could call it British Rail. Fares are among the highest in the world but service and reliabilty do not reflect this. We don't need amazing stations and trains. We need cheap, reliable, useable trains. We will never tempt people out of their cars while the trains are so expensive. I have a family car and it costs me \u00a370 to transport my family of 5 from Devon to Lancashire and back. The same return journey on the train is \u00a3420. ",
