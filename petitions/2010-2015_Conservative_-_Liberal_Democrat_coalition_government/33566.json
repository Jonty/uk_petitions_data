Plus you do no know if it is safe.\r\n\r\nIf people come out with deformed babies because of someone modifying the food. that would no look good.\r\nThings like this need to be considered. this mite be an extreme case but It first will modify the animals and they become more resistant to anything you put on GMO food. This mean you would have to make it stronger eventually which makes it even more dangerous and puts the stakes higher.\r\n\r\nso that is why we should say no to GMO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
