During this tough economic climate education isn't desired experience and skills attained are. I would like to propose that Job Centre Plus should give job seekers the opportunity to work voluntarily in their offices. Individuals would then gain the following skills such as Administrative experience including working with colleagues, using administrative software packages. Team working skills including following and/or issuing instructions and contributing to everyday tasks. Communication and interpersonal skills including working with new people, understanding your assignment. Attention to detail, researching documents or maintaining records. The ability to learn quickly and absorb information quickly; whilst working on different assignments. These skills are essential and are desired when employers are looking for the perfect candidate.",
