        "additional_details": "Our local high streets and shopping centres are dieing off - killed mostly by supermarkets and on-line shopping and by the myth that small shops are more expensive.\r\n\r\nI am asking the government to urgently consider the following to help small high street businesses survive: 1) council tax reduction  2) improvement of parking provision (should be free in many cases),  3) reduce rent for market traders.  4) help with high rents for first 3 years of trade.\r\n\r\nMy main interest is not financial but environmental; high streets are the 'heart' of local communities where people can meet, socialise  and shop in a stress-free way.  Without them a feeling of isolation and depression will be free to thrive & grow.",
