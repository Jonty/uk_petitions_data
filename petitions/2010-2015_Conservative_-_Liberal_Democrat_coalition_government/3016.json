        "additional_details": "The maximum yearly benefit entitlement should not exceed 75% of the average yearly national wage. This will prevent benefit abuse by people who are able to work but choose not to do so. It will also curb the practice of people having a lot of children to claim more benefits.\r\nBenefits should remain with working people by lowering their taxes and not by handing out their hard earned money to the lazy.\r\nHard working, law abiding citizens should be rewarded by paying lower taxes, benefit scroungers should be punished by living in dormitory style accomodation and soup kitchens. They should not receive cash handouts.",
