        "additional_details": "Public sector works need to start paying for their pension\u2019s in full.  Why should these workers be able to amount pension pot that the private sector worker can only dream about?  The private sector is being forced to pay large amount of money in both local (about 25-35% in council tax) and central government taxes to give these workers a better start in their retirement. If these worker paid 90% plus of their pension pot, the Government could cut taxes for all making it easier for the private sector works to get pensions.  We also have too many pen pushers \u2013 these needs to be cut by 15-20%.",
