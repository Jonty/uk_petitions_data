        "additional_details": "The logical solution to Sir Howard Davies and Boris Johnson's London Airport problem is to create TWO identical International Airports. One called Heathrow West (the current Heathrow) and the other Heathrow East (0n the Thames Estuary).\r\n   Air transport would be divided between the two dependant on their destinations as follows:- the dividing line would be the Prime Meridian line at Greenwich - zero degrees - to 180 degrees longitude to the West and to the East.\r\n   Both Airports would benefit and thrive  by dividing existing flights between the two giving each an opportunity to grow.  They would be linked by the new cross London underground.  London would sit between the two and become a major stop over.\r\n   The Government should consider this as the preferred equitable solution to all other proposals.\r\n\r\n    ",
