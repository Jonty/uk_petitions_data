        "additional_details": "We would like the Government to put in a new zebra crossing on Whalebone Lane North between The Warren School and the Moby Dick Pub.\r\n\r\nWe would also like safety railings to run in more  strategic places along Whalebone Lane to help keep predestrians safe.\r\n\r\nThis is to support a crossing already in place by the Warren School and allow our pupils to cross safely in more than one area.\r\n\r\nWe have had a number of our pupils seriously injured in road traffic accidents over the last 3 years and want to avoid any more injuries or even a fatality.",
