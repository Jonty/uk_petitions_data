        "additional_details": "The infrastructure to the south west is poor, Exeter has a good train and airport link to London.  Plymouth doesn't, if we extend the M5 from Exeter to Plymouth we will ensure business growth and therefore jobs in Plymouth.\r\nThere are more people out of work in Plymouth than Exeter and this is greatly influenced by the travel infrastructure.  If a new business looks to relocate to the South West they will not consider Plymouth because the motorway ends at Exeter.",
