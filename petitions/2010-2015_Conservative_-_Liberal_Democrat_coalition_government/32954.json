        "additional_details": "In the last year, the taxpayer subsidised alcohol and food in Westminster, to the tune of \u00a35.8m, with \u00a31.33m of that spent on alcohol. For every \u00a310 spent, the taxpayer funded \u00a37.60 of that.\r\n\r\nWith the disgraceful drunken behaviour of some MP's and reports of some turning up drunk to parliament, I think it is disgusting that as a taxpayer, I am paying for these people to get drunk.\r\n\r\nIt must end, we are all in this together, afterall. Scrap the subsidy, pay for your own drink.",
