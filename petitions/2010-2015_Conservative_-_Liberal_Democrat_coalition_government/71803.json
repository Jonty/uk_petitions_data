Children need to be taught the consequences of violence for victims, the families of victims and the limits of having a conviction for violence in the workplace. This is in memory of Michael Green (23) who was killed in Peterborough in May 2014. Four young people, all under 18 years old have been charged with his murder. None if them have any concept of the consequences of their actions. Only better education can end the violence. ",
