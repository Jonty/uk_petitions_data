        "additional_details": "The Government should dual the a17 due to the fact it is a very busy trade road for lorries and also carries a high volume of cars. The dangerous overtaking on this road leads to the extremely high accident rates on the a17 which has caused it to become a red route.\r\nThere is sufficient space to dual the a17 as there are large ditches on both sides for most of the way from Kings Lynn to Lincoln. Journey times would be largely reduced for both cars and lorries as well as making this road safer. The money spent improving this road would be returned via the increased volume of trade going from south to north in less time and a shorter route than going via Peterborough, London etc. Furthermore, it would bring tourism to both the north and south if the car journey was much quicker.
