        "additional_details": "The government plan to cut funding for the scientific research body that is responsible for scientific research in the polar regions.\r\n\r\nThe British Antarctic Survey was key in discovering the ozone hole during the 1980's sparking the biggest international cooperation operation in history. Since then British Antarctic Survey has been at the forefront of climate research in the areas that most sensitive and important to climate change.\r\n\r\nNew government plans will see funding cuts and restrictions applied that will undermine the vitally important work that the centre undertakes to safeguard the worlds future.\r\n\r\nPlease add your support to the petition and help stop these cuts.",
