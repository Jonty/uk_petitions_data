        "additional_details": "Many carers work all day, 7 days a week. In addition to this carers who live with the person they care for are often available to care through the night when necessary. Despite the fantastic work they do & the fact that they are available to care at ALL times, carers get paid only \u00a358.45 per week. For many this equates to less than 35p per hour for the time that they work and are available. Carers work HARD & vulnerable disabled people benefit by having a close family member or friend who understands how to meet their needs. Many carers live in poverty on as little as 35p per hour, or get a better paid job which means they receive no carers allowance for their caring responsibilities and disabled people do not get the care & attention they need. GIVE CARERS AND DISABLED PEOPLE A FAIR DEAL - IT'S NOT A CHOICE IT'S A NECESSITY!",
