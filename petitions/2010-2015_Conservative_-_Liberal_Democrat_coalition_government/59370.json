        "additional_details": "This petition is asking for a allowance of two weeks per year to be taken as a family holiday, as we  are aware the current situation gives no chance for some families to take family holidays together because of the cost. This petition is asking that an allowance of two week be given in which families can be together on holiday at a considerably lower cost than at present. There is a vast difference between School holiday weeks and other weeks during the year and the only way to stop the hard working parents of school children having to go into debt or not have an holiday is to ensure that they can take a leave at anytime rather than the present bottleneck caused by the draconian rules in place at this time.\r\n By signing this petition we can let those in charge know that we do not want people put in prison or fined for trying to give their children decent memories of their childhood.",
