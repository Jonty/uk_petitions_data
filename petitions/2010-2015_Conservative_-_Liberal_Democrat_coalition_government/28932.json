        "additional_details": "Brandon has raised its by 41.7pc, to \u00a3282,231, to help pay for the takeover of Brandon Country Park, changes to street lighting, and a future extension to the cemetery.  The first anyone was aware of this extra charge was from the local newspaper.\r\nThe charge is a little over \u00a320 per household for a band b property per year. This is alot for a deprived Brandon especially for families who are trying not to spiral in to debt with the rise in food, fuel, water and other utility bills.\r\nWe want the government to step in and make the Town council listen that this is not the best way of making money needed and that they do have to make cuts like everywhere else.\r\nIf you want to stop Brandon Town council from putting up there part of the council tax especially seeing Suffolk county council and police have frozen there part of the council tax then please sign this petition.",
