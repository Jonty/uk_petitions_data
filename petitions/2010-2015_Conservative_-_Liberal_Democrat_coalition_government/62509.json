        "additional_details": "The Peterborough City Council are proposing to stop providing the current Caretaker Service to sports clubs.\r\n\r\nThis would mean that clubs would have to:-\r\n- Clean the changing rooms and pavilions\r\n- Put up goal nets on match days\r\n- Clear debris etc. from pitches\r\n\r\nThis will seriously harm the local game with the potential reduction of volunteers and players.\r\n\r\nWe would like to ask the Peterborough City Council to reconsider this proposal. Peterborough needs good quality sporting provision, it needs the facilities, the participants and the volunteers. Please support the football community.",
