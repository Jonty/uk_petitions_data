        "additional_details": "We the people of Shirebrook and the surrounding area demand that a full review of the viability of an Swimming pool within Shirebrook be undertaken by the local authorities. This petition is a direct result of yet again another town within the district being allocated the potential of a new swimming pool being built in their locality. Since the 1960's Shirebrook has been requesting that some of the unused land within Shirebrook be used to provide these facilities. Local business people have in the past offered to build these facilities but have been refused permission to build, We are short of safe, supervised and secure facilities for the children and families to exercise in Shirebrook. It is now time that the people of this area were listened to and treated to a facility which is long overdue.",
