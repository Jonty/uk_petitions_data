        "action": "Should the BBC continue to be taxpayer funded whilst being politically biased?",
        "additional_details": "The taxpayer funded BBC has, by their own admission, been \u2018massively politically biased\u2019 and is frequently \u2018talking Britain down\u2019 by constant negativity. Whilst it is imperative that the UK media has the freedom of opinion and investigation, we the undersigned below do not believe that taxpayers\u2019 money should be used for this purpose.  Thus, this petition is to address whether the BBC should continue to be taxpayer funded whilst in its current form, and if it is still to be funded by the taxpayer, whether it\u2019s political bias and influence should be contained.",
