        "additional_details": "I want the Government to add to the school curriculum lessons on the 3 main political parties, which sections of society they represent as individual parties.  This would have to be taught in an unbiased, balanced way without the teacher's own personal views putting any slant on the lesson.  They should start with history of democracy from the signing of the Magna Carta to the present day, explaining as the lesson progresses which political party is responsible for passing various legislation which affects all of our lives, ie could discuss private enterprise, national mimimum wage, explaining which party was responsible for each individual bill on those and similar topics.  Then our young adults can go to the polling station having made an informed decision and it will help them to appreciate democracy.",
