Lifetime ban from keeping any animals.Increased penalties.\r\n Put an end to the uneccessary suffering of our animals",

Powers for local authorities and police to investigate and take action in cases of suspected cruelty are provided in the Animal Welfare Act 2006. Under the 2006 Act, the maximum penalty for causing unnecessary suffering is a fine of \u00a320,000 or six months imprisonment, or both. In addition, the court can impose post-conviction penalties on anyone found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal by disqualifying anyone from having any influence over the keeping of animals for as long as the court see fit.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold",
