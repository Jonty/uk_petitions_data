        "action": "Introduce a new bill of Childrens rights to see thier father",
        "additional_details": "There will be cases where it would be to the child's detriment to have contact with thier fathers. This proposal is not intended for that. It is intended as a tool for children and thier mothers to be able to use the law to ensure children see thier fathers. Every child has a right to see thier fathers. Why should these neglectful men not be held accountable? The bond with a mother is sacred and substantially important. The bond with a father is also important. It would not be a straight forward bill, however the fundamental premise would be for the child and parent to be able to draw upon help to make the absent parent think about thier behaviour and in the first instance voluntarily see thier child and if this is not successful, go on to use the law in the form of contact orders. Much like the rights fathers already have to see thier children but reversed for the rights of the child. Alot of social problems would be tackled at root cause if such a bill/law were to be introduced",
