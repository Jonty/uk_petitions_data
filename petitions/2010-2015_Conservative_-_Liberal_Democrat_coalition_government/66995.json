        "additional_details": "It has come to light, that the BAE Systems Hawk T1 as used by the RAF Aerobatic Display Team (The Red Arrows), will be shortly withdrawn after 36+ years faithful service.\r\n\r\nI feel, along with countless others, that this Country benefits enormously from their Displays at home and abroad. They have been described as, the World\u2019s Best Aerobatic Display Team. They also sell this Countries wares around the world, and aid in the recruitment of personal for the RAF. They also may you feel Proud to be British!\r\n\r\nWe feel that the Government, should not take the ability of the RAF Red Arrows Display Team, and therefore should make available a new aircraft when the time is due.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you agree that the RAF Red Arrows, should receive new aircraft.\r\n\r\nThank You Everyone for your valuable support.\r\n",
