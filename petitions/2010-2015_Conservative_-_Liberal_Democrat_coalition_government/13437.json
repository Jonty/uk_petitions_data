        "additional_details": "To make law that national examination boards adopt a percentile grading system for their GCSE, A Level and other key examinations.\r\n\r\nFor example, in each subject, based on their individual marks, the top 5% of examinees achieve \u2018A*\u2019 grading, the next 10% achieve \u2018A\u2019 grading and so on.  Anyone in the bottom X percentile to obtain \u2018U\u2019 or \u2018Fail\u2019.  I am not proposing where the boundaries should be placed, but the principle itself.\r\n\r\nUnder the current system, universities and employers looking for particular academic qualities are unable to assess candidates\u2019 relative strengths in comparison with the rest of their peer groups.  This makes both the education and recruitment processes highly uneconomical.\r\n\r\nOnly by differentiating the highest achievers in each year-group do educational establishments, businesses and individuals get a fair and unbiased opinion of their academic achievements.\r\n",
