        "additional_details": "On Saturday 19th May 2012, the Queen invited the King of Bahrain to Buckingham Palace for tea, an invititation which was sanctioned by the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nThe King of Bahrain is committing systematic human rights violations in his homeland. Therefore the invitation was totally unacceptable. Not only does it undermine the UK's stance on human rights but it also legitimises a brutal and oppressive regime.\r\n\r\nWe therefore demand an inquiry into why such an invitation was allowed.",
