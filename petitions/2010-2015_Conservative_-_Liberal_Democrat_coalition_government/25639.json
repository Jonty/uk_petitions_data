        "additional_details": "\r\nTea has been the nation's favourite beverage throughout the ages.  When people stereotype us they often use some sort of tea related comment.  As a nation we need to stand up and remember how the perfect cup of tea is made.\r\n\r\nIn this day an age people have simply forgot how to make the perfect cuppa.  With people making the most cardinal sins by adding the milk first or whist the tea bag is still in the cup.  This is not right! To make the perfect cup of tea you first put the tea bag and sugar (optional) into the mug, then you add water and stir, leave for a few moments whilst you get the milk stir again, squeeze the goodness out and dispose of the tea bag.  Then and only then must you add the milk.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, request the government add basic tea making to the national curriculum.",
