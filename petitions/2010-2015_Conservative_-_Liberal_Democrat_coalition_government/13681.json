        "additional_details": "Climate change is multi-factorial, whose interactions can be difficult to predict. Only a few years ago, hardly anyone talk about the greenhouse effects. I believe the person who brought globing warming into the fore is Al Gore about 11 years ago. Climate change due to CO2 greenhouse effects palls into insignificance when sun flares occur, a large meteorite struck the earth, when earth\u2019s magnetic poles reverse its polarity. The earth\u2019s circular orbit with the sun can revert to elliptical orbit causing the next ice age, which has been predicted to may occur again in around 2030. If enough cold, fresh water coming from the melting polar ice caps and the melting glaciers of Greenland flows into the northern Atlantic, it will shut down the warm Gulf Stream and then instead of increased global warming, winter would set in for all of Europe, Siberia and eastern USA.",
