This area is a cause of great confusion and distress for this group of our society.  In most cases HM Revenue & Customs would have sufficient detail to collect a reasonable estimate of the individuals liabilities through the PAYE system.\r\n\r\nThe loss to the exchequer would likely be minimal but the benefit to this proportion of society would be substantial in their last years of life.\r\n\r\n",
