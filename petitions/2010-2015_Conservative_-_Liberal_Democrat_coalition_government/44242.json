        "additional_details": "Job centres up & down the country need to provide better customer service. No respect or appreciation given for an unemployed persons struggle or attempts to find work, Ive been treated like i didnt matter. This has got to stop we deserve to be treated as human beings not a pain just because we are unemployed we aren't criminals, we just want help & given the customer service provided its a disgusting way to treat others the unemployed could do a far better job than what they do, These so called 'advisors' need retraining & regular appraisals, its not just about certain people now but the treatment of all people & anyone in the future.",
