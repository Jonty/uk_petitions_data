        "additional_details": "The planning inspectorate is a QANGO that is riding roughshot over local constituents views, by making ill informed planning decisions, that are destroying our countryside and placing unwelcome strain/ costs to our local services. We demand that this organisation is closed down and that future planning decisions are restored to local planning officers. This oranisation has killed the 'Localism act', in favour of pandering to the wishes of the corporate building contractors, whilst sticking two fingers up at the electorate.",
