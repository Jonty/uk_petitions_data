        "additional_details": "If you are a British Citizen and marry a non-european, your spouse is unable to come to England and live with you unless you earns \u00a318,600.  This rule does not apply to any other EU citizen.  ie.  British person marries an Australian and earns \u00a315,000 a year, their spouse is not entitled to settle here.  If say a Polish/German/Spanish etc etc person earns \u00a315,000 and marry's an Australian their spouse can settle here.  Is this fair!!  I think not.  The British people are getting descriminated against in their own country.  We need to stand up and unite.  The same rule needs to be the same for everyone. ",
