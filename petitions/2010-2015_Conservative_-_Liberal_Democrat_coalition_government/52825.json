        "additional_details": "Our children are individuals and their successes in education should be judged as such. As a parent and a teacher I want to know a) is my child happy and content at school? b) are they engaged and motivated to learn? c) are they being stretched to achieve to their potential?and d) is their behaviour and attitude appropriate in a learning environment? None of these questions can be answered by knowing which percentage bracket a student falls into nationally. It is counter productive, divisive, potentially damaging for an individual's self perception and risks turning children off learning all together. Abandon these ill concieved plans with immediate effect before irreversible damage is done to our children. ",
