        "additional_details": "In the light of recent rememberance day commemorations, I ask the Government to consider limiting the continual surge of christmas marketing activities (particularly TV advertising) which seems to come earlier each year, until after Rememberance Sunday has taken place.  Surely it is wrong to be highlighting the ideal of a happy family christmas, when we are commemorating those whose family  lives have been torn apart.  This is not intended to be anti-Christmas or anti-Capitalist.  I am just asking for a respectful distance between the low season of rememberance and the joy of Christmas",
