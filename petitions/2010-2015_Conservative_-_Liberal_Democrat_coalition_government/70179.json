They have been staying on the streets since last Saturday night (27/9).\r\n\r\nAs full democracy in Hong Kong was solemnly promised in the Sino-British Joint Declaration which Britain was a signatory, we loyally, by this our humble Petition, request Her Majesty's Government to uphold Britain's duties to monitor the implementation of the Joint Declaration. We also appeal to Her Majesty's government to make it clear to the Chinese central authorities that any effort to crackdown peaceful demonstrations by force will be strongly opposed and severely punished.",
