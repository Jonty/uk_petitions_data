        "additional_details": "Vamp a London based graffiti writer has been sentenced to 3 and half years in jail for vandalism and perverting the course of justice. In comparison Stuart Hall a convicted sexual offender of children was sentenced the same day to 15 months in jail.\r\n\r\nWe petition the UK government department of justice to see a more lenient sentence which fits his crime of vandalism. We petition for a reduced sentence or the removal of a prison sentence to be replaced with community service in the local community of artistic nature where this man can teach others his artistic skills. What kind of image does this give to the populace of the UK when we treat those who harm others better than those who seek to bring happiness to our lives through art. It is evident that the UK government regards property of corporate entities with higher regard than the lives of the general public.",
