        "additional_details": "The Government owns 43.4% of Lloyds Banking Group, with their backing we may be able to overturn the decision to close Essex house by LBG.\r\nOn Thursday 9th May, I along with 850 other employees of Essex House were told without warning that we will loose our jobs in December. We were told a decision had been made by the bank not to renew the lease on Essex House. The employees effected by this decision believe it is completely unjustified and should be overturned. If you agree, please sign this petition and share it with your family and friends.\r\n\r\nWe are calling upon the whole Southend community \u2013 customers, politicians, council, businesses and the media \u2013 to join us in vigorously opposing the closure of Essex House and to help us force Lloyds Bank to ditch its closure plans.",
