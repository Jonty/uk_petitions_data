        "additional_details": "Having football stadiums on streets originally intended for horse and cart creates *enormous* tailbacks, attracts crime and antisocial behaviour and overloads understaffed stations like West Brompton. My solution is to move stadiums out of the centre, rejuvinating derelict land in the outskirts with new stations at each stadium (tying in with Crossrail in London). Crime would no longer be in the centre (lower security costs) and having their own stations would reduce pollution by reducing the number of people who drive and would cut congestion. The construction and running of the new stadiums and stations would increase employment. Cheaper land could lead to larger stadiums. These football matches are downright selfish, whole parts of a city grinding to a complete halt so a few thousand people can watch a match is completely ludicrous.",
