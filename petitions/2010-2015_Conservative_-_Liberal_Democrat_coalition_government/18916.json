This will cost the Treasury less than closing them and putting workers on welfare. We need help to get public bodies to place work at Remploy under EU Rules as now allowed.\r\n\r\nKeep disabled people in Work and allow disabled people- old and young- to have a future; by keeping Remploy factories open, you are supporting Disabled people.",
