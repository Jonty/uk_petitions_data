        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call for an urgent review of the proposed 8% increase in rail fares in England. We are concerned that the increase in fares will affect millions of commuters across the country already paying high fares for services provided by rail companies that are not fit for purpose; subject to overcrowding, delays and cancellations on a daily basis. Rail users in the UK already pay some of the highest rail fares in Europe and we feel that further increases do not take into account the lack of service and improvement that is evident from our use of such services. Proposed fare increases will also lead individuals to seek alternative transportation including travelling by car and motorbike which will undoubtedly impact the Governments aim of encouraging environmentally friendly travel across England and the rest of the United Kingdom.
