        "additional_details": "Give fathers parity to mothers, ensuring that children go to the best parent rather than the mother being the default resident parent.\r\n\r\nTo prevent children futures being destroyed by mothers who only use children as financial safety net and are not capable of helping their children reach their full potential.\r\n\r\n1. Additions made to the Family Bill that allows fathers to gain sole custody based on capability rather than if the mother is unfit.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Fathers to get equal access once parental responsibility is acquired .\r\n\r\n3. Enforcing contact when mothers frustrate access more quickly, with more serious sanctions imposed if they refuse.\r\n\r\n4. Speed up court litigation so that cases are resolved faster.\r\n\r\n5. A clear time span for targets to be met by both parents when it comes to disputes\r\n\r\n6. An independent watchdog that ensures that women comply with access orders.\r\n\r\n7. Fair support and treatment of Fathers regardless of their financial background.\r\n",
