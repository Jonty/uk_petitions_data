        "additional_details": "Halal is a practise of killing the animals by slitting their throats while a blessing is made. However these animals are not stunned first as is the normal practise which means they are fully aware of whats happening. They are then hung upside down while the blood is drained from them. They dont die instantly. This is a cruel practise despite how its dressed up.",
