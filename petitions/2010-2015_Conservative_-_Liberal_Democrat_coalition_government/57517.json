In many ways, the previous e-petition site was superior. The following are suggested:\r\n\r\nThe more formal introduction to a petition used previously raised the standard of contribution and should be reinstated\r\n\r\nMore and better sort options would allow improved access by those interested\r\n\r\nA better search engine is needed - the current one is not fit for purpose\r\n\r\nAn option to sign opposing a petition should be introduced. It would give a clearer view of public opinion without the need to raise a counter-petition\r\n",
