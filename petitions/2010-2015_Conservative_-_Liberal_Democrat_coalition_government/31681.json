        "additional_details": "To pass the draft Bill \"The Care Homes & Sheltered Accommodation (Domestic Pets) Bill.  This was last before Parliament on 05/0310. It received wide-spread cross-party support.   It did not progress further because of lack of parliamentary time.\r\nEvery year, approximately 38,000 pets are put down and an estimated 100,000 pets are put up for adoption, because their owners are going into a Care Home or Sheltered Housing and they are not allowed to take their pet.  Moving into a home due to failing health or physical needs is distressing and stressful.  The loss of a pet at the same time must make it even worse. We are not calling for a blanket policy so that any pet be allowed.  The draft bill provides for a basic legal presumption that pets should be permitted, subject to certain common sense limits.",
