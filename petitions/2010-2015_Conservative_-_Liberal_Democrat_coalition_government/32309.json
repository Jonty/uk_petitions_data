        "action": "End and prevent any further British military involvement in foreign countries. (Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan)",
        "additional_details": "Stop all war funding and troop deployment in foreign countries, we would be better defended if our troops were back home and our money was spent developing our country. All our continued unwanted military involvement causes is more unrest, more enemies, more blood on our hands and a larger threat of retaliation on our soil.\r\n\r\nEven if it was morally right to force entire populations to adopt the views expressed by an undetermined amount of people through military intervention without any legal investigation, it costs money that we, the undersigned would rather be spent on promoting our own economy, well being and safety.\r\n\r\nLet's show the world how a fair, accountable and prosperous country works. Provide a model of good governance that the people of the world can, if they wish, promote to whatever degree they decide, like has been done many times including by ourselves in the 17th century. We do not have the right nor the resources to impose anybody's ideals forcefully on the world.",
