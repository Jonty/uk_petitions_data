My son found this very distressing and I telephoned my local council hillingdon and they said phone the police so I did but an hour later she was still there she was romanian and if thats what we have coming the UK or the no longer GREAT BRITAIN is completely finished where is my home land.I was proud of my country when I was a teenager learning how my grandad risked his life with millions of others to stop hitler but now all I hear from youngsters is they risked there lives for nothing germany now call the shots anyway without a war and that is disrespectful to my grandfather so why should I respect my country when we are allowing immigrants to take over.WE NEED TO STAND FIRM AND MAKE THE UK GREAT BRITAIN AGAIN ",
