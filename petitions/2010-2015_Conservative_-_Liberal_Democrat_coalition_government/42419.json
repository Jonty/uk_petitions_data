        "additional_details": "Strictly limit the size of solar installations on farmland to 5 acres or less. Provide planning authorities with clear guidance and introduce a sequential test - brown field sites before farmland.\r\n\r\nLocal Planning Authorities are being inundated with planning applications - the gold rush for solar. Lack of experience in dealing with this new industry leads to decision making that is ad hoc on a case by case basis. Government needs to ensure it is evidence based decision making with clear unambiguous plannning guidance for authorities to follow.\r\n\r\nAlso provide clear instruction about end of life - who is responsible and who pays for removal of panels and potentially hazardous waste in 25 years time?",
