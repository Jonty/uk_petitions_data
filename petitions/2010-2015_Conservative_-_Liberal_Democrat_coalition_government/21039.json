For Example: \u00a310 on your electric key \u00a310 on your gas meter \u00a325 in supermarket vouchers, or whatever is considered the relevant amount needed for these services and goods. All supermarkets and utilities companies should be forced to accept these vouchers in lieu of cash which they can claim payment from the government with some kind of VAT tax break built in. This will stop long term benefit claimants drinking and smoking and watching sky tv whilst the rest of us go to work to provide for them. ",
