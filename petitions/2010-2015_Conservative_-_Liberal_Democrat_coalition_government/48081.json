        "additional_details": "There is a common misconception that all parents who send their children to private schools are 'rich' or 'wealthy'. In reality many parents who pay to put their children through private education do not fall into one of these categaries and work hard and go with out in order to give their children a good education.\r\n\r\nPrivate school fees are very expensive, especially if you have multiple children going through the system at the same time.\r\n\r\nAlso, the more children that are in private eduction the less of a strain there is on the local government funded schools and therefore this reduces the funding requirements from the budget.\r\n\r\nAll we are asking for is tax relief for private school fees to assist families in providing a high level of education for their children.",
