Hundreds of men, women and children were gunned down by British Indian Army soldiers under the command of General Dyer.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre\r\n\r\nThe UK Government (and Queen) have issued other apologies for massacres committed in times past for example The Bloody Sunday killings in Ireland.\r\n\r\nPlenty of people have demanded a full apology for the Amritsar killings - to do so could only bring our nations closer.",
