        "additional_details": "If an industry is too big too fail, it is too big to be held in private hands. UK banks should be nationalised. Why should taxpayers continue to bail out banks and then stand aside as the profits aggregate in the hands of the few. All profits from banks would come to the government. Also, banks never again avoid taxes. This would provide a huge contribution to HM Treasury which could be used to stimulate the economy or improve public services.",
