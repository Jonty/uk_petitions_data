This would mean that Sky could collect the licence fee as part of the subscription cost and pay it directly to TV licencing (one fee).\r\n\r\nIt would also mean that 'catch up' services could offer pay per view live coverage of major events and sports. This cost would be the equivalent of 1 days licence fee and would only be available for free if a valid TV licence number is provided. ",
