        "additional_details": "The Greater Merseyside / Liverpool City Region Combined Authority is an undemocratic body consisting of six council leaders.\r\n\r\nThese council leaders take expenses of \u00a33,000+ each and make decisions on matters concerning over 1.5 million people.\r\n\r\nYet nobody gets to vote for them and decisions are made by the Mayor of Liverpool.\r\n\r\nThis is communism at its worst. We know what's best, kidda, so we'll decide for you.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the Mayor of Liverpool, most of the people of St Helens, Runcorn, Widnes, Southport, Formby and quite a lot of people in places such as Rainhill, Prescot, West Kirkby, Maghull, etc., want nothing to do with it.\r\n\r\nThe previous local authority (Merseytravel) did things such as buy Beatles memorabilia in Liverpool, lost \u00a3300,000 on a discount voucher, and operates tourist attractions (in Liverpool, of course).\r\n\r\nThis needs to be abolished as the first step in a return to Lancashire that existed prior to 1974.",
