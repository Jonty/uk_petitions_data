        "action": "Review the xenoestrogen overload in our way of life",
        "additional_details": "Young girls are reaching puberty around 3 years earlier than 30 years ago, male fish in our rivers are turning female in droves, more men are experiencing infertility and many women are suffering from the symptoms of estrogen dominance ( eg depression, weight gain, infertility etc ) without them or most doctors even having heard of this condition. Xenoestrogens are getting into the water supply via the urine of millions of women on the birth control pill. Xenoestrogens are also getting into the food chain via the use of certain plastics like phthalates etc used in packaging / cooking and in hundreds of other ways eg pesticides, air fresheners, skin creams, shampoos etc . This petition would like an official review of the consequences of this and what could be done about it including better filtering of sewage to remove hormones, possible bans on phthalates and other xenoestrogen causing products / packaging in the food industry etc ",
