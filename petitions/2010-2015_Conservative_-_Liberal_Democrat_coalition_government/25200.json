Housing prices have been pushed up by demand but in the big squeeze it is the richest that are cashing in on the misfortune of the middle and lower classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s time for the government to stand up for the working class and start restricting the amount of property any one person can own i.e. 5 houses, there needs to be a restriction on the amount of profit that can be made i.e. 20% above the mortgage repayments or 0.5% of the value of the property. Say the mortgage of a 4 bedroom \u00a3200,000 house has been paid for then the rental price should only be \u00a3250 which is \u00a31000 for the whole house. Landlords should also own at least 50% of a property before it can be rented out.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese measures could free up thousands of properties and bring down the price of the housing across the board there would also be an increase in the amount of money in the banking system.\r\n",
