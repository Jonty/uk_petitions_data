With us now just passing 100 years since the beginning of WW1 I strongly believe it is about time that the boys and the men who were accused of desertion and killed when really they were only suffering from shell shock and associated illnesses are given a full pardon by this government. It has since been proven that most of these soldiers were suffering from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) which at the time had no treatment but now is a recognised condition by the British Army and who have put a lot of time and resources in to helping those who suffer. These men had fought in some of the most horrendous battles in the most awful of conditions all on the orders of Generals whose abilities to command were lacking. The right thing to do is to give them a full pardon and to give them and their families peace after all these years.",
