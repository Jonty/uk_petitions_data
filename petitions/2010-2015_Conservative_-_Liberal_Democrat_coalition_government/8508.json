Following those orders anyone choosing not to take the opportunity to leave should be subjected to a mist or aerosol of smart water / dye (technology exists already), they and their belongings would then become recognisable for some weeks to come and that would enable arrests by the Police to be made, it would also show parents if their children had been involved, as most seem to be constantly on their phones these too would show the incriminating evidence.",
