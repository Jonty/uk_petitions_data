        "additional_details": "Scotland (and most other countries) allow non-powered craft to navigate any of its waterways. However, this is deemed to be trespass in England and Wales since the riverbeds belong to riparian landowners. Furthermore, anglers defend the rivers (often aggressively) since they pay for fishing licenses. Many rivers, (Thames, Dee, Wye, Severn etc..) are easily large enough to allow access for all. Our waterways are a natural gift for all to enjoy - and the government should give access rights for all non-powered craft and swimmers to any lake or river that is deemed suitable.",
