        "additional_details": "I would like to see Military Support/Martial Law imposed in cities within the UK at times of civil unrest, riot and crisis.\r\nThe current situation in London, Leeds, Birmingham, Bristol and Liverpool is a reminder of the consiquences of the Governments plans to cut back on front line Police services.\r\nBy allowing Martial Law to be imposed on our cities it will allow normal order to be resorted long before thousands of innocent people's lives are destroyed by their homes, businesses and property being wrecked by mindless violence.\r\nIn the UK we have tens of thousands of soldiers in the Army, Navy and Air force who are all trained to deal with civil unrest as part of their peace keeping duties with NATO and the UN. We should put this valuable resource to good use.\r\nThe soldiers do not need to be armed or even autonamous, they would be placed under the command of the local police force who they are helping so there is less fear of soliders etc becoming too heavy handed or over reaching.",
