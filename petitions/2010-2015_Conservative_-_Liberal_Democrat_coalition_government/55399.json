        "additional_details": "The government has appointed a non-police officer to the role of \"Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary\" (HMCIC). Previous holders of this appointment have been senior serving police officers and have worn police uniform at appropriate public and ceremonial events.\r\n\r\nThe Police Act 1996 makes it a criminal offence to impersonate, or unlawfully  possess the uniform, of a police officer. If HMCIC is not, nor ever has been, an attested constable then the wearing of police uniform by the holder of the role should not be permitted. Neither should public money be spent on providing such to a non-entitled person.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call on the Government to ban the wearing of police uniform by HMCIC unless the holder of the role is an attested constable.",
