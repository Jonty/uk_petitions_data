        "additional_details": "I recently posted a petition calling for the legalisation of Cannabis, however it was rejected on the grounds that a petition was already posted on this topic. This is correct, there are in fact two active petitions on the subject of legalising cannabis. However, a search for 'active petitions' on capitol punishment revealed more posts than I cared to count, while the Cannabis debate's rejected petitions contained equally valid opinions. It cant be right that the death penalty debate can take well over 20 active posts, yet the cannabis debate, just two! You can read the 'rejected' posts yourselves so it cannot be argued that people did not express their opinions on the topic! They did, its just that they were rejected!I believe the Gov are using this website to justify their future policy decisions and to put across a biased image of British Public Opinion. Please all sign the 'active cannabis petitions' or your views will be ignored by the Gov!",
