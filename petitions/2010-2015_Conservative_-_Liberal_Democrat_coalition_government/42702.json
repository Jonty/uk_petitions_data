We should not be pushed back into the dark ages where we cannot go out because it is dark.\r\n\r\nIt is terrfying to walk in the dark and who knows who will start to dwell outside if no one can see. Break ins, muggings, rape. I will not risk my life to save money and neither will anyone else! I will not stop until these lights back on and neither should you. We are not expendable.",
