        "additional_details": "We ask that the goverment put more research into finding a cure for M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease has the following symptoms: vertigo, tinnitus and deafness. People who suffer from it, do so to varying degrees. Currently there is no clear understanding of how the disease will develop within each individual, hence there is no way of halting or curing it. As the disease is little understood and is not common (about 0.1% of the population suffer), medical care and support can vary depending upon where you live. As there is no obvious line of research to follow to find a cure for the disease the Menieres Society has spent a considerable part of its budget on research to help sufferers like us and their carers to manage the disease better. We would therefore ask that the Government help in this process and help all of us whose quality of life has diminished so significantly as the onus should not be entirely upon the Menieres Society",
