        "additional_details": "Create a defined policy to enforce parental responsibility in law until the child is above the age of 16. For example, many people feel the parents of the majority of under age rioters should be made accountable for the actions of their children. This should encourage better parental guidance. This could be enforced by means of guidance classes, fines or in the most serious cases a short custodial sentence.  The lack of consequences for young people is no deterrent to them, maybe punishing the reason for their behaviour (parents in the majority of cases) will change this.",
