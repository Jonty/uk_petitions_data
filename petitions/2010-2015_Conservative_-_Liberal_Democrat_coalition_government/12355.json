Make sellers have papers ready for buyers solicitors and give a maximum of 10 working days for these to be checked and enquires to be made.\r\n\r\nMake it so that at no time during the 10 working days can the seller consider further offers.  At any time during the 10 working days both parties can change their minds except in order to accept a another offer.\r\n\r\nOnce the buyer\u2019s solicitor has inspected the titles & other papers, have a contractual letter containing further qualifications drawn up. If the terms are acceptable to the seller, make it so that at this point both parties are bound by the terms of the contract constituted by the offer.",
