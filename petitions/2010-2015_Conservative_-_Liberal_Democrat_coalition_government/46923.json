        "action": "Raise the national minimum wage for 16-20 year olds",
        "additional_details": "With many youths in poverty, the national minimum wage for those at the age of 16-18 and 18-20 is inadequate. The issue of discrimination could be raised, as the national minimum wage for those 21 and over will rise to \u00a36.19, and the apprentice rate to \u00a32.65, while those at the age of 16-20 will stay the same.Ths means those aged under 21 are being discriminated against. I am certain you are aware that the national minimum wage for 16-18 year olds is \u00a33.68 an hour and \u00a34.98 an hour for those aged 18-20. These are not only well below the rates of \u00a36.19 an hour for people aged 21+ but it is also well below the national living wage which has been calculated at \u00a37.20 per hour. Rising the minimum wage of those aged 16-20, would make a huge difference to the lives of young people.The situation at the moment is unacceptable and must be changed in order to create a fairer UK. So please sign this petition.",
