        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call upon the Government to drastically overhaul the UK immigration system, applying rules similar to those used in Australia & New Zealand, and thus reduce the \u00a32 million per day costs of managing the current system. All asylum seekers should not be provided with accommodation at the expense of the UK tax payer - approval should be sought before arriving in the UK. As used in Australia, asylum seekers should either be family related to current UK citizens or offer a skill where there is a current shortage in the UK.",
