HMRC have now reduced this to just four years.\r\n\r\nHowever, HMRC can still go back up to six years, or even 20 years, if YOU have not paid enough tax.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the timeframe that a taxpayer can reclaim tax to be reinstated to six years or more as opposed to the current four years.\r\n\r\nMore details can be found at:\r\nwww.u-tax.co.uk/tax-rebates",
