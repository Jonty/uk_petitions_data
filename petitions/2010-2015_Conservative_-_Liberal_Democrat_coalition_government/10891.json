        "additional_details": "The UK government should now close down ALL tax havens in it's jurisdiction and sequester ALL foreign deposits in those tax haven banks (the figure I have comes to \u00a316 trillion) and put it in the treasury account. It can then be used for rolling back the 'cuts' and put to use in the City. If someone wants to claim their money they come to the High Court with their i.d. and prove it's their money, they earned it honestly and they paid tax at source on it. I would count the applicants one one hand.\r\nClose these tax havens now and roll back the 'cuts' and let's get Britain working again!",
