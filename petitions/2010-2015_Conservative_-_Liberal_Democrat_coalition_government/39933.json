What is the difference from someone else receiving Employment Allowance or Disability Benefits, to someone receiving Incapacity Benefit? They all come under benefits, and proving you're on Incapacity Benefits should not be a downfall or exempt from the schemes, because those on Incapacity Benefit are also on a low income.\r\n\r\nPeople who receive Incapacity Benefit should be allowed to have discounted / free treatment and discounted schemes (ie; Disabled Railcard).\r\n\r\nWe kindly ask the Chancellor and Government to make Incapacity Benefit accepted on treatment and discounted schemes.",
