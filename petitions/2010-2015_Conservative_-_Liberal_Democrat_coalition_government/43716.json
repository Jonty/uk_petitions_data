        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the appropriate regulatory body to look at how Ryanair uses their online sales website to try and confuse customers by using user un-friendly software that is manipulative, telephone helplines that are unobtainable and charge premium rates for calls that are on hold and never answered, why Ryanair does not appear to adhere to UK or EU regulations concerning passenger complaints the same as other airlines, defamation of customers by Ryanair staff when they are reffered to as stupid or thick or imply that they are not of sufficient mental capacity to complete the Ryanair online booking form correctly, not everybody is computer literate, much of the Ryanair revenue is generated by genuine mistakes that cannot be compensated by being hidden in very obscure small print, these questions should be addressed as soon as possible.
