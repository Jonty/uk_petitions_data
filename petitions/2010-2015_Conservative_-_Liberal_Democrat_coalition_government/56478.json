We should be learning how to cook for our future children or grandchildren, learning how to use a washing machine, or even how to search for jobs or write CV's, schools do not teach teenagers the basic skills they will need in life when they move out of their parents house. Right now they are being taught how to find the value of X, how will that help them put a roof over there heads. I think if they are spending all day in school, maybe they should be taught something that will actually come up in their everyday life!",
