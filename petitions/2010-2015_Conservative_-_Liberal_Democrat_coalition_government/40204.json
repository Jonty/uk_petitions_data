It is EnergyReturned/EnergyInvested ratio.\r\n\r\nmarket prices can go all over the place and are subject to policy, but EnergyReturned/EnergyInvested ratio if high can give a clue on how much better prices may be with appropriate policy.\r\n\r\nexample\r\nWindfarms are expensive yet have a EROEI ratio of between 20-40:1 which compares to Nuclear of only about 5:1 This suggests with appropriate production capacity windpower can be very cheap.",
