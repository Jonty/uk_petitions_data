        "additional_details": "I feel that there is a cultural belief within this country that the Benefit\u2019s paid by DWP are provided by solely by the Government at the Government expense. I propose that the term \u201cBenefit\u201d be changed for the term \u201cCharity\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe funds used in the Benefit system are provided by an overtaxed population. These funds would normally have been given as charity to those who are less fortunate. This ideal is supported by two of the major religious groups in the United Kingdom the Christians and Muslims. I am sure this is reflected in other religions as well. I believe the Government should continue collecting and distributing these Charity contributions as it does presently.\r\n\r\nThis would certainly be the end of the Benefit Culture.\r\n",
