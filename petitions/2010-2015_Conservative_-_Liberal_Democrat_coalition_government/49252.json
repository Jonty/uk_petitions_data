        "additional_details": "Nazareth House is a children's villa in crosby, Liverpool. It provides vital respite for families with disabled children. The trustees who run the villa are wanting to close this service in september this year because of lack of funding and also a need for building refurbishment due to it being a grade 2 listed building. Many of the families who use this service do not recieve help or support for anywhere else. The children see this as a second home and all have a great relationship with staff, this is a great relief for us all and we feel safe leaving our children in their care. Due to our childrens complex needs everybody needs to be highly trained to care for them. If it is not possible to keep Nazareth House open we would like the children and staff to be able to stay together, either through funding for Nazareth House or for a new building. To lose this service would be heartbreaking for all the service uses, parents and siblings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
