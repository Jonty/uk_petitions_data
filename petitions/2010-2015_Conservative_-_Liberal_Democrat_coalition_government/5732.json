        "action": "Close public schools and ban private education in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The fastest way to improve education, to close the gap between rich and poor and increase equality of opportunity in this country would be to close the public schools. Choice is ony fair if everyone has the same choice. If all the pushy parents who currently send their kids to public school were obliged to send their kids to the local state school the schools in this country would improve rapidly due to parent power. Taxes could also be raised to improve education for all because these parents would be saving money on school fees. This petition requests parliament to debate the closure of the public schools and a ban on private non-state funded education.",
