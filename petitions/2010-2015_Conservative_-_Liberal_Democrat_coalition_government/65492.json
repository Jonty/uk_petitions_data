This is a call to try to protect ALL serving dogs whether they be police or military or any other types of active service, Please help me change the rules and give our four legged loyal friends the protection they need and deserve when on active service.\r\n\r\nFace shields and body protection for ALL.\r\n\r\nPlease help me make a difference.",
