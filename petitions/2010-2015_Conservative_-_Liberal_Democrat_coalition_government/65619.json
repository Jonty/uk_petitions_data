        "additional_details": "This petition is to try and get the government to realise that under 18's deserve to have a say in laws that seem to continuously affect them. At the age of 16 we can get married, join the army and die for our country, even choose not to have life-saving treatment... so why can't we have a say in the people who decide how much we have to pay for our education? What activites teenagers deserve to have access to? What jobs we can have? and even where we can live and what we can do with our lives.... why shouldn't we get a choice, just because we're young?",
