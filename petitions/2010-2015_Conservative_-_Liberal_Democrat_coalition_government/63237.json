        "additional_details": "This petition calls for a raising of the severity of the offence of death by careless driving to that of murder when the driver is under the influence of alcohol, drugs or both.\r\n\r\nThe current charge carries a maximum sentence of 14 years for death of a person. The charge of murder would enable a life sentence to be given.\r\n\r\nThe death of a person in such an accident is as traumatic for the family as that of any murder victim so should be treated the same.",
