        "additional_details": "For centuries all constituent parts of what is today the United Kingdom had this Act in place and it worked extremely well. It meant that wherever traitors or the mst serious criminals had commited an act against the State and society that they could be attainted of all their honours and forfeited of their property to the State. The State could then award the property to someone else, or auction everything off. If this Act was good enough for centuries of aristocrats and Landed Gentry to suffer, it is certainly good enough for today's folk. Restore this Act.",
