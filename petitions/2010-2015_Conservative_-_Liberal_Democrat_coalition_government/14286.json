This petition requests a debate on the recognition of the right of citizens to bear such arms as they see fit for personal, social, and national defence. This would allow citizens to bear such firearms as they see fit, and clarify the rights of the police to be armed. For the police are the public, and the public are the police. There is no reason for the police to be allowed any weapon for their personal safety that the rest of the public are denied.",
