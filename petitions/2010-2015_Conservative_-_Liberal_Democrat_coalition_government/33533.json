        "additional_details": "Whilst it is almost impossible to make large purchases using cash, without accounting where it has come from, in almost all walks of life, millions of pounds in cash are being taken in fees by public schools right across the UK.  Anecdotal research suggests that the majority of fee-paying schools will accept cash for school fees with 'no questions asked'.\r\n\r\nIt would be a straightforward change to force schools only to accept payment from a bank account and stop this money laundering opportunity directly.\r\n\r\nIf the government are serious about closing tax loopholes and maximising tax income - this should be discussed immediately.",
