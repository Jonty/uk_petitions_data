        "additional_details": "So getting to the point about the rise of UKIP this year, they are not making Britain look very good.These peole claim that muslims are \"terrorists\" and Britain should not have them in the country. These typical ideas are embaressing our country and we want them to be banned straight away.Our aim now is to ban all these racist organisations. All Muslims are not terrorists and these groups are against that point. Although, Some Muslims may cause violence sometimes such as Lee rigby's death they are not all the same. They are also not taking jobs of englishmen, bombing the country or even trying to get shariah law running in Britain. We want England to be a multi cultural country and these groups are not making that happen. UKIP are making a big fuss about immigrants because it is clear that they want Muslims out of this country. What UKIP don't realise is most of the Muslims here are born in Britain. We demand for us to stay in the EU too. BAN THESE GROUPS!",
