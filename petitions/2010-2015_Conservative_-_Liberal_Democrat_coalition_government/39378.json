        "additional_details": "We are concerned that T1 PSW Permit holders are unable to switch their visa category into other Point Based Systems as the requirements for these Point Based are far beyond the reach of these young graduates.\r\nIn all honesty, we respect government\u2019s right to reduce immigration from outside of EU, but we must point out that a good government also have responsibilities to protect the welfare of PSW Permit holders who had been granted permission prior to the changes in immigration rule of April 2011 as these people had already been accepted and settled into the United Kingdom. Immigration restrictions and changed must not be at the expense and rights to leave of migrants thereby causing them unwarranted pains and suffering.\r\nIt is paramount that you pursue and debate these changes in the Parliament and look into the situation of PSW permit holders already resident in the United Kingdom. We can be contacted through email at info@pswforum.org, twit us @pswforum\r\nThank you\r\nPSW Forum",
