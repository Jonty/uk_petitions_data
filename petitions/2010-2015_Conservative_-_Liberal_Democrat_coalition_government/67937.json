It is said that senior officers were never told about the formation of the SDS Unit in Scotland Yard.  It is utterly inconceivable that such criminal spying activity was undertaken against bereaved relatives of people unlawfully killed by police officers, without political approval at the highest level - probably the Prime Ministers Office - so if that is the case then those politicians need to be arrested, charged with misuse of public funds, abuse of public office and perversion of the course of justice and put on trial.",
