        "additional_details": "in the last 5 years cannabis has gone up in price by over 100%, this is largely due to supply and demand and it will continue to go up in price due to this.\r\n\r\nwith less work about and the price of everything going up it seams to me that people will be finding it vey hard to afford cannabis (I am).\r\n\r\nbecause cannabis is part of a underworld there are a lot of bad people involved and they do not care how much people pay or weather they can really afford it.\r\n\r\nI believe that it should be legalised and taxed, this should help balance supply and demand and hopefully bring the price back to a sensible sum, or at least people would be able get a standard quality of cannabis if they cant grow there own.\r\n\r\nat the moment i would guess a lot of the money spent on cannabis is lost from the banking system or spent abroad, if it was sold legally and taxed it could help our country greatly and could also bring tourists to spend money in our country, like in holland (Amsterdam).\r\n",
