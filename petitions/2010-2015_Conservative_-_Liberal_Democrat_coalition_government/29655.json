        "additional_details": "This campaign is to abolish the child protection register in Wales, as England has done.  Social Services are using this register to practically abuse innocent families and will lie and decieve to use this medium.  The manner in which this is carried out is abhorrent and causes stress and untold damage to the average family, including those with children with disabilities.  The register either needs to be abolished or a severe reform is in order to stop social services from distroying innocent peoples lives.",
