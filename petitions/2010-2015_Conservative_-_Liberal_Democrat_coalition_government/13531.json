        "additional_details": "Too many children are leaving school and/or college, without a good standard of education. Every concerned parent and grandparent knows this. I am in my middle sixties, left school at 16 with no qualifications and have a much better education than my grandchildren, aged from 6 to 17. They marvel at my vocabulary and my knowledge of Maths. Why should this be, when they apparently have so much more in terms of facilities and class sizes? Time to go back to basics; throw out the calculators and the \"Trendy\" methods, ensure that the greatest number of Primary School pupils can read, write and carry out basic arithmetic. Successive governments of all political parties, have failed our children. This will affect their future and the future of our country. The time to act is NOW, before we lose another generation to riot and criminality. Young Britons need to find a way to have a stake in the future of Britain.",
