        "additional_details": "Reverse the amendments to the term time family holiday rules under The Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006 which came into force on 1 September 2013.\r\n\r\nAll children who have a good attendance record of 95% or above, should be allowed an annual holiday of up to 10 days per school year.\r\n\r\nWe would like to suggest that holiday leave is granted for up to 10 days, on the condition that there will NOT be a fine if the child's attendance is still above 95% at the end of the school year.\r\nIf the child's attendance falls below 94.9% then a fine WILL be issued (where holiday leave had been taken)\r\n\r\nWe believe that this could be a solution to keeping attendance in schools high & parents being able to take an affordable holiday.\r\n\r\nThe Government should amend these current amendments immediately.",
