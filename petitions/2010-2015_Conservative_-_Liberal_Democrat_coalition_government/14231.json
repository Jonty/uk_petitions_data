These sick people can be stopped by hitting the problem at the source, by removing and banning all offending websites.\r\n\r\nMany people stumble upon them, to find advice on how to do it, and people who are more than happy to tell someone they've never met to kill themselves, rather than seek help from people who really care about them and want to help them.",
