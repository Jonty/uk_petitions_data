        "additional_details": "I am petitioning to claim back the pension lost for all people who joined the military under the age if 18.  We were deemed old enough to serve our Queen and Countrt but we weren't entitled to pensionable service until we reached 18 years old so effectively all the employment previous to this was lost time.  This is unfair and unjust and service for 16 year olds wouldn't be allowed now but effectively we were historically discriminated against for being under 18.  As a military veteran I implore the government to correct this injustice.",
