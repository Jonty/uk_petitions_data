However, in spite of the world moving towards democracy; something is left unconsidered- the rights of young\u2019s. It is important that 21st century\u2019s youngster\u2019s should be given an opportunity to shape their own future by letting them \u2018\u2019have a say\u2019\u2019 on decision making of the country.\r\n\r\nAt 16 you can:\r\n*join the armed forces\r\n*get married\r\n*pay income tax and national insurance- Can taxation without representation be fair?\r\n*and more\r\n\r\nGermany, which is among the top 10 democratic countries in the world, has given their 16 year olds this right: so why not the UK?\r\n\r\n\u2018\u2019 Yes I am a big supporter of votes at 16. The state can ask a 16 year old to fight and die for this country, why not vote too?\u2019\u2019-Nick Clegg\r\n\r\n",
