Where the industry is advised that content they host contravenes legislation, they will readily remove it.  In addition, ISPs have contracts with their customers called good practice Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs), which they have recently strengthened, about what may be hosted on their servers.\r\n\r\nComplaints about a particular website\u2019s content should first be directed to the site\u2019s manager.  Most AUPs already contain a general clause which allows ISPs to remove sites or content which contain offensive or objectionable material, even if it is not illegal.  Arrangements similar to AUPs apply to many websites, including social networking sites.  Those people, who find user content offensive or suspect, should therefore report their concerns to the appropriate social network site."
