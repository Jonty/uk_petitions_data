        "additional_details": "Please sign if you agree the UK government should fund all party gay delegation to meet Robert Mugabe to discuss his anti gay stance. I nominate Gay MP Conor Burns to head the delegation supported by Gay Justice minister Chris Grayling, and they select all party Gay MPs to join the delegation. Conor Burns would be ideal as he had an audience with the anti gay Pope Benedict XVI .  Please support this petition and let us get an all party parliamentary gay mp delegation over to Mugabe as soon as possible to help in the fight for gay rights over there.",
