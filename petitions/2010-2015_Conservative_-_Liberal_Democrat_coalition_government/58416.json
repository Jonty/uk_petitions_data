        "additional_details": "We desire for the Houses of Parliament to fairly debate the illegality of cannabis. Too many good people are ending up with criminal records over the use of a plant, that grows naturally.\r\n\r\nDecriminalization would take the money out of drug gangs that use minors to sell the cannabis for them. Also bringing in legislation would make it harder for young teenagers to get hold of cannabis.\r\n\r\nIt could generate revenue for the country. ",
