        "action": "Stop compulsory joined up writing in junior schools.",
        "additional_details": "I feel that the current stance on forcing children in junior schools to write using joined up letters is not  needed. Most children are not ready to use this style of writing and it causes complete distress when doing written work. It is only used as far as I can tell to get the child to write more and faster to the detriment of neatness. This policy is only used in the last 2 years of junior school and not carried on to senior school. Let the child concentrate on style and neatness not amount of words written down.  I want the goverment to remove this policy.",
