Research has shown that both employers and young people feel that some young people lack the necessary skills required to gain and sustain successful employment. Reducing the Skills Gap has been established with the aim to support equipping young people with the employability skills to meet the needs of employers and we petition for the government to encourage:\r\n\r\nEmployers to work closer with young people, schools and training providers to support young people into employment.\r\n\r\nSchools, colleges and training providers to incorporate employability skills into their teaching to help young people gain employment .\r\n\r\nYoung people to commit to learning new skills which will increase their employment chances.\r\n\r\nThis petition has been initiated by the Regional Youth Work Unit - North East.",
