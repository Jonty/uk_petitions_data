        "additional_details": "Solar Securities have indicated their intention to apply for planning permission to install 112,060 solar panels across 157 acres of arable farmland.  If the installation goes ahead, it would be the largest of its kind in the UK.  All petitioners support renewable energy initiatives that are on brownfield areas. We vehemently oppose this plan.  We want government support to have this plan rejected or moved to a brownfield area.",
