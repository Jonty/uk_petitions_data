Around \u00a327 billion had been awarded to over 370,000 for good causes so far. Around 28% of their takings they received from punters, unclaimed prizes & investment incomes received by the National Lottery are presently used to support good causes. The Department of Culture, Media and Sport is responsible for the National Lottery licensing & issues directions on where to allocate the funds.  Lottery punters should be able to indicate to the National Lottery operator areas the proportion of funds received to donate to good causes to, be it (say) heath, performing arts, heritage, sports, research in science & engineering. However, the National Lottery may be able to support other worthy clauses by giving their punters an annual statement/explanation of how & why the funds raised are used to support the various areas of good causes.",
