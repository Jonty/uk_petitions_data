        "additional_details": "Please remove the requirement to have a tax disc displayed on a vehicle (a statement that tax has been paid) and replace it with a \"MOT\" disc (a statement that the car has been tested recently to be safe on the road) together with an insurance disc. This combined new disc, demonstrating that the car is both insured and safe would cut down on uninsured drivers and people driving cars without MOTs. The cost lost from abolishing the Tax disc would then be transferred to the cost of getting an MOT or even better be added as a few pence to petrol so that it became a difficult to avoid tax on actual usage.",
