        "additional_details": "British seamen are not covered any legislation which protects their health and safety whilst at work.\r\n Shipping companies can force them to work up to 98 hours a week. This not only affects the health and safety of those working on the ships, it also affects those who are travelling on them.\r\nTiredness causes accidents and coach and lorry drivers are not permitted to work this amount of hours for this reason, so why are seamen expected to do so? British Seamen are too scared to complain because shipping comanies will just get rid of them and bring in cheap foreign crews who are prepared to put in the hours instead\r\nThe Government should take action and bring the rights of seamen into line with other industries within the transport sector.",
