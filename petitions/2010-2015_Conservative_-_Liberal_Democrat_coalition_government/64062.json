In the UK 1.5 million 16 and 17 year-olds aren't being provided with the opportunity to influence government policies and improve their situations.\r\n\r\nSome government policies affect 16/17 year-olds negatively and they don't have a chance to change these policies. This is why they should be given the vote.",
