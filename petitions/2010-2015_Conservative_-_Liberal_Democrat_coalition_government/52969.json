        "additional_details": "Tory MP Claire Perry argues that having internet pornography filters will make a difference in curbing child abuse. She says that \"the killers of schoolgirls April Jones and Tia Sharp had accessed legal pornography\" [Source: BBC].\r\n\r\nAs cars are often used by paedophiles to follow and abduct their victims, we call for the government to ban people from driving any kind of engine-powered vehicle. We feel this will help protect children as much as, if not more so than, having an opt-out pornography filter.",
