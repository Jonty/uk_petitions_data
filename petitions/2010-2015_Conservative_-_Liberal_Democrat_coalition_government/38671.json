        "additional_details": "This Movie needs to STOP, whatever has been recorded in this particular Movie it is totally wrong and it is against our Prophet Mohammed (saw).  This movie if released is going to cause a lot of riots, due to the way this movie is performed it is an utter shame and disgust the way our Prophet is being insulted in this movie for example, There are also several insulting lines about the prophet and Islam itself. An elderly woman says: \"In all my young life, I have not seen such a murderous thug as Mohammed!\" We are Muslims and have been brought up in a Islamic culture all this movie is NOT the way our religion is, STOP this film from being released. Thank you",
