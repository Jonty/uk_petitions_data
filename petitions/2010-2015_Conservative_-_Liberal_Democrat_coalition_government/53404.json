        "additional_details": "I hereby, the undersigned, petition for a Special send-off or memorial service for tragic Daniel Pelka, who suffered incomprehensible cruelty at the hands of his mother and stepfather, whilst being let down repeatedly by his local authorities such as social services.\r\n\r\nThe perpetrators of this horrific abuse are now behind bars, but poor Daniel still hasn't yet had a funeral. It is owed to Daniel, particularly by all those who let him down, to provide him with a fitting tribute to him for his bravery during his suffering, and to finally lay him to rest in peace. This is better carried out at the expense of those responsible for the failures that led to this tragedy.",
