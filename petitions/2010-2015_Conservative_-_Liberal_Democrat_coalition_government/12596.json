        "additional_details": "Why should we pay for the cost of repairing the damage the rioters caused? Why should we pay \u00a3100 per day for each of them to sit in prison?  They are all able-bodied people - they are quite capable of working to pay these costs themselves.\r\n\r\nPut the rioters on strict and tough work programs that are judged by results, not hours worked. That way they can't sit around skiving, they have to WORK HARD if they want to get off the program.\r\n\r\nNot only will this save us money, it is also much better for the rioters themselves. Rather than sitting about in prison getting even more bitter, hanging out with murderers and other bad influences, they will be doing something that is actually rewarding. It will give people who have never worked skills and experience.\r\n\r\nSign this petition for the benefit of society, the benefit of the rioters and the benefit of your own pocket.",
