We wish this Parliament to serve and represent the people of England, with Westminster continuing as the seat of UK central government.\r\n\r\nWe respect and recognise the outcome of the 2014 Scottish referendum, and celebrate that the United Kingdom will continue as a family of four nations united under one British constitution.\r\n\r\nHowever, we believe it is unfair that Scottish MPs are allowed to vote on English-only matters, but English MPs cannot vote on Scottish matters.\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge the Prime Minister\u2019s appointment of Lord Smith of Kelvin to supervise this course of handing more tax, welfare, and spending powers to Scotland; with proposals set to be introduced to the House of Commons in January.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the Government to establish a similar process and timeframe regarding the introduction of an English Parliament, with the same powers promised to the Scottish government.\r\n",
