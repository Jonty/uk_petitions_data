Anyone can offer tuition without any teaching qualifications, any CRB checks and without being obliged to make that known to their clients.\r\nWe trust that the people who are providing a service are qualified in the field they are offering. Gas fitters are regulated why shouldn't tuition providers.\r\nIt is an anomaly that as a fully qualified and experienced PE teacher I would not be able to coach swimming at my local pool, but anyone can tutor in academic subjects.\r\nIt should be mandatory that tutors disclose in their advertising that they are either qualified teachers or that they hold no teaching qualifications.",
