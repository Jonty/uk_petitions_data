        "additional_details": "There seems as though there's a McDonald's every other street in Swansea and the Liberty is surrounded by pubs, fish & chip shops restaurants and fast food outlets as well as the in stadium food/drink outlets. I believe that at the time the Swans were in the lower divisions Mac's were not interested otherwise they would have been on that site like a rash, now there are 20,000 potential customers a week they want a slice of the action.\r\n75 jobs in Mac's is 70 exploited youngsters some who will work until 2pm in the morning when they are told they will finish at 11pm and get paid a pittance.\r\nThe council and businesses are saying they are getting the benefit from Premier league status, the business sense here is to increase the gate by 7-10,000 increase the away supporter numbers so that more stay for 1 or 2 nights, the revenue from this will far outweigh a McDonalds for \u00a31.99,\r\nPLEASE STOP PLANNING BEING ALLOWED NO ONE NEEDS OR WANTS IT",
