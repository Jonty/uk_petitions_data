Indeed the Scots and Welsh are demanding and receiving more concessions by the day. The English people feel that no-one is speaking up for them.\r\nIf the UK is going to move forward together a central English Parliament must be established, free of British rule, on the subjects that are currently devolved to the other constituent parts of the UK.\r\nThe English are a proud nation and demand that our voice is heard. We can no longer be the last colony of the fading British Empire.\r\nOur time has come and we demand our freedom.",
