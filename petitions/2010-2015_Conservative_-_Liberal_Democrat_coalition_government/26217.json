A small group of armed police force tend form a clique & support each other. Accidents can happen when a group of armed police are trained in effect to shoot first, ask questions later. There are incidences whereby a police officer shot a suspect dead a suspect carrying a table leg without warning because they thought he was carrying a shotgun, shot dead Menezes in a crowed tube as they thought he was a suicide bomber, an OAP, a barrister, a driver whilst attempting to stop him on a routine check. What about the police shooting dead a suspect in Ipswich about over 2 years ago? Where are the outcomes of the investigations by Police Complaints Authority? Suspects should not be shot dead without warning. Challenging armed suspects to surrender should be done in a more secluded place, away from crowded places.",
