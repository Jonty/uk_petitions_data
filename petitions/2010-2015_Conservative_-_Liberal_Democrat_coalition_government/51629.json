Teaching assistants play an important role in supporting children with special educational needs and dealing with children with behavioural issues.  Teachers and teaching assistants make up a team to ensure that all children's needs are met and reach their full potential, to take away teaching assistants would compromise results and standards leading to increased stress levels within the teaching profession.
