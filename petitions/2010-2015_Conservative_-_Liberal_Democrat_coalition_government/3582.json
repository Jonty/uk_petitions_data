Fees should be returned to their previous, more sustainable and inclusive level of \u00a33000. The Coalition Government's recent tripling of the maximum charge will undoubtedly favour the more wealthy in society and will saddle graduates with crippling levels of personal debt that will negatively impact their life choices for decades.",
