        "additional_details": "due to the farcical inconsistent loss making joke of a  ferry service we demand a Bridge linking Portaferry and strangford on the ards peninsula.Bringing much needed prosperity to both areas, a bridge would also significantly cut journey times to hospitals and schools cutting a 50mile journey to 3/4 of a mile bridge. A toll bridge would also start paying for itself imediately upon opening. if it was anywhere else in the uk it would have been done years ago why are we second class citizens?",
