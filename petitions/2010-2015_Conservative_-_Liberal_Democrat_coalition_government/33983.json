        "additional_details": "The government is planning to only commission psychological reports in the family courts in exceptional circumstances. This will result in more children being placed for adoption as families that might have been helped will no longer receive properly assessed support.\r\n\r\nThese plans disenfranchise parents with conditions such as personality disorders from resolving their difficulties and becoming good enough parents.\r\n\r\nThis policy in the name of saving money sets family proceedings back by 40 years.\r\n\r\nExpress your concern for the proposed changes to the Family Courts by signing this petition.",
