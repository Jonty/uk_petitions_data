        "additional_details": "NHS/BPAS/Marie Stopes- virtually all sectors refer to unborn children using Latin 'fetus'. I was shocked to discover a healthcare worker claim 'fetus' was a species & not human/baby 'yet'.\r\n\r\nI question the legality of using Latin terms in UK. They're clearly only used where there's scope for economic profit obtained from manipulating a misleading response. To keep Mum in work/education & off benefit/more expensive entitlements. By promoting misconception regarding a child's existence & manipulating individuals into acting with selective discrimination- such as selective dehumanization & abortion of children. The NHS is responsible for ensuring patients aren't misled & info is presented in a language they can understand. Most of us don't understand Latin- this is clearly evident!\r\n\r\nI demand Latin terms such as Fetus must be replaced with plain English 'baby'. Either write entire thing in Latin or English- not both!",
