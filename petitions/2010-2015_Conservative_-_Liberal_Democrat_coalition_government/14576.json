It is a secret and sometimes unjust process and the system must change. The most common and easiest way to take children are based on 'EMOTIONAL ABUSE' and 'MUNCHAUSEN SYNDROME BY PROXY (\u201cMSBP\u201d) which is being overly abused in family courts to take children away from their parents whilst so many cases prove that the parents are in-fact innocent. The system needs to change and abolish these loopholes, to stop destroying innocent family lives, and have a fairer family justice system in place.",
