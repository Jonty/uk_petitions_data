        "additional_details": "Much of the population of the uk are vehemently opposed to culling of badgers since they are our largest and most loved wild mammal.\r\nFarmers argue that badgers cause TB amongst cattle. Whilst there are differing viewpoints as to the science I believe that most beef eaters would rather pay a marginal tax of 2% on beef which would prevent the culling of badgers. (This figure based upon 2.1 million cattle slaughtered annually in UK for meat and 30,000 due to TB - i.e less than 1.5% of cattle - so a 2% increase would cover these losses)\r\nIf we therefore compensate farmers for the loss of cattle caused by TB by imposing a very small \"Environment Tax\" on beef then everyone is happy!\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned would be willing to pay a small duty on the price of beef to compensate farmers for cattle lost due to TB, in order to prevent the culling of badgers.",
