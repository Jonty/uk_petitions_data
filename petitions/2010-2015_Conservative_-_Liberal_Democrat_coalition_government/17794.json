        "additional_details": "Under the current safeguarding children act parent helpers in schools and nurseries must only have the normal checks carried such as a CRB if they are a regular helper.  Adhoc helpers can be excused from this process as they are \"supervised\".  Parent helpers stretch to step parents grandparents in fact anyone that wants to volunteer.  Introducing a child to a stranger in a trusted environment like school means that to the child that person is no longer a stranger and therefore they become a trusted adult to the child in and out of school.  Whilst in school they are supervised outside of school they may not be.  I would like to call that we enforce the official child protection checks on ALL helpers adhoc or regular, supervised or unsupervised and commence this immediately.",
