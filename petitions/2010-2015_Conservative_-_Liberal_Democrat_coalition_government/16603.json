        "additional_details": "ITV coverage of major sporting events is dire at the best of times but their coverage of this and previous Rugby World Cups is risible.\r\nIt is more commercials than punditry. 6 commercial breaks in an hour! The commentators are enough to send you to sleep. The touch screen team guide is the worst contribution to sports broadcasting since Channel 4 took over athletics - especially when you put two large forwards in front of it.\r\nWe, the undersigned, called upon the Secretary of State to call ITV executives to explain themselves and then ensure that ITV are prevented from tendering in future as they are incapable.
