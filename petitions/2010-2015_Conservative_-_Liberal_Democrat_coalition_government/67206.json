        "additional_details": "IHT is grave robbery. Many ordinary people are deprived of the ability to bequeath to their familes the assets accumulated by hard work and prudence.\r\nGovernments have failed to index the already low threshold resulting in relatively modest estates falling victim to this iniquitous tax.\r\nIHT is triple taxation on, 1.earnings, 2.savings, and 3. bequests to family.\r\nThe value of your house alone probably makes your estate liable to IHT, so if you want your family and not profligate government to benefit from your estate, without getting involved in complicated schemes which may be overturned at the whim of government you should definitely sign this petition.",
