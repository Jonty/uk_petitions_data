        "additional_details": "Education is a right, not a privilege. Raising it to \u00a39000 will deter some deserving teenagers from lower income and middle income families. There is still all the other expense to pay for as well eg board, lodging, travel, clothes , books, equipment. MPs who legislated this increase did not pay for their education and probably got university grants free. Non graduates need graduates and vice versa. A hospital porter's child when ill needs to see a doctor and a pharmacist. They are taught by teachers (graduates). Everyone needs trained non graduates to build cars and build\r\nhouses. This government divides and rules.",
