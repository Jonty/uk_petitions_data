        "additional_details": "A lot of people have to travel to gillingham for a few hours of ice skating and we ideally need one in Maidstone town or surrounding Maidstone area so that the local community can save money but either walking or taking the bus to go ice skating, it will save money and save the environment from gases from vehicles. I think this idea of putting an ice rink in the Maidstone town or surrounding area would be a great idea and will boost jobs and bring the community closer.  ",
