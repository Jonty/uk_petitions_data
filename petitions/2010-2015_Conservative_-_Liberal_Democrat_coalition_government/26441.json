These are the most important functions of government that will affect UK forever. UK should not \u2018shoot herself in the foot\u2019. Rights/contracts given away to another states (like EU), if not renewed/negotiated from time to time by a sovereign state may be taken for granted to be permanent by stealthy \u2018prescription\u2019 (a Land Law concept). Grants of rights under EU treaties give the impression that they are there for perpetuity. Under Land Law, the right of private way (easements) over another's land may arise from prescription by twenty years of continuous use of a land by implied easement. What rights is given away by a sovereign state should be able to be returned back to the state, unless it is by military conquest as in 1066 by William the Conquer.",
