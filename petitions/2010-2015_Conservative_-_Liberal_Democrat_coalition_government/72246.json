Six months is not enough for what he did to Zak Rowland. He targeted a vulnerable person and examples need to be made to prevent what is fast becoming the 'norm' for vulnerable people in care homes. The justice system is far to relax when it is comes to protecting the innocent and the guilty must be punished as a deterrent to these situations.",
