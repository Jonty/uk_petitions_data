        "additional_details": "We think the goverment should rethink and cancel its proposal to halve the FIT tariff for domestic solar PV systems four months early, with only 6 weeks notice. The proposed action will place thousands of jobs at risk and will have serious implications for SME who have based their company business plans, staff training schemes, installation programme and stock orders on the previously proposed FIT tarrif review date of April 2012.
