        "additional_details": "As a current student on the SCPHN programme at Southampton University, I am shocked to see that baby food is still labelled as something to be started from four months. The Healthy Child Programme, that as Health Visitors, we deliver, clearly states that weaning should start around six months. Having labelling that says otherwise is confusing for parents. There is sufficient evidence that states that baby\u2019s digestive systems are too immature for food earlier than six months. Please can this be addressed so parents do not get conflicting information.      ",
