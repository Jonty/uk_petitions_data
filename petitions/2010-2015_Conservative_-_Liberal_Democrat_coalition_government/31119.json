        "additional_details": "I want the government to scrap all road tax and replace the lost revenue with a small increase on each litre of fuel. The advantages are as follows.\r\n1. No one will be able to avoid the tax (we all need fuel)\r\n2. The more fuel you use , the more you will pay which is fairer to all road users..\r\n3. It will address the problem of unfairness for those people who only do a little mileage but pay the same Road Fund Licence as people who do many times more miles.\r\n4. No need for tax discs on cars, this could be replaced by displaying a MOT certificate.\r\n5. Enormous savings could be made in administration at DVLC Swansea.\r\n6. Foreign drivers on our roads would make a contribution for the upkeep and repairs as would all drivers, in proportion to their usage.\r\n7. This would be a 'greener approach' to pollution tax.",
