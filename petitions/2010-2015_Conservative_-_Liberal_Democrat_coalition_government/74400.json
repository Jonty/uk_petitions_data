        "additional_details": "New guidelines given to the police when handling rape investigations require the accused to prove consent. This new requirement undermines the very idea of \" innocent till proven guilty\" and I believe will result in an increase in false rape allegations as proving innocence in the face of these guidelines becomes much more difficult.\r\n\r\nPrecisely how does one prove consent? A written affirmation is useless as consent can be withdrawn at any time. Do the police expect people to begin to film their sexual encounters in the off chance that morning after regret leads to a false allegation?  I do not have a suggestion on how the legal system can be fixed to further help legitimate victims of rape when confronting their rapists, but this very idea of presumed guilt undermines the premise of our legal system and is a resounding step in the wrong direction. A step I believe should be re-examined. ",
