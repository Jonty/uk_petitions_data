My Lawyer, Karen Thompson of Lester Aldridge LLP, 3PB Barristers & the \u2018Expert Witnesses\u2019 used by them, conspired to cover up my Syrinx, broken neck, back, coccyx & Deviated Septum with Dural Tears.  My spine was MRI'd & the results witheld from me. Married to a Dr at the hospital, she used the same Dr\u2019s who were negligent as Expert Witnesses. I wasn't allocated a \u2018Legal Friend\u2019 despite having a Moderately Severe TBI and my OT describing my problems as \u2018Profound\u2019.  In \u2018covering up\u2019 Negligence in my hospital treatment, they violated my 'Human Rights' and deprived me of a \u2018Proper\u2019 settlement in my Injury Claim.  The 'Negligence' continues, leaving me without \u2018Proper\u2019 medical care and a \u2018Burden\u2019 on the state.   I can't even afford the wheelchair I need.  Nor complain to the Law Society or SRA as she works for and advises them. ",
