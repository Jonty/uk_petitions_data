        "additional_details": "We should leave the European Union and trade with our Commonwealth nations. Our sovereignty should never be in question and the powers of parliament should never be undermined by foreign policy. As an Island sovereign nation we should welcome trade and commerce from Europe but we should never be under the control of it. While other countries within Europe enjoy open borders and unlimited movement of legal goods, we in the UK are still regulated by allowances coming back from Europe. It appears the British people have continuously been given the bad deal. Though the belief in a European Union is utopian in principle, it would be unviable due to social and cultural differences. In reality the future of a United Europe is that of growing tension between the states. We are an Island people and we should remain self governing, we are proud and have a long powerful history and though our power has diminished we are still British. ",
