I propose banning all alcohol paid by the taxpayer at events for MPs and Lords and only offer basic value juice from concentrate. The MPs and Lords are more than welcome to contribute to these events out of their own pocket in order to have expensive alcoholic drinks.\r\n\r\nImplementing this proposal will help defuse tensions we have in our society, allow the public to regain a trust in politics, as well as save money.",
