Many children do not want to worship at all or do not want to worship the religion favoured by the school.\r\n\r\nLet our schools educate our children about religion and culture but not force a particular religion onto them.\r\n\r\nThe current \"opt-out\" does not work as children are stigmatised when they or their parents choose to remove them from collective worship.\r\n\r\nSo remove collective worship from all schools and educate children so that they may make their own informed choices about religion (or lack of it) as they become adults.",
