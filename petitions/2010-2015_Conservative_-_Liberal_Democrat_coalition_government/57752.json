        "action": "Equal pay for new and employed prison staff",
        "additional_details": "Prison staff in the public & private sector are being recruited on substandard renumeration for the dangerous, difficult and life consuming work they undertake on behalf of the public.  The pay has been reduced to attract people who are desperate for work and does not give any consideration for the danger they face, the impact on life expectancy and the intrusion into their lifestyles and family life.  This causes divisions that break what should be an harmonious working environment.  By paying all staff equally and to a level that is fair for the work undertaken, this would ensure a more united workforce which in turn would benefit rehabilitation & increase safety alike.  The old public sector pay scale from pre 2009 should be adopted for all staff I.e. Prison officers earning 28,930 at the highest pay point on completion of the set number of years experience and any subsequent pay amendments should be in addition to these pay scales.  To be adopted immediately.",
