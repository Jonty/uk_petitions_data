It is a seriously sadistic crime truly on a par with murder.\r\n\r\nLife sentences protect the public from dangerous offenders. Rapists enjoy hurting people and often go on to reoffend, which isn't always true for murder.\r\n\r\nPlease lock up rapists for life so they can never harm others again.",
