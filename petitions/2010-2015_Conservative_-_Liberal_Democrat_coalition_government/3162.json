        "additional_details": "In so many secondary schools & college's in England there has been an upraising of racist and discriminatory behaviour which includes Islamophobia, Homophobia and other hateful verbal/physical attacks on minorities. What I think the education system needs is a re-education program for pupils aged 13-18, in fact years 4-6 in primary schools should under go, if needed, a re-education. Just a simple but informative short course say 7-8 weeks, twice a week of information given about why they are there, and why discriminating against someone for who they are is wrong, no matter what religion they are or social background they have to learn that they were born that way, and they can not change who they are.
