There should be discounts for people such as pensioners and for selected dogs, including guide dogs and neutered dogs, while animals would be micro-chipped, with details entered on a national database.\r\nAs an example, the obligations imposed on dog owners by this Act require every owner of a dog \u2013\r\n(a) to ensure that the dog is registered and micro-chipped in accordance with this Act,\r\n(b) to ensure that the dog receives veterinary treatment, proper care and attention and is supplied with proper and sufficient food, water and shelter,\r\n(c) to ensure that the dog receives adequate exercise,\r\n(d) to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the dog is kept under control and does not cause a nuisance to any other person, property or wildlife.",
