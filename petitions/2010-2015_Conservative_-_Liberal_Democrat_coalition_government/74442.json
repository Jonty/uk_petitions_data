        "additional_details": "Moghuls is a bar and restaurant in Episkopi Garrison, Cyprus.  Moghuls has been serving British Troops for 35 years, and the family has worked in the Garrison since the early 50s. Now, due to bureaucracy they are threatened with closure to make way for a multinational company.  It is disgraceful that Moghuls is being forced out of the Garrison after decades of service.  Moghuls offers an alternative, giving a friendly and social focal point for hundreds of soldiers and their families. Please allow Moghuls to remain trading.",
