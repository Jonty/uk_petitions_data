        "additional_details": "The current length of school summer holidays is 6 weeks, I feel that this is too long as the students then get out of the structure  and discipline of school. I propose that the summer holidays should be shortened to 4 weeks, and the remaining 2 weeks could be added to other breaks such as half term. This would mean that pupils are less likely to get out of the habit of school and working, and could also help with the difficult situation of childcare faced by many parents. ",
