        "additional_details": "Many motorists are suffering everyday stuck Dartford Tunnel traffic trying to cross the bridge. If this happens once in a while then it is an incident. If it happens day in day out then this is known as a problem. Many motorists don\u2019t realise that they are burning the fuel unnecessarily and still have to pay to cross the bridge. There is a delay at least one hour to cross the bridge during the peak period and on Fridays it could go even further.\r\nIn this bad economic climate, I urge the government to take proactive measures and remove the toll charges and ease the traffic during the Christmas period. I am only asking from 1st of December till 31st December and if you do further during the winter periods the more the better.\r\nThereby, many motorist will benefit 1) From less journey time  2) Save petrol /Diesel and on cost of living   3) Less accidents etc.",
