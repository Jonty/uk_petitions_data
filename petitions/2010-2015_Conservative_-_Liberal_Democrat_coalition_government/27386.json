        "additional_details": "As the use of the Internet expands, and international trade and  commerce become  part of our everyday lives, there is an increasing danger that UK Citizens living in the UK may be accused of crimes in other countries and subject to threat of extradition for actions that would not be against the law in the UK.  This petition proposes that we  follow the example of  France and pass laws to prevent any UK citizen from being extradited to any foreign country (in the EU or not). If necessary existing international treaties may have to be repudiated  unilaterally. ",
