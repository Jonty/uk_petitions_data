        "additional_details": "Following the recent arson attacks all across London, I think it might be a good idea to create a program that includes sending some of the hooded people from disadvantaged communities in the UK to live in deprived areas of the world such as shanty towns. That way they could experience the effects of extreme poverty, lack of opportunity, lack of healthcare etc and come to realise that setting buildings on fire and drug dealing etc isn't the best way to build a better society.\r\nI think it could be interesting to see what effect it has. Perhaps they need a catalyst to help them feel like they could achieve something positive despite the adversity of their present social conditions. Just an idea. I'm not convinced that prison works that effectively alone for all people. Lets inspire and motivate these people, not rate their entire worth as zero because of the bad choices they have made.  Humans are fallible but also able to change.",
