        "additional_details": "The Ministry of Defence want to cut the Welfare budget again so that the UK can keep the army.\r\n\r\nSavings could be made by stopping benefits to people coming into this country from abroad.  Savings could also be made by stopping MP's from going on foreign junkets.  To save money, if MP's want to investigate things going on in other countries, they could do what other people do and use the internet.  Also, MP's expenses and pensions could be cut.  Cutting the number of MP's would also save money.  MP's should also use public transport instead of using taxis and aeroplanes.",
