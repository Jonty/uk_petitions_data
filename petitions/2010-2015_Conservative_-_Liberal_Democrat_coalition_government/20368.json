Hospitals clearly state that smoking is not permitted inside any building or on the surrounding NHS land, and yet some staff, patients and visitors ignore this. People caught smoking should be fined to send a clear message that smoking is not acceptable. Revenue raised from fines could be channelled into improving hospital services, funding charities, or any other such publicly beneficial scheme.",
