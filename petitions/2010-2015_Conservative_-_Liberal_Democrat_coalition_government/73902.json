Dorset County Council are proposing  the destruction of  nearly a kilometre of protected ancient woodland in the medieval cutting called Dinah's Hollow on the C13,  south of Shaftesbury, Dorset.  The proposals will mean the destruction of 1700 plus trees some of which are pines and oaks over 100 years old; the destruction of a linear ecosystem and its associated flora and fauna and to replace all of this with concrete walls, and industrial soil nails every metre with mesh so small that no trees or vegetation will ever re-generate.",
