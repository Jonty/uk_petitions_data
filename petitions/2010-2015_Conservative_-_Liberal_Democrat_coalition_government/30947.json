This man is responsible for the kidnapping of 30,000 African children, their torture and conversion into child soldiers and sex slaves.\r\n\r\nThe Ugandan government is happy for outside powers to intervene in the matter. As one of the most advanced nations in the world with the technology and committed professionals to hunt down and bring this man to justice I would like to know why we aren't doing just that. ",
