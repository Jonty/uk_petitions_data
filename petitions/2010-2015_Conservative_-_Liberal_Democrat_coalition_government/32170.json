        "additional_details": "By putting VAT on \"Hot Takeaway Food\" you are penalising innumerable small Bakery Businesses and as a result many could go out of Business. Unlike in London where Pasties are distributed by Large Manufacturers and you have a choice of Hot or Cold Pasties (where they just stick them in the microwave) in the West Country i.e. Devon & Cornwall the vast majority are freshly baked during the course of the day and many workers will buy a pasty for their lunch & take it away. Are you seriously expecting these small bakers to bake them the day before and then sell them the next day. True Westcountry residents like \"Fresh Pasties\" and they are protected by EU Law and therefore should not be subject to VAT. Many small bakers will end up going out of business with this sort of penalty being imposed. George Osborne clearly has no idea what a \"Real Pasty\" tastes like! MAKE CORNISH PASTIES EXEMPT FROM VAT VIA A MINOR AMMENDMENT TO THE FINANCE BILL!",
