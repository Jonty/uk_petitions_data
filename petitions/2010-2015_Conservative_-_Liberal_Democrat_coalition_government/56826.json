        "additional_details": "Hello. We live in an area of Manchester, called Gorton. In recent years we have seen all the green area surrounding us being build on. It has got to the stage where we only have one green field left. The field in question is called Mellands Playing Field. I have today received a letter from the local council, informing us that they intend to now build on this last piece of greenery. We have a local historian looking into the fact that this particular field has a covenant on it, left to the people of Gorton and surrounding areas for our leisure. We are classed as a poorer area, and this piece of land is the only area for our children to play on safely. I will be going to see our local councillor Sir Gerald Kaufman to try to get their support. I know the good people of Gorton will support this, but I was wondering if everyone who wants to keep as much greenery as possible in Britain will also take one minute to sign this petition too. Thank you in advance",
