        "action": "Stop Croydon Council using CCTV in Hugh Street Purley to issue Parking Charge Notices",
        "additional_details": "Croydon Council has been issuing PCNs by a CCTV  camera at High Street Purley for years, majority of these fines are for contravention 62 \u201cParked with one or more wheels on or over a footpath or any part of a road other than a carriageway\u201d. Since there are no raised kerbs, motorists easily make a mistake so if a car wheel ends up on any part of the bricked areas, level with the road surface, the waiting discrete CCTV  captures the image and motorist is sent a hefty fine by post! According to their Annual Report 2012/2013, Council issued 108,549 PCNs of which 43,888 were issued by CCTV. Nearly a third of these were for contravention 62. Council is excessively using CCTV , nearly half of all parking revenue collected from PCNs. High Street Purley is on top of Croydon Councils\u2019 Top 10 Street by PCN Income list! Its time Croydon Council listened to the locals and motorists affected by this unjustified practice and stop using the CCTV to issue excessive fines.  ",
