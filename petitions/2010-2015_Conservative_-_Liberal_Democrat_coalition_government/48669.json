        "additional_details": "We are living in very tough times, our children are set to inherit a gargantuan legacy from Banker's profligacy and greed and yet for some reason there seems to be no red lights in government about this Impending disaster. Foreign Aid was once described as the poor people of a rich country, giving money to the rich people of a poor country, yet Foreign Aid never seems to eradicate the problem. We are set for tough times ahead, where cuts to vital services will become common-place and still our Government, cling to this idea that if they give our hard earned money, away there will be a massive improvement in living standards in the third world. China and India which are both rich developing countries still receive subsidies yet have their own Space Programs while their own people starve. We must stop this anomaly where countries come to rely on our charity, as it only prolongs their misery. ",
