        "additional_details": "For some schools, position on the league table matters more than the achievement of pupils. Therefore I propose the Government abolish School League Tables in favour of a graded system.\r\nEach school could be graded on matters such as qualifications, pupil behaviour, attendence and innovation. An overall grade could then be awarded.\r\nRemoval of positions in favour of grades would create an incentive for schools to improve matters unique to them, rather than a position on a table.\r\n\r\n",
