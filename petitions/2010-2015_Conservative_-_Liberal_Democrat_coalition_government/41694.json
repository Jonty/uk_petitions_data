        "additional_details": "\r\nThe current CPI index is based upon the services that are used by middle class persons who have reasonable wages and wage rises.\r\nOld age pensioners do not have the income or the expectation of increases in their income, to be able to buy the same range of items.\r\nIt is common knowledge (as confirmed by the government economist) that the inflation rate for a pensioner, on the basic pension, is in the order of 2 to 3 times that of the CPI value.\r\nThe governments of both parties have used this fact to hold down the cost of old age pensions and progressively reduce the real value of old age pensions for a large number of years.\r\nThis ploy reduces the cost to the government of providing pensions.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative that the government provides a realistic CPI value for old age pensioners and stops the erosion in the value of the old age pension.\r\n\r\nI would strongly recommend that all old age pensioners urgently sign this petition.\r\n",
