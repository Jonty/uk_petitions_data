        "additional_details": "In the last 20 years while television grew, also adverts on tv got better and better.\r\n I believe that one of the few reason British people are eating a lot is also because they are eating late at night, and adds to promote food on tv at hours like 10 pm or after, are not helping to get a healthy life style for British people.\r\nSo, let's all sign this petition to stop advertisements for food on tv after 9pm daily.",
