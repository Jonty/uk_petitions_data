These reports make up the vast majority of reported telephone crime taken by civilians and police officers in offices such as the Empress State Building.\r\n\r\nThe reports are usually made simply to obtain an insurance number for respective providers.\r\n\r\nSenior officers have failed to do anything about this for years. The Home Office should change operating procedures to allow police operators (properly trained) to filter these reports and refer people direct to their providers and NOT to police.\r\n\r\n",
