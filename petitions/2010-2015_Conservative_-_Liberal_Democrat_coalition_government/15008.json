        "additional_details": "Sentencing appears to be completely at odds for the crimes committed.  How can a two year jail sentence be a fit punishment for someone who torments, tortures and eventually helps to kill young children? Surely a life sentence is more fitting!? This is just one of many sentences that is far too lenient, encouraging the attitude that its ok to commit these hideous crimes. I want the government to have a full review of this matter.",
