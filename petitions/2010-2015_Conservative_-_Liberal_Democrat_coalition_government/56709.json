        "additional_details": "If a school must have a library for studying and a gymnasium to exercise, then equally it needs a place for the children to dream. This can be called a Sacred Space or Sanctuary, a place that allows all to develop their minds and question deep down within themselves where they came from and the purpose of life. This can only impact positively on all aspects of education.\r\nWe passionately believe that every school needs such a space for its pupils and staff and the design of this space can also be influenced by the students themselves.\r\nMany years research has enabled the development of a blueprint for the design of such spaces by Sefre Architects + Research Group.\r\nWe call on the government to demand from all schools that they create a dedicated  building or space within their premises for the children to dream, no matter what their beliefs may be.",
