Those 16-25 and not in full-time education or employment are obliged to serve 12 months working in Community Care with the Elderly (or everyone could be required to do so as the population is living much longer anyway).\r\nIn return everyone would receive training, recognised qualifications and a benefits/minimum wage.\r\n",
