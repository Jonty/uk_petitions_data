        "additional_details": "Leigh is a major North West conurbation, despite being one of the first towns in the country to have a railway station, it is now not served by any.\r\nAn opportunity exists for a branch off the Manchester to Walkden to Atherton railway line using former existing track beds to create a new terminus at Leigh, near the town centre.\r\nThe HS2 plans were ambitious, however I feel that this is very realistic but must be done soon as the trackbed is to be used for the proposed Bus way on which work has started. The economic and social benefits for Leigh cannot be underestimated!",
