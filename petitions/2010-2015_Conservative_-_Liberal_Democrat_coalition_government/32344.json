        "additional_details": "More and more private companies are springing up, charging extortionate sums for parking. One example is of \"Parking eye\" a company that uses cctv to take pictures of car number plates in order to purchase the registered keepers details from the DVLA.\r\n\r\nAt a time when our road tax, fuel costs and everyday motoring costs are on the incline we should be able to park our vehicles safe in the knowledge that we will not return to our cars (after over staying by minutes) to find we are served with a charge of upwards of \u00a380 up to one month later (even more so with those unfortunate to have had their veicles cloned)\r\n\r\nThese companies are con-merchants and bullies! who no matter what regulations are impossed upon them will find ways to rip you off!!!!!",
