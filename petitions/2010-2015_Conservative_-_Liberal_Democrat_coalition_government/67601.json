        "action": "The recovery and storage of stolen motorcycles by the police or 3rd parties should be a free service",
        "additional_details": "When the police recover a stolen motorcycle, it is often taken by a 3rd party for storage or to be held for forensic investigation on behalf of the police. Upon completion of this work the owner is then contacted and given a limited period to either pay a large recovery fee to the 3rd party to get his property back or have it sold. Having had your vehicle stolen it is an insult to have to pay again to get your property back often in a damaged state. We want this practice stopped and the onus put upon the criminal where possible. Police recovery should be funded from the recovered proceeds of crime not from the individual victims of crime. We believe this is an integral part of the function of the police to recover and return stolen property",
