I propose that all British citizens lobby for this decision to be reversed and stand up for our Human rights..\r\n\r\nAbu Qatada has connections with al qaeda and faces punishment in his own country.  Abu Qatada is a danger to the UK and Crown, he hates the UK and is a burden to our country.\r\n\r\nI believe that in circumstances such as this, the Attorney General should overrule the European decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
