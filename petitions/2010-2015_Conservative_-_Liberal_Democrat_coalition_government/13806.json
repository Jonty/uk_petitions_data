In the world, passive smoking kills 600,000 each year and in the UK 'normal' smoking causes 80,000.\r\n\r\nIt's a burden on UK resources in health\r\n\r\nSmoking has a negative effect on any attempt to have comfortable cafe style restaurants and pubs. It always sems to be the non smoker that has to move on. Some smokers want those in favour of bans o cross the road. What do you do if there is a smoker across the road?....walk in the centre of the road?\r\n\r\nPeople are vulnerable to burns and see others smoking so could be influenced to smoke..\r\n\r\nSmokers also drop tens of thousands of butts carrying spit and disease on to streets, parks, beaches etc.\r\n\r\nIf every one knows it is illegal to smoke in public there will be instant disapproval just as we disapprove of spitting even 'farting.'\r\n\r\nbans. Legislate for trial areas before full introduction. Such as at Stony Stratford.\r\n",
