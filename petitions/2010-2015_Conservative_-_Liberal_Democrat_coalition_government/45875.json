        "additional_details": "To further encourage more sporting involvement and to help small businesses we ask that all taxes are reduced for sporting venues.\r\n\r\nIn doing so these businesses will be able to reduce what they charge the client and so encourage more people to try or continue with sport. This should include places such as riding schools who are crippled by the costs and we are losing them all the time. In the light of the gold medal wins at the Olympics this year we should be preserving the businesses that provide the opportunity for people to find their sport.\r\n\r\nThis is an investment in the future of thousands of businesses, the future health of our population and so a reduction in costs to the nhs and benefits system, increasing our chances of more sporting success and through all of this helping our economy.",
