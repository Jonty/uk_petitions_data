Scotland may not be with the union in the future leaving the union in tatters. I would like to see four different votes on staying in the EU. What the people of England wants may not be what the people of Wales, Northan island or Scotland want. We are four different countries, we should have the right of self determination to choose if we want to stand by London who has neglected parts of the union for so long or brussles who distribute wealth to help small businesses, farmers and regeniration.
