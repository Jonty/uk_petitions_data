        "additional_details": "This petition is to state the the undersigned believe in the good that social media has enabled in combating the riots. From organising clean up operations via Hashtags, to the mass search and reporting of tweeters boasting of exploits. Blackberry messenger was also used positively by journalists to source information and ensure informed rather than speculative reporting.\r\nNot to mention the ability of the police to easily quell rumour and conjecture on the sights with calm factual statements.\r\n\r\nTo remove Internet and social media would put the UK in kin with the now defunct regime of Mubarak, in Egypt.",
