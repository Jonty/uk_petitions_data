        "additional_details": "The Government should note our support for MP David Tredennick and his brave stance on alternative therapies, including the use of astrology.\r\n\r\nIt is right that we in society whose spirtual beliefs are alternative to those with more disbelieving and closed minds should have a voice.\r\n\r\nWe note that astrology has been in use for thousands of years and indeed the Indian High Court has ruled it a science.\r\n\r\nWe in the alternative spiritual community should be respected for our beliefs and not subject to ridicule, or have our voice subdued or removed, because of the opinions of the dismissively high handed.\r\n\r\nAs a talking therapy, astrology (or any alternative therapy session) has value for its psychological benefits and the promotion of well being. Clients report that they feel better and less stressed after it.\r\n\r\nSurely in a fair society, we are all entitled to our opinions? It is time our faith and beliefs were listened to more seriously.\r\n\r\n",
