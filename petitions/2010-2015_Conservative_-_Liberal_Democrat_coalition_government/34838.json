        "additional_details": "Everybody has the right to know about the products they use and the ingredients in them. It is disgusting that companies are allowed to claim that a product is not tested on animals even though the ingredients are animal tested. Animal testing is a massive concern for many people and it is wrong that we are putting our trust in these manipulative companies.\r\n\r\nFines should be in place to all companies who make false or misleading claims, and every single product should have clear information on the packaging/bottle if it IS or IS NOT tested on animals and whether it contains animal tested ingredients or not. There should be absolutely no loop holes for companies to get away with false claims or statements.\r\nAs consumers, it is a basic right to be aware of such information.",
