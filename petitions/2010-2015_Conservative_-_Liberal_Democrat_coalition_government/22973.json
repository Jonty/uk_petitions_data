        "additional_details": "Many debt collection agencies operate unfair and distressing business practices, which bully and intimidate members of the the public into helping with their investigations.\r\n\r\nAn agency will send out worrying letters to a list of people who share the same name in the hope that the recipients will contact them and be willing to divulge personal information to be removed from the list. Failure to respond will result in follow up letters claiming debts and threatening court action. Telephone calls will be made repeatedly to harass the innocent victims into complying with the debt agency's demand for private personal data.\r\n\r\nUsing these methods, debt agencies can narrow their search and reduce their operating costs.\r\n\r\nThere are OFT guidelines that explicitly prevent this behaviour but they are not being enforced and it is difficult for victims to find help.",
