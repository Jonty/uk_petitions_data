        "additional_details": "Every year hundreds of teenage girls disappear from schools in the UK and are forced to marry overseas. However they are only 35% of all forced marriage victims and the vast majority of them are girls.\r\nMore shockengly there are stories of the women coming back to the UK pregnant to help with the husbands residency status\r\nThis has to stop now before it becomes commonplace.\r\nI am demanding that a law be introduced which will result in a investigation of parents who leave their children overseas, and if they are found to have forced their child to marry then they are imprisoned and the UK refuses to recognize the marriage and the victim is demanded back on British shores. Without the husband/wife\r\nThe parents have to be held responsible for their actions and must learn that this behaviour is not tolerated at all in the UK.\r\nAnd we need to protect our citizens, of any age, from this sick practise. Here, and overseas. ",
