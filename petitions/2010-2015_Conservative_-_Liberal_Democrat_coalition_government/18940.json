        "additional_details": "We would like the government to pressurise foreign countries abroad to enact a complete embargo on any arms trading within Darfur. UK aid props up many countries outside of Europe that participate in arms deals; we would like the UK government to use this influence to prevent this slaughter of human life in Darfur. Furthermore, we would like a significantly stronger UK stance on the human rights abominations in Darfur at the UN - in order to force action.",
