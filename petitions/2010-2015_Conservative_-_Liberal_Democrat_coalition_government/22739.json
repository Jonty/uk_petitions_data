        "additional_details": "\r\n\r\nA 40p cut in fuel duty would reinvigorate this country overnight. It would instantly motivate people and business to spend \u00a0and create massive employment. The government would not lose as the quantity of fuel sales would go up nullifying any cut. Instead of pumping billions into economy to get the country going you actually end up better off. Reducing fuel duty by a few pence does not achieve anything only infuriating the British public. This could be the feel good factor everybody wants and nobody loses.\r\n",
