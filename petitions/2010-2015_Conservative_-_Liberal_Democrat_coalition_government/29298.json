In the light of Fabio Capello's resignation we believe now is the time for Roy, King of the LMA and holder of 35 years of experience, Hodgson, to be given this position in recognition of his achievements in the game. The FA are clearly an incompetent organisation and this petition calls on the secretary of state for culture media and sport to take the lead in this matter and appoint Roy Hodgson as the man to take England to Euro 2012 glory.",
