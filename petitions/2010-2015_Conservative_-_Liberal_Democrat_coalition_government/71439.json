        "additional_details": "With the development of the area over the past few years the current layout is no longer able to support the volume consumers visiting the premises.\r\n\r\nBusy weekends have seen cars in gridlock, unable to exit the Car park for several hours. This has caused much stress and frustration for these people and has often led to irrational and impulsive driving behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis is also effecting the local retail businesses. It is causing a reduction in footfall to the area, which has a resulting loss on takings. It must be taken into consideration that Boots pharmacy is the closest pharmacy to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, delays in getting medication to patients could pose serious health risks.\r\n\r\nPrevious proposals for changes to the Car park revolved around manipulating foliage to make it more aesthetically pleasing. This is completely overlooking the larger issue. Change to the traffic flow and car park exits needs to be made to improve the experience and safety for drivers.\r\n",
