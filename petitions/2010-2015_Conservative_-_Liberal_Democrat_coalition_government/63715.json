        "additional_details": "We wish to campaign for fairer treatment for which Letter Box Contact is agreed and supervised. We believe that Letter Box Contact should be built within the Adoption Order and should be mandatory for all adoptive Parents to write to the Birth Parents/Family (As approved) within set time frames. Letter Box contact should not be optional but mandatory. It is in the best interests of the child(ren) to receive contact from the birth family. We wish for this to be discussed in Parliament.",
