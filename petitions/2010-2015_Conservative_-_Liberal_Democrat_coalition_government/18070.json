They are favouring the use of CE and BCE (Common Era and Before Common Era) in a move to be \"religiously neutral\". The fact that the WHOLE WORLD currently lives in the year of our Lord (AD) seems to be redundant! In this, a Christian country are we supposed to forget that Christ even existed now? How many people of different faiths are really going to be offended that they are living in 2012? Well, according to, ironically, a BBC poll 91% would rather keep BC and AD. Let's put pressure on this supposedly great British institution to see sense and revert to the terms that have served us well for centuries.",
