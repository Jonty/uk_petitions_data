        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the creation of the UK equivalent of France\u2019s Ecole Nationale d'Administration, which is France\u2019s National School of Administration. The institutuion would prepare students for the highest levels of the non-technical civil service in the UK, and would prepare its students for their future responsibilities in UK, Europe or elsewhere abroad.\r\nThe school should offer diversified educational programs, adapted to each stage of a professional career, be it the principal curriculum, continuing education or even tailor-made programs.\r\nBy combining field experience with expertise acquired in the classroom, the programs, led by civil service and outside professionals, would provide both theoretical and practical education, on-the-job training (stages), case studies, simulations and work in groups. Together, they would make it a dynamic professional training school, fully in phase with today\u2019s challenges in public-sector management.",
