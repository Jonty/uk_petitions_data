They toil under the ever-increasing stress of overwhelming bureaucracy and unattainable expectations. The stress and strain of the relentless struggle to progress is resulting in the slow erosion of this invaluable profession.\r\n\r\nThe teachers of this nation have lost faith in those who make the decisions about how and what they teach. They are unable to engage in a meaningful dialogue with the policy makers who instead make decisions without consultation or advice from those that are at the front lines of teaching. As such, we call upon the Prime Minister to terminate the tenure of the current minister of education, Michael Gove, in favour of a politician who will engage with teachers, head teachers and educational professionals in a manner which will promote understanding and trust between the government and educators.\r\n",
