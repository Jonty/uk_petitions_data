        "additional_details": " Contrails are the exhaust of an Aircraft, a trail in the sky which should rapidly dissipate.\r\n\r\n Chem trails initially look identical to contrails, but rather than the trail dissipating, the trail expands and then starts to look like a cloud. I almost daily witness these Chem trails starting and stopping from airplanes. In other words, the plane has control over the chemicals it is releasing.\r\n\r\n  The purpose of Chem trails (which are well documented over the United States and other parts of the world) according to researchers, is to manipulate the weather.\r\n\r\n  I would like an open & public driven enquiry into what physical elements make up a \"Contrail\" or \"Chem Trail\" & are these unnatural clouds made of \"Earth Friendly\" materials?\r\n\r\n What percentage of this material is falling back down to ground level? is it harmful to soil or living organisms?\r\n\r\n YES THIS INCLUDES YOU AND ME!\r\n\r\n I would very much like to know what the UK Governments opinion on this subject is.",
