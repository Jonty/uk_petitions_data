First used in days where lords, ladies and the landed gentry lived off of inheritance and other assets as the only way of taxation. It is hitting working farm owners who are already struggling and citizens who wish to inherit family homes and small savings from their relatives.\r\nPeople pay tax all their lives and to tax their assets on their passing is fundamentally wrong",
