        "additional_details": "Allow parents to take their children out of school for up to two weeks during term time.  Also allow teachers to take two weeks of holiday during term time, with their place to be filled in with a supply teacher (as it would be for any other absense).  The two week holiday must be taken as one block.  Teachers would be able to make up this time with a different two-weeks working during other school holiday (on lesson plans, marking and other necessary duties).  Extend term by two weeks to cover the missed schoolwork (e.g. reduce the summer holiday by two weeks).\r\n\r\nAdvantages for families: ability to afford a proper family holiday; less childcare needed.\r\nAdvantages for teachers: extra time to do non-teaching activities.\r\nAdvantages for economy: families have more money to spend on other things.",
