        "additional_details": "We have established through extensive research that LAPBELTS can be very dangerous and FATAL for children to wear. We believe that legislation should be updated to ensure coaches with 3 point harnesses be used (as in mini buses). Current legislation states that lapbelts can be used for school trips - they are hugely inadequate and present their own dangers.\r\nMost modern coaches are fitted with three point harnesses but schools are still booking inferior coaches. In our research cost has not been an issue as coaches with 3 point harnesses are now readily available and do not cost more.\r\nWe need to prevent kids being sent around motorways in ancient, decommissioned buses just because they have lapbelts in and so meet current legislation! Lapbelts are not safe for children.\r\nPlease let's not let any child be hurt, disabled or killed because they were on a coach with lapbelts on and not 3 point harnesses. Prevention is better than cure.",
