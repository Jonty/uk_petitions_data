        "additional_details": "In England we have no real recognition for St. George's day currently and this is wrong. Most nations celebrate their patron saints with pride, but we are currently denied that opportunity. This needs to change.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, the Scottish Parliament passed the St. Andrew's Day Bank Holiday Act 2007, which designated the Day as an official bank holiday.\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick's day is also celebrated across the Republic of Ireland & Northern Ireland as a bank holiday.\r\n\r\nSt. David's day is recognised as a national holiday in Wales, but not as a bank holiday.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is that both St. George's day and St. David's day are both made into full bank holiday's for their respective nations. We should be able to celebrate our patron saints with pride. We should be celebrating them both, just as many other nations around the world do in remembrance of their saints every year.\r\n\r\nSign this e-petition and let's get our government to take notice of us!\r\n\r\n",
