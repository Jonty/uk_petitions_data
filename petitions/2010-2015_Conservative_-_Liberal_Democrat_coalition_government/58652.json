        "additional_details": "Following another bad crash this evening and 2 fatalities in less than a year and the number of cars dangerously going over the speed limit something has to be done to stop this. There are no safety measures in place for this bypass and it is part of the school run to access ynyshir primary school. This petition has been set up as we feel safety measures and speed cameras need to be in place to make the road safer and to try and prevent further injuries and fatalities. How many more lives have to be lost before something is done? ",
