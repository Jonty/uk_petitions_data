        "additional_details": "Sport generally is a key aspect of life within the British culture, with many sports having been created here. It is important to ensure that major sporting events remain accessible to the majority of the population and not only those who can afford to pay to watch. Football, Rugby & Tennis finals are some examples which have been retained. F1 Motor Racing doesn't have one 'final' as such but a series of races that cumulatively equate to  a 'final'. That the television rights for this major sporting spectacle, which has such noble British origins, can be sold off to the disadvantage of the British Public without discussion or intervention by the Government is a disgrace. This Petition demands that F1 Motor Racing remains on free-to-air television.",
