        "additional_details": "That when Votes are taken in a British Parliament as to whether or not the British should go to War they should not be on Motions devised by some other Authority. They should be on the Principle as to whether or not the British should go to War, and nothing else. They should also be for the Individual Conscience, and no other. There should be no Reliance by any Individual either on the Conventions of the Past or on what is judged to be the Opinion of the English Majority in the present Parliament for the British. Decisions of such a Nature that are of Interest and Concern to the British as a whole should require the Full and Unanimous Authority of each of the Countries represented in the Parliament, with each Country enjoying Power of Veto. In this way if any one of the English, Irish, Scots or Welsh does not wish to go to War then the British do not go to War.  ",
