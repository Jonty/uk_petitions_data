        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the licensing of establishments and on line facilities that sell Hunting Crossbows, Black Widow Catapults and, or, so called 'Survival' knives. These weapons are freely available to anyone who wishes to purchase them. They have the ability to kill or maim individuals and should only be available from properly licensed premises, where identification prior to purchase is a requirement. If this were done, it woyuld immediately remove the opportunity for such weapons to fall into the hands of criinals and those intent on terrorising neighbourhoods. It would also reduce the number of such weapons in general circulation. This would make our communities safer and less prone to these weapons falling into the hands of gang members.",
