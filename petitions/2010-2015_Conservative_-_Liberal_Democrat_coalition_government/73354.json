Enormous damage can be done to patients by so-called therapists who don't know what they are doing.  Every therapist or counsellor should hold a genuine qualification for the issue they purport to treat. They should also be supervised by an independent body and regularly inspected. Please change the law to protect mental health patients from unqualified charlatans, some of whom don't even have the basic counselling skills of a first year counselling student. ",
