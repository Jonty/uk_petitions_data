        "additional_details": "As a GCSE student, a lot of pressure has been imposed on me and my peers. I propose that there should be less of this pressure put on us as developing children to make our time in education more of an enjoyable time in which we are able to form lifelong friendships and take part in activities that we will continue for the rest of our lives. I believe this would be made possible by the removal of homework from schools and increasing the length of the school day to accommodate the small amount of extra work that this will entail, another thing I propose is to remove the examination system, and instead grade children on their overall performance in the subject in the class, this will help to prevent children from feeling overly stressed with the fear that upcoming exams create and would still provide the students with an incentive to do well.",
