The local area is already liable to flooding with reseidents of Craiglands suffering for years. Our schools are at bursting our local roads and infrasture can not cope with strain of more homes.\r\n\r\nPlease act now to protect the identity of our local area, and stop any further destruction of our community.\r\n\r\n",
