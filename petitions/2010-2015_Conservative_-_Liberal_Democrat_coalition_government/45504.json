Trains at peak times with 4 coaches, uncomfortable seats, inept seat booking processes, foul smelling vestibules and toilets the stench of which is felt when boarding the train and in the carriage. The service is costly (I paid \u00a3256 yesterday for the pleasure of standing up in a dangerously full coaches). Something needs to done about this unresponsive, unsafe and non customer friendly debacle of a company who do not deserve the long suffering customers who have to put up with their monopoly of services to some parts of the country. Dft you need to experience this to believe it, and not in first class please!",
