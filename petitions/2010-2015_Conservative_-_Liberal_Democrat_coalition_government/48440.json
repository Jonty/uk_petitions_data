In the light of her many achievements, not least:\r\n- changing the face of Britain for the better,\r\n- removing the ability of the Unions to dictate national policy\r\n- giving Britain the ability to compete on the international stage\r\n- leading this country to an unparalleled economic boom which took 10 years of Labour to destroy.\r\n\r\nI respectfully petition the government to grant a state funeral to Baroness Margaret Thatcher.",
