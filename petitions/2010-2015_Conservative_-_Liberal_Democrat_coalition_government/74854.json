        "additional_details": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a psychiatric procedure where up to 400 volts is put through the brain for up to 8 seconds causing an epileptic fit purportedly to relieve mental distress. Mainly given to women and the elderly, sometimes to children and often without consent. ECT machines have never been independently inspected or approved for medical safety, not even by the regulators for the UK - MHRA and the US \u2013 FDA, who considers them \u2018hazardous and unsafe\u2019. Dr Peter Breggin states that ECT produces a \u2018closed head injury high\u2019 giving temporary relief from depression in exchange for permanent brain damage www.ectresources.org. Research shows ECT causes brain cell death, brain bleed and swelling. It can cause permanent memory loss, cognitive impairment and even death. Many patients are afraid of ECT and it can trigger or aggravate depression and suicide attempts. Patients are often not fully informed about the potential harm. Abolish ECT. www.speakoutagainstpsychiatry.org",
