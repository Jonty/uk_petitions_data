        "additional_details": "Calling on the Parliament to urge the Government to consider placing hyperemesis specialist nurses in hospitals throughout the country to provide medical and emotional support to the thousands of pregnant women suffering from this condition.\r\nThousands of women are desperate for help and support during and after this illness.  The lack of knowledge within the medical profession regarding this condition can lead women to seek termination instead of suffering from this.  A specialist doctor, nurse or midwive for every county would be able to provide medical and emotional support by providing the correct information, holding counselling sessions and support groups.\r\nIn 2007, The Royal London Hospital set up a day unit for women suffering from hyperemesis. This is the only clinic in the UK available for outpatient care and preventative treatment",
