UAE, China and Norway amongst others, have used these to preserve and grow their wealth .While we may not have any extra funds to invest into these, we should put the share of RBS and LLoyds into these and the fund be expanded as we go along.\r\nAdditionally, faltering public utility companies could be fined in shares, rather than amounts and these too should be added to the fund.\r\nThe proceeds from natural sources (such as Shale Gas) too may be included.\r\nThis fund in the future could be used to either leverage Britain\u2019s monetary power in the world or be deployed for welfare.\r\nIt should be protected from political interference so that it cannot be raided by any political party for short term electoral gains.\r\nThis is just a start and we could build an immense political and economic structure on this back of this idea.",
