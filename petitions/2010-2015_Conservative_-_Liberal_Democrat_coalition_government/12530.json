We, the undersigned, demand a rational, public debate on the alternative models and the steps needed to ensure a more equal and harmonious society. The gap between the rich and poor is an abomination; whilst the corrosive, morally contemptible actions of bankers and greedy corporations continues to benefit just a small minority at the expense of the average working man. This must change if we are to stop the slide towards further moral and economic decline.",
