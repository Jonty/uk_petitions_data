        "additional_details": "Trying to control binge drinking by artificial price control is a socialist/communist solution in that it attempts to control all members of society for the mistakes of relatively few.  A more liberated and democratic solution is to let people choose for themselves what and how much they drink but to then let them live with the consequences.  In this case, the consequences are that they have to pay the bill for the medical treatment incurred after a binge drinking session.  many people would think twice about binge drinking if they knew they would face a bill of, say, \u00a3500 afterwards.  I appreciate this goes against the principle of free care to all but exceptions to this have already been made (e.g. prescription charges) and I'm sure a method can be found.  Also, since it is self inflicted, maybe the principal is on rocky ground here, anyway. ",
