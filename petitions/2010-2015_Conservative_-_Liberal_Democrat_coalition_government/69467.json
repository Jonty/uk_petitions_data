        "additional_details": "Many people with long term mental health issues are living in the community alone, with little to no support, and constantly denied secondary support services, even when once weekly counselling is simply not enough to properly support the person's mental health needs.\r\n\r\nThose with long term mental health issues should have the right to a support worker and/ or care co-ordinator if they so wish.\r\n\r\nMany would benefit from having a supportive individual to help them manage aspects of their life, such as work, social and emotional and financial skills, so that they can become fully independent.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you believe those with long term mental health conditions deserve to be independent and feel properly supported in their community.",
