        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to end the regime of using MPs and Peers as Cabinet and Junior Ministers and instead bring in a professional Cabinet system whereby experts are hired and fired by Parliament to run a department or look after a portfolio.  We believe this will allow short-term political decisions to be minimised and for talent to flourish at the top of Government for the benefit of the public.  It makes far more business sense than using non-expert individuals to lead a department.",
