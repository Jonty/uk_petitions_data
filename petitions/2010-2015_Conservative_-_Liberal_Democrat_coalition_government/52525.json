        "additional_details": "This Chapel remains the first place that repatriated service personnel are brought together with their families. For the families, the first time they saw the body of their Son, Daughter, Husband,Wife, Brother, Sister, Mum or Dad remains a devastating and surreal moment forever etched in their minds.\r\n\r\nWe as a nation, owe it to those that lost their lives and those left behind, to honour our heroes. It may be that the families wish this to be demolished but I petition this Government to take NO steps to demolish this Chapel without offering the families a choice of what should happen. Turning it into a memorial garden, Training Centre Chapel or quiet area of reflection are all possible uses but have the moral decency to carry out a survey of every next of kin first! Then and only then make a decision that reflects the majority view and honours our Heroes.",
