        "additional_details": "The government wants to charge 5p for every plastic bag we use. I believe that they should be got rid of completely. Companies know they are dangerous but continue to supply them, why is this being allowed to happen.\r\n\r\nWhen I go into a shop and buy products from them, I will need a way of getting them home, it is the companies responsibility to provide an environment friendly way of doing this and they are not. So we have to pick up the bill.\r\n\r\nI want the government to realise that it is the companies at fault and it is them who should foot the bill. Many places use paper bags, McDonalds for example and my own bussiness for another.\r\n\r\nIt is disgusting that bussiness owners can not be bothered to pay the extra for better bags so we as the consumers pay the price.",
