        "additional_details": "After the recent rioting, David Cameron is still planning on going ahead with the budget cuts of Britain's police force.  Considering these riots only calmed down when a 16,000 strong police force flooded the streets of London, and our police force worked tirelessly to bring charges upon nearly a thousand of these criminals, these budget cuts to the police force must be stopped to ensure the safety and future of our country.",
