Should this be debated then the public should be entitled to suggest ideas on how this would work.\r\n\r\nIf our youths feel that they should be handed something for nothing then let us hand them this. Families are living in fear, shop keepers have been terrorised and after the devastation caused by riots we should stand together to ensure discipline is restored, this can be done with National Service. Nothing else seems to be working.",
