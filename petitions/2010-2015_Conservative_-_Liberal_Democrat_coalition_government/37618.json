        "additional_details": "Parliament should compel local authorities to send a written caution to any motorist who is caught on CCTV committing a minor motoring offence, eg infringing a bus lane, when this is a first offence.  The written caution would take the place of a fixed penalty charge.  This would prevent the penalisation of honest mistakes and remove the strong suspicion that many people have that such penalty charges are simply a revenue-raising exercise.  It would also accord the same opportunity to modify behaviour that criminals often receive when caught on a first offence.",
