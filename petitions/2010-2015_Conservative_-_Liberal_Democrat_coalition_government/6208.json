Likewise the official languages of the European Union.  Education through the medium of such languages should be provided wherever 10 or more families ask for it.  All such languages should be accessible as second languages to schoolchildren and the learning of a variety of languages at school should be encouraged.  Such enterprise must be given proportionate media attention throughout the UK, not just around \"hotspots\" for a particular language.",
