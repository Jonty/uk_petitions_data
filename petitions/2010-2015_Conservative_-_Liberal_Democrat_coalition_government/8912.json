        "additional_details": "It\u2019s taken for granted by many benefit claimants that it\u2019s their entitlement to use tax payer\u2019s money to fund lifestyles that are beyond the reach of many working people. It is not untypical to find claimants with the latest in plasma TVs, games, taking holidays abroad, smoking, drinking and spending tax payer\u2019s money on lottery tickets. This e-petition is to call for a review of the way money is credited to claimants and to call for cash benefit to be replaced with tokens or vouchers that can only be used in exchange for Food and Clothing. Claimants need to learn and understand that Luxury items should only be a benefit of those in employment and that the taxpayer can no longer afford to subsidise non essential purchases of those not contributing to society.",
