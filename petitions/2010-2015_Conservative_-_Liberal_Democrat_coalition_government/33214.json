        "additional_details": "The house of lords should be reformed to comprise of no more than 15% political party members restricted to a 15 year term selected by their political parties.\r\n\r\nThe rest should be non-political appointees from an independent commision selected based on their expertise in a diverse range of fields without a specific term limit.\r\n\r\nFailure to attend the house of lords for less than 25% of the sitting days should be deemed as forfeiting the right to hold a place.\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of members should be no more than 450 members.\r\n\r\nThe position should remain unpaid with expenses met.\r\n\r\nAny change to current arrangements should require a referendum with a majority of the registered UK voters to approve it.\r\n\r\nThe expectation is that this petition is presented to the house of commons for debate and considered an alternative to the current propossed changes by the government.\r\n",
