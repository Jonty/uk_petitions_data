        "additional_details": "Insurance for Young Drivers is way to high and this is stopping people from buying vehicles and causing great harm to the economy. I would like the Government to put in place the correct regulatory standards for Insurance company's, so that they will not discriminate against age or peoples from more disadvantaged area's.\r\n\r\nThe UK's Roads are some of the safest in the world and this should be reflected in people's car insurance prices. Our government Should stop Corporations who are using the law to monopolize Insurance and charge High rates just because they can. Also if the Government cannot Properly regulate Insurance rates then it should look to partly Subsidize them for Certain people.",
