It gives ordinary people something they lacked before - a voice.\r\n\r\nHowever, the slightest publicity causes people to visit the site, which cannot handle the numbers. The website promptly becomes unavailable.\r\n\r\nIf the e-petition idea is to be taken seriously, I request that the website is properly funded and made robust enough to handle the large amounts of visits it gets.",
