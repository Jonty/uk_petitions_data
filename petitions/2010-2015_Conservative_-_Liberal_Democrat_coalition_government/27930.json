The people most adversely affected by politicians' failure to resolve the situation are the taxpayers of this country and it is THEY who should be given the opportunity to resolve the question in a legally binding referendum.  Politicians' are continuously demonstrating an inability to resolve questions which might end up adversely affecting one or more of their membership.
