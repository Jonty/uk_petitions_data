New regulations are urgently needed to make providers fully accountable for the health, safety and dignity of their residents.\r\n\r\nThe R&RA is calling for the reinstatement of regulations requiring that providers:\r\n\u2022\tinspect their care homes monthly to check the standard of care provided;\r\n\u2022\treport their findings to the regulator, the manager of the home and company directors;\r\n\u2022\tensure quality of care is improved when care is of a poor standard.\r\n\r\nGood quality care means that there must be a trained and qualified manager in post at all times. We want robust regulations that ensure the regulator, the Care Quality Commission, has the power to:\r\n\u2022\timpose serious penalties for carrying on a care home without a registered manager.\r\n",
