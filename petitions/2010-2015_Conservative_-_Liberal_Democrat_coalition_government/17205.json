        "additional_details": "Contribution based benefits are only paid if a person has made contributions for the LAST TWO FULL consecutive years regardless of how many years they have been contributing over their working lives. Therefore even if a person has worked continuously for 30 years or more they would not be entitled to any contribution based unemployment benefit if they have made a prior claim in the last 2 years \u2013even if it is the only claim made during their working life\r\n Unemployment benefits should therefore be calculated on a sliding scale based on the number of years / months a person has worked and contributed to the system via their National Insurance contributions. Thus those that have worked longer would be entitled to greater support.\r\nThis would reward those people who have continuously contributed to the system and put their needs ahead of immigrants who have not contributed to the system and those feckless individuals who have not worked and have no intention of working.",
