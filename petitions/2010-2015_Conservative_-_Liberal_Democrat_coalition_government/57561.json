        "additional_details": "Our one and only aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious is due to be decommissioned in 2014. However our new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth will not be commissioned until 2016 at least. I suggest that we keep HMS Illustrious in commission with the Royal Navy until HMS Queen Elizabeth is commissioned into the navy, otherwise we will be left without an aircraft carrier for two years. This is unacceptable for one of the most sophisticated navies in the world.",
