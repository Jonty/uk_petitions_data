        "additional_details": "We the undersigned sincerely believe that removing these people from the benefits and social housing system only sows the seeds of further trouble. The causes of this unrest are not yet entirely clear, but taking this step will lead these people into further crime as their only source of income. Beyond this, we find it morally objectionable to take this step regardless of the outcomes, particularly in situations where parents may lose their homes because of their children's actions without any investigation into whether that parent could have done anything to stop it. We do not believe social ostracism and enforced poverty are fair punishments for these actions.",
