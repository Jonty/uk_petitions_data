        "action": "Regulate the travel industry to end huge price increases during school holidays",
        "additional_details": "The govt aims to keep pupils in school during term time in order to maximise their education and to ensure they don't miss anything in class time. However, when parents come to take their children abroad in school holidays, they find that they can be paying upwards of \u00a32000 extra against a comparable holiday booked during term time. The travel industry knows that they can charge these extortionate prices as parents are threatened with fines if they take their children out of class. This petition aims to make the govt regulate the travel industry and ensure no more than a 10% rise in cost for a trip taken during school holidays compared to one in term time.",
