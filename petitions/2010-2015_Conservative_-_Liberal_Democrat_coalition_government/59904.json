        "additional_details": "Two days ago my dog was savagely attacked by a pitbull/staff type dog. the attack lasted 15 minutes and was witnessed by an 8 year old girl who was walking my dog also.\r\nThe dog has not been seized by the police because an officer says it is blue coloured and pitbulls do not come in that colour, therefore it is a staffordshire bull terrier. This means the dog is free to potentially do this again. also the owner will not be questioned formally about this incident as someone else was walking it, even though he trained and socialized it. this shows what a farce The Dangerous Dogs Act is and how it the Government should amend this act to include 'deed not breed' and raise the question of owners being void of responsibility in cases like this.T",
