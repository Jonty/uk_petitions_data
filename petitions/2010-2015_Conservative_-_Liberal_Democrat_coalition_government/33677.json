Making these women's lives a little easier and safer is surely something we should aspire to.\r\n\r\nI propose that all women from their 7th month for 3 months (to include immediately after birth) should be routinely given a blue badge to be given the same rights to priority parking as a disabled person.\r\n\r\nRough calculations show a possible 5% increase in blue badges.\r\n\r\nThe costs would be minimal, with regular scheduled doctors appointments they could be given out with strict expiry dates.\r\n\r\nI have yet to meet anyone with a reason not to support this so please sign this petition to have it debated.\r\n\r\nThanks",
