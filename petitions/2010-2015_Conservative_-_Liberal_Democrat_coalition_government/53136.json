        "additional_details": "Two main points to this petition.\r\n\r\n1-Child & Parent parks needs to be exempt from blue badge holders and their exclusive right to park anywhere especially in supermarkets. These parking spaces are an absolute necessity for parents with young children and especially multiples I.e twins, triplets or more. They make the difference between a parent going out alone or being secluded at home.\r\nWhich brings me to my next point.\r\n2- Specialist trolleys I.e newborn seats, newborn & toddler seats and double toddler trolleys need a specific home in the supermarket. It is not safe for a parent to leave their child/children in the car especially in the heat of summer and have to run & search for their required shopping trolley. I propose a simple coin operated slot on the trolley. This ensuring that a) each type of trolley had a \"home\" therefore allowing the parent to know exactly where they are & b) it forces trolley users to return the specialist trolley to its \"home\".",
