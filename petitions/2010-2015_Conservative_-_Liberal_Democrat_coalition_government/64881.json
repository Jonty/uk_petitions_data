        "additional_details": "The football league in England consists of 72 full time football league clubs. The football conference premier division consists of 24 clubs of which many are professional. Each club has it's own unique history, it's own colours, it's own badge, it's own nickname and represents it's own community. This has been the foundation and culture of the English football league for 150 years. This heritage and tradition that has been enjoyed by those gone before must be maintained and preserved for now and future generations.",
