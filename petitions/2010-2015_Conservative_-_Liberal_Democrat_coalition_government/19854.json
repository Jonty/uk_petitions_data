        "additional_details": "Having accidentally walked past a newspaper with Gaddafi's dead, bloodied body on the front page at childs height I want to get 100,000 signatures to make it compulsory for supermarkets etc to put newspapers out of childrens eye view when such graphic images are on the front page of newspapers. My daughter Ellie was really upset by it and now I have had to have a very difficult conversation with her. I just want to highlight the distress that can be caused by such images being so easily viewed. If you agree please say, Many Thanks",
