        "additional_details": "My petition is here to give the so named 'Dangerous dogs' a chance to prove that its the owner not the dog, as someone who has had experience with pit-bull's, Rottweiler's and many other so called 'Dangerous dogs' I am a strong believer that any dog can be vicious but it's all down to the owner, no dog attacks without reason, I did an animal care course which allowed us to learn why animals attack, and in fact studies have shown that small breed's such as: Chihuahua's, Jack Russel's and Yorkshire Terriers have proven to be most aggressive, however no dog is nasty for no reason. Relinquish the dangerous dog title and in fact take more care to vet owners before the are allowed to take any animal home, that way there is no breed discrimination and beautiful, loving, misunderstood dogs have a chance at loving family's who care for them PROPERLY!
