        "additional_details": "This petition is to increase the DWP JSA and Income Support weekly benefit rate to the aged 25 or over rate  of \u00a372.40 per week.This is proposed for all care leavers aged 18-24 who live independently.Making this change would acknowledge and recognise the barriers faced by care leavers. And the significant vulnerability faced by young people leaving care who live independently without support  from family & who have no safety net. Living independently on lower benefit rate (for under age 25) of \u00a357.35 is impossible and is causing extreme hardship & poverty to care leavers who live independently; it is also a significant cause of homelessness & is creating severe disadvantage for care leavers.\r\nWe ask the government to make this change a top priority.\r\n\r\n",
