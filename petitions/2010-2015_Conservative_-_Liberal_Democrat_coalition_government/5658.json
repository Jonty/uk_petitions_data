        "additional_details": "The creation of the Scottish Psychic Industry Authority (SPIA) that manages the licensing of worldwide psychics, clairvoyants, fortune tellers, tarot readers and other's that use face to face predictive type divination tools for Scottish based clients. The SPIA will create a new Psychic Proficiency Standard for the licensing of ONLY face to face psychic services in Scotland. We hope to terminate and swich off all premium rate numbers that provide telephone psychic services to Scotland and discourage technological methods of providing psychic services. All those that work in the worldwide psychic industry and provide face to face psychic services in Scotland would need to be registered and licensed with the Scottish Psychic Industry Authority. This new authority would handle all formal face to face psychic services complaints from Scotland residents to a psychic anywhere in the world. ",
