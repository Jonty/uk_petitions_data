        "additional_details": "Despite years of peace talks, foreign aid, UN resolutions, NGO support and media attention, people in the western region of Sudan, Darfur still suffer ground attacks, air strikes, gang rapes, blockage of aid and the media, detention and marginalisation at the hands of the government and Janjaweed.\r\n\r\nSudan received \u00a3146m of aid from Britain in 2009. We must use this leverage to resolve the situation there.\r\n\r\nWe propose that the government support the Sudanese Revolutionary Front, an organisation comprised of all major rebel factions to take control of Darfur via the creation of a new state or other means to achieving peace and security in Darfur under a new authority.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, we ask the government to push the UN to increase the size of the peacekeeping force in Darfur such that UNAMID can confirm it has the means to ensure security in Darfur so that aid and media organisations can operate throughout the entire region without fear of attack.",
