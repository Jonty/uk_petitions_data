        "additional_details": "Jeremy Hunt has clearly demonstrated an abject lack of understanding of the problems the NHS faces. He has provided no useful direction and only provided knee-jerk rhetoric since coming into office.\r\n\r\nHis policies so far have served only to destabilise and undermine the NHS at a time when it faces unprecendented demand and unrealistic financial pressures. This marks the very definite beginnings of a move to deconstruct the NHS and increase privatisation, a model which has repeatedly been seen to fail to produce the desired results in other areas but offload the government of any responsibility. He should resign and hand responsibility to someone with at least some grasp of healthcare.",
