        "additional_details": "At the end of December 2014 I had my car mot'd in preparation for the coming year's road tax. I needed a new set of tyres to pass and the tracking needed adjusting. Part of the reason for this is the poverty of repair to our minor roads system. The Government seems no longer to link the road tax we pay with the state of the minor roads around our villages, towns and cities.\r\n\r\nEither investment must be made to return the minor road system to 1980's 90's conditions or the road user should be able to make claims for recompense using their garage invoice following their mot. If there can be wear and tear to any part of the vehicle shown to be from a lack of investment then there should be possible partial return of the road tax paid.",
