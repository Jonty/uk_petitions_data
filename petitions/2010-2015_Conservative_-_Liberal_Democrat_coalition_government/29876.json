        "additional_details": "The smoking ban, in my opinion, has not gone far enough in deterring people from smoking; instead, it has only shifted the issue rather than dealing with the core. The ban must be expanded in scope to finally show that the government does not support this act.\r\n\r\nGovernments have stated that they wish to tackle this demon, so why not ban smoking in public? If people still wanted to smoke, then they would be free to in the privacy of their house. The only thing this ban would negatively impact is cigarette sales. So, I must ask, do the financial incentives of cigarettes take precedence over morality?\r\n\r\nI understand potential scepticism, but it is the logical step forward as a society. New York City passed legislation which has banned smoking in parks, beaches, board walks, pedestrian plazas and other public spaces, so why can\u2019t the UK follow suit and show the tenacity required to ban smoking in public? We shouldn\u2019t look to follow a model; we should look to develop the model.\r\n\r\n",
