This follows the death (and not limited to) of Lexi Branston and the recent death of an 11 month old baby in Blackburn.  Not enough is presently in place to attack innocent children from being bitten on a dog owners own property as there is currently a luciana in the law that allows such owners whose dogs bite to walk away criminally unscathed, this is unacceptable especially where dog owners know beforehand their dog is a danger.",
