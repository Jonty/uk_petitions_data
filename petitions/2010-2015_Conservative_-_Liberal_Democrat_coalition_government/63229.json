Roxy spent six days clawing at the kitchen door until finally she went blind, slipped into a coma and died.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe five-year-old boxer was eventually found, maggot-infested, ten weeks later. The traumatised RSPCA inspector was forced to scrape this tragic creature off the floor with a shovel.\r\n\r\nWe want as many signatures as possible before the 8th of April to ensure this is taken seriously and a longer prison sentance is issued. Justice for Roxy. Thank you!\u201d",
