These devices have been in our bodies for many years, we feel we have a right to know what has been found in relation to substance properties, in particular molecular weight, capacity to migrate across membranes, and chemical content.\r\n\r\nWe want a full investigation into the set of symptoms commonly-reported by women who have had PIP implants, through gathering patient-reported experiences, and also through the examination of medical records.\r\n\r\nWe also want the Government to enforce the law in regards to clinics who sold the defective medical devices to consumers. They have a 'legal and moral' obligation to remove and replace the faulty product, or refund consumers. If they don't they should lose their license to practice. A 'legal' obligation is meaningless if it is not enforced.",
