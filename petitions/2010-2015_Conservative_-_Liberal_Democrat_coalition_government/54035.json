Loyalty. Integrity and Commitment.\r\n\r\nCommunity service is still maintained.\r\n\r\nThe boot camp can be a site for career guidance and workshops led by tradesmen and professionals with offenders obtaining key skills and the possibility of future apprenticeships.\r\n\r\nThe site would require a resident therapist and a nurse.\r\n\r\nThe government could run a pilot site in a specified area, I guarantee there would be less re-offenders from a site such as this.\r\n",
