        "additional_details": "McDonald's submitted a planning application to build a two storey drive-through on Kenton Lane in Newcastle upon Tyne.\r\n\r\nFollowing a three month campaign by led by residents and supported by local Labour Ward Councillors and the local Member of Parliament the application was rejected by Newcastle City Council's planning committee on 5th September 2014.\r\n\r\nThe people have spoken.  In huge numbers local residents, schools, pupils, businesses, community groups and councillors expressed their legitimate concerns about this application.  But this might not be the end.\r\n\r\nMcDonald's have a right to appeal the rejection of their application to the planning inspectorate.  We call on McDonald's to respect democracy and to forfeit any appeal.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we call on the Government to look at planning legislation and in particular the applicant\u2019s right of appeal to the Planning Inspectorate which severely limits the role of democracy and the people in the determination of planning decisions.",
