        "additional_details": "I fully support a school resolving discipline issues in any reasonable way WITHIN school time, however how can they have the right to detain children AFTER SCHOOL when the school day has ended - in other words, our time.\r\nUnder Article 5 of the European Convention of Human Rights it is illegal to detain children in school against their will without first securing a court order. The current UK law on school detention directly contradicts this and needs to be challenged.\r\nWe have seen an end to corporal punishment; and now we need to change this disciplinary anomaly where a school can exercise authority outside school hours.",
