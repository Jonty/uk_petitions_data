        "additional_details": "Call on the government to raise the tax on alcohol. This would hopefully help stop our current binge drinking culture and in return more money would be available for the NHS, Education, Police or even paying back our debts. The tax needs to be high enough to make alcohol unaffordable to the irresponsible people that have made it a problem.",
