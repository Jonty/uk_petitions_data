        "additional_details": "Laws have been proposed in St Petersburg that will make it illegal to publically promote gay culture and practices. With fines for doing so ranging from about \u00a320 to around \u00a31000, this is a clear breach of the  human rights of the LGBT community in Russia, and is a homophobic set of legislation.\r\n\r\nThankfully these laws are not yet in place, and we the undersigned urge the UK government to use whatever diplomatic influence they have over Russian lawmakers to ensure that the laws remain un-enforced, and to encourage world leaders to condemn these propsed laws.",
