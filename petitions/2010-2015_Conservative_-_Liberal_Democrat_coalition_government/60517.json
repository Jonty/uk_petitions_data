        "additional_details": "As a country we are responsibe for a large percentage of food wastage. I have noticed companies simply do not do enough or care if they discard food. As the population of the UK increases, resources will rapidly reduce. We need to be a more sustainable country, and NO food should be wasted. If the Government could introduce legislation making it illegal for companies to waste food it would push companies to be more sustainable. ",
