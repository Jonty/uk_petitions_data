With Gordon Brown apologising this publicly I think now is the time he is honoured for all his work.\r\n\r\nHe was highly influential in the development of computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of \"algorithm\" and \"computation\" with the Turing machine, which played a significant role in the creation of the modern computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of computer science and artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nHe also played a very important role in the war for cracking Nazi communications.",
