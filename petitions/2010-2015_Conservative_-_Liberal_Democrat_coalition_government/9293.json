        "additional_details": "The severn bridge tolls should be reduced and capped to rounded sums of money. i.e. \u00a35 cars \u00a310 vans \u00a315 lorries.  Also bigger discounts should be given to frequent users. The current tolls are causing huge queues of traffic to build up as time is taken to give people their change. The credit card payment scheme is also causing traffic to queue as people have to wait whilst the transaction is verified. A dedicated lane should be put in place for this type of transaction. These steps are needed in order to reduce the CO2 emissions from all the cars which are now stopped there on a daily basis.",
