        "additional_details": "Many illnesses and conditions, including psychological mood and anxiety disorders and physical muscular skeletal disorders, lead to a lifetime of suffering that cannot currently be resolved by orthodox medicine. Many patients become a lifetime burden to themselves, and to their family and workplace, with increased and permanent costs to society including sickness and disability benefits. We petition that medical doctors should always attempt to resolve a patients problems first; however, as soon as doctors suggest they probably cannot improve a patient\u2019s symptoms further, six sessions of complementary therapies be offered free \u2013 with records kept for example of triangulated case study research to see if a patient who was likely to be on a lifetime of sickness or disablement benefits is able to return to work, or have reduced symptoms or improved quality of life, and thus be of benefit to their family and society with the potential for millions of pounds in cost benefits to government.",
