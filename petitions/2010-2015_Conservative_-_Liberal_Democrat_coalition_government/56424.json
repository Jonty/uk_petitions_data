As such, the interrogative question 'whats in it?' should not be asked. It should be reworded to be more human rights friendly such as 'are the contents of your parcel/s any of the items outlined in the prohibited items/dangerous goods list?'\r\n\r\nHuman rights to privacy are being violated with the implementation of the new rule. This needs to be addressed.\r\n\r\n",
