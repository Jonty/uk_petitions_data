        "additional_details": "Despite having BS EN compliance safety clothing for motorcyclists attracts full rate VAT.\r\nThis tax deters motorcyclists from investing in products that may save their life or reduce the severity of an accident.\r\nEach motoring fatality is calculated as costing \u00a31.78M.\r\nMotorcycle helmets that meet 25 year old standards are VAT free but the latest inflatable safety over jackets that meet standards established in 2013 are not.\r\nHMRC simply state that their formal instruction in Public Notice 701/23 does not to allow a dispensation.\r\nOur petition is for this notice to be quickly amended to reflect product developments and to seek to reduce the physical and public cost of motorcycling accidents and fatalities.",
