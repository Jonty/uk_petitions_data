        "additional_details": "I would like the British Government to bring back capital punishment for child murderers. People who do not want capital punishment brought back into the criminal court system argue this because they say that 'we live in a civilised society'. My counter argument to this is that if we 'lived in a civilised society' then murders would not take place in the first place. Child murders happen because dominant adults or in some cases children murder a child because there is no deterrent and they know that even if they are put through the court process then they will receive menial punishment.  We also now have DNA testing which has significantly improved the proof of guilt.",
