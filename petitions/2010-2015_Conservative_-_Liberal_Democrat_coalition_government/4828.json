And every firm is in a supply chain ultimately to meet the demands of real people: the end consumers with cash to spend out of their real earnings: their take home pay. It is the individual consumers that, by their purchases, support the whole hierarchy of commerce. Clearly, the real burden of taxation falls entirely on the consumer, who is subject to the same effective sales tax, be he rich or poor.\r\n\r\nSo-called \"taxpayers\" in the supply chain are merely unwitting intermediaries in the collection of tax from consumers.\r\n\r\nRecognising true earnings as current net pay, VAT as the only tax would bring:\r\n- Cheaper food by completely tax exempt supply\r\n- Greater individual and corporate enterprise\r\n- Cheaper exports\r\n- Inward investment of foreign companies\r\n- Increasing GDP and employment\r\n- Full transparency and simplification of the tax system with lower\r\n\tcollection costs",
