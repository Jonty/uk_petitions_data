        "additional_details": "The Government are making so many cut backs to cut our borrowing deficit etc, without any statistics on the amount of immigrants using & abusing our Benefits, NHS & Housing systems - If the figures were revealed they would shock but not surprise the majority of British people - The savings Britain could make would be huge, rather than cutting public sector jobs and others, including one-sided cut backs for most others. Take away all the plus sides for the immigrants then they wouldn't come here & abuse our system that the genuine British people have paid for.\r\nI'd like the Government to publish accurate figures on the above, including those lost in the system who are never counted, and stop all the above for all immigrants; the savings gained should then go back into Britain not keeping the majority of immigrants.",
