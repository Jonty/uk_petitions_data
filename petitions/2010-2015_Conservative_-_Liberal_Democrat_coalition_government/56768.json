All of the interviewees that did not attend were unemployed. We wasted time waiting for the non attendants over several days. I believe that they only have to prove to the Job Centre that they are actively looking for work. I think they should have to prove that they have gone for interviews and what the outcome was or lose benefit, not just write down a list in a book to show what jobs they have applied for.Anyone can do that.",
