        "additional_details": "Rather than expand Heathrow, Gatwick or build a new airport in the Thames Estuary, why not expand Birmingham Airport instead?\r\n\r\nBirmingham is already an International airport and has the added benefit of being the center of the country.\r\n\r\nExpanding Birmingham would provide a significant stimulus to the local and wider economy. Coupled with the proposed HS2 rail link there is a real opportunity to build something that would benefit the whole country and in particular Midlands. It could even be pivotal in helping re-balance the Economy towards manufacturing.\r\n\r\nBeing the historic engineering heart of the country, a stimulus like this is just what is needed to regenerate the industrial heartland of the UK and build a sustainable future for all.\r\n\r\n",
