The animals are not killed in a humane way and for 60 to 90 seconds before the animal finally dies it remains in excruciating pain, whilst being petrified. It is an abomination that this occurs in this country and I along with many other of its citizens have no desire to eat meat that has been killed like this.\r\n",
