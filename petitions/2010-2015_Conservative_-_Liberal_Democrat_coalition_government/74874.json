        "additional_details": "Recently, a Sussex police officer was removed from duty for wearing a Union Flag patch with a 'thin blue line' through it.  This patch shows support for the families of fallen police officers and should be supported - not called 'offensive' by police hierarchy.  Through further research it has emerged that some the uniform in several forces do not show the Union Flag at all.\r\n\r\nPolice officers should be allowed to wear the Union Flag and/or a charity Union Flag on their uniform whilst on Duty.  The Government must look at protecting this.  The Government must also look into why some supervising officers believe showing support for fallen comrades may be seen as offensive.\r\n\r\nSee link below for background information.
