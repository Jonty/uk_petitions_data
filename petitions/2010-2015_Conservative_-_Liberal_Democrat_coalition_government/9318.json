        "additional_details": "I would like the goverment to consider bringing back National Service for all School leavers or those who drop out early and commit crimes. This would give those young people in society a sense of respect and manners that seem to have been lost in this generation of children. This would also keep them off our streets. Right now there is a total disregard for the police or the courts as they know they can get away with almost anything. We are having to see our heroic armed services brought back in coffins defending our right to freedom. And all the trouble caused by the youth of today is how they thank them.\r\n\r\nSo if like me you want to see justice served and not feel fear when walking past a gang of youths sign up and let them fight for their country not against it.\r\n",
