        "additional_details": "Penalising Big plc that outsources to EU or non-EU countries would be protectionism.\r\nPerhaps it is better to ensure that a proportion of the outsourcing profits/revenue lost to another country is retained in the UK for the advantage of UK plc. The retained value should then be used by Big plc to buy Assets ie Guilts or shares in the semi-privatised banks from UK plc. The benefit to the UK is that the Assets' value can be used to reduce the Sovereign Debt; and so assist in keeping the UK interest rates down; and ease the UK recovery. The Assets so bought would have to be retained for a 'to be decided' term. Big plc would effectively have a zero corporation tax on the outsourcing profits/revenue lost. If the Assets are sold before the term end then corporation tax becomes due. If Big plc decides that a better ROI can be achieved then the Assets could be used as collateral to borrow from a UK bank, thus allowing flexibility to Big plc and boosting the UK bank liquidity.",
