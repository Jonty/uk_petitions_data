Yet the local authority are being lead by certain minority interest groups who oppose the development.\r\nI know so many people who are in favour of the new cinema and lifestyle centres, yet cannot make there voices or opinions heard. I am proposing this e-petition so that the local MP's are forced to back the develeopments and listen to the local populace, rather than the small groups of 10 people who will oppose any development.",
