        "additional_details": "Since the privatisation of the gas and electricity industries, the consumer has been affected by ever increasing energy bills.\r\nPrivatisation was promoted to the British public as a means of giving the consumer greater choice, enabling them to select the energy provider who offered the best deal.\r\nIt now transpires that these energy companies operate as a cartel, tell us that the cost of energy is so high that bills need to increase and make appropriating the lowest energy bills one of the most complicated and under-publicised issues of today.\r\nWhilst they tell us in one breath that bills must increase to meet cost, in the next they tell us that they are making billions in profit every year.\r\nThey have no interest in the consumer, save to provide an energy supply at maximal cost.\r\nThe time has come to stop their profiteering from all classes of society and hand control of our energy and it's costs back to the state.",
