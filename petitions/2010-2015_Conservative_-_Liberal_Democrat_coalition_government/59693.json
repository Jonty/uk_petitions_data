The volunteers have brought their knowledge and given their time to raising visitor interest related to something that is a profound part of our recent heritage. They should not have been treated publically in such a manner as effectively being dismissed on Camera. We as a Nation owe so much to those people of Bletchley Park from WW11 and some of those volunteers who now keep alive the importance of what was achieved there. Please sign to acknowledge the importance of the Volunteers which is Governments Policy.",
