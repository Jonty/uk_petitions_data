        "additional_details": "We the undersigned British citizens of the United Kingdom and her Overseas Territories petition The Secretary of State to retain HMS Illustrious in active service until a Queen Elizabeth class carrier is brought into service.\r\n\r\nHMS Illustrious is the UK\u2019s High Readiness and Commando Carrier; one of the core components of the Royal Navy\u2019s amphibious fleet.  She is involved in multinational operations, escort missions, commemorative events, intense periods of training, and counter-piracy operations.  She and her company of heroic personnel are ready to deploy with just five days of notice, as part of the Reaction Force Task Group.  In her absence, Britain would be left without a carrier for 6 years, which we feel is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nWe respectfully request a review into the decision to decommission HMS Illustrious and ask for her to be kept in service, until one of the new aircraft carriers begins its new role.  HMS Ocean is not to be compromised by this request.",
