It is actually tresspassing.\r\n\r\nIt is utter, disgusting filth and carries disease.  Cats faeces can be very harmful to pregnant women and it carries disease - this is aside from the stench.  Some people have to check over their gardens before allowing small children to play in their very own gardens.\r\nNobody should have their property violated in this way with disgusting, disease ridden filth.\r\n\r\nGoverment needs to step in and outline some laws governing the ownership of ALL animals....\r\nCats should not be let out of their own houses and gardens unless on a lead and trained to use their own garden or litter tray.  Fines should be enforced for fouling outside of these confines.\r\n\r\n",
