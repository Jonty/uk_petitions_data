Over a billion \u00a3's could be raised by the exchequer in these tough times, and it could help reinforce the idea 'we are all in this together', rather than allowing the very rich a way of avoiding a tax everybody else has to pay.\r\nAs property prices in these areas is always increasing, it seems there are no shortage of buyers, so it is doubtful if anybody rich enough to buy these expensive properties, would be put off by this tax",
