        "additional_details": "The govenment should scrap vat on all products made and sold in the uk, this would in the short term cost the treasury but in the long term manufacturing output in the uk would increase dramaticaly as all british made products would have a 20 % advantage on imported goods and with increased manufacturing competition should be created in the uk with foriegn companys moving/increasing manufacturing here, low/semi skilled work would increase damaticaly and prices should drop as a result, increasing the potential for the same companies to increase there exports and bring in even more money.  There should however be tight restrictions to ensure no loop holes, only products 100%made here to be included.",
