        "additional_details": "Until February 2014 when Wokingham Borough Council redrew the settlement boundaries the field next to my property was designated \"countryside\".\r\n\r\n50% of the field is in Flood Zone 2, it is home to Great Crested Newts, access to the site is limited and via an unclassified road used by schoolchildren and yet the Council has designated the site to build 29 houses.  Bellway currently has an open application (F/2014/0704) to build these houses.  Previous planning applications were refused (O/2010/1621) due to flood risks, access issues, density, not in keeping with surrounding properties, destroying countryside, effect on protected species of Great Crested Newts amongst others.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and stop the government allowing local authorities to change land designation which is increasing flood risks and destroying our countryside and wildlife.
