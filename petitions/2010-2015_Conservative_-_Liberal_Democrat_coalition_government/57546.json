        "additional_details": "The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has to make emergency savings of \u00a31.4 billion (out of a total budget of \u00a313 billion). The UK currently spends just 0.65% of its GDP on science research funding, which has already had to cope with a 10% real terms cut due to the flat cash settlements awarded annually since 2011. The Dept. for BIS promised to \"ring fence\" the science budget from any future cuts. In the light of this recent news, we call upon the Dept. for BIS to make a public statement that it will continue to stand by this commitment.",
