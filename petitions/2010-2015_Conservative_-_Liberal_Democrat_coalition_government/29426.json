        "additional_details": "Enfield Council are about to outlaw the dsigusting habit of spitting in public. It blights streets all over London and makes areas very unatractive to visitors and residents.\r\n\r\nWith the Olympics coming in the summer, Stratford will be welcoming many new visitors. Should they and locals have to walk with their eyes on the ground in order to dodge spit and other material?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-16985480\r\n\r\nVisit the link above to see how Enfield are tackling the problem and encourage Newham to do the same.",
