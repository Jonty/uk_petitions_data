        "additional_details": "Legal documents in the UK currently only recognise two binary genders - 'male' and 'female'. However, there are many people who identify as something other than those, and are therefore of a non-binary gender. Australia and New Zealand (among others) accept these with their extra option on passports which is simply 'X' for unspecified, and it's time for the UK to join them.\r\n\r\nInternet giants such as Google and Facebook also allow 'other' options, with Facebook now allowing a custom gender option so that the user can select their identity in particular.\r\n\r\nPeople other than men and women (agender, genderfluid, bigender, genderqueer, etc.) deserve to be recognised by HM Government. Brighton & Hove Council have recently accepted 'Mx' as a gender neutral title, and this was a positive and successful change in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for a gender option other than 'male' and 'female' to be available to anyone who requires it on all legal documents and records.
