        "additional_details": "2,000 overseas non-EU students are being forced to abandon their studies at London Metropolitan University, following a decision by the UK Border Agency that the university has failed to meet certain commitments. Many of those students have put genuine faith in the UK education system, and have invested considerable time, effort and fees into their courses. They risk deportation unless they can find an alternative institution to sponsor their studies within 60 days. This decision by the UKBA is detrimental to the worldwide reputation of British education, and promotes a draconian image of UK immigration policy in which legitimate visitors are deported suddenly though no fault of their own. We call on the Home Office to consider the plight of those affected students, and to assure prospective student visa applicants that they will not be removed prematurely from the UK.",
