Organisations whose main objective is achieving as much profit as possible at any cost are not going to approve multi million \u00a3 donations if it is will not result in greater profit margins later on by changing certain current laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nIn the age of social medias and the internet showing its true potential, wasting millions on staged and redundant and elaborate tours of the country and conferences which make little to no effect on the vast majority of the public's final decision. We need to reform our system to have each political party receive a set fund from the treasury for their election campaigns, with equal and further extended media exposure in set debates and Q&As where they can each propose their policies without gimmicks, in conjunction with use of the internet and social media .\r\n",
