        "additional_details": "A divorced father who pays for his children and complies with CSA payment calculations is not treated fairly. This amount is not deducted as money he does not have when any tax or benefits is calculated for him or his new family. The single mother however who receives this money does not have to declare it when her benefits or tax allowances are made. It is not a fair system and should be the same calculations for both. Please sign this petition to make it a fairer  system for fathers who no longer live with their  children, in some cases no fault of there own. Please help stop this injustice. ",
