        "additional_details": "Food and drink retailers and supermarkets are refusing to sell alcohol to adults (18+) when accompanied by children (under 18).\r\n\r\nThis is refusing adults the right to purchase alcohol when with their children/siblings. They are using the 'Challenge 25' policy too much and taking it too far.\r\n\r\nThey are assuming that adults are purchasing the alcohol for their children, siblings or friends. This is unacceptable and adults are having their rights denied from them.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, under 18's are allowed to drink alcoholic beverages with consent of parents/guardians in their own home so this contradicts itself.\r\n\r\nThe government need to stop retailers doing this immediately.",
