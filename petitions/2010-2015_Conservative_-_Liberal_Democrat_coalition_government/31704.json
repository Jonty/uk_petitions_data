Clarification is required regarding protection from UV rays during school hours. Currently schools in England do not follow a standard policy and therefore there is no uniformity or clear directives.\r\n\r\nThis petition by the charity the British Skin Foundation (BSF) calls for a debate in the House of Commons to seek clarification that would establish a policy on the administration of any skin protection procedure for children during school hours.",
