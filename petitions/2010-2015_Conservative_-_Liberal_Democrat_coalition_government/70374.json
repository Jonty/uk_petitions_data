        "additional_details": "On October 3, according to various news, HK protesters were attacked by Thugs and Triads, and HK police connived to let them continue to perform anti-social behaviours, causing harm to the society.\r\n\r\nVarious media has photo and video evidences showing those Triad members co-op with HK Police.\r\n\r\nHKFS and Scholarism condemned the strategies from the Government and closed talks with the Goverment after the incident. Violence continues.\r\n\r\nWe, as the HK citizens believe CY Leung is associated with the incidents and suspect he has close connections with Triads. But the HK Police is now corrupted (co-op with Triads), thus they will not do any arrest and investigation work on him.\r\n\r\nWe want the Home Office, for justice and border safety, we demand:\r\n\r\n1. Arrest of CY Leung, when he cross the UK Border, and keep him in custody.\r\n2. Send him to Interpol for further investigations.",
