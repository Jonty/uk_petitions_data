        "additional_details": "Over the last 18 years APD has grown from an orgninal \u00a35 for flights to European cities and \u00a310 for everywhere else, to now being \u00a312-\u00a326 for flying to Europe and up to \u00a3188. To fly everywhere else.  Is this fair on us? Although the tax does bring an estimated \u00a32.7billion into the treasury. Is it doing more harm than good, and why do we have the Highest APD in Europe?\r\n\r\nAsk yourself, should it be better? Should it be more fair?\r\n\r\nSign this petition if you want to make your holidays cheaper and if you want to see this country flourish.\r\n",
