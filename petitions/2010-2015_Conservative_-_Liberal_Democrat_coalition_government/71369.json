You ask them to delete the picture, but they refuse. Is this legal? Yes, they have the right to take a picture of your child, without your consent and keep it.\r\n\r\nYou ring the police, they speak to the person. They still refuse to delete the picture. Is this legal? Yes. Still perfectly legal.\r\n\r\nHow is this acceptable?\r\n\r\nWe propose no person is allowed to take a picture of a minor without parental or guardian consent. It's that simple.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want pictures of your children taken by strangers, and used in whatever way they wish...we ask you to sign our petition.\r\n",
