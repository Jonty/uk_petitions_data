'They are collecting all this data about me for them to analysis my shopping habits why can't I do the same?'\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be great if we could:\r\n\r\n- Analyse what food and drink we buy now and suggest healthier alternatives\r\n- See how much alcohol we drink so we can cut down\r\n- See when we buy cigarettes so we can improve our will-power and give up\r\n- Merge details of how much petrol we buy with our GPS data to use less fuel and release less CO2\r\n\r\nThese are just the examples I've come up with. With access to our data (via APIs where we control who can and can't use our data) we can allow others to make great tools to make lives better.\r\n\r\nFreeing our data will make our lives and society better.\r\n\r\nDear Government, ensure Nectar and Tesco Clubcard free our data.",
