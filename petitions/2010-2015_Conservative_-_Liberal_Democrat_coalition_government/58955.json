        "additional_details": "It is now more widely understood that sugar is a major factor in obesity and diseases such as heart disease and diabetes, as well as contributing to tooth decay.\r\n\r\nMost recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) is reportedly considering cutting the amount of sugar it recommends in our daily diet to half the current limit - from 10% of our daily calories, to just 5%. However, with added sugar being hidden in a multitude of packaged foods, it is becoming increasingly difficult to reduce sugar intake in an easy and sustainable way.\r\n\r\nLegislation should be put in place by the Government to limit the amount of sugar and sweeteners added to packaged food and drink in the UK.",
