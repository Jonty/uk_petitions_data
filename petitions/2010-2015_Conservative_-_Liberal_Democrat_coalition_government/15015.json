A children\u2019s contract exploring what would happen to the child in the event of the parents separating or early death of one or both parents would form the basis of the Child's Contract and the funding for the child\u2019s wellbeing would be determined according to the circumstances of the parents.\r\nWith so many children being denied access to the people they love, children need these decisions taken about them before they are born, so that the eventualities that can happen in the life of a child are written and enshrined in law.\r\n\r\n",
