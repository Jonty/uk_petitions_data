We would also argue that receiving regular monthly payments would be beneficial to the HMRC's cash flow, too.  Businesses can already make PAYE payment to HMRC on a monthly basis; why not VAT?\r\n\r\nMore than ever, UK businesses need all the support they can get to remain not only profitable but to maintain liquidity, so that they can continue to pay salaries and support the recovery of the UK economy.  Please stop crippling UK businesses by insisting on collecting quarterly VAT payments. ",
