        "additional_details": "The public need access to laws that force greater parental accountability following years of violent crimes committed by children, including vandalism, assaults and thefts. The US and Canada allows parents to be sued for the  actions of their children, and its time UK citizens had this route to compensation.\r\nParents should be held financially responsible for all expenses associated with misuse of emergency services, damage done to property, and injuries directly attributed to the child.\r\nLegislation needs to be detailed, but easier than the existing method of coaxing parents to become litigation friends. Consideration may be given to capping compensation in recognition of other factors contributing to a childs behaviour.",
