        "additional_details": "Chichester District Council is on the verge of granting planning permission for 500 houses on Old Place Farm in Westhampnett. This village consists of 350 homes and will be swamped by this proposal. It takes away the green buffer zone of farmland once designated as a  green break between Chichester City and the village of Westhampnett. The village has suffered with insufficient drainage and inadequate road surfaces for many years with effluent rising in peoples gardens. The developers say there are several major employment opportunities in the area which is true but they are not hiring and who can absorb 1000 people. The truth is the new home owners will have to travel much further afield to find work and this will over tax a road system that is suffering now. Please help us by adding your support to this petition, requesting the Government to intervene with the District Council and reduce the housing numbers allocated to this area, it is our last chance to save our village.
