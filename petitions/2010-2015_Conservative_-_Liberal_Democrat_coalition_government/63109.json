        "additional_details": "The current law on playing poker in a pub states:\r\n\r\n\"Low stakes poker is permitted in pubs as long as stakes are kept below \u00a35 a head and \u00a3100 per premises per day. A significant number of poker leagues operate legitimate low stakes poker around the country but there is some evidence of restrictions being breached.\"\r\n\r\nWe are petitioning to change this law to the following:\r\n\r\n\"Low stakes poker is permitted in pubs as long as stakes are kept below \u00a320 a head Maximum.\"\r\n\r\nWe believe that this change to the law would not only breath new life into the UK amateur poker scene but would also benefit the UK pubs who are struggling in the current financial climate. Pubs in the UK are closing down at around a number of 50 per week in the UK, they need every assistance that can be offered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
