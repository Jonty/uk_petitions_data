        "additional_details": "Every year at least 50 people are killed when a deranged person the police already knew about murders their target. Remember that vicar who had to defend himself against a well-known lunatic with nothing but a child's toy? How many ex-partners kill every year? Ever had a stalker?\r\n\r\nPepper sprays are non-lethal and no one will come to permanent harm. The attacker can be prevented from approaching their target and can be apprehended when the police, eventually, show up - then taken away and prosecuted or treated.\r\n\r\nIf you trust the police to protect you, go sign something else. If you are already familiar with their  customer service standards, and don't want to risk your life on the offchance they've improved any, you'll probably want to sign!\r\n",
