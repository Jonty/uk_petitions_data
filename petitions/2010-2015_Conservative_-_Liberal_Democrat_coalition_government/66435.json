        "additional_details": "Property prices are tipped to rise by 35% by 2020 and currently and the number of people renting is rising. This needs to stop.\r\n\r\nWhy we need to stop this ?\r\n\r\nSecurity of housing, not wasting your money on rent, Access to housing, stopping the rich poor divide.\r\n\r\nWhy is it happening?\r\n\r\nMany high earners purchase several properties and have turned the housing market into a housing 'Market'. Purchasing houses and renting them out to make more money, preventing new and current buyers from purchasing a house.\r\n\r\nWhat will stop this?\r\n\r\nThere are two approaches we can take:\r\n\r\nLaw - we can restrict the number of properties that one person can own.\r\n\r\nTax - We can implement a tax system whereby the more properties you own the more tax you pay and the level should be high enough to make it financially redundant.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want a country where future generations can actually purchase a house, then please sign this petition.\r\n\r\n",
