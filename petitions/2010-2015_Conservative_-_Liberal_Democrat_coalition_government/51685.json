It provides an excellent environment in modern buildings purpose built for the elderly, staffed by a dedicated and caring team. It must remain open.\r\n\r\nit is an example of local, dedicated dementia and mental health services for the elderly and rather than being closed, should be an example of how this service should be run. If this facility is closed it will be the tip of the iceberg for similar services around the country.\r\n\r\nwe call on Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust to reverse their decision and keep Altham Meadows open.",
