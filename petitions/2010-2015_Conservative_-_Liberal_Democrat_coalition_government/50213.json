        "additional_details": "The petitioners believe that the Rotarix vaccine should not be added to the UK Routine Childhood Vaccination Programme due to it: not being cost-effective for the UK, and therefore being a mismanagement of public money; having more risks than benefits for many UK babies and relying on uninformed consent from most parents.\r\n\r\nThe Petitioners request that the House of Commons prevents the routine introduction of the Rotarix vaccine in July 2013; also we urge the Government to only advise use of this vaccine to high risk targeted groups and only offers it to other parents, without pressurising them, on an \u2018opt in-signed consent\u2019 basis. This must be accompanied with a full fact/information sheet that must be signed to confirm full comprehension before the vaccine is administered to ensure full informed consent.",
