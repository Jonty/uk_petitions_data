        "additional_details": "If a person who has no previous convictions commits criminal assault then they get charged with a caution. I am petitioning for this to be changed to at least a fixed penalty fine, or community hours, or a combination of both. This will hopefully deter people from committing such a heinous crime, and think twice about their actions. After my mother was assaulted in an unprovoked attack, and the person charged with common assault, she felt unjustly treated by the justice system, when the punishment was a caution. Her injuries were extensive, but there were no broken bones. If the punishment were to change, then hopefully it would prevent the disappointment happening to anybody again, and significantly reduce cases of common assault.",
