Corporation Tax revenues stand to be lost, along with Job cuts and the effect on local communities where Astra Zeneca has offices / plants.\r\n\r\nIf Astra has to be sold, a British suitor must be found and any EU \"issues\" must be vetoed down.\r\n\r\nAstra is the latest in a long line of British Crown Jewels that stand to be sold to foreign companies.\r\n\r\nPharmaceuticals lie at the heart of the UK's future innovations strategy and must remain so.
