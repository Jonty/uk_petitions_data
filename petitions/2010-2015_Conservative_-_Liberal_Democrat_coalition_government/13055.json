This will have a detrimental affect on the economy as people are forced to give up working and paying tax.\r\n\r\nMany now have to make the decision to stop working as it is just no longer a financially viable option.\r\n\r\nProposal: Increase Child care vouchers to an entitlement per child and increase their value to help support working families.\r\n",
