        "additional_details": "This is to bring in your kind attention that the Iltaf Hussain who is the Leader of Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM), is involved in target killing of innocent people, spreading sectarian violence and fear within the Karachi and Hyderabad. This all violence is controlled by MQM's founder and leader Mr Iltaf Hussain who is a British Citizen from his headquarters in London. Through this petition, I would like UK Government to play its role to stop these inhuman activities by MQM especially stopping Mr Hussain addressing to people in the Pakistan over the video link. Not long ago I was threatened by MQM party member in London over internet for saying the truth.\r\n\r\nToday, there was a Rangers = Pakistan army raid at MQM's Pakistan Headquarters in Karachi, where Rangers have found and arrested 9 individuals wanted for murders, kidnapping, torture for ransom along with Amir khan who is currently a party leader and not only that, Rangers have also found missing NATO weapons in MQM office.",
