I believe the current structure is inadequate to reform and a new ethnic minority policing force should be formed and established independently. Using the blueprint of the current structure of policing as a base in the assessment and evaluation of the development of the new policing force working along side with the support of local communities. Promoting a more diverse job role. The current measures are not cohesive enough for the tax money spent they do not justify a more robust an accountable or accommodating service if anything it is often rude offensive and at times in violation of basic human decency and dignity. The sub standard is just unjustifiable for our progression as a nation.\r\n",
