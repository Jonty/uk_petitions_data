        "additional_details": "As of September 28th 2014, the political situation in Hong Kong has reached a new level of urgency. Police used violence on unarmed students who were peacefully protesting for democracy by occupying a district of Hong Kong. They have used tear gas, started arresting students and searching their homes, and now may even be bringing out rubber bullets. A major lead up to this was China announcing that HK people would not have total electoral rights and instead, can only vote for their Chief Executive within a set number of 2-3 candidates pre-chosen by Beijing. It is time for Britain to respond and step up to their responsibilities as the third party in the handover, and defend the rights of Hong Kong people, or at least condemn mainland China's violent methods in handling the situation. We don't wish to deny HK as a part of China, but it is our right to choose who will lead our future. Please respond to the promises that you made and prevent further violence.",
