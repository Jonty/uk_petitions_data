A clone is basically an identical twin with the same genetic makeup (hardware), albeit different degrees of experiences (software). Genes does not code for multitude complex behaviours as they are learned from experience on interaction with one\u2019s genetic made-up. Genes (nature) interact with the prevailing circumstances and experiences (nurture). For example, if Einstein was cloned today he will have the benefit of computers unlike in the early 20th century.",
