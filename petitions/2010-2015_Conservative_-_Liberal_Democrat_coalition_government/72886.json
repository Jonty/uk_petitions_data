        "additional_details": "As motorway driving is not practically covered in a standard driving test, many drivers - new and old - do not follow the highway code when driving on motorways. Many drivers simply enter the motorway and immediatley pull into the middle lane and/or outer lane and sit there (whether they are overtaking or not) causing additional and un-necessary traffic build up on UK Motorways.\r\n\r\nDrivers should have to undergo a driving test to get an accreditation that they can competently drive on UK Motorways and understand that the motorway has one main lane and two overtaking lanes. This accreditation can go on their driving licence now alongside the vehicles that they are licenced to drive.",
