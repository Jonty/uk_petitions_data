We call on the Department for Culture, Media & Sport - Select Committee to STOP the owners of Leeds United F.C. from selling our football club to a private company controlled by a twice convicted foreign criminal; we call on the authorities to help Leeds United to return the club to its loyal supporters, responsible benefactors and prudent ownership.  We demand better regulation, governance, transparency and social inclusion from the controlling football authorities to protect supporters.\r\n\r\n",
