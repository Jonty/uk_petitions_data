        "additional_details": "This week, 'The Mirror' have published a video of 'NHS sponger' Josie Cunningham attempting to justify her poor reason for going ahead with an abortion next week, at 18 weeks.The father of her child is unknown. (During this interview she also had a cigarette in hand, and talks about her 10 a day habit and alcohol consumption during the pregnancy.)\r\nShe goes on to say that the opportunity she has to go on Big Brother is worth more than her unborn child's life.\r\nJosie states that her final decision is based on the breakdown of negotiations with Channel 5 to appear on the reality TV show.\r\nJosie's reasons for an abortion fall outside the NHS guidelines and the 1967 abortion act.\r\nTo terminate a pregnancy at 18 weeks along, for the sole reason of appearing on a reality programme is just immoral. What kind of message will be broadcast to teenage girls across the nation that will be watching this programme?\r\n\r\n",
