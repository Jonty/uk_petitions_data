        "additional_details": "Small Independent Film Makers in the UK struggle to budget their films and compete with too few distributors. The Internet has opened up Streaming Video & Video On Demand enabling film makers to distribute online directly.\r\n\r\nA film rating certificate currently costs 750,00 pound minimum. How is this justified? Pay 3 people \u00a325.00 an hour to watch a 2 hour film and charge 225 pounds instead. Better still, allow Independent Film Makers to rate their own films and fine them if they break the rules.\r\n\r\nThis one move would help UK Film Makers to launch their films themselves and bring increased revenue into the UK.",
