        "additional_details": "We the undersigned are asking for the inequality in the way Personal Independent Payment (PIP) claims are handled to be stopped and for those making transfers from Disability Living Allowance (DLA) to PIP to be treated in the same way as fresh claims for PIP.  Currently those making claims for PIP have their payments backdated to date of claim.  However those receiving DLA do not get their claim backdated even if a change of circumstance means they are entitled to a higher rate of payment.  Payments are made from date of decision, meaning current delays, which the DWP admit to, mean claimants losing out on several weeks payments, depending on the length of delay and time to process a claim.  This goes against what the DWP themselves have said in response to questions from Susan Elan Jones MP i.e. '...the benefit is backdated so NO ONE is left out of pocket'.  The current system is in no way equitable and victimises the most vulnerable in society, the long term disabled.",
