Exceptions for car parking ticket requirements are for stays which only last for 20 minutes, which is too short a period of time.\r\n\r\nHospitals should not have the right to charge people to park there, whether visiting a friend or relative or through admission.\r\n\r\nFines should also be abolished for those who do park and do not display a valid ticket at a hospital.\r\n\r\nGoing to a Hospital is not a privilege or an enjoyment, and the government should not be allowed to allow people to have to pay to visit a hospital.
