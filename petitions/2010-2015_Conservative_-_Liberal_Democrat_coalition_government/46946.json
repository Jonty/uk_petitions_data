        "action": "Cover up Tabloid papers in shop displays - in the same way that pornographic magaizines are - and make them 'top shelf' items",
        "additional_details": "We would like the government to pass legislation that effectively bans the sale of tabloid newspapers - unless they are suitably covered up - in a manner similar to the way that pornographic magazines are sold. It's time to stop exposing our children to the daily diet of hate, predjudice, lies, sexual exploitation and propoganda that these publications put out. Sign this petition if you agree and would like to see tabloids as 'top shelf' items only",
