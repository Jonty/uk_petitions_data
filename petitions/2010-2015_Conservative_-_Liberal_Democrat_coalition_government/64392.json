        "additional_details": "Stephen Sutton should be Knighted for his work to raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trust, despite being terminally-ill.  He created a bucket list which he wanted to complete before he died but has refused money to help him complete this, instead electing to request support for the Teenage Cancer Trust, to this end he has skydived, bungee jumped, learnt to juggle, ridden a Segway and even got a tattoo. His energy, love of living and strength to fight his illness has inspired people across the UK and around the world.  As such I feel he is the definition of someone who should be honoured, making achievements in public life and committed himself to serving and helping Britain.",
