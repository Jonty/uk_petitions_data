This includes updating and upgrading the current UK servers and connection speeds across the country. Especially those in Rural areas, with outdated technologies. E.g. Lincolnshire\r\n\r\nRural areas and other regions with poor broadband speeds shouldn't be left alone to suffer. Some having less the 1Mbps; this is NOT good enough.\r\n\r\nHaving 3Mbps as a standard across the UK, would help improve everyone including those who have more than 3Mbps. ",
