A society where the old are respected for their outstanding contributions in the development of mankind, safe, protected, housed, clothed and cared for free of abuse. A society where our young and old are first priority not objects, statistics, victims of society or last in line. A society where our young and old are our main priority, the people who have helped to make us and shape us. A society where we give back to those who give us purpose when eyes can see no bridges across broken roads. A society where we look after each other because we all share the same reality if we like it or sometimes not. A society where we are not mentally broken with the financial burden of corrupt systems. A society where all people can smile and be happy not just a minority.",
