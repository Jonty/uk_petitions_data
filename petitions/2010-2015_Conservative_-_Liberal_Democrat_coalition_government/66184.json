        "additional_details": "With our roads getting busier and the nations health getting worse, it makes utter sense to allow people to take part in leisure and sporting activities which improve the countries well-being, wealth, and freedom. But due to a serious lack of off-road cycle routes, it can be almost impossible for many cyclists to find somewhere to ride other than on our very busy and often dangerous roads.\r\n\r\nTherefore I propose that a network of national off-road cycle routes be created by simply allowing people to use the currently unused 1000s of miles of public footpaths.  If we can forcibly concrete over our countryside to allow a multi-billion pound train to pass through it, then surely, forcing landowners to allow cyclists to use footpaths will have benefits almost too numerous to mention.\r\n\r\nThis could potentially save the country billions in heath bills, whilst vastly improving the nation  opportunities to better health and wealth.",
