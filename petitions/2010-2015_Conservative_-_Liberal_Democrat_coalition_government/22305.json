        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition Parliament to make the act of squatting illegal. The Land Registration Act 2002 considerably reduced the scope of adverse possession and squatters' rights. However, the doctrine conveys considerable injustice by enabling squatters' to occupy and later lay claim to the title of property belonging to others. Evicting squatters' can be a costly and traumatic  process for landowners. It is time to abolish this age old doctrine, which has little place in our society.",
