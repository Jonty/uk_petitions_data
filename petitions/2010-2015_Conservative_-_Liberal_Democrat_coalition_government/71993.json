In the wet it is very slippery and as it is on a corner in both directions. represents a danger  to motorcyclists, due to both it's construction and the layout of the roads. this is because it is either on an exit of a roundabout or in the other direction joined by another road.\r\n\r\nwe petition the government to address this dangerous issue, by removal of the cattle grid, adding a grip surface, or road re alignment.",
