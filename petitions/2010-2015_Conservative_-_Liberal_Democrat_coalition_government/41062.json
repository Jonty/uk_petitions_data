You see plenty of leaflets in hospitals about heart disease and different cancers, BUT NOTHING ABOUT EPILEPSY!!! 1 in 131 people in the UK have epilepsy.\r\nIf someone has epilepsy they need to know the dangers and that's why i call on the government to create an awareness campaign for national Epilepsy week to put the disease in the spotlight.",
