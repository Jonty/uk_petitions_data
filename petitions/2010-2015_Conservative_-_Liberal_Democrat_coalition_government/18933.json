        "additional_details": "Every day men, women and children are trafficked into and within the UK, experiencing slavery, rape, desperation and fear. Some vulnerable victims are identified and helped by Government and charities; however, due to a flawed system, an untold number are improperly detained in prisons and detention centres. These individuals were lied to and harmed in the UK, but instead of focusing on arresting and prosecuting the criminals who trafficked and exploited them, many who also committed other crimes in our communities across the UK, the Government continues to put victims in prisons and detention centres. Their crimes? Over 95% of Poppy Project clients in detention or prison lost their freedom because a trafficker gave them a fake passport; others stole food to survive \u2013 crimes that only happened because they were trafficked here.\r\nWe call on the Government to ensure that anyone who may be a victim of trafficking is properly identified and freed from unfair detention or incarceration.",
