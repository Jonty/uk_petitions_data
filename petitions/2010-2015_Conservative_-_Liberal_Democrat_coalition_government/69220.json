        "additional_details": "On 31st October 2011 my son Oliver, who I am the genetic father of, died in the care of stoke Mandeville hospital due to 28 counts of negligence, which the staff involved tried to cover up. I had found out about all this by walking into shop and seeing a picture of Oliver on front of local paper, I have asked for the details of what happened but been refused as the mother had lied to me and not put my name on birth certificate. The head of Bucks nhs, Anne Eden, has refused me this information as my name is not on birth cert., or even an apology from them, all I got was her give me \u00a320 and told to treat myself. Does my emotions and love for my son count for nothing in this country, is it not time the law is changed so people like myself and my family don't have to go through extra emotional distress at an already difficult time, to get the answers we ask. I hope you agree that the law needs to be changed in this matter. Thankyou.",
