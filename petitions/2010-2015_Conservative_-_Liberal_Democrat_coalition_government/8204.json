        "additional_details": "Given the current state of our economy, general lawlessness and over-stretched armed forces,I propose to introduce compulsory National Service for those not attending university at 18 years of age.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for this is that there is a generation of disaffected youths, with too much time on their hands, very few opportunities and even less discipline.\r\n\r\nNational Service could provide this discipline, along with vocational training that would enable them to enter the workforce after a minimum period of 2-3 years, allowing them to contribute to our society and economy.\r\n\r\nThey could perform non-combat military tasks at a low cost (apprentice wages), thereby allowing our military budget to be effectively deployed.",
