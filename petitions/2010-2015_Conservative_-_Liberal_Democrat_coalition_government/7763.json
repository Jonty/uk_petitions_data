Communicating with your child is a basic right, but many families are not getting the support they need to learn British Sign Language. Sign language courses vary throughout the UK in regards to availability and price.\r\n\r\nIt is unacceptable that parents of deaf children who wish to learn sign language are not getting the help they need to communicate with their child.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, are calling on the Department for Education to roll out family sign language classes for families of deaf children, and to incorporate national standards on sign language support in family services, early years settings, schools and further and higher education in any forthcoming special education needs legislation.",
