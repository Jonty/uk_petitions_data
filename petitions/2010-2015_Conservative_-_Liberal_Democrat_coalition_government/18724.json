        "additional_details": "The Bank of England should use QE2 to stimulate the economy directly by lending the money to businesses to increase investment and thereby create sustainable private sector jobs. The newly employed will not only be paying tax but will also increase consumption spending. This will in turn drive the economy forward. All the banks are doing with the money is re- building their asset bases. That is why QE1 didn't stimulate the economy and why QE2 will fail to do so as well.          ",
