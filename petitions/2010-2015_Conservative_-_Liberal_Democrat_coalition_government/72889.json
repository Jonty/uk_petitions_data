        "additional_details": "The sentence for Yusuf Sarwar is unjust and unfair especially compared to others that have travelled to Syria and returned to the UK.\r\n\r\nThose who know Yusuf know that he is young, caring and sweet which also makes him vulnerable and susceptible.\r\n\r\nIn his mind, he went over to help citizens against the dictatorship regime.\r\n\r\nThis Government must find other means of challenging people's view and behaviour and help reintegrate them back into Society rather then isolate them by locking them up.\r\n\r\nPlease help Yusuf by signing this petition. We need 100,000 signatures for the Government to sit up and take notice.\r\n\r\nYour help and support is much needed and appreciated.\r\n\r\n",
