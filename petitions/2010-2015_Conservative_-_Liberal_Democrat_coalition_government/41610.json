        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned call on the Government to make personalised NHS budgets for talking therapies available to victims of sexual abuse.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when you are assessed by your GP as being a victim of sexual abuse, you are put on a waiting list. Most patients are on that waiting list for months before they get to see a therapist or counsellor. That is not acceptable.\r\n\r\nWe propose: When the patient is assessed by their GP as being a victim of sexual abuse, a budget should be allocated to each individual for use on whatever form of Trauma therapy they believe will help them. This would give patients the freedom of choice, quick access to the support they need and it would give charities the chance to receive the funding directly via the client.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to make personalised budgets standard and treat mental health issues resulting from childhood sexual abuse/violence with as much care and compassion as they treat physical issues.",
