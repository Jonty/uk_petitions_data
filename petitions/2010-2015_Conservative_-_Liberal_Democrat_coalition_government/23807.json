        "additional_details": "Many animals are treated very cruely in animal testing and most result in death, but it is excused because it is 'animal testing' and it contributes to science, however not all the information collected from animal testing are helpful to use, because they are not humans, so their results aren't reliable! So most of this: time, money and cruelty is wasted.\r\nHowever I would think there would be a lot of conflict if we banned it all completely, so i think that animal testing should only be allowed if the animals are well kept, not subject to torture and only if the results will be beneficial to it's species. e.g. testing a medicine that will be used for animals.",
