        "additional_details": "TV Licensing is one of the most oppressive and restrictive licensing requirements in the United Kingdom, often leaving people feeling insecure in their own homes for fear of legal visits from TV licensing \"enforcement\" officers.\r\n\r\nThe constant hounding of tenants of unlicensed properties causes a great deal of undue stress and only impacts the current average household's ability to stay out of financial debt in times of current fiscal crisis.\r\n\r\nThe average household tends to struggle to pay their mandatory living expenses and would benefit greatly from the release of the need for a TV License to be comfortable in their own homes.\r\n\r\nThe funding and/or revenue lost by abolishing the license can be quickly recouped by product placement and advertising on the BBC network, just like any other respectable TV network.\r\n\r\nThis petitions' target is to have the TV Licensing completely abolished and to never be reinstated.",
