The USA have this freedom and privilege, probably originally bequeathed to them by us. As a Christian country with an established Church and HM the Queen as Governor of the Anglican Church and  Bishops playing an active part in out Upper House, we should be more pro-active in maintaining our Christian heritage for which many fought and gave their lives in previous generations. This would not be an offence to those of other faiths who have freedom to practice their own beliefs in our tolerant society.\"\r\n\r\nBritain is a Christian country where we have an Established Church, Her Majesty the Queen being Governor, we have Bishops in the House of Lords and some basic aspects of our legal system are founded on the 10 commandments.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
