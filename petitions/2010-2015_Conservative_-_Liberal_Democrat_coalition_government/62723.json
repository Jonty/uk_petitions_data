The 'sentence' received by bereaved relatives affected by the loss of a loved one caused by drink and dangerous driving is far greater than the so called sentence, the guilty party currently receives. The taking of a life should mean life in imprisonment or at the very least a more substantial sentence than is currently given.\r\nRest in peace Callum Christopher Warm.",
