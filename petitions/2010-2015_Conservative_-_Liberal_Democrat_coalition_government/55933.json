We live in a culture where age related expectations devalue a young person's success because they may not achieve at a certain age.  Students' progress and achievements should be valued equally, irrespective of the age they sat the test, early or late.  Every student should be on their own pathway to success and encouraged by the inspection system to value GCSE grades at any age.",
