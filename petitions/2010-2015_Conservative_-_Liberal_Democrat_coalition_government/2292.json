        "additional_details": "There is currently a gap between the supposed goals of the policy of applying green taxes to fuel, and the reality that is being achieved by it.\r\n\r\nHigher fuel prices have not encouraged more people to travel on public transport because higher fuel costs have also affected the public transport companies leading to rising ticket prices.\r\n\r\nWe propose reducing or scrapping tax on fuel that is used for public transport, and guaranteeing that these savings are then passed on to the customers in the form of lower ticket prices.\r\n",
