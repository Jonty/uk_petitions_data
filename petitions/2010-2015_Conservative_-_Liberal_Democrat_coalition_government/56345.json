        "additional_details": "A woman is being privatly prosecuted by the RSPCA who used to take animals to her sanctuary.... the RSPCA did not follow protocol and the animals that where taken where not seen by a vet until 5 days after the seizure.....This woman spends all her money on the animals and rescues animals from situations which the RSPCA themselves will not attend!!! She has lost donations and she is loosing the will to fight the battle with them.. she cant afford a solicitor and she's selling personal belongings to feed the rescued animals which she is rehabilitating at her sanctuary. how could the RSPCA do this to a honest caring woman?? Please can the Goverment stop this BULLYING from the RSPCA and help fight her corner in this dishonest battle by the RSPCA. Please sign and share this e petition.",
