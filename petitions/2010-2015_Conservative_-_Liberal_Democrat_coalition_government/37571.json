        "additional_details": "We would like the government to re consider the case that was put forward in the Courts by Tony Nicklinson and to change the UK Laws on assisted suicide/murder. The change should allow for doctors to legally be able to take the lives of patients who so wish their life to be ended when a) the decision by them is made by free will b) there is no chance of a recovery to normal life for them and c) the condition they suffer is so severe and they are unable to end their own life. Patients would have to meet strict criteria and it be known that it is 100% what they want. e.g. Tony Nicklinson.",
