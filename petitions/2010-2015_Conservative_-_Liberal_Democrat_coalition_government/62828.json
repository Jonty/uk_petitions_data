This is all while the Vice Chancellor's of universities and Chief Executive's of colleges give themselves obscene pay rises.\r\n\r\n We the undersigned petition the UK Government to consider the following:\r\n\r\n- Launching a review into the unacceptable pay rises of university VC's and college CE's\r\n\r\n- Consider imposing statutory regulation by means of an independent body of pay and benefits given to Vice Chancellor's and Chief Executives at institutes of further and higher education.
