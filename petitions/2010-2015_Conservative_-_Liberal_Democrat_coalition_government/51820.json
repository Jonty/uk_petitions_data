January modules helped students who are late in developing and gives them more time to help study. Why should the department of education think they have the right to get rid of it? They clearly are not 15-18 and have no idea what it is like to be a child in the 21st Century. The pressures they put upon us. They have taken coursework away and kept us in education for longer, because they know many pupils prefer to leave the system as its not a fun system. Maybe if they considered us students more, many of us will aspire to do better and more creative things about our education.\r\n\r\nSo what do you want to do?\r\n\r\nYou can be one of the many people that agrees and would like to make a change so make the first step by signing this and showing the government: Students of the 21st Century are not as na\u00efve as they think.
