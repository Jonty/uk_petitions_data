        "additional_details": "I propose changes to the health care system, the NHS. Currently there is an augmenting problem with waiting times within the NHS for patients. The NHS makes a promise that no client, which attends the NHS and is entitled to an appointment, will have to wait no longer than 18 weeks to have access to treatment or consultations. However from research and findings, in April 2014 29,417 of the 295,641 patients admitted and treated that month had to wait more than a month for treatment. Therefore the NHS only met their promised requirements for 90% of patients to be seen within 18 weeks.\r\nIn order to address the problem we propose the following E-petition:\r\nSubsidise the university fees of all medical students who commit to working in the NHS for a minimum period of five years. Medical students will include nurses, doctors, and all other frontline medical staff. This will solve staff shortages therefore reducing waiting lists for medical appointments and treatments.\r\n\r\n",
