        "additional_details": "I think that the Mayor's office as well as the Greater London Authority (GLA) should be given more power and a bigger say on issues such as taxes and welfare. In comparison to other major cities London falls behind on the amount of decisions taken by the people in the city itself. Why should a city aspiring to be the best in the world not make their own decisions. With a population of 8.3 million citizens ; bigger than scotland and wales combined. The people of London should have a bigger say on their own affairs.THe government should let London make decisions regarding taxes and welfare most of all.",
