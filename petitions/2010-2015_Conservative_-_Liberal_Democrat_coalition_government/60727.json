This is a blatantly racist book which should have no place in our so-called politically correct society.\r\n\r\nThe title alone is an insult. The children\u2019s nursery rhyme of similar name was published in 1875 in the US; years before Agatha rewrote it into a novel.\r\n\r\nSome lines from original rhyme:\r\nTen little nigger boys went out to dine;\r\nOne choked his little self and then there were Nine\u2026\r\n\r\nTwo little nigger boys sitting in the sun;\r\nOne got frizzled up and then there was One.\r\nOne little nigger boy left all alone;\r\nHe went out and hanged himself and then there were None\r\n\r\nIn our multi-cultural society, how can this be acceptable?\r\n\r\nDistribution of this book and others like it needs to stop. Organisations profiting from sales of such books show support of ignorant, racist views. We should not endorse companies like these.\r\n\r\nThis book is extremely offensive.",
