        "additional_details": "i believe that many people over 55 should not be harrased to get jobs if they no longer wish to work. many over 55's are not in the best of health, not as strong or fit as they once were. With more over 55's not in work this opens more doors to the younger generation who have much more need of work to build there future. Ok if you are over 55 and still want to work, but it should be your choice. it is very difficult to find work at this age if you havent already got a job. Concentrate on the young, us oldies wont riot if were bored and most of us have worked for years already and deserve our benefits more than those who have never worked. ",
