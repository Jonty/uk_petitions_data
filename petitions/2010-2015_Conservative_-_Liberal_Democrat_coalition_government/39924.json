We have got other things to consider, such as funeral costs and grave costs. And then they consider giving the money to much loved family members, as a form of support and true love (not for the government to think that is a luxury either)!\r\n\r\nIt would make things better, and more manageable, if Inheritance Tax was cut to a lower rate.",
