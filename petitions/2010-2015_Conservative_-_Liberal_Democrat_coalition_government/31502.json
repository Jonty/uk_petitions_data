        "additional_details": "We, the Young Campaigners want education to change for autistic people:  Autistic children should be involved in decisions which affect them and have the same opportunities no matter who they are or where they live. Teachers need a better understanding in order to  provide the right support. To do this we recommend: all teachers have effective autism awareness training, school councils should involve students with autism and all students should have a personalised plan. The local offer should comment on the support avaliable for children with autism.",
