Pay only subsistence wages. Army gets a boost in numbers for low cost. No benefits paid. No prison costs. Jobs available to others if conscripts had to give one up. Troublemakers off the streets. Oh, and conscripts may learn a trade and become useful.This is a positive suggestion that has benefits all round.  Better than National Service for all youngsters; better than stopping benefit or evicting people.  Let's get something positive out of this situation for once!",
