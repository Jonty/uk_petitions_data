The funds are currently destined to reduce the deficit in a one of payment.\r\nThe undersigned propose to use the funds generated, by the selling of the funds assets, to fund an upgrade and expansion of the nations infrastructure.\r\nAt the time of writing this, the deficit is expected to be \u00a37bn smaller than predicted. The deficit reduction is on track but growth is below was is to be expected. Use the money to create jobs and growth by spending the \u00a328bn on the nations ageing and overworked infrastructure. Creating world class transport, broadband and energy networks serving the country for decades to come.\r\nThis policy would avoid the need to \"privatise\" anymore of the UK's infrastructure or use PFI schemes.",
