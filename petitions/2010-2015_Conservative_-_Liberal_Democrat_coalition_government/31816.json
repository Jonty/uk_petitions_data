        "additional_details": "This government could easily collect money from people who use our roads but do not pay for it, when I drive my car abroad I pay tax on there fuel and then pay tolls to use there roads, in some countries in the EU as I enter there country I have to pay a tax to use there roads which has to be displayed in the windscreen of my vehicle (these may vary from 1,7 or 28 days) as well as tolls etc if you don't you get  one then its an on the spot fine, If your driving an HGV or bus you pay in even more countries in the EU for the privelege of using there roads.\r\nSurely the UK government could easily do this as were an island and all non UK taxed vehicles as they arrive in the port can register and then pay on leaving for the period they are here using the UK roads as we do in some EU countries. This would bring in a considerable income in for the government or IS THE UK GOVERNMENT SCARED OF UPSETTING OUR EU PARTNERS.",
