        "additional_details": "This is to demand an end to the policy of allowing the official Bank of England interest rate to operate at a level lower than the official rates of inflation.  This policy has never been debated: the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England has no democratic mandate to implement this policy, as their charter of independence explicitly states their role is to control inflation.  This policy is damaging the economy and is unfair to savers and investors: it has never been debated or discussed in parliament or by any manifesto issued by the political parties.  Negative interest rates have never been officially stated as a policy and this needs to be discussed and overturned.",
