We were promised that when the goalposts were moved for women's retirement age to be increased from age 60 to 65 our entitlement to full pension would be protected by giving us 5 years \"free\" contributions. Now it has been moved to 66 and the contribution period is to be increased to 35 years from 30. In other words the five years we were \"given\" is to be stolen back. Stop moving the goalposts! Any future changes should affect only school leavers.",
