No more free Perscriptions, no more free university fees, no more benefits from our english system. Thats just a few things that instantly come to mind that costs English tax payers and English tax payers don't get. Personally would like them to vote no... But if that's what the majority want let them have it. Scottish Oil will be dirt cheap when their economy realises they need us. ",
