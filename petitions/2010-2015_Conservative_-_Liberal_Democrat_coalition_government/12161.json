        "additional_details": "Today 14.8.2011 7pm I went to park opposite Thornton Heath Library Thornton Heath Recreation Ground  with my 3 and 5 year old children. There was a man with his 3 year daughter smoking in children's area near the swing. When I told him that there are children around and it was not right. He told me he was outside and there is no board sign saying No smoking. Will the council/Government  put Boards of No smoking in children's park so people like this who lack common sense understand that others at least are not interested in exposing children to his smoke? Many Thanks",
