        "additional_details": "We urge the Government to repeal Breed Specific Legislation and focus on more appropriate measures of tackling irresponsible dog ownership.\r\n\r\nBreed Specific Legislation is an ineffective way of dealing with and battling irresponsible dog ownership. Under B.S.L. their are four breeds of dog banned from the U.K.; American Pit Bull Terrier, Japanese Tosa, Fila Braziliero and the Dogo Argentino. In 1991, the Dangerous Dogs Act (including B.S.L.) was rushed through parliament after a series of attacks and one particularly serious attack on a child by American Pit Bull Terriers or \"Bull\" Breeds. The hastily applied Act, since then, has not reduced the recorded number of Dog 'Strike' statistics, they have, infact, increased since then.",
