When the lights are out we ALL feel vulnerable.\r\nWe agree with reducing the carbon footprint and we agree with saving money but surely there must be other ways to preserve our quality of life?\r\nWe believe the crime rate will soar, increase fear and impact catastrophically on the businesses of North Somerset, which are already struggling to survive.\r\n\r\nTherefore to keep us all safe KEEP THE LIGHTS ON!\r\n",
