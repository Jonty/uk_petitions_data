        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned demand that returning injured soldiers be given priority for apropriate healthcare and housing and all available financial assistance over and above asylum seekers and other non-British nationals currently claiming disability allowance/housing association stock.  Our soldiers do a tough job, in difficult circumstances for not very much pay and with great dignity.  Having seen the cases of Private Alex Stringer - a triple amputee being forced to live in a 6th floor tower block and L Bdr Ben Parkinson, a double amputee with brain damage having to accept reduced financial compensation, we find it intolerable that soldiers are penalised having given service to the country whilst others, of non-British origin who have contributed nothing are generously recompensed at taxpayers expense. We demand that the government take action to rectify this appalling state of affairs.",
