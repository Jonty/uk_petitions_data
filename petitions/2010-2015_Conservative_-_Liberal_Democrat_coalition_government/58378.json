        "additional_details": "The UK government is pressuring the major ISPs to enable on by default filtering, and the countries major ISP - BT - who most other networks piggyback upon already has agreed to this. He is also trying to have these filters not only cover pornography but what he calls 'extremist' sites too.\r\n\r\nWhen David Cameron says extremist sites he is intentionally leaving it incredibly open to interpretation and will undoubtedly have some very creative interpretations of that. It will start off with terrorist boards and sites - who don't even use the clearnet.\r\n\r\nWhat he is doing is getting us used to censorship, if he were to block half of the internet today there would be protests. Pornography is just the beginning.\r\n\r\nWe need to act now, and kill censorship before it takes off - we can not just lie down and leave the internet in the hands of those that do not understand it.",
