I believe that UK wide the Jobseekers Benefit should be changed to a Community benefit.  The benefit will only be paid to the claimant when they have served their community.  This will allow local Governments to keep services such as library, park warden services and street cleaning services to mention a few.\r\n\r\nThere are many things that could be completed by a claimant in my area such as street cleaning, grafiti removal, gritting during the winter months.\r\n\r\nAs opposed to a payment that is collected for nothing, why not give something in return.  I am sure that there are many people who want to work and can't find jobs; this will give them something to do while earning their benefit.",
