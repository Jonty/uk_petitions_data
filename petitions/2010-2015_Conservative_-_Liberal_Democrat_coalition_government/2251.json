        "additional_details": "It is known for many people that in many work places there are only one culture and it seems they only employ one culture.ect. african, british, other ethnic backgrounds.\r\n\r\nI am doing this as over the past 2 years i have noticed when attending interviews this is the case that they will only employ people of their own culture despite the other person having whats needed for the atcuall job.\r\n\r\nThe equality and diversity act is being toatally ignored and i believe work places with only one ethnicity type should be reviewed.\r\n\r\nEngland is a mixed society of ethnicities and should stay that way including in the work place.\r\n\r\nBy not employing a person because of the colour of their skin or ethnicity is Racism and its time it was looked at.\r\n\r\nI myself am a white female and feel this is happening on to many occasions\r\n\r\nPlease sign this if you believe its fair to have work environment with all different ethnicities and not just one.",
