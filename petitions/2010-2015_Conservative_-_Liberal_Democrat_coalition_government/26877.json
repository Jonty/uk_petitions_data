        "additional_details": "By introducing compulsory degree qualified nurses, the NHS is losing out on a wide variety of potential nurses who are prepared to do such things as basic care. Meaning - bed panning, checking for bed sores, taking an interest in the person as a whole with compassion etc, that some new university educated nurses deem to be beneath them now that they have a degree. A reintroduction of the diploma in nursing would again allow people who may have a passion for true 'nursing' of other people (which is what the NHS needs) but not enough degree level education to be given a chance to be a true 'all-rounder' nurse, rather than just a medical pencil pusher who thinks that basic compassionate care is the work of an auxillary.",
