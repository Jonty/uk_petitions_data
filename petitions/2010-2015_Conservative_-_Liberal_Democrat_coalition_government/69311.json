        "additional_details": "The increase in a Bereavement award is long overdue.  Whilst it is accepted that no amount of money can ever replace a loved one a token amount of as little as \u00a312,980 acts more of an insult to a bereaved family of a lost child, mother, father, brother or sister.\r\n\r\nThis petition would like to provide a fair compromise and suggests an amount in the region of \u00a3100,000.\r\n\r\nPlease support bereaved families accross England and Wales.",
