        "additional_details": "Many drivers display a bad habit of staying in the middle lane of the motorway despite the lane to their left being clear and available. This forces drivers wishing to pass them into the outer overtaking lane. The middle lane is I understand an overtaking lane. I would like to see this become an offence so as to remind and force people to stay in the inner lane unless overtaking. This will ease congestion and make the motorways safer.",
