        "additional_details": "At present most contraception and sexual health is focused on women which is wrong. Men should be responsible for their sexual health and that of their partner, and if as a result of sexual intercourse,  a woman become pregnant, men should take the full responsibility. It is men\u2019s sperm and therefore their responsibility. The petition is for the government to place responsibility back on men and not on the tax payer for the thoughtless actions of men (young and old) who act irresponsibly towards women. We would like the government to have all sexual health and pregnancy promotion directed towards men. By doing this it will reduce teenage pregnancies, abortions and unplanned pregnancies.  It will improve pre-marital and post-martial relationships before sexual intercourse is engaged in. It will make men directly responsible for obtaining contraception, sexual health costs and other costs including child birth, if a woman became pregnant.\r\n",
