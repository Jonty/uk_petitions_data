Also they sue hospitals/insurance firms/employers/schools/police and whilst some of these cases may have a real issue, many of them are trivial whilst others are simply a way of making money from the above.  I propose that if the lawyers involved truly believe in their client then they should do the work pro-bono (for free) and if they lose the case, they and their client should bear the costs rather than the organisation who is being sued.
