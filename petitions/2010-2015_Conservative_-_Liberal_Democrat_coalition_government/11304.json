        "additional_details": "To make rioters homeless is a vicious and vindictive knee jerk reaction that will only serve to inflict hardship and destitution on one of the poorest sections of our society. This will also create an additional burden for local government which has a duty to accommodate the homeless.\r\n\r\nEven worse, would be to force their families, who bear no legal responsibility for the rioter's actions, into homelessness. To do this is to unfairly punish and stigmatise the innocent.\r\n\r\nIt should not be a goal of any local or national government to deliberately create poverty, homelessness, exclusion and destitution or to undermine and disregard the human rights of its citizens/residents.\r\n\r\nThe Government must ban any local authority or social housing provider from evicting rioters and/or their families.\r\n\r\nThere are already sufficient sanctions in place through the criminal justice system to deal effectively with those who are convicted of committing criminal offences.",
