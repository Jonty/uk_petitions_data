        "additional_details": "I don't believe and I'm hoping to prove I'm not the only one that believes congestion charging is wrong. There are still thousands of accidents, traffic queues and cars on our roads. Congestion charging does not solve the problem! It creates revenue for the government and it looks green but it doesn't involve any bans and 9/10 who live in London can afford the charge! I believe a re-think is needed and calling for one! Banning of more than two cars in one home, all cars with a certain license plate not driving on an even day etc.Electric cars are not the way either. Where do you get electric from? Burning fossil fuels, I'm calling for a referendum on the matter.",
