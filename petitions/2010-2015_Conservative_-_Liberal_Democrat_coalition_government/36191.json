        "additional_details": "We call on the government to repeal the Marriage Order (2003) which states there are legal impediments to same-sex civil marriages. In a democratic society, everyone should be equal before the law. We request that the Northern Ireland legislative assembly open up civil marriages in register offices and other licensed premises to all couples, gay and heterosexual, regardless of gender or sexual orientation and without any discrimination.\r\n\r\nWe want our government to understand that equality before the law is a basic human right and that the LGBT community should not have to jump through hoops simply to have expressions of love through marriage recognised as equal to that of heterosexual couples.\r\n",
