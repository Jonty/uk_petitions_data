        "additional_details": "This petition is to request the House to review the current statutes and policies regarding the use of Solo Motorcycles in recognised bus lanes in all major cities and towns within the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nAfter the completion of two trials allowing motorcycles to use Bus Lanes in London, the scheme was implemented on most Red Routes within the City.\r\n\r\n The trials showed that the scheme reduced carbon emissions, improved travel time and increased the \"smoothness\" of traffic within the city.\r\n\r\n We therefore request that the scheme be implemented in all major towns and cities within the United Kingdom",
