        "additional_details": "Firms like G4S, Serco etc... Should be made to not only pay back what they overcharged, they should also be made to pay associated costs such as the cost of the serious fraud office's investigation, the governments legal advice, the audit of contracts by accounting firms and interest plus charges.  This should be done not only to recover the true cost of this fraud but also to set the benchmark for any future cases of fraud.  This should then serve as a strong deterrent to private companies that might exploit similar opportunities in future.",
