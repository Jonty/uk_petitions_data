        "additional_details": "Every year thousands of greyhounds are made to race for entertainment. After they have stopped making money, many are then disposed of; some even die on the track. There have been cases of greyhounds having their ears cut off so their owners can't be traced. Greyhounds make wonderful pets as they are gentle and loving, but only few are re-homed after they have retired from racing. All greyhounds truly deserve a loving home, not suffering for people's entertainment. Stop greyhound racing and help to find homes for all greyhounds! ",
