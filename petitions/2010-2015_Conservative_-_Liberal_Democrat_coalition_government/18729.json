        "additional_details": "Safe Drive, Stay Alive is a roadshow based around powerful personal testimonies designed to make the audience aware of the nature and extent of personal tragedy and suffering a Road Traffic Collision can and does cause.\r\n\r\nThe roadshow leaves the audience fully aware of the risks they pose to others and themselves if they do not behave in a responsible manor when ether as a driver or passenger.\r\n\r\nWe believe this presentation is so powerful it should be shown to every young person as part of their school education before they learn to drive.\r\n\r\nNational Health Statistics state that young people are more at risk of dying in a road traffic collision than from any other accidental cause. If we are so aware of this why do we not educate them in schools of this danger?\r\n\r\nThis roadshow fills that gap in their education and helps prepare them for life outside of education.\r\n",
