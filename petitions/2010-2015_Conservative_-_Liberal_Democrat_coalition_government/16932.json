        "additional_details": "Many school leavers find themselves as \"NEET\"s: not in Education, Employment or Training.  Unemployment rates for these youg people are very high and their long term prospects are poor.  The proposal is to:\r\n\r\n1.  Create a stand-alone scheme for all \"NEET\"s (aged up to age 21) and deal with them seperately by:\r\na) provision of long term voluntary work placements which provide experience & skills;\r\nb) create a plan for each person to get them trained;\r\nc) provide incentives for the young person to engage in this scheme by either a compulsion to undertake in order to qualify for benefits or a more positive incentive based scheme.\r\n\r\n2.  Create an incentive for employers to create oppotunities for these youg people:\r\na) Payment of an allowance to employer or tax incentive via National Insurance etc;\r\nb) Allow additional corporation tax deductions for training costs incurred by the employer (say additional 50-100% credit).",
