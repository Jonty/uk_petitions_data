Surely the government should be saying no and instead take that money and put it back into building the country back up.\r\n\r\nCuts are being made to NHS services, benefits, pensions etc yet these bankers still get large pay packets and want more on top of that?!\r\n\r\n \"Antonio Horta-Osorio, the bank's chief executive, will receive a \u00a3900,000 allowance in deferred shares which will boost his guaranteed annual pay to \u00a32.6m.\"\r\n\r\nDont they get enough already?\r\n\r\nthe wrong people are being punished.\r\nlets put a stop to this\r\n",
