        "additional_details": "We the undersigned oppose the proposed amendments to the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act (DDA). We oppose extending section 3 to any place leaving dogs & their owners potentially criminalised in their own homes. \u2018Dangerously out of control\u2019 is any occasion a person has \u2018reasonable apprehension\u2019 of injury whether or not the dog has actually injured a person. Offences should not be of strict liability as is currently the case. Barking/growling alone at an assistance dog should not result in proceedings. We oppose any extension of powers to enter private property or seize a dog from private property without a warrant. We object to amendments that a court MUST consider if the owner is \u2018fit and proper\u2019 & may consider \u2018any other relevant circumstances\u2019. BSL does nothing to protect the public, or address the problems of irresponsible owners/breeders. Defendants should be innocent until proved guilty. Legal aid should be extended to cover civil proceedings under the DDA & also the Dogs Act 1871",
