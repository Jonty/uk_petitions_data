        "additional_details": "The daily commute for the average worker is becoming an ever more burden to the household income and lifestyle.\r\n\r\nRoad Traffic and congestion across the UK is an integral part of daily travel.  People are leaving homes early just to beat the \u2018daily rush\u2019 and for those who find it all too much seek other means of transport.  It is safe to suggest that when pursuing other means (train travel) calculations quickly equate to it being more expensive and less direct.  If we look towards reducing train fares we can link up with bicycle travel, reduce traffic congestion, reduce stress, develop health, improve punctuality and spend travel savings on visiting  family and friends.\r\n\r\nWe need to develop a strategic approach to decrease family household expenditure and improve quality of life. Jobs are out there, travel is an issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Reduce train fares\r\n-Increase train usage\r\n-Reduce road traffic\r\n-Encourage cycling\r\n-Improve quality of life\r\n-Drive spending\r\n\r\n",
