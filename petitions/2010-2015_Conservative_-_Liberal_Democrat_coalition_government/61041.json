The BBC are renaging on their own charter by reporting on the debate in such a heavily biased manner. We would like evenly balanced debates with equal times given to both the union AND the nationalist sides. We would also like there to be more consistency, balance and fairness in the way questions are posed and adequate time given for answers, without constant interruptions. ",
