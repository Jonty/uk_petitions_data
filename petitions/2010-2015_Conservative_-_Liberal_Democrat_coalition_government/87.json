        "additional_details": "At the moment, if you are paying to the government then you are classed as single. If you are claiming from the government then you are classed as a couple.\r\nMany husbands have built up a pension, with the support of a partner at home. Many wives have relatively no pension of their own as a result. The wife can claim no benefits to support herself because of her husbands pension. The husband can claim no tax allowance to support his wife. Because the man is taxed as single and taxed as such, then often the couple are caused severe hardship.\r\nTaxing a couple as a couple would seem fair. I suggest that one member of a couple could transfer their personal tax allowance to the other.",
