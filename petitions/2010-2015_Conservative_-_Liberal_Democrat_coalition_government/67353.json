        "additional_details": "Recently the telegraph published an article on the justification of pedophilia due to a discussion at Cambridge university last july.in this article the experts in the field of psychology and pedophilia proceeded to list justifications that pedophilia is a normal thing for the male population to experience and they also allowed convicted sex offenders access to this discussion and to debate with the expert's it is appalling to think that a place of higher education would allow this debate to go ahead or be justifiable .I want a serious check on the teaching practices that are taking place in Cambridge university and what sort of people they allow to debate with and teach there students Feel free to read the article http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/10948796/Paedophilia-is-natural-and-normal-for-males.html\r\nIf you feel as strongly about this as I do please sign this petition and help to change these teaching practices Thanks for taking the time to read this petition\r\nMr D.P.IBBS ",
