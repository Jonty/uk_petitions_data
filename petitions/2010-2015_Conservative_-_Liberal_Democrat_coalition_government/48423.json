        "additional_details": "This is a formal petition to campaign against any plans for a State funeral for Margaret Thatcher.\r\n\r\nHer actions whilst in government were unconditionally damaging to generations, and tens of millions of Great Britons.\r\n\r\nThere should be no public funds used for the funeral of a much loathed ex-Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nWe are on the verge of triple-dip recession and we are constantly being told by the current Tory-led government that state funds are to be very carefully managed. Therefore, this should include the refusal of state funds for a funeral for Margaret Thatcher.",
