        "additional_details": "I would like to raise awareness to the fact that Sunderland Royal Hospital does not have a birthing pool meaning thousands of women are losing out on the opportunity to give birth this way, Wearside, having a population of 300,000.  The benefits of water birth are enormous such as, pain-ease, more oxygen for the baby, better circulation, deeper relaxation meaning labour becomes more efficient, relaxes pelvic floor muscles.  As water birth is proven to ease pain epidurals would not be as heavily relied upon saving the NHS thousands of pounds per year, not to mention being safer.  After asking 100 women on average 98% said they would or would have liked to give birth this way.  I would like the government to consider this and give funding for this basic facility that would greatly improve the maternity unit at this large hospital and prevent the need for expensive pain relieving drugs.
