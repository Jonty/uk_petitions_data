        "additional_details": "Despite recent statistics, homosexual men are still prohibited from donating blood in the UK. Based on recent statistics, published on http://www.avert.org/uk-statistics.htm, there is strong evidence to suggest that this law needs to be re-evaluated.\r\n\r\nHIV/AIDS was first concentrated among three 'high-risk' groups - men who have sex with men (MSM), injecting drug users and people who had received treatment with blood products. However, a major component of the rapid increase over the past 15 years has been HETEROSEXUALLY acquired infection. Up until 1998, the highest number of new HIV infections were acquired through sex between men. However, since 1999 heterosexually acquired HIV has overtaken as the largest exposure category. Heterosexual sex accounted for 42 percent of HIV diagnoses in 2010 and sex between men accounted for 38.5 percent, compared to 1995 when 31 percent were a result of heterosexual sex and 58 percent of new HIV diagnoses resulted from sex between men.
