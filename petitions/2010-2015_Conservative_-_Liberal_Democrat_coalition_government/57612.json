        "additional_details": "We are distressed and saddened to hear that Isa Muaza\u2019s appeal to be released from detention was refused by the Court of Appeal on 25 November 2012.\r\n\r\nIsa Muaza\u2019s condition is critical. He has been on hunger strike in Harmondsworth Detention Centre for over 90 days, and is no longer able to see or stand. We are extremely concerned that Mr Muaza will soon die or suffer permanent damage to his health in detention or during a forced removal from the UK.\r\n\r\nWe call on Theresa May, the Home Secretary, to exercise clemency, release him from detention to receive medical treatment to stabilise his condition prior to any removal, so that another death or serious harm in immigration detention or during the removal process may be avoided.",
