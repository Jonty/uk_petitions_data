        "additional_details": "The charges should have been dropped years ago, but due to 're wording' and slippery government practice, the charges still apply.\r\n\r\nThe PFI (private finance intitiave) 1988 scheme allowed DRC Ltd a 20 year concession to collect revenue, although this could be ended early once debts were repaid, which was deemed to have occurred on 31 March 2002.\r\n\r\nThe Dartford Tolls were originally introduced to cut congestion. It now has the opposite effect and causes hour upon hour of misery for motorists who then have to pay for the priviledge of waiting in intense traffic jams.\r\n\r\nWhat the government are doing is wrong and causes stress for the put upon motorist.\r\nOpen the tolls now and stop the charges!",
