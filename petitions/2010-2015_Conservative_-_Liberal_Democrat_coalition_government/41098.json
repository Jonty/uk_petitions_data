        "additional_details": "Many food and drink products purchased from supermarkets contain 'flavouring' or 'natural flavouring', without specifying what the flavouring actually is. How is consumer choice being maintained when we are uninformed as to what we are buying?\r\n\r\nSecondly, artificial flavourings/sweeteners such as Acesulfame K, Aspartame, Sodium Saccharin & Sucralose; in addition to preservatives such as Potassium Sorbate & Sulphur Dioxide, have adverse effects in some people and are have been proven to be strongly correlated with extreme illnesses such as cancer.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, colours such as tartrazine in orange drinks and carmoisine in cherryade have been shown to  produce these effects whilst also triggering hyperactivity in people with ADHD.\r\n\r\nIn order to protect the health of the public, we the undersigned request that such items be banned from all food and drink products in the UK.",
