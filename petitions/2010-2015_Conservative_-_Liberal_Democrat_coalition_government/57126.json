        "additional_details": "I believe that it is ridiculous that WDD doesn't receive any publicity from the Government or any related public bodies. Approximately 350 million people in the world suffer from type 1 or type 2 diabetes, 3.4 million died in 2004 due to type 1 or type 2 diabetes and Type 1 diabetes is one of the biggest killers of teenagers due to lack of awareness about the symptoms. I believe that more publicity would be beneficial so that more people know what signs to look out for so that unnecessary deaths can be prevented and also it should be seen as more important due to the large number of people who suffer from it.",
