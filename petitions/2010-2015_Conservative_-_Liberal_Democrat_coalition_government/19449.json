Then if you use enough energy the unit price goes down! This is what should be disallowed. The price not go down, it should go up (or stay the same).\r\n\r\nThis is likely to reduce people\u2019s use of power to have a fairer charge for people who live modestly. This would be in line with thinking green.",
