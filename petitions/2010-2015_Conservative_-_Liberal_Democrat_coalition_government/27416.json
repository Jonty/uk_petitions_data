The people of Northern Ireland, Wales and England have as much right to be asked to validate our futures with or without Scotland.\r\nThere are so many issues which devolution would cause for all countries such as \"Can a devolved Scotland  be allowed to keep the \u00a3 Sterling? What if independent Scottish fiscal policy became damaging?  \"Would there be a need for protectionist trade legislation by Scotland or against Scotland? What about the shared infrastructure, would the rest be expected to pick up the tab if Scotland could not maintain it.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue which is far too wide reaching to be addressed only by the Scottish electorate.\r\n\r\nThe Government should ensure that any referendum was opened to all those directly affected by Scottish devolution/ independence, that is all the members of the current union not just a small minority.",
