Campaign \u201cFixed means Fixed\u201d and hundreds of thousands more complained, yet no one cares.\r\n\r\nBefore this started in 2011, we were just recovering from another one called \u201cAutomatic contract renewal\u201d\r\n\r\nHundred thousand consumers that were tricked will never have faith in any Contract or agreement in the future, and that is bad all around.\r\n\r\nIt is also very sad, that no Select Committee, Minister, Secretary of State or anyone else that the public can turn to when it comes to Ofcom.\r\n\r\nRespectfully ,calling on the Prime Minister to honour his promises mentioned above.\r\n\r\n",
