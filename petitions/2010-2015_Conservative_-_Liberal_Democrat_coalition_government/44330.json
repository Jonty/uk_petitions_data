Needing to apply for Government funding via DFG's, costing the State millions. But IF all local authorities & the government were to take back these bungalows from \"Able bodied tenants\" whom DO NOT need them, give the \"Disabled & the Infirm\" the bungalows that they so Desperately Need & re-house these Able Bodied Tenants in the EMPTY General Needs Housing given up by the Disabled & Infirm, The money saved from the non applications for DFG's could be best spent on something more constructive in this country.\r\nGIVE BUNGALOWS TO THOSE WHO REALLY NEED THEM",
