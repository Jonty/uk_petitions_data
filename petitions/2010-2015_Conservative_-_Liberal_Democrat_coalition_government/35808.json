        "additional_details": "Hi, i have just split from my partner, we had 3 children, 2 girls and 1 boy. I was told at the begining from Home group I can have a 3 bedroom house, so I started bidding on them, but now I am told I can only have a 2 bed house, because my partner has the child benefit. For me to get a 3 bedroom house, she has to surrender her child benefit to me, which is unfair, also because of the new housing benefit rules as well. So home group expects me to squeeze 3 kids into one room, so people are we still living in the 60's era or not and this is prob the same throughout the uk.  So please lets get housing rights changed for dads, so we can have the same rights.",
