A man is not considered equally and custody of children is automatically given to the mother.  If this was the other way round then you could imagine the feminist medias response.\r\nPeople complain about absent fathers, but the real truth is they are excluded and driven away from their children from day 1 of the split even if they are the better parent.  This is sexist and anti male but mostly disastrous for our children and reflects itself daily in the gangs of males roaming the streets of the UK without a male role model.\r\nThe government must make both parents equal and give them joint custody automatically both financial and with regard to domicile",
