And now we all now have to pay the cost for those actions by way of even more cuts to the NHS, public and council services !!! Lets hope they dont need an ambulance or the police one day !! These people need to feel ashamed for what they have done and one way of doing that is by making sure everyone in their community knows who they are and what they have done. I say put them on billboards, posters and websites !! let us all see which people in our communities have been causing the trouble ! ",
