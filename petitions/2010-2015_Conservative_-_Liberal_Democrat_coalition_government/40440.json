Reduce the minimum wage to \u00a33 and put all those on sub \u00a37 jobs on benefits that they are on now.  Work then pays.\r\n\r\nWhen earning over \u00a35/hr, cut the benefits.  When over \u00a37/hr remove all benefits.  The thresholds will need resolving, the model is simple.  The problem of idleness is solved.\r\n\r\nEmployers benefit from lower cost employees.  Society has more workers that may move up the value chain.  All win.",
