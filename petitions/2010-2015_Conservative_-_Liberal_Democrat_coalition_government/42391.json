        "additional_details": "We want an immediate moritorium on the extraction of gas from Wales' shale formations. There is a risk of releasing methane which would seriously affect the government's ability to meet its targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Poisonous chemicals could be released into underground aquifers, eventually reaching the sea: Swansea's beaches could lose their blue flag status: this would affect tourism. Chemicals could also leak into reservoirs which supply water to the local polulation. The gas pipeline from Milford Haven to Gloucester could be affected.",
