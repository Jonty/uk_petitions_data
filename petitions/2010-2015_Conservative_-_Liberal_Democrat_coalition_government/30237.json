        "additional_details": "Currently the law states that employers in the UK do not have to consultate with either employees and/or trade unions for making redundencies in \"working enviroments\" employing less than 20 people. We want to change this law after several tribunals have denied protective award compensation for people in these situations including Woolworths and Ethel Austins. There are many more instances like these and we feel this law needs changing. Sign and help us make a difference today.",
