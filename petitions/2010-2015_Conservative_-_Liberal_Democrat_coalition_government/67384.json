        "additional_details": "The bungalows in Bandeath Road, Fallin, were purposely built for the over 60's. They have secure entry systems and have ramps and handrails. I have just been informed that these bungalows are no longer for over 60's, leaving anyone to be allocated one of these. They are putting young people in beside pensioners, which is wrong. They no longer feel safe in their own home. Please sign this and share. Thank you.",
