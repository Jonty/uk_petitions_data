During this period all MPs from all parties MUST attend debates or lose allowances.\r\nAt present there is no record of attendance in the commons except for voting figures. This is not acceptable, as the public must be able to see whether their MP has attended any debate, petitioned or otherwise.\r\nMPs are public servants, paid by the public purse, and, as we're reminded when we call any government agency, we are all customers of the state, and as customers we are entitled be listened to, and served.\r\nWe demand a good service for our taxes,and as customers, as voters and most importantly as Humans, we demand the right to determine how we live, and have our voice heard!\r\n",
