        "additional_details": "Currently bus passes only work in the nation they were issued from eg, England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Island.\r\n\r\nThis means that older people living on the border have to pay fares half the time.\r\n\r\nIt also creates unnecessary separation as when your pass is rejected it makes you feel unwelcome.\r\n\r\nThis also reduces tourism and  mobility of tourists, reducing the benefit to the local economy.\r\n\r\nIt is all unnecessary it would probably save money if there was an integration of the bus passes.\r\n\r\nOf course it is a devolved area, however a simple agreement to accept passes from other parts of the UK would be simple to set up and is what  this petition is calling for.",
