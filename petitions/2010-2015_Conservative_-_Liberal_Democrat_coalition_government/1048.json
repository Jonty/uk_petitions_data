        "additional_details": "This is a petition for the British government to call for the Northern Ireland assembly to restore the Ulster banner as the official flag for Northern Ireland / Ulster / \"the province\". Unionists are the majority in Northern Ireland, even amongst Catholics, and that should be the basis of getting a flag - perceived to be unionist - officially recognized for a country with a population of just under 2 million.\r\n\r\nIdeally this would be done in time for the London 2012 Olympics when each nation of the UK will be representing their respective country on British soil.",
