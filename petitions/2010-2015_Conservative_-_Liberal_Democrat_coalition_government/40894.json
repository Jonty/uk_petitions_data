        "additional_details": "This petition is to request the government to introduce a policy for the control and legal reduction in numbers of the raptor population, due to the ever increasing attacks on racing pigeons.  Birds are attacked on a daily basis whilst racing, training and even flying round their own loft environment.  Numbers of raptors have grown out of all proportion due to introduced nesting sites in urban areas. ",
