        "additional_details": "Introduce legislation to require insurance companies to pay out pension funds to terminally ill patients within 30 days of application supported by confirmation of diagnosis from the doctor.  The process for claiming should not allow the insurance companies to delay payments by drip feeding requests for information.  On being diagnosed as terminally ill with cancer, my sister submitted claims to 3 companies, one paid out within weeks, one took 3-4 months to pay and the third paid out after more than 7 months of requesting more and more information, causing a lot of stress and actually refunding my sisters pension pot less than a month before she died.  She wasn't alone, she told me that there were numerous similar cases on cancer support sites.  When someone is told that they have less than a year to live, the last thing they need is stress of making these claims and they may need the money to live and fulfil some of their last wishes.",
