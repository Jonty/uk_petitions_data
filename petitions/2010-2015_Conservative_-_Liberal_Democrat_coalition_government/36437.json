        "additional_details": "Currently Tenancy Deposit Schemes are not held accountable for their services and subsequently many landlords and tenants are provided with a very poor service concerning deposit allocation at the end of a tenancy. The deposit scheme operators simply state they are not liable should the adjudication make mistakes, and simply pass the burden onto the tenant and or landlord, often leaving one or other out of pocket, due to their own poor judgement. No one regulates these schemes yet they are set up by the government and a legal requirement for any tenancy.",
