Our children not only suffer at the hands of playground bullies, but also online, and often by the same kids who bully them at school. Adults too suffer at the hands of bullies in the workplace,  with further attacks online. Disabled people suffer from bullying, as do other vulnerable adults and children. This behaviour from bullies can lead to the victim contemplating or even commiting suicide. Those who take their own lives have often been tormented so much that they cannot see any other way around the problem.  We have to take a stand and say enough is enough.\r\nBullying in all its forms needs to become a criminal offence. Whether it is bullying in person or online, bullying must be a criminal offence. Appropriate sentences should be given for such an offence...\r\nHow many children, adults and vulnerable people have to die before we do something about this?",
