        "additional_details": "In England On 25 February 2010, the government stated that it will not overturn the October 2007 House of Lords ruling regarding pleural plaques compensation claims.\r\n\r\nAs a result, It is not possible to claim compensation for pleural plaques in England. However, in Scotland, The Damages (Asbestos-Related Conditions) (Scotland) Bill enables victims to continue to claim compensation through the courts for pleural plaques, pleural thickening and asbestos-related conditions.\r\n\r\nThis is obviously unfair to suffers in England, and needs to be changed.",
