        "additional_details": "In an exclusive interview with the Sunday Express before the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, Ms Truss said the Hunting Act had been a \u201cmistake\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe Coalition promised a free vote on overturning the Hunting Act when parliamentary time allows.\r\n\r\n\u201cFox hunting has always been a matter for a free vote,\u201d Ms Truss also said \u201cI personally would vote in favour of allowing fox hunting. I think it was a mistake, the Hunting Act, and I would vote for a repeal.\r\n\r\nBritain does not need this bloodthirsty hobby resurrected. With even members of the Tory party now coming out against the hunt, it\u2019s time for governemnt to take a firm stance and pledge not to relax the hunting ban if they are re-elected.\r\n\r\nDemand the Conservatives not abuse their precarious position as a minority government to push through wildly unpopular changes to existing legislation or make any amendments to the existing legislation in favour of hunting foxes.",
