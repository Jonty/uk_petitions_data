There they will help the communities by building wells , homes etc. Not only will they being doing something useful, they will be keeping numbers in prisons down, learn a trade that they can put to use in future and also realise that they are not actually as hard done by in England after all. I doubt the cost of send ing them out there etc would be any different to keeping them in prison here",
