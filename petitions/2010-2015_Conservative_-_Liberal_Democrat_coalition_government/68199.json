        "additional_details": "Being a motorcyclist I'm quite aware of the dangers of getting on 2 wheels every morning before work. Bikers not only have to be wary of; keeping a 2 wheeled vehicle upright, drain covers, pot holes (I could go on), but when car drivers find it acceptable to cut up someone on 2 wheels, that's when us bikers get angry.\r\n\r\nI would like the DFT to consider making it a requirement that each new driver must hold a CBT for at least 1 year before they are allowed to drive on the road, even with an instructor, to increase the awareness of the dangers bikers face.\r\n\r\nLook at it from a biker perspective:\r\n\r\n17 years old car driver, any CC vehicle, top speed, easily over 80 mph. 17 Year old CBT/A1 license holder. Maximum engine capacity, 125cc, top speed around 65mph.\r\n\r\nIf new drivers had a CBT, they would be made aware of the dangers motorcyclists face, and the driving would change. If drivers knew what a motorcyclist had to think about when controlling a bike, the roads would be safer.",
