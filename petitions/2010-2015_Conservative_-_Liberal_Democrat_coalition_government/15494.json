        "additional_details": "The government should review the state of football player salaries and recommend a sensible level to prevent what is in effect the formation of a market bubble.  Bankers salaries have been capped and a similar application to footballers would be welcome by any sensible individual for the benefit of the game and to send the message of austerity out to the wider public.  There is arguably one solvent club in UK and possibly Europe (Arsenal) and they are lambested for good budgetary responsibilty when in fact they should be applauded.  As a suggestion a max. \u00a350K per week is more than enough and it would mean players did not switch around unnecassarily for bigger wages and would dilute the concentration of skill at only the top clubs. Sure alternatives renumeration methods will probably accrue but this cap would prevent the decay of football clubs.  Obviously there are risks as foreign clubs will apply different rules but as a leader this strategy would be revolutionary but right. ",
