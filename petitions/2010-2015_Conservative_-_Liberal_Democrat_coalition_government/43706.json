        "additional_details": "Given the disgraceful behaviour of Alex Ferguson in the recent game between Manchester United and Newcastle United on 26.12.12, how can the british people refer to him as a \"Sir\". His subsequent comments regarding Newcastle as a \"wee club in the North East\" are completely outrageous and disrespectful.\r\nKnighthoods must reflect the character of the person e.g. Bobby Robson, not rude and arrogant people like Mr Ferguson's recent behaviour reflects.",
