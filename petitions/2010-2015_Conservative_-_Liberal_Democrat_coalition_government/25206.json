Im sure in the news we've all heard about the \u00a322,000 of tax payers money spent in portraits of a speaker and also the frame costed around 15K. But im sorry i am not going to be paying tax for expensive portraits of MPs when the money could go funding houses, education and health care, i will not sit down and watch irrelevant painting being painted with our money that we pay from hard earned work!. I mean it got nothing to do with running the country i mean looking a invaluable painting of a random person will not rise the economy. ",
