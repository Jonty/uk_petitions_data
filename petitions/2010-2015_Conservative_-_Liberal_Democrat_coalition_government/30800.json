        "additional_details": "John Prescott is on the television constantly since resigning his seat in Hull at the last election (2010). His image is leading hundreds of thousands of Britain's to get up, otherwise unnecessarily, to turn the channel over or turn the T.V. completely off! The government must put a ban on Mr. Prescott (I see no reason to call him a Lord seeing as he stated that he would never take one) going on television and allowing television and radio stations to ask for interviews with him. He continues to spread his message of hypocrisy and lies stemming from the last Labour government, and it should be seen that the government is taking action on people like this from the last government. There's free speech, then there is John Prescott! ",
