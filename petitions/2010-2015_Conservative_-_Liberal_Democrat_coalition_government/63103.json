        "additional_details": "Following on from a recent TV documentary, Dangerous Dogs, it is clear that there is an urgent need to introduce Pet Policies into ALL UK current and new council residential tenancy agreements to stop the unlicenced breeding of dogs and the sale of puppies/dogs from council accomodation.  The policies to be introduced are:\r\n\r\n1. A strict no dog breeding policy.\r\n\r\n2. A strict ban on sale of dogs/puppies. The incomes generated by those partaking in these activities are seldomly disclosed to the HMRC and Benefits Agency, which in itself is fraudulent.\r\n\r\n3. The compulsory neutering of all dogs residing in council owned residential properties.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of such policies will not impact the local authority resources immediately but over time it certainly will, with the notable reduction in stray and abandoned dogs.\r\n",
