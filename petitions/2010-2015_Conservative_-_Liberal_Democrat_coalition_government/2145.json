Signing this petition will help protect our NHS, lobby the Government to take responsibility over the most vulnerable members of our society, and end the ideology of the market and profit as the primary solution to the ills of society. Protect our jobs, our NHS and our right to free health care at the point of delivery.  Privatisation only leads to rising costs and degrading standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
