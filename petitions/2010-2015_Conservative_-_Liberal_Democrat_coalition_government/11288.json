I believe they would they decide based on the spirit of the law, rather than the letter of the law as at present.\r\n\r\nIt should allow common sense to reduce the number of controversial prosecutions in such circumstances as retaliation against anti-social behaviour, and possible over-enthusiastic self-defence.\r\n",
