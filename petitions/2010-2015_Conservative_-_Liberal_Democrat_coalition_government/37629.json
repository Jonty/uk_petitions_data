        "additional_details": "The M6 toll is currently under used, and more crucially, rarely busy. I propose that the speed limit is raised to 80mph. This speed limit will draw more people to use the toll, increasing revenue for the government and the private investers.\r\n\r\nThe road will also be a means to test the 80mph speed limit which was proposed for all motorways across England. As the M6 toll has less traffic, motor collisions are less likely to occur. The raised speed limit and few cars using the road will also allow data to be gathered relating to what causes collisions and crashes, does the extra 10mph cause more people to lose control of their car?\r\n\r\nI propose an 80mph speed limit on the M6 toll.\r\n",
