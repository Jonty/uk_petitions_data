        "additional_details": "We, the petitioners, call on Her Majesty's Government, the Ministry of Defence and specifically the Secretary of State for Defence, to stop cutting the amount of technology, weapons and equipment of the Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.\r\n\r\nWe have not got enough ships, submarines, aircraft, aircraft carriers, army equipment or even serving personnel or officers.\r\n\r\nIf there was another Falklands War, or attack, we might not be able to defend ourselves. The Armed Forces should not have to be attacked by the Government for finances just because of the economic situation.\r\n\r\nThough there are cuts to departments, and there is a lack of funds, we need to keep up our military might and not put finances ahead of the security and protection of the country or our overseas territories.\r\n\r\nWe must stop the crippling internal attack on the Armed Forces by the Ministry of Defence.
