        "additional_details": "\"We all know that every child deserves to have a high quality teacher for every moment in class.\"\r\nThe Government should honour this statement by enforcing legislation making it a legal requirement that every person covering or teaching a class must hold Qualified Teacher Status in line with published regulations, guidance and statements.\r\nSo there is an urgent need for the DfE to revise its latest reforms and maintain the requirement that schools and academies employ staff with QTS to supervise or teach whole classes.\r\nThe government talks about raising standards of teachers in schools.  However, by allowing schools and academies to employ personnel without any teacher training to teach lessons, on both a temporary and permament basis, the government is  betraying the future of the nation's youth.\r\nWe believe the government is putting finance and ideology before the educational needs of young people and so is damaging our education system.\r\n",
