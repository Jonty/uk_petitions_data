        "additional_details": "The current system is unfair; it is wrong that MPs from the devolved nations can vote on purely English matters but English MPs cannot do the same. We need an English parliament that deals purely with English matters, but we should also maintain the Union. Thus, I propose that the UK is redesigned as a federal state; the central UK government would deal with matters affecting the UK as a whole, such as defence and foreign policy, and each country within the Union would have their own national assemblies to deal with their own domestic issues. It may also be pertinent to break England up into smaller federal regions to make governance fairer. ",
