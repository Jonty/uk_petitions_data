It is an official language in countries such as Pakistan, Zimbabwe, Jamaica, papa new guinea and India and its about time that it is given de jure official status - enshrined in law, in it's place of origin.\r\n\r\nWe recommend the government to give English official de jure status as opposed to the de facto status is currently has.",
