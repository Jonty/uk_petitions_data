        "additional_details": "The iconic yellow Search and Rescue Sea King helicopters, based at RAF Lossiemouth, have been a welcome and familiar sight in Scottish skies since 1978. On the 31st March they will be replaced by the new civilian SAR unit at Inverness Airport and will be made redundant. The current plan is for the two aircraft to be flown south to eventually be decommissioned after which they will no longer be flyable. Morayvia wish to purchase one of these aircraft, especially one with few remaining hours and hence less desirable for sale or spares, whilst it is still at Lossiemouth negating a costly road transport if we are successful in our bid. Our aim is to site the aircraft with our other exhibits, including the Nimrod, at our secure location at nearby Kinloss where it will be open to the public to see inside an aircraft which has saved countless lives.\r\nSee www.morayvia.org.uk",
