All people need is a chance of hope.\r\n\r\nA friends son is only 16 months old and might need  a double lung transplant due to his lungs are 80% damaged , there is no guarantee he will be accepted onto the list which we think is unacceptable , the law needs changing to allow hope for all patients.",
