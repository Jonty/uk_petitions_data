        "additional_details": "I would like the government to introduce a law that forced cyclists to have training and  take a compulsory test, wear appropriate safety clothing and helmets and take out insurance in the same way that motorcyclists and car drivers have to. I think its shocking that children and adults can ride on roads alongside 20 ton articulated lorries, buses and speeding cars with no protection whatsoever, other than hoping that the drivers of these vehicles will notice them. They should be held accountable for the accidents they cause due to appalling cycling errors.",
