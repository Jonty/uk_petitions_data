        "additional_details": "Climate Change is widely accepted by scientists as the major environmental challenge facing human civilization. Our children will be left with the consequences of our actions, so it is essential they understand the facts about climate change. They also need this knowledge to be prepared for the impact, and help them find the solutions that will play such a huge role in their futures.\r\n\r\nLearning the basics in science is important, but bare principles sometimes fail to catch the imagination of young students. Climate change is a real-world problem with real-world consequences. Learning about the complexities of the real world will be far more engaging and useful for their lives than studying basic principles alone. We must therefore keep climate change in the school curriculum",
