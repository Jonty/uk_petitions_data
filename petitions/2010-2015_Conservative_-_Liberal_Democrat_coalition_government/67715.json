If you live in a property that has stables and or a sand school, your property may be subject to a non-domestic rating assessment.\r\n\r\nStables, along with exercise arenas can be valued for non-domestic rates, even if the planning permission is for domestic use only.\r\n\r\nI propose that any stables and sand schools that have planning permission for domestic use only should not be subject to non-domestic rates.\r\n",
