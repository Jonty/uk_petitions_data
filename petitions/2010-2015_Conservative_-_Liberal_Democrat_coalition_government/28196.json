        "additional_details": "The Government should go further and reduce the benefits cap to below 26k. People need to take responsibility for their lives and not rely upon the state for handouts to support them. Those who cannot afford to bring up 4+ kids, simple, don't have so many! The state is not a free cash point, and the taxpayer cannot support this lifestyle, it is there to support people in poverty, not people with 42inch tv's who say they can't afford their next meal! Live within your means and not that of the benefits system!",
