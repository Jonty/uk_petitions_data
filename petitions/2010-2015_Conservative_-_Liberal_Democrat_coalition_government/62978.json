On each of these occasions I met fellow patients who had also undergone one or more cancellations.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that NHS trusts are deliberately overbooking theatre slots in order to meet Government waiting lists targets. This practice inevitably leads to distressing cancellations \"in situ\".\r\n\r\nTherefore I would like the Government to launch an enquiry to investigate just how widespread this apparent practice is at a national level and also to consider how  \"robust\" the NHS system of reporting such cancellations is.\r\n",
