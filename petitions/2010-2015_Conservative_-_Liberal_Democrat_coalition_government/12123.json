        "additional_details": "The Law of Joint Enterprise frequently allows innocent people to be convicted of henious crimes such as murder. Dereck Bentley being a prime example. This Law continues to destroy innocent peoples lives, and the lives of their families. Individuals should be held accountable for their criminal actions, not the actions of the sole perpetrator. This law has no place in a self proclaimed civilised society, and we demand that it is revoked.",
