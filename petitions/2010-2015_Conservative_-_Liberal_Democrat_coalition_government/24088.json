As late as February this year armaments were sold to Libya - this is simply unacceptable.\r\n\r\nStricter laws are needed so that only democratic regimes can buy British armaments. Possible requirements to obtain a licence could include: regimes to have a democratic form of government; freedom of speech, assemby and press to exist; and reasonable proof that the armaments will only be used for legitimate security purposes.",
