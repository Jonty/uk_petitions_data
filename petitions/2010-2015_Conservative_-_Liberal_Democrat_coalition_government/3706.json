        "additional_details": "Most Car Parking Zones (CPZ) are money making schemes where councils target a section of society, namely motorist. CPZs satisfy a few selfish people who only want to park outside their houses and not a few houses down. CPZs cause massive environmental damage where house owners dig up their gardens to provide car parking spaces. In many cases beautiful heritage areas, with wildlife, are being destroyed. Public transport cannot cope and cars are a must for many people and to the economy, so stop knocking motorist and start solving parking and traffic stress instead of selling off car parks and putting up restrictions and CPZs.\r\nI want the government to stop the relentless spread of CPZs and along with Local councils start providing useable parking facilities for example park and ride schemes and reasonable priced car parks. Cars will not go away, but the effects of car use can be mitigated if motorists are no longer scapegoats and targeted for revenue.",
