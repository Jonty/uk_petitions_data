Central Government, and also, Local Councils, must be made responsible for their preservation, and, required to deny any planning request, or demolition request, to save our heritage.\r\n\r\nAll too often, these ancient secular structures, fall into the hands of unscrupulous developers,and suffer the fate of demolition, in the guise of progress, or greed. As a culture, we need to recognise the importance of these rare, and historic buildings, and to let them be handed down to posterity, intact, and returned to their former glory. ",
