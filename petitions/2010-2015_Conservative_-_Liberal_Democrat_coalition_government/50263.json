        "additional_details": "Continue to allow under 18's to join the Armed Services. There is a lot of media hype around this topic with overly simplistic views being reported. This is a complex issue and one which cannot be decided on cost alone.\r\nThere are costs associated with our youth going to college and dropping out, there are costs involved in supporting them when not in work and that doesnt even take into account the social and economic impact to the nation of youths out of work.\r\nContinuing to recruit Junior Armed Services Personnel isn\u2019t just about bringing in \u2018boy soldiers\u2019 its about training individuals for the arduous and dangerous task of defending our nation, providing them with a vocational education that they can use in later life and, when all said and done, giving our nation a pool of excellent resources when they come to the end of their tours.\r\nArmed services isn\u2019t for everyone but lets keep it open to those who choose to serve their nation and applaud their bravery and commitment.\r\n",
