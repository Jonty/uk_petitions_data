        "additional_details": "'Lessons will be learned'. A noble statement with a chilling sub-text that inevitably connects with the preventable death of a child. The State assured us that 'Lessons were learned\u2019 following the deaths of Victoria Climbie, Peter Connelly & Daniel Pelka. No doubt 'Lessons will be learned' following the death of Hamzah Khan especially since his mummified body was found not in the realm of a 'developing country' but within an English City. Parliament has not shirked from it responsibility in punishing corporations under The Corporate Manslaughter & Corporate Homicide Act 2007. Now is the time to make sober reading for those of Director level (or equivalent) to face the same consequences. Maybe then they would be more inclined to intervene early enough and their focus would be re-directed from looking up to the next level and down the chain of responsibility to ensure that the tools and working practices exist to collect the often overwhelming intelligence and act before a child dies.",
