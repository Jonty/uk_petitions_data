        "additional_details": "The Government wants to change the law to allow any foreign national to lead British Police Forces by becoming Chief Constable. This is ending centuries old traditions of only British people being able to hold that position. Allowing foreign nationals into the British Police force will risk the security of the country, as well as disadvantage hard working British Police Officers who wish to reach the top of their profession. The Government is wrong to attempt to change the law and should be told.",
