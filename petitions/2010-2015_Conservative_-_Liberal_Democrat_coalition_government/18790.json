        "action": "Fully enforce terms of sex offenders licence on release",
        "additional_details": "Once a sex offender is sentenced and the terms of their release on licence are clearly stipulated, the government should ensure that these are fully adhered to when the offender is released. Too many are being released and the original terms of their licence rescinded almost completely or reduced drastically leaving their victims vulnerable and let down by the justice system. It also leaves other children at risk when these terms are ignored or no longer deemed necessary. These people cannot be 'educated' out of their conditions. We need to fight this to protect existing victims who have suffered and need the system to work for them not against them and also to ensure no new potential victims are made vulnerable.",
