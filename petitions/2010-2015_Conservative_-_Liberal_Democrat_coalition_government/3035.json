        "additional_details": "We request a debate take place in Parliament to show that modern training of nurses as a degree course at a university does not provide sufficient practical experience in the care of patients and  the Royal College of Nursing should acknowledge the fact that the previous training, whereby student nurses were based at one hospital during 3 years to qualification spending only 16% of those years on theory, the rest on the wards and departments dealing  with patients, as opposed to the present system where more than 50% of the time is on theory, moving hospital to hospital. Also the Royal College should accept that, despite the advance in drugs and operative procedures, a patient is  an individual who needs basic care, no matter what the condition being treated. We therefore ask Parliament to ask the Royal College of Nursing to address this  to reconsider nursing training, to return  to that previously employed which produced nurses with a true experience of patient care.",
