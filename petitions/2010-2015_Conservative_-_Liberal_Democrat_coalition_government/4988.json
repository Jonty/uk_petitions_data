        "additional_details": "In view of the current financial situation, abolishing all child benefit would save the country approximately \u00a312 billion a year, plus ending all the other subsidies and credits that encourage human procreation. With a population of 62 million and rising rapidly and nearly 3 million unemployed, why encourage the birth rate even more? Some of the money saved could be channelled into providing free contraception and sterilisation.\r\n\r\nAlso a high rate of VAT should be applied to children\u2019s clothing, shoes and nappies and also on cruelty goods like meat, wool and leather. I would suggest a luxury rate set at say 40%. Some of the money here could be used for animal welfare purposes.\r\n\r\nSo not only will the country's financial problems be solved, but a reduction in population, a better quality of life, less damage to the environment and improved welfare for animals. A win all round.\r\n\r\n",
