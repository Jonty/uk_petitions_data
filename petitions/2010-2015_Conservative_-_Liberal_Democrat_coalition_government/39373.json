        "additional_details": "The government should stop penalising those with physical disabilities because they use mobility aids.  The new benefit to help with mobility says that it's not about why you need to use crutches or a wheelchair rather how much you can do when you use them.\r\n\r\nWe use them to become independant.  This could mean some may no longer lease a new car via MOTABILITY as you must receive the highest rate of the benefit.  The benefit helps you to buy and keep your vehicle on the road.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned reject the assessment criteria of the new benefit and say the government must support physically disabled people to remain independent in order to take part in life and the economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
