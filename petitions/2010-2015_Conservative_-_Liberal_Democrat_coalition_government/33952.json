        "additional_details": "Proposed changes to legislation to allow the Government to access phone numbers, emails and internet searches/websites visited without a warrant are despicable. This draft needs to be stopped in it's tracks before it becomes a white paper.\r\n\r\nThe buzzwords of terrorism and paedophilia are being used to scare people into just accepting the fact that this could become law given the chance. If enough of us put our voice to this petition the government has no choice but to listen to us. They should listen to the voters - many people do NOT want this. It is not the fact that ordinary innocent people are hiding anything, it is the principle of trusting your citizens.\r\n\r\nSign if you understand that we need to be confident in our national security, but not at the expense of the privacy of ordinary people.\r\n\r\n\"People should not be afraid of their governments, the governments should be afraid of their people.\" [V for Vendetta, 2005]",
