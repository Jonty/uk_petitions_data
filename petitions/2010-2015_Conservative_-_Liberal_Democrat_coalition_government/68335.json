        "additional_details": "We want the Government to prove that it has the best interests of the State at heart by preventing the rich and wealthy from passing on their assets to their children. At first this may sound callous but this wealth will then be fairly redistributed in the best interests of the State and its people, consequently reducing crime, poverty and inequality to great effect. This will also lead to more funding for healthcare, public services, better education and future prospects for all of us. The entire country will benefit from this, not just the rich. A real Government is a government which looks after the State and ALL of its citizens, not just the elite and wealthy.",
