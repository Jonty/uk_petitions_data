It is apparent that this movie has caused nothing but immense offence and no apparent benefit to mankind and yet has been targeted directly to the muslim faith in order to malign it. People of the Muslim faith and other Faiths together, side by side support this statement worldwide. We, in its highest form condemns the use of any violence which is taking place throughout the world caused by direct or indirect uploading of this movie. It is a human duty, regardless of being of any faith to stop and oppose the disrespecting of any religion. This movie which makes false misinterpretations of the Muslim faith and has been directly targeted to make mockery of the religion should be removed immediately.",

ISPs have contracts with their customers called good practice Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs), which they have recently strengthened, about what may be hosted on their servers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, complaints about a particular website\u2019s content should first be directed to the site\u2019s manager. Most AUPs already contain a general clause which allows ISPs to remove sites or content which contain offensive or objectionable material, even if it is not illegal."
