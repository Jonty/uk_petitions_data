        "additional_details": "I would like this government to make our National Curriculum encompass political education, making it compulsory in both Key Stages 2 & 3, and an option for pupils to take in both Key Stages 4 & 5 in every school/college.\r\n\r\nThe reason for introducing political education is to ensure that young people are fully aware of this country's democracy and electoral processes to ensure that when they reach the age to vote they are fully aware of what happens, and can make a more informed choice.\r\n\r\nThe subject should cover how to vote, how to register to vote, how the UK Parliament, devolved parliaments (i.e. Northern Ireland Assembly), and local authorities operate as well as the EU, UN, and other aspects of international politics. It should also cover different voting systems, and the Monarchy.\r\n\r\nEach school year should teach more complex issues relating to politics, with Key Stage 2 simply teaching the pure basics of our democracy.",
