Since many of the these scam mails are from England, I want to raise this issue to you seriously; even when I have told the concerned parties that I'm a pauper, why did they exploit me financially? I'm sorry to ask this, is this a racial hatred or impression? Sorry once again.......I apologize to you. Please do the needful.",
