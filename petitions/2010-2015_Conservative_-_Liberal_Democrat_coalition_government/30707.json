        "additional_details": "It has been released that the government intends to introduce private companies into the functioning of the police force.\r\n\r\nThe police force is a public service, and unlike other cases for privatisation, isn't something that can generate money legitimately, and therefore practically removes the so called cost savings. It also introduces a whole set of new problems, involved with vested interests, jurisdiction, accountability and whether a private company will have the public's safety at heart, which should be the main purpose of any police service.\r\n\r\nThe only benefit is to the shareholders of the companies who get the contracts.\r\n\r\nBecause of these reasons, it is unacceptable that any part of the police service should be privatised, or further privatised. It is no less acceptable than the NHS privatisation proposals.\r\n",
