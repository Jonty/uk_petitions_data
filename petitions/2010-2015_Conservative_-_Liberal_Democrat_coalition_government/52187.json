        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to provide grants to ensure 400,000 home in the next 5 years install CHP boilers in their home. This the equivalent of 200 million pounds every year. This will generate 400 MW of electricity during peak usage. As the technology generate electricity when the home gas boiler is used. In addition it will also kick start the industry. As current forecast rates of update it will take 18 years, before the technology becomes common place in the home.\r\nIf this is not possible then all newly built home should have them installed in the home as standard.",
