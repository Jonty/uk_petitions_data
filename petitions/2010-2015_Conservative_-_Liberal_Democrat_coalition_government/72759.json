These cuts have reduced council services to the Elderly, children and the disabled. We have already faced job and wage cuts and there are more planned in the near future.\r\nOn top of the savings we have already identified.

This means that there will be more difficult decisions in the future and work is already underway to address this. challenge\".\r\nWe the voters do not not agree with the way our council tax is unfairly being used to support salaries that will see the executive paid more than the Pime minster whilst we suffer drastic cuts in services.",
