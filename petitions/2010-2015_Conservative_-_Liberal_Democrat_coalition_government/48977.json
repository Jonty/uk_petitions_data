        "additional_details": "The Southbank Centre seemingly wants to refurbish the riverside area of the Southbank , and in the process remove one of the most famous culture spots in London, which has existed since the late 70's.\r\n\r\nThe Southbank skate spot is the most iconic skate spot in all of the UK, and is one of the most symbolic gestures of finding something more out of an area.\r\n\r\nIt is a specific point which distinguishes the Southbank from every other over developed area of Central London, and the process of creating a \"replacement spot\" is not only offensive but misses the entire point of the most iconic symbol of counter culture to be a part of London. To remove this in the place of more shops would be a terrible tragedy and would be one of the biggest mistakes made by the culture department.\r\n\r\nDon't let this happen, it would be a shame for everyone and would scoop out the soul of the Southbank.",
