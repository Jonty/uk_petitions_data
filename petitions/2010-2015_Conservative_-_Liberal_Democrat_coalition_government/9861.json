        "additional_details": "Following the recent riots in England, Parliament has said it will discuss the possibility of seeing what can be done about restricting face coverings in certain situations.  What a feeble way to approach such an issue.  Why don't they ask themselves, what justifiable reason is there for anyone to cover their face in public?  Let's make it an offence for anyone to cover their face in public unless it is on medical grounds, backed up by a doctor's certificate. The penalty - a six month prison sentance for anyone who disobeys it and let's start to show we are a strong nation that won't tolerate such behaviour.",
