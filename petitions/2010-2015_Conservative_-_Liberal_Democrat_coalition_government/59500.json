        "additional_details": "Marijuana has unbelievable powers to those with PD. Without Marijuana, my PD can get terrible and each day becomes a nightmare of emotions and thoughts to deal with. When I'm high, it's as if the weed is lowering brain activity and makes me feel relaxed and calm (Which I rarely ever feel sober). The Marijuana makes it feel like time is slowed, and put's me in a mental state of ease. While I'm high I'm then in a great mood and I enjoy myself a lot.\r\nI guess what I'm saying is that stoner's are the ones who see something more in the use of marijuana, and not just to have a good time. The only real problem is that of being addicted. Anything so simple and powerful is prone to abuse. But that all being said, the amount of pain, emotions and anxieties marijuana can help with makes it a miracle drug for many people with certain mental health problems such as PD.",
