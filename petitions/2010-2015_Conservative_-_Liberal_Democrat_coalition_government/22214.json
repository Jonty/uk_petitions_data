The law state that we can use reasonable force to defend ourselves in our own home, but there is not clear definition of reasonable. If 3 people enter your home and you have no idea if they are armed, you stand no realistic chance of getting out of a physical confrontation in a healthy condition without using a weapon of superior force than that of your intruders.\r\nWhy is it more important to protect criminals than law abiding citizens? Criminals have weapons anyway so it is only the law abiding citizen\u2019s that are unarmed because of this law restricting Taser\u2019s.\r\nTaser\u2019s are not harmful and produce an electric shock that will pacify the intruder for up to 30sec so you can escape and call the police. It will leave no permanent damage to the intruder so you just potentially saved your own and your loved one\u2019s life.\r\nAllow Taser's for home self-defence. ",
