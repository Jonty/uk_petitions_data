Sufferers of hemiplegic migraine should be receiving the same\r\nHelp as a person who has had a stroke because the condition mimics a stroke.  Having spoken to many other sufferers they are finding it hard to find help from the government.\r\n\r\nWe believe that hemiplegic migraine should not be treated as a normal head pain rather it should be dealt with the same help and process as a stroke patient.\r\n",
