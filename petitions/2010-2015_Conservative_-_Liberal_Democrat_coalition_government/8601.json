        "additional_details": "Instead of filling already overloaded prisons, the training skills of the British Army and the surplus accommodation of barracks through reduced Armed Forces staffing, should be put to use to engage the minds and talents of those able to co-ordinate mass thieving to a more productive and socially acceptable end.\r\n\r\nThe Army has great experience in shaping young people for a focussed and effective delivery of a campaign.  In this case that campaign should be to tidy up the UK dealing with derelict land, dumped rubbish, eyesores, renovation of decay etc.  With such a task force we might get the UK looking much cleaner - almost like Switzerland?\r\n\r\nThe end product. Young adults with self esteem and a new outlook on life rather than criminals with enhanced address book and skills from tuteledge of 'Mr Bridger'  et seq\r\n\r\n(as this bridges many Ministries it goes to Cabinet) ",
