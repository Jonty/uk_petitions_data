        "additional_details": "When you buy goods or services, your legal rights are protected by laws such as the Goods & Services Act, the Consumer Credit Act, Consumer Rights Act and so on.\r\nIf the goods are faulty or the supplier reneges on the agreement legal action can be taken.\r\n\r\nPolitical parties provide the public a manifesto. I understand many people vote for a party they like, but the manifesto lays out what they are going to do during the term of their government.\r\n\r\nSurely that's a legally binding agreement. If a coalition government is formed then that government should produce a new Coalition manifesto within 6 months of gaining power.\r\n\r\nIf we can take a company to court for breaking an agreement then why not hold political parties to account. Let's call it greater transparency!!",
