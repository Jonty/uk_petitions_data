        "additional_details": "For over 30 years the residents of Mottram, Hollingworth, Tintwistle, Hadfield, Padfield, Simmondley and Glossop have suffered the most appalling traffic congestion that is doing untold environmental damage!\r\n\r\nMottram Moor is the only place in the UK where you have to queue in traffic on a Sunday Morning and if something isn't done soon, the whole area will grind to a halt! The continuous suspension of the approval and building of a bypass is long overdue for the UKs busiest stretch of road. The Government needs to approve this scheme without further delay or consultation and make the funds available now without any more excuses.\r\n\r\nThe residents have suffered enough and deserve this relief road",
