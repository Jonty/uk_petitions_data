        "additional_details": "UK yachtsmen are entitled to purchase and use reduced duty red diesel to propel their craft in UK waters but HMRC now want yachtsmen to sign a declaration stating that this legally purchased diesel will not be used in foreign waters.\r\n\r\nThe HMRC proposals are unworkable because:\r\n1. UK marinas only sell red diesel\r\n2. sailing boats fill up diesel tanks irregularly due to their use of wind to propel them\r\n3. even if white diesel is purchased abroad, if there is a trace of red diesel in the tank, boat owners risk heavy fines.\r\n\r\nIf this proposal is brought into law, UK boats will be unable to sail across the Channel without risk of heavy fines on arrival.\r\n\r\nWe urge HMRC to drop the proposal. The UK Government should challenge the European Parliament to continue to allow UK leisure craft to use red diesel purchased legally in the UK to propel their craft both inside and outside UK waters.\r\n\r\n",
