        "additional_details": "When you sign a mobile phone contract you sign up to unlimited laibility if the phone is lost or stolen.Meaning you are liable for all calls  made between losing it and reporting it lost or stolen to the company.\r\nThis can be thousands of pounds  as there is no automatic cutting off  the phone in the event  of an  unusual pattern or higher than normal call usage or cost. There can also be a delay if the phone is lost abroad.\r\nMobile phone companies are very unsympathettic and will send the debt collectors after you\r\n\r\nOFCOM the phone regulator is  supposed to be looking into this from the consumer point of view but slow progress and nothing is happening.\r\nI want the government to speed this up and get legislation in place as soon as possible to ensure the companies have to set  credit limits .If the banks can do this  with stolen bank cardswhy not the phone companies?",
