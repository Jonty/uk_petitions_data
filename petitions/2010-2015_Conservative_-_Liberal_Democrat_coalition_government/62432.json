If we are given the opportunity for an in-out referendum regarding our membership of the EU, how is it the citizens of the Crimea are denied the same opportunity?\r\n\r\nThis petition is for the full, free and fair referendum for the peoples of Crimea to adjudicate on their self-determination without interference from ANY third-party.\r\n\r\nAny other position taken by the British Government is the height of hypocrisy ",
