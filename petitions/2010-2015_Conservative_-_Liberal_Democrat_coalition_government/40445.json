        "additional_details": "Mosquito Alarms could be damaging to the ears of babies, toddlers, and young people up to age 25.  It was designed as an anti-loitering device and emits a pulsating high pitched noise that irritates ALL young ears and cannot be heard by adults. The noise is entirely indiscriminate and is an infringement of civil liberties.\r\nThe damage it can cause to babies, toddlers and growing children\u2019s ears is NOT YET KNOWN.\r\nThe device that instigated this petition affected one of my children\u2019s ears so much so that when he cycled past the house the distraction caused him to fall off his bike.\r\nThis house is less than 5 metres away from the entrance to a children\u2019s play area; the road is a main access route for children to attend the high school.  If every house in that street had one the road would be impassable for young people.\r\nWe want the Government to either propose a ban of their use in residential areas or regulate them for late night use only.",
