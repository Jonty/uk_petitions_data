In line with most European countries, British children should be taught a second language in primary school, from the same age as basic literacy and numeracy. Mastering a new language is difficult for most adults; languages are learned more easily and naturally by young children. Moreover, scientific research has shown that those fluent in more than one language are less likely to become senile in old age, owing to the greater redundancy in their brains.",
