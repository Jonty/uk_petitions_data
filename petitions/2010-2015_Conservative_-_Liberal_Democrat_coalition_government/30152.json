Is this because we are still considered as the property of our parents? It is important that 21st century\u2019s youngsters should be given an opportunity to shape their own future by letting them \u2018\u2019have a say\u2019\u2019 on decision making of the country. And this is possible by handing them the right to vote in public elections.\r\nWe are allowed to\r\n*join the armed forces\r\n*get married /consent to sexual relationships\r\n*become a director of a company/ join trade union\r\n*pay income tax and national insurance- Can taxation without representation be fair?\r\nCountry like a Germany, which is among the top democratic countries in the world has handed its 16 yeared citizens the right to vote: so why not the UK?\r\n\u2018\u2019 Yes I am a big supporter of votes at 16. The state can ask a 16 year old to fight and die for this country, why not vote too?\u2019\u2019-Nick Clegg",
