        "additional_details": "I've started the petition because I find it extremely unfair that working families receive no 2 year free child care unless they are on a low income yet people receiving benefits receive it. How can anyone say that's fair? These people on benefits get there rent paid,  council tax paid, money for free, free milk tokens, free childcare etc yet if you go out to work you get none of it. It's disgusting. My 2 year old son is now missing out on this free 2 year education because my husband works and has a good job. I cant go to work because I have 2 children that would need full time childcare and we've been advised we would get no help so my wage would barely cover it. We can't afford to send my son to nursery off the 1 wage because that would mean the rent wouldn't get paid. It's just wrong. People on benefits who are capable to work should be given very minimal help. Just given enough money to live and I would like to see all this extra help going to ALL working families.",
