Rejecting their claims for compensation is an insult to the loyalty and service they gave to their country. Refusal to deal with their just claims in a fair and equal manner is abhorrent, when we can find funds to compensate criminals, terrorists and people with little more than hurt feelings. It shames us all and it needs fixing.  ",
