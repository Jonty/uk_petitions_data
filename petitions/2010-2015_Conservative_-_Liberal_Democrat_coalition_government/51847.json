        "additional_details": "Recently the local parks football goals have been removed due to numerous complaints by home owners, the football goals have been there for years, years before these people decided to build there house directly behind a football pitch! How can the government expect to encourage children to excercise when they are constantly taking away the facilities and locking them away in a container which by the way is the most hideous eyesore ive ever seen! If you want to bring back the goals sign the petition below! ",
