        "additional_details": "Russian punk band \"Pussy Riot\" desecrated an Orthodox Church in 2012 in Moscow. It is Moscow's most important Orthodox cathedral, dedicated to Christ the Savior; it had once been destroyed by Stalin when the USSR officially persecuted Orthodoxy and religion.\r\n\r\nThe three members have been convicted of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred, by due process in criminal proceedings, and have been sentenced to two years' imprisonment.\r\n\r\nTheir acts were hugely offenseive to Orthodox Christians and they have been punished aptly. Nevertheless, there has been widespread support for these vile actions including from the EP.\r\n\r\nI ask that the Commons debate this, and move to bring this to the European Parliament, to pressure it to change its mind about nominating them for the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought; there was no \"free thinking\" in their behavior, only sickness.\r\n\r\n ",
