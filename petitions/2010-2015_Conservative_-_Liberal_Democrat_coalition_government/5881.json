        "additional_details": "Most food and drink for human consumption is zero-rated for VAT purposes, but fruit juice is not. Other food groups which are not zero-rated tend to be 'less healthy' options such as fizzy drinks or crisps and salted snacks. Removing VAT on fruit juice would make it a more affordable and would therefore allow people (especially those on low incomes) to meet their recommended 5-a-day intake of fruit and vegetables more easily. This is particularly important for children, who will often drink fruit juice even if they are reluctant to eat fruit and vegetables.",
