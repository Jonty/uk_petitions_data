If a carer has cared for a family member for five years or more they have already saved the government an enormous sum of money, because if the dependent relative had been cared for in an institution during those five years their share of the property would already have been used up in residential or nursing home fees. Proceeds from the sale of a shared property should then go to the carer not to the government, The carers home should be secure for them,after caring ceases, in recognition of the service they provided. If after five years or more the situation deteriorates and the carer can no longer cope neccesitating the dependent relatives admission to a nursing home, it should then be paid for by the government in recognition of the services already provided by the carer during the previous long term care..
