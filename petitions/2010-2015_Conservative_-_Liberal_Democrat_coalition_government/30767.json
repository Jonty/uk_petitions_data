It would also give them \"dignity\".\r\nBeing employed enables you to contribute to society, pay income tax, have money to spend which in turn will boost the economy and also create even more revenue for the Treasury through VAT.\r\nThe EU is dictating \"Austerity and Liberalisation\".\r\nWhat gives these Dictats in the EU Parliament the right to destroy the UK economy?\r\nGive the electorate of the UK the chance to vote on \"Membership of the EU\".\r\nThis has to be ASAP before the damage that will be caused by these cuts goes beyond repair.
