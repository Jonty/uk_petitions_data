        "additional_details": "Petition to create a new system of Jails.\r\n\r\nJails would be run like police custody suites  with custody procedures similar to those introduced in the PACE act 1984. Jails would be designed to hold up to 1000 inmates.\r\n\r\nAfter a suspect has been through the police, instead of releasing them on immediate bail or police bail to wait for a court hearing, the suspects would be presented to a panel of Magistrates, but special magistrates that would decided whether the suspect should be immediately put on bail or to jail.\r\nThe decision to place them in jail would be designed to eliminate the risk of reoffending on the community ,public protection and to ease  pressure on Courts. Criminal background would be taken into account.\r\nPotentially have one jail in each Force Area.\r\nThe Jailed suspect would remain there until their trial or if they could afford. They would pay a large sum to be released on bail with condition set by a court. This would recover some of the cost of running Jails.",
