        "additional_details": "I would like the Gov't to ban all plastic can/bottle holders (connectors) used on six packs etc. These are often left lying around and both on land and in the sea can trap wild life/ domestic pets/ and farm animals causing them great distress and sometimes serious injury and even death. They are not essential. Cardboard packaging has been used for years and is the best environmental alternative but shrink wrap is also usable and not a 'trap'. ",
