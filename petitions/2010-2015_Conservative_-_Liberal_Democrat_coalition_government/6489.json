        "additional_details": "The people of England should be given a say by way of a referendum on whether NIreland should continue to be part of UK and/or continue to be subsidised by the UK taxpayer. It is now almost 15 years since the GFA. NIreland is now an independent political entity with it's own devolved government and legislative assembly. It is no longer the responsibility of the UK however it is an expensive drain on the UK economy and taxpayer.\r\nI propose that a referendum is held for the citizens/residents/taxpayers of England only as the other constituent countries of the UK have their own devolved governments and it would be counter productive to ballot them as they have a vested interest in continued subsidy form Westmister.
