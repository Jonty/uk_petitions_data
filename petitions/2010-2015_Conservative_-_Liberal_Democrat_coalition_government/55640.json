The Storybus promotes the joys of reading and the fun that it can bring for parent and child it's a beautiful bus and a much more fun experience than a library where you feel you and your child have to stay quiet at all times. The staff are lovely the toys are fun and educational you get prizes which is always great and we don't want it to close, so please show your support an sign this petition. Thank you",
