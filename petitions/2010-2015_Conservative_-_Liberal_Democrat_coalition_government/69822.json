This forces the CV to be submitted in a narrow scope word processing format despite have no relation to evolving CV submission techniques such as social media web pages, PDF files, and so on which are equally good, if not better.\r\n\r\nCurrent practice is descending into sham with examples such as sending a doctor's CV for an engineering post through keyword matching.\r\n\r\nThe candidates deserve better. The employers deserve better.\r\n\r\nChange the regulation for recruitment companies so that they interview the candidate at least once for 10 minutes before forwarding a CV. Additionally compel recruitment agencies to list their CV processing formats in all job listings so that employers and candidates can filter recruitment agencies according to new media formats they are able to handle.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
