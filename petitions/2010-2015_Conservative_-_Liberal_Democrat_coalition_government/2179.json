        "additional_details": "Squatting has incurred home owners tens of thousands of pounds in damages. UK has become the squatting capital of Europe. Its ridiculous that in a free country I cannot leave my house and go for a holiday without worrying all the time of it being taken over by some Eastern European immigrants or so called Art patrons. I want complete freedom of mind when I leave my home. I have worked very hard to be able to afford a small house. Please help me get enough signatures to make squatting a criminal offence.",
