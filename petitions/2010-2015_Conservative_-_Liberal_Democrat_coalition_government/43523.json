        "additional_details": "With more and more people coming out as gay or lesbian at younger ages, i believe it is time we taught safe sex for homosexuals in sex education classes at schools.\r\n\r\nCurrently homosexuality is not taught in school leaving many gay teens confused and lost about where they can go for safe sex advice, which many have to learn from thier GP even for things as basic as, where can i buy gay condoms from?\r\n\r\nThe benefits of teaching safe sex for homosexual teens would improve the health of homosexual couples.\r\nFor a start if gay teens were taught about safe sex, they would be more likey to practice it, lowering the numbers of STI's transfered  between gay couples.\r\nIt would also ease the pressure on teens who want to come out.\r\nIt may also lower the numbers of homophobic bullying cases in schools.\r\n\r\nSafe sex should be taught in schools for all sexualities beacuse a lack of education is what is spreading infections and fear through the gay community.",
