        "additional_details": "On 7 Feb 2013, the Dept for Education issued a consultation paper recommending Yr 4 pupils (age 8) be taught evolution as a proven scientific fact. Currently this is only in the National Curriculum for Yr 10 pupils (age 14).\r\n\r\nIn a Gallup Poll on the topic (May 2012), 46% agreed with this statement: \"God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time during the last 10,000 years or so\". Only 1% more, 47%, agreed with this statement: \"Human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life\".\r\n\r\nIt is wrong to force any student to deny an explanation for origins accepted by half the population.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there are many valid scientific arguments from biology, geology, physics and other disciplines in support of the creationist explanation of origins.\r\n\r\nThe Department for Education should require both explanations to be taught alongside each other, with teachers explaining the evidential pros and cons of both sides of the debate.\r\n\r\n",
