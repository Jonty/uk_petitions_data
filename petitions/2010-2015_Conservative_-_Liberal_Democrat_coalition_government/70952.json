        "additional_details": "The claims made by car manufacturers official MPG figure are becoming increasingly outlandish and no longer represent real world driving. There is also no consistency in the variation between the official and real world figures, with some only achieving 70%, some getting to 130%. The government should establish a standardised test using real world driving conditions that all manufacturers would have to use. This would provide consistency and allow the figures to be used to make objective assessments between cars.",
