        "additional_details": "If the British government involves Britain in the ongoing conflict in Syria, it will go to the level of military intervention, like in Libya as a no-fly-zone has been set up over the county and the Royal air Force sent in to destroy Libyan military structures. we can not let the British government involve our armed forces in another conflict over seas. ITS A WASTE OF MILITARY RESOURCES,PERSONAL AND MONEY. Britain is stretched to the limit, fighting 2 on-going conflicts - Afghanistan and Libya. Is it really a good idea to be involved in a third?. I say enough is enough.    ",
