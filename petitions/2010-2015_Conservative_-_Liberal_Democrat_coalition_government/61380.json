        "additional_details": "In the current climate of austerity, imposed by the Conservative / Liberal Democrat coalition, we object to the treasury giving UK tax payers money to the Ukraine while imposing Dickensian levels of poverty and hardship on the poorest and most disadvantaged members of British society. Until the cost of living for UK residents is reduced to a more manageable level the government should direct any surplus monies to helping the population of the UK. To do otherwise is contrary to the wishes of the general population and it would be undemocratic to continue foreign aid while the Uk populace continues to suffer.",
