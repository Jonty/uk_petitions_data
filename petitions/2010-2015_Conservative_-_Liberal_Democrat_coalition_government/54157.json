        "additional_details": "I think the country will save a lot of money for those that just need a car for being taken to the hospital or shopping if they were just given access to a pool of good condition secondhand cars that could be loaned free when needed.\r\n\r\nMany of those full time FREE cars end up being given to someone in the family that gets the full-time benefit of a free car, while other hard working citizens struggle to afford anything! Now and again they will go and get the shopping or run them to a hospital appointment.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I don't see what the problem is letting them share good condition second hand cars, those that have been a hire car for two years for example.\r\n\r\nI see many FREE top of the range disabled cars driving around... but I very rarely see any disabled person being transported in them.\r\n\r\nThis country has given enough to free loaders for long enough. Time to be realistic.\r\n",
