Building storage would cost the water companies money - but they would gain nothing from it.\r\nBanning hoses actually saves the water companies huge amounts of money as they do not have to pump or purify the water - hence with a hoepipe ban in place, and no reductions in bills they make lots of money.\r\nThis has to change - we have global warming to deal with!",
