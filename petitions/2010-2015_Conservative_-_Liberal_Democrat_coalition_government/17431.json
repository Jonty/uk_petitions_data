        "additional_details": "This petition is to ensure that people with company cars who are given a fuel card for company use are paying for what they use (through private/company mileage records)\r\nAt the moment everyone given a fuel card has to pay tax at a rate solely based on the type of company car.\r\nThis does not take into account the actual amount of usage by the user.\r\nThis means that someone doing 1000 private miles will pay the same as someone doing 10000 private miles.\r\nAdditionally, the current system does not discourage unnecessary driving and reward people who drive less which is bad for congestion and the environment.\r\nI would like the government to take recorded private miles into account when calculating this tax so that the tax is fairer to those doing lower mileage.\r\nThis could be either prior tyo tax being taken or as a claimable rebate at the end of the tax year.\r\n",
