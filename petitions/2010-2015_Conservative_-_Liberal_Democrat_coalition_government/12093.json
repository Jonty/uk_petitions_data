        "additional_details": "The House of Lords should be elected and not have MP's who have served in Government automatically entering the House. An example would be John Prescott, part of a Government that was corrupt to the core and also took advantage of his position within Government. as well as those who become Lords through family and are hiers to titles again they should seek election not have the position handed to them. The good of the country depends on law making and decisions made by these people, if they are not capable of garnering trust by election then surely they are not capable of making such decisions.",
