        "additional_details": "There is confusion about the correct name of our national flag. Until recently Union Jack was universally used. The public sector and the BBC now often use the alternative but until recently seldom heard Union Flag.\r\n\r\nSome believe that 'Jack' should only be used when the flag is flown at sea but this is a recent idea. The term Union Jack possibly dates from Queen Anne's time but its origin is lost in time. It may come from the 'jack-et' of the soldiers, or from the name of James I who originated the first union in 1603.\r\n\r\n\u2018Union Flag\u2019 is uninspiring \u2013 whereas \u2018Union Jack\u2019 is a rich name full of character: one that other nations know our flag by. It is correct through common usage over centuries.\r\n\r\nFor clarification a Flag Act should be enacted to confirm the name \u2018Union Jack\u2019 as the national flag of the United Kingdom. After 400 years it's time to clarify the situation & ensure that the Union Jack is preserved for ever in common usage.",
