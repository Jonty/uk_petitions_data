My brother did not have the same support and it seems many men live with the legacy of abuse on their own because of lack of services.\r\n\r\nI would like to see:\r\nMore funding to provide specialist counselling and therapy services for male survivors of CSA.\r\nA dedicated 24 hour helpline service for men suffering domestic violence.\r\nRefuges/safe houses for men needing to escape domestic violence.\r\nRape crisis centres to support men and boys.\r\nA perpetrator scheme for all domestic violence perpetrators.\r\nCampaigns aimed at ending domestic violence to be gender neutral.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo victim deserves to be left behind.
