Shouldn't we, as the majority law abiding British citizens know who has been defaming the British brand. The newspapers have been tracking certain individuals but given the vast numbers, the British public will never know who are these violent thugs who live in our midst. I call on the government to publish the names, photos and ages of all those convicted of violence in relation to the current violent unrest on the Internet. We don't want vigilante behaviours, but we have a right to know who our rotten apples are. ",
