        "additional_details": "ACTION CHANGES to Section 9\r\nInclude more descriptive codes of practice for domestic pet rabbits (non-breeding stock), kept outside in confinement, between the weight of 3lb and 12lb;\r\n\r\nACTION ONE: Be housed in a space of no less than 6ft x 2ft x 3ft & in a  secure run of no less than 6ft x 10ft x 3ft.\r\n\r\nACTION TWO: Be kept with at least one other rabbit. (Both spayed/neutered by a professional vetinarian) and not housed with a different species. (It should also be advised that any rabbit housed in confinement be allowed to interact/play with other rabbits and humans at least 4 hours every day).\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\nRabbits are still not living to their full potential (teenage years) which shows a continued misunderstanding, proving existing legislation is NOT sufficient. Additional, more detailed, guidelines, laws and codes of practice should be introduced and enforced as a matter of urgency.   ",
