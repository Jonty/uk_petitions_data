        "additional_details": "I would like to petition the Government to introduce techniques for conflict resolution into the school curriculum and introduce therapy and conflict resolution workshops as the basis for solving child custody disputes.Teaching children healthy relationships from the beginning and giving them the tools to resolve conflicts amicably will build better relationships, reduce domestic violence and bullying in the long term. Introducing workshops based on Non violent communication and dialectical behaviour therapy will help parents to control emotions and understand each other and problem solve without conflict reducing anxiety in children with seperated parents.  These workshops should be compulsory before mediation takes place. The drive is to move to a therapy based approach and avoid destructive court battles.",
