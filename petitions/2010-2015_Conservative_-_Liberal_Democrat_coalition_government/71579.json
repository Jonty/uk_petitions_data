        "additional_details": "Stop unlicensed breeders breeding & introduce dog licensing laws. We currently have a staggering 100,000 dogs in rescues in the UK with the number growing daily. We are seeing dogs dumped & abandoned to rescues which get no government financial help, Staffordshire Bull Terriers literally being bred to death & the government doing nothing to tackle the problem. Please sign this petition to bring to the attention of the government that more needs to be done to protect dogs in the UK & stop unlicensed breeders from breeding. Thank you ",
