        "additional_details": "It appears that the many childrens charities in the UK are in \"competition\" with each other. This is  demonstrated by all the advertising seen and even the charity rules that restrict people/volunteers being involved with more than one charity, as this is seen as a \"conflict of interest\"\r\nEach charity incurs its own internal costs including advertising, marketing, HR, legal and financial support roles, and the gifting public is faced with the difficult choice of which charity to donate to.\r\nIf all UK childrens charities were consolidated into one then its internal costs could be greatly reduced, resulting in more of the gifted funds going directly to the care and support of the children who need it the most. This would also create a greater and most importantly, consolidated focus on the areas that need the most support. A consolidated board of directors would ensure the charity had a far reaching and clear policy so the gifting public knew where the funds are going.",
