Some specified dog keepers may be banned (& recorded online) by courts to be the registered keeper of certain dogs for a specified period of time. Irresponsible dog owners do play a part in a dog\u2019s behaviour. Genetics, as well as the training/socialisation of a dog does play a part in determining whether a particular dog is dangerous or not. It is irresponsible to leave large dogs unsupervised with human babies. Dogs (as well as the owners) should be properly trained and excluded from potentially dangerous situations by their owners. ",
