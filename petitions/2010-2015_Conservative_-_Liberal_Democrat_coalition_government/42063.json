        "action": "10% UK turnover tax on international companies",
        "additional_details": "This petition requests the Chancellor to levy a minimum corporation tax of 10% on the UK turnover of international companies. To reduce complexity, this would apply only to international companies whose UK turnover exceeds \u00a310million.\r\n\r\nRecent debate hasd focused on perfectly legal international trading arrangements for companies such as Starbucks or Amazon whereby intellectual property and licencing arrangements reduce the profitability for UK trading,despite the large turnover that would otherwise indicate the availability of large corporatioln tax payments.\r\n\r\nThis petition removes these incentives and devices by levying a minimum corporation tax of 10% UK  turnover for these large international corporations.",
