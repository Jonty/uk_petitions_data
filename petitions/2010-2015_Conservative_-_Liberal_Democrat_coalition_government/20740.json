        "additional_details": "Members of the House of Commons are elected to express and represent the wishes of their constituents. The three line whip negates that duty - as it usually forces  MPs to vote for party and career over constituency and conscience; eroding the concept of democratic representation. 100,000 people signed an e-petition requesting a referendum on the EU - yet all 3 political parties had a 3 line whip ordering their MPs to vote against the petition. That is hardly a Parliament representing the wishes of the people. The 3 line whip takes sovereignty away from Parliament and gives it to the executive. This should be reversed ;any future use of the whip should prevent the whipper from holding ministerial office for a minimum of 2 years, while excessive use should result in dismissal from Parliament for breach of fundamental democratic principles.",
