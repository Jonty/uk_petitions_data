There should be a clinic or emergency service that people can go to when the feel they have a dvt or pe coming on. I myself have thrombophilia and lupus anticoagulant and each time i get a symptom the dread of a&e puts me off getting checked. Its my husband and mum who make me go potentially saving my life! Dvt is a killer this needs to happen!",
