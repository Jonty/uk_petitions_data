And I'm not alone.\r\n\r\nThe amount of performers who struggle to develop their act or skills due to the cost of travel is massive.\r\n\r\nThere's a student pass & a pass for 18-25 year olds but nothing for performers who (often) have had to take up low paying jobs to focus on their skill / craft/ act.\r\n\r\nWe'd love to discuss a way that travel all over the uk could be more affordable for comedians & other working performers.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy love live shows (or are a comedian / performer) please sign to help struggling artists.",
