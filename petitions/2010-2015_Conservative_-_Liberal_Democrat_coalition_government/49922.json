People seem to deem it acceptable to write anything in all capital letters to emphasise a point, even petitions on this site have been written in such a manner. The fact is that far from emphasising anything it simply infuriates the reader as reading all capitals letters is much harder than reading the correctly written text. So we the undersigned petition the government of this country to make it a criminal offence to type a sentence in all capitals or misuse an apostrophe. There's no excuse for it, education is free in this county so you should have learned better!",
