On a daily basis it is evident the press are distorting public perception and opinion of organisations, individuals and government affairs and situations - which is not in the best interest of the public.\r\n\r\nBring forth legislation that fairly and in a balanced manner, regulates the press to ensure objective and good-purpose journalism is forefront in journalism and that invading people's privacy is illegal and misconstruing or portraying particular events, situations, organisations or individuals in an incorrect or negative manner must be legally corrected by a correction in the same font formats as the offending article on the same page(s) to inform of what they did wrong.",
