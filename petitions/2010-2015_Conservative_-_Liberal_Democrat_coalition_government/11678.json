        "additional_details": "The NHS is in crisis, but it is a crisis that has been created by successive governments over the last 30 years. The ideology of privatisation - Internal markets and PFI schemes - have imposed unnecessary costs on the organisation and swallowed up much of the extra funding that has been pumped in. Outsourcing of services such as cleaning have resulted in dirtier hospitals and a poorer service for patients.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to:\r\n* Scrap the current Health and Social Care bill, as called for by the annual representative meeting of the British Medical Association.\r\n* Commit to a comprehensive, publicly funded and publicly provided National Health Service, free at the point of use.\r\n* Ensure best value for the tax payer by funding all new projects directly, rather than via PFI schemes.\r\n* Recognise that promoting, or removing barriers to, competition, is not a valid part of the role of body regulating health services.",
