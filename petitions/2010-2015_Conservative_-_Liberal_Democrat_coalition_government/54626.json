This means a child could be given a sentence higher than the average life expectancy without parole until the time is served on the life sentence.\r\n\r\nWe call on Her Majesty's Government to make the maximum sentence for a person aged 10-18 years of age life imprisonment with 25 years until parole.\r\n\r\nThis means that in a life imprisonment case a child can defiantly be given a chance to have parole.\r\n\r\nThankfully life imprisonment without parole (whole life order) is by law not applicable for persons under 21 years of age.
