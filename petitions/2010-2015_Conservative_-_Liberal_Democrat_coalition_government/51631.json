        "additional_details": "This is a petition to call on David Cameron, William Hague, and other members of the British government not to arm the Syrian rebels.\r\n\r\nYou cannot ask us to tighten our belts, cut benefits, reduce government spending etc simply to use the British taxpayers money to fund Syrian rebels.\r\n\r\nThe innocent lives in Syria don't need arms flowing into their country, what they need is humanitarian aid.  If we, as a country, can provide any assistance, it should only be along these lines.\r\n\r\nThere is a rebel group called Al-nusra, who have allied themselves to Al-Qaeda, a group British forces have been fighting for over 10 years, and we cannot besmirch the memories of the brave men and women who fought and died in that cause.  Just recently it was reported that Syrian rebels killed a young boy for blasphemy.\r\n\r\nIf you want to stop the Syrian civil war, work with the international community, provide tables and chairs to enable the talks to begin.\r\n\r\nPeace not war ",
