        "additional_details": "Give town councils the power to use planning process to protect the diversity and individual character of town centres. Currently multiple retailers are able to set up in high streets regardless of the impact on independent retailers. Planning authorities are not currently able to prevent this happening and as such many towns centres are becoming clone towns. Similarly many pubs are being converted to convenience stores owned by multiple retailers with little consideration of their long term impact on the community.\r\nSpecifically we would like to see:\r\n1. Town councils gain right to designate their town centre for diversity protection\r\n2. Impact on the character of the town to become a legitimate reason for rejecting an application in towns designated for diversity protection\r\n3. All retailers wishing to locate in designated towns required to submit planning application\r\n4. Move from public house to other form of retail to be regarded as a change of use",
