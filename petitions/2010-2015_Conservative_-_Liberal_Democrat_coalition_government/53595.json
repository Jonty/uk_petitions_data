We believe that putting the onus on these social media sites to monitor reported abuse raises a conflict of interest and thus independent monitoring and administration is required.  We want the government to enforce social media sites to link to independent support services were education is provided on e-security, and emotional support is available.  Allowing for the worst cases to be identified and forwarded to the correct authorities instantly.  Social media sites who make millions have a moral and social obligation to fund these services.",
