There is nothing locally much quite like it,and its time to change the thinking on their needs and must haves. It is there social environment and my severly autistic son of 7 years loves it!!\r\nPlease Stop the cuts and give more resources and give the children their sense of belonging in our alienated environment. Our Children need us to stand up for them and say stop enough is enough!! Some of them cannot talk recognisable words like my son so how must that affect him? ' I am his voice '!! these 160 children need this don't take it away. ",
