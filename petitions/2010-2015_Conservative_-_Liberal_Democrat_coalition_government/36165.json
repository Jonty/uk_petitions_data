        "additional_details": "As with all business transactions, it would seem obvious that the contract between her majesty and the private security companies policing the olympic games in london, would have some sort of penalty clauses. The military budget is already stretched and simple recompense to the public purse in the form of a bill from the MOD to G4S would be sensible in order that the resources used to 'fill the gap' should be funded outside of the tight budget that covers defence. For anyone that wonders , this is not a mercenary situation , this is simple and straight and involves a lot of easily overlooked expenses. Bear in mind that the MOD looks after its personel. Cancelled holidays will be compensated, troops will be fed, administration will be costly. The bill is more than just renting a few buses and throwing up a few camp beds, vote to put this thing into the hands of the politicians and lets see a debate which will send a message...............dont bite off more than you can chew.
