        "additional_details": "Britain is becoming overwhelmed by the effect of the increase in eating disorder cases. The government is under pressure financially and morally to adapt hospitals and the equipment to cater for obese patients as well as for the research into aiding the illnesses caused by the eating disorder. Yet whilst faced with the pressure of the obese, they are also failing to acknowledge the extreme opposite; those suffering with anorexia and bulimia, who are being failed daily to be recognised unless their weight reaches a critical level, by which time their mental state is at its severest and almost irreversible. If the government can\u2019t extend their hands far enough people need to have the knowledge themselves, to save themselves and those around them, and to do so is to be given a thorough scientific and psychological analysis of eating disorders through the education system.",
