        "additional_details": "It has become noticable that many organisations winning tenders for construction are utilising their own staff from outside the local area.  This in turn is causing deprivation and not regeneration.\r\n\r\nIt is a view that Contractors who win business from local tenders should utilise the skills sets within the local area and not from across the Country.\r\n\r\nTherefore we would expect that a successful contractor be mandated to utilise a minimum of 80% on site staff from the local area.\r\n\r\nThose found not undertaking this should have there tender removed and it be given to the next preferred organisation.",
