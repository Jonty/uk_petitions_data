        "action": "To urge China ban children begging on the streets and to impose stronger penalties on the traffickers of children",
        "additional_details": "Begging by children on the streets in China is heartbreaking. Most of these children are bought or kidnapped by traffickers. Many are subject to extreme abuse and in some cases are cruelly mutilated blinded or have limbs amputated to make them better earners for these criminals. The immediate cause of this tragedy is ineffective law enforcement against these criminals for their brutality. Under the current criminal code, they face as few as three and at most seven years in jail.\r\nTo protect the children, we petition the British government to raise these issues with the government of China in diplomatic and ministerial talks to urge the Chinese government to act to ban child begging on the streets and to impose stronger deterrents for child traffickers.\r\nFor more information, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.chinese-traditions-and-culture.com/beggars_in_China.html\r\nhttp://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1452514/investigative-report-highlights-plight-dongguans-disabled-beggar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
