        "additional_details": "My parent - the hand that first held mine - now holds my hand, needing reassurance and nurturing from this \u2018evil world\u2019.\r\n\r\nAlzheimer's sufferers do not just live with loss of memory; they fear this world.\r\n\r\nThe lack of funding, trials, EMPHASIS, is an ageist issue. If this disease affected 18-25 or 30-50 year olds, there would be a national outcry over the lack of progress in CURING this illness.\r\n\r\nA recent report states that Alzheimer's research is 40 years behind cancer research -  progress in AIDS treatment is remarkable - all progress in these areas is fantastic but PLEASE now give more attention to Alzheimer's.\r\n\r\nWe hear about trials in other countries that are 2 or 5 years away from a drug but my parent does not have that time. They are at the mild-mod stage so I still hope; but also, I cry every day and I am crying now.\r\n\r\nPlease help my parent and all of our parents.\r\n\r\nAlzheimer's sufferers cannot be a strong lobby group; we need to be.\r\n\r\nThank You - In Hope & Trust x",
