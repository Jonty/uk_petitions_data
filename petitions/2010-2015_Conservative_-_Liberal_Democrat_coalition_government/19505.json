        "additional_details": "Due to the growing cost of fuel and the fact that oil is a fossil fuel that will not last forever. Those Companies and sport bodies that use vast amounts of oil, which is causing a major carbon footprint worldwide, they should pay a higher number of tax, even if a new tax is created.\r\n\r\nCompanies, drivers, managers and administrators of many of the elite of Motorsport are vastly rich and use thousands and thousands of liters of fuel every year. It is only right and proper, like those who choose to use private jets. That a higher level of tax is paid.",
