Regardless of the word \"Volunteer\", the word could also be reviewed, or either stay as it is.\r\n\r\nNot saying people who do volunteering should be paid the full amount per hour, but a small contribution for their time and work should be considered, or such volunteering job roles should offer a small payment for the free workers. For example, a volunteer could be paid \u00a32 to \u00a33.50 an hour.\r\n\r\nWith this being considered, in my belief, it would help people get into employment, and people would be more willing to work on the 'free' side. At present, millions do not and are not interested in working at a charity shop for nothing in return. They have a life to lead and live. It would even be a big benefit for people under the age of 20!",
