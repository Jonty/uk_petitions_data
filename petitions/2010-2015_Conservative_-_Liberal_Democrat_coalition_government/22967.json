        "additional_details": "Because of the recession and high unemployment, there are thousands of families who are struggling with living expenses. Many of these are unable to buy their own homes because they do not have a deposit, and have to rely on renting a property for their families to live in. These families include many that do not have local authority housing, but have to rely on private landlords, who seem to be 'milking it' because of the demand for private rentals, along with the estate agents who have found a new profit making scheme with application fees. The local authority housing allowance is restricted (which is understandable) but many families are struggling to find decent, fit for purpose, housing within a price range they can afford. \u00a3700 for a three bedroom house in Merseyside, for example, is ludicrous for a family on benefits. It's more than a lot of people pay for a mortgage every month.",
