        "additional_details": "We should celebrate success not just memorials to bad events. A generation was inspired and educated. However tens of thousands were not chosen to be gamesmakers, thousands of athletes from around the world did not reach the qualifying standards, and millions of people were unable to experience the events live. The UK has the facilities and the enthusiasm to give them and the lucky 2012 ones the opportunity to experience olympic and paralymic sport every summer. Be bold - make the festival of sport an annual event across the UK. GREAT SPORT. GREAT PEOPLE. JUST GREAT.",
