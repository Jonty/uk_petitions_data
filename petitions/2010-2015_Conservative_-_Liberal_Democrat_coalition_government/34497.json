        "additional_details": "Change the funding policies for Further Education (14-19) to put the responsibility for learning back on the student,  Retention statistics and funding in colleges have forced education providers to: take on everyone, keep everyone and pass everyone to maintain funding streams.  As such it is no longer the responsibility of the student to attend, behave, work and pass.  It is increasingly the teacher / lecturer who has to justify why a student has done none of these things while the student has no onus of responsibility for their own learning or behaviour.  A change in funding policy away from quantity and towards quality education would alleviate this problem.",
