        "additional_details": "Abuse of radio comes in several forms. However, most of it is designed either to deny access to the spectrum or to offend and annoy by causing deliberate interference, using offensive language, playing music, pirating call signs, keying out other users etc. On the amateur service, abuse is most commonly aimed at open access facilities such as voice repeater so as to cause a nuisance to the maximum number of people and attract attention.\r\n\r\nWe feel this has went on for long enough. Almost 5yrs now this abuse has been on heard on GB3CS Amateur Radio repeater and Ofcom have not done anything with regards closing down this Amateur Radio repeater or taking action against these stations who are abusing the radio system",
