        "additional_details": "QE2 is one of the most famous cruise ships in the world. The ship was built on the Clyde in Glasgow in 1967, and was used in service as a troop carrier in the Falklands War thirty years ago. In 2008 Cunard sold it for \u00a364 million to Dubai which planned on turning it into a luxury hotel. However, when the credit crunch hit, the firm ran out of funds and the ship has been languishing in Dubai ever since.\r\nThe QE2 is a great British Icon it deserves to be back home in Britain Today we urge the Government to urgently speak to Dubai and try and secure a deal to Bring home the QE2.",
