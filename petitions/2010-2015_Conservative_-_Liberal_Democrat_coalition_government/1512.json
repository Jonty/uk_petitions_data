Allowing a safe, honourable passing.\r\nThis petition also believes that the majority should not be denied in a Democracy which consistently polls strongly in favour of this motion.\r\nThis petition believes in a comprehensive set of safety nets and regulation on the issue to avoid the euthanising of those who do not wish to die,who can not defend themselves and to avoid the conditions of some unsavoury clinics which have been discovered in Europe.\r\nThe spirit of this petition is to protect those most vulnerable in society and legislation should be designed as such for both those who choose to end their life and those who choose not to.",
