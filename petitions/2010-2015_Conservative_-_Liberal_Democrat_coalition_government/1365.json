        "additional_details": "With so many people out of work, and the country in such a financial state, why don't you get jobseekers to do community work or other public service work for 2/3 days a week.  That still leaves them time to look for their chosen job, while helping the community.  There are plenty of jobs that local councils have stopped doing because of cutbacks, and you have this huge untapped workforce that could be doing something constructive to help this country get back on it's feet again.  I would like the Government to make it a requirement of receiving Jobseekers Allowance etc, that claimants carry out some sort of community/public work for between 2 and 3 day per week. ",
