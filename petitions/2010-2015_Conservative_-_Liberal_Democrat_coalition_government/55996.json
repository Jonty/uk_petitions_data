We would much prefer you spend more on keeping them incarcerated but exponentially less on what they get while they are in there.  We don't want them to be kept warm, well fed, clean and entertained at our expense while we cannot afford it for ourselves. We want them to want not to go back, not look forward to a holiday next time they get caught.",
