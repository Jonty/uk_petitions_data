When duty rises on fuel, they are amongst the first to feel the adverse effect of not being able to use their vehicle for the purpose it was intended. What is the point in having a \u00a310,000 mobility car when you cannot afford the fuel to use it?\r\n\r\nI propose that those with disabilities are given an exemption from fuel duty, or are given fuel at a discounted rate or set price. They could even be given fuel vouchers, or they could be given some form of ID card which would allow them to purchase their fuel at a price they can afford. Of course there will be those who see opportunities to abuse the privilege, but I am sure there are measures that can be put in place to prevent such occurrences.\r\n",
