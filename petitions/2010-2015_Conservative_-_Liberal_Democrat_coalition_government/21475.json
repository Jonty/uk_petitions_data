        "additional_details": "This petition moves to introduce the idea of deporting an offender not originally from the UK back to their home country. Only those charged with a serious crime should be at risk whether they are found guilty or not guilty so that the probability of such crimes being recommitted is lowered greatly. This is in the public's interest and most importantly, the victim's.",
