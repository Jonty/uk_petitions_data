As parents & adults we encourage children to respect & care for animals around them, yet IACGMOOH &others aware that children often imitate what they watch, are encouraging children to cause suffering & harm to animals around them.\r\nThere is also the unnecessary stress & even death of animals for supposed \"entertainment\" value, although used very little in the first 1-2 series, animals now cover app. 90% of trails.\r\nThere are increasing types of this type of show every year, we would urge the government to stop the makers using animals in future series for the welfare of the animals & education of children.",
