        "additional_details": "Any persons convicted of anti social crimes in the UK should be given the opportunity to do Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) as an alternative to a custodial sentence.  Given the cost of incarceration, Voluntary Service Overseas is an excellent alternative to prison. It represents a real opportunity for offenders to give something back to society. Working overseas gives a level of exposure to different cultures, experiences and an understanding of the challenges faced by many.  It would give people the chance to be positive role models within their communities and ensure that people on the verge of exclusion, are reintegrated into society , and are able to rebuild self- esteem, and change their vision.\r\n",
