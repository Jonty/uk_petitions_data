Also by denying the pubs the opportunity to be open is potentially losing them thousands and thousands of pounds. So I call on you to sign this petition and get the government to change their mind and allow pubs to open!! Give yourself's to enjoy England games with good friends at the pub with cold fresh drink and banter with fellow football fans.",
