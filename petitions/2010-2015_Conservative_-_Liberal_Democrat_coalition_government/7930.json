        "additional_details": "Currently if you steal or cause damage you may have to pay it back but often you go to prison.  There food, shelter and safety is provided as well as entertainment and fitness facilities.  This should be paid back.\r\n\r\nThis could be like student loans, automatically taken out of wages and depending on their income.\r\nAlternatively, they should be given a work placement for a minimum income (such as benefit amounts) and their income compared with a salaried staff member could be used to calculate costs.  Either way, criminals are not just draining society but providing compensation as part of their rehabilitation.  This should also mean that facilities can be improved as money will be put back into the system, such as to tackle drug issues or relocation costs.",
