Introduce a flat rate of 10% over this amount.\r\n\r\nYou tax us when we earn it, you tax us when we spend it, you tax us when we save it and you tax us wherever else you can squeeze it in. We earn our money and did not give you the right to take it from us. It's theft.\r\nWe do not approve of half the things you spend it on. So stop spending our money for us, let us spend our own money and with more disposable income you might even see a boost to the economy!",
