There would be no eligibility for parole.\r\n\r\nToo often we hear of those criminals who have committed such crimes, go on to commit similar/exact same crimes again on release. Also, it is well reported by psychologists/psychiatrists that paedophiles are notoriously difficult to \u2018cure\u2019.\r\n\r\nI do not propose/advocate the death sentence as miscarriages of justice do occur. There would be the possibility of an innocent person losing their life.\r\n\r\n(Manslaughter would be dealt with as present or by some other process).\r\n ",
