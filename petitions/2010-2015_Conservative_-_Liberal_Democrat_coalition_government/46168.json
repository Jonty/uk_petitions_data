        "additional_details": "Begin the process towards allowing overtaking in any motorway lane.  As more motorways are being increased from 3 to 4 lanes, \"middle lane hogs\" are now settling in lane 3.  By allowing overtaking in any lane, permissible in the USA, we can hope to regain the full capacity of the motorways.  Alternatively, make driving in lanes 3 and 4 illegal unless lanes 1 and 2 are congested, and publish the new law widely.",
