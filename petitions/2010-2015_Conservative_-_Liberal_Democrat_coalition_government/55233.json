        "additional_details": "The government should pass regulations that forces domestic energy providers to include two pieces of information in a prominent position on all utility bills.\r\n\r\n1). The average wholesale unit price over the period, as observed by the regulator.\r\n\r\n2). The \"all-in\" unit price paid by the consumer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe domestic energy market has been successfully de-commoditized by the 6 largest utility companies.\r\n\r\nThis very simple and easy to implement act would significantly re-commodotize the UK domestic energy  market by putting wholesale price information in the hands of common buyers.",
