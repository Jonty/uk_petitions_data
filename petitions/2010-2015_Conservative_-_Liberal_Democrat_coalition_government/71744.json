        "additional_details": "Following the attacks this year of an elderly veteran poppy seller and then an army cadet volunteer, I believe an element of protection should be awarded to any uniformed cadet, soldier, officer or veteran of our armed forces similar to that offered to the police officers and publicans.\r\nBy uniform I propose a minimum of headgear or even those wearing medals they have earned.\r\nBy protection I propose a mandatory additional punishment with no option of a caution. This would be added onto normal sentences. Mandatory community service could involve the care and refurbishment of our war memorials.\r\nThe aim of this protection is to try and deter attacks on homeless veterans, poppy sellers and those that we owe so much to.",
