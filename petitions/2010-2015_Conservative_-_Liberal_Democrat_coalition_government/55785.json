If the energy prices weren't so high in the first place there would be no need.\r\n\r\nThousand of people die each winter from the effects of being cold and going hungry. The NHS spends millions treating people who are physically affected by being in fuel poverty. The suffering and strain on a whole nation is caused by a few very rich people making themselves even richer. It is criminal to be told to expect further increases. It is unjust, unfair and inhumane and prices need to be reduced.",
