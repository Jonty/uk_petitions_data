        "additional_details": "More and more often prisoners are converting to Islam in prison. It is thought they do so because they get more privileges like being allowed out more to pray and better food. This should not be allowed people shouldn't be able to convert just for these rights. A Christian who wants to pray doesn't get such privileges. This needs to be addressed as it is unfair and a person who has committed horrendous crimes should not be treated better just because they have changed their religious beliefs.",
