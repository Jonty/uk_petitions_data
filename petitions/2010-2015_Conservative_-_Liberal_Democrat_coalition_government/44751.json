        "additional_details": "A Land Value Tax reflects local interest better and is a better local tax, both in terms of impact and ease of collection. It would raise more than the Council Tax with less impact on the economy. So more could be spent on housing, support infrastructure for industry, education and re-training for work and even scrapping/cutting other regressive taxes. The feedback from changing local land values would hold local government more to account.",
