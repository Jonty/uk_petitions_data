        "additional_details": "A litre of fuel costs 137.5p. The true cost for the fuel and paying the retailer is 52.8p. I am proposing we make the cost of fuel 80p with the retailer getting an extra 5p and the government getting the difference.\r\n\r\nI am also proposing that the government cannot increase the fuel taxation unless there is a vote by all MPs. The cost of fuel taxation can never rise more than 2p in any given year.\r\n\r\nWe need to stop our elected representatives using petrol as a vehicle for increased taxation. Do they not realise that increasing fuel costs , increases the cost of transportation, public transport, goods, wages.\r\n\r\nStop this runaway taxation.\r\n\r\n",
