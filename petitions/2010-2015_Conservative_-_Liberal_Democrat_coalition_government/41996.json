        "additional_details": "Israel has taken many innocent lives and they need to be stopped before they take ground troops into Palestinian and go on a mass murder run.\r\nOne life taken away from a family leaves a family broken, Israel has so far killed in the hundreds and many injured why should innocent lives be taken. Britain needs to stand up to Israel and help civilians who are caught up in the fight.\r\n\r\nBritain has had a rich heritage in being resolute and standing up to metaphorical 'bullies' such as Hitler's Germany and Sadam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. It is about time Britain looked to its past and saw what was right in all of this, and stand by Palestine in seeing Israel out of their territory, whether this be by through trade sanctions or UN resolutions, lets unite and stop this before we lose many more lives.",
