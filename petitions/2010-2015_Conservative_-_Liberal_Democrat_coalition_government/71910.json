Other European countries such as Belgium shut down all shops and businesses to allow the commemorations to be carried out in a proper fashion.\r\nHowever the U.K as the country many of the fallen were from, does not have this marked as a public holiday as it should be and we would like this changed to become a permanent bank holiday regardless of the day of the week it falls.",
