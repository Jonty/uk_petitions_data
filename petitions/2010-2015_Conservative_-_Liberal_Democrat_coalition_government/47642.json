We feel that doctors, nurses and other health professionals should have the right to express themselves as they see fit in any medium provided patient confidentiality is never breached or in any way compromised. We feel that this kind of freedom of speech is what the health service needs at a time of unprecedented financial and logistical challenges, particularly in light of recent failures and the gagging of staff.",
