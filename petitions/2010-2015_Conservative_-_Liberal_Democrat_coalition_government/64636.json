        "additional_details": "Roughly 65% of people in the UK use their mobiles phones more than their landlines in the UK, yet companies still haven't got with the time and still expect us to pay \u00a30.36 per minute to call them when we need to sort out a problem or pay a bill, on average each month I spend between \u00a35 and \u00a315 on 08 numbers that can't be found to have an alternative number even with 'SayNoTo0870.com'. There are roughly 75,750,000 mobile users in the UK so even if that was \u00a31.00 each per month that's a total of over \u00a375 million per month and a whopping \u00a3900,000,000 per year wasted and most of it by listening to automated services and hold music..",
