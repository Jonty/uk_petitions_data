People would spend 6 months in their local community helping the elderly, the infirm, children, cleaning the environment etc...  In essence, improving the local community and giving something back.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the 6 months, they'd get a certificate and their name would be added to a register.  Taking it to the next level would mean that those on the register are then entitled to vote and (if necessary) receive benefits.",
