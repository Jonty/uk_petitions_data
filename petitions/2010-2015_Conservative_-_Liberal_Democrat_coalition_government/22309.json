This is often at the expense, quite literally, of the independent stores, given that Registered Charity Shops receive a discount on their Business Rates of 80%.\r\n\r\nConsequently not only is a huge amount of income being foregone across the country, but also other retailers have to pay more.\r\n\r\nThe government should reduce the discount to no more than 25%, and achieve this by a phased increase over say five years.\r\n\r\n",
