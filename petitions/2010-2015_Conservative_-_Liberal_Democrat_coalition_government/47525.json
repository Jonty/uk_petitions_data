Thus creating breakdowns of what were amicable arrangement and relationships. Consequently pushing children into poverty and forcing people to use an agency they may rather not.\r\n\r\nThe government should change the law so that all children are considered when CSA calculate their payments especially if the non resident parent can prove they are paying maintenance to their other children without the CSA's help.",
