It seems odd that in an era of public scrutiny and transparency, billions of pounds worth of public money can be spent, squandered or lost with absolutely no accountability of where those scarce funds have been used (or misused). The government should have to obey the same laws and legal requirements that any company must follow in the preparation, audit and publication of quarterly accounts.\r\n",
