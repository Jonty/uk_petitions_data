        "action": "Increase national insurance to 5% to include dental care for all.",
        "additional_details": "It's been 5 years since I've seen a dentist. Why, you ask? Because I cannot afford it.\r\n\r\nThere is a very long list of those who can claim free dental care if on benefits, but those of us who work hard for every penny we have get told that we must pay for something as basic as caring properly for our teeth.\r\n\r\nI have been living in pain for months but cannot do anything about it because I don't have the money!\r\n\r\nI propose that a blanket increase of 2.5% in National Insurance Contributions would provide enough of an increase to make sure that dental care is accessible to all and no one has to live with infections, exposed nerves or gum disease. We don't let our citizens suffer from chronic conditions that we have no cure for, so why should we leave people in pain that is very treatable and preventable if they had access to dental care.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and end the needless suffering!
