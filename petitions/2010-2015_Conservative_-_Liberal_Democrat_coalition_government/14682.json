        "action": "Stop the police's ability to continually re-bail without oversight",
        "additional_details": "In England it is common practice for the police to arrest someone they suspect of a crime. After a short interrogation, the police grant bail for the person to return at a future date.\r\n\r\nThis petition is quite simple.  To ensure the police have a set period of time with which bail can be set & if that time expires, they have to charge the suspect, release them without charge or apply for an extension from a magistrate, the same way they have to do when a person is being questioned for up to 96 hours.\r\n\r\nThis change would speed up investigation time, reduce the impacts on innocent individuals, reduce the possible harm criminals may do whilst on bail & make the police more accountable for their investigations.\r\n\r\nThere are currently over 80,000 people on police bail, just short of the total prison population which clearly indicates that most of those will be released without charge; it\u2019s time for a change - please support this petition.",
