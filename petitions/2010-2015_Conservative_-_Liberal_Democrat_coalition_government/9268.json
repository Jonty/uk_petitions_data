As this addresses real concerns over the lack of moral guidance some parents give their children, would it not be an idea to fine the parents, so that they will think twice about letting their children get away with this despicable behaviour.\r\nA fee of say \u00a31000 for each criminal offence to be paid, and to those on benefits \u00a31000 to come out of their benefits over a 12 month period.",
