        "additional_details": "For the government to advocate non offending paedophiles to 'come out' and receive clinical help from experts and support groups to prevent them from potentially offending.\r\n\r\nThe system and stigma on the subject is currently failing and does not serve its purpose as a deterrant. Consequently, underground rings are being enforced and reform is needed to prevent this.\r\n\r\nThe government can look to the likes of Dr Sarah Goode who recognises paedophilia as a mental disorder. She supports similar reforms made in Germany that have proved successful so far in combating this problem.\r\n\r\nGermany are given funding for their Project Prevention Dunkenfeld from the EU under the Daphne III act and scientists are being helped to understand the issue better from university funding.\r\n\r\nThe main aim is to raise government awareness of paedophilia as a mental issue and for the public to understand the difference between a paedophile and a child sex offender.",
