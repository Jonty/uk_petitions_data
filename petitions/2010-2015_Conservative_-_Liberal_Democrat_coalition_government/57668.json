        "additional_details": "We currently have MPs and Lords who have had a conviction for Parliamentary expenses fraud, spent time in prison and then returned to their former position in Parliament!\r\n\r\nThis is unacceptable as the court has already demonstrated they cannot be trusted to make honest claims.\r\n\r\nWe propose MPs & Lords convicted of Parliamentary expenses fraud to face a permanent ban from Parliament with them receiving no further payment or allowance associated with being in that position.\r\n\r\nThe ban should include loss of pension and exclusion from the \"hard times\" members fund. This should serve as a deterrent for every other MP or Lord tempted to do the same thing.",
