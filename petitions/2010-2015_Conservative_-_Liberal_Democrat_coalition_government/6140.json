        "additional_details": "This is a petition to re-nationalise the supply of gas, electricity and water to consumers in  the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nEnergy privatisation was sold to the UK on the fundamental promise that competition would keep prices down. In fact the reverse has happened. The six main energy suppliers are are a de facto cartel.\r\n\r\nToday many thousands of ordinary working class families have to make a decision to go hungry or cold or into debt in order to pay their energy bills.\r\n\r\nThe main reason energy companies are inflicting such excessive price increases is because the government does nothing to stop them. This is a national disgrace. It is immoral and indefensible that UK energy supply companies - most of which  are foreign-owned \u2013 should be allowed to make such huge profits while condemning millions to despair and poverty.",
