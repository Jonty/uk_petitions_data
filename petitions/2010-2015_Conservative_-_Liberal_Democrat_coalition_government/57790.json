        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe it's wrong that any council leader should be receiving a pay rise well essential local services are being cut and local people suffering. This should not be happening, we call upon the government to stop councils approving such large pay rises for council leaders and to force them to overturn any pay rises already granted. We also call upon any council leader offered such pay rise to refuse it because unlike these pay rises public respect has to be earned and nobody stood in line at a food bank with there dignity in there pocket will ever respect you for excepting it and neither will the rest of us who believe such behaviour is wrong",
