The Para's regimental motto is \u201c\u2019Utrinque Paratus\u2019 (\u2018Ready for Anything\u2019). Their ethos, training and experience makes a Para what he is.........\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Defence is about to change all this and decimate what is the UKs premier fighting force .being a Paratrooper isn't just about jumping,but its a state of mind.able to overcome your fears and go when that \"green light\" comes on.being able to crack on with any task with minimum fuss and equipment. What truly separates us from other units is our Airborne aggression which is bled into us from day one ,week one of depot. And it's because of these attributes our great country has called on our skill sets first, time and time again! ",
