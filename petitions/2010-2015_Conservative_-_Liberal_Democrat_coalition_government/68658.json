        "additional_details": "The conflict in Gaza is devastating thousands of lives. Not just human. Action should be taken to aid the animals of Gaza Zoo.\r\nThe Zoo has been bombed by Israel leaving many of the animals dead and injured. The cages they are kept in are crumbling after the bombs with twisted steel bars and holes in the roofs. The welfare they receive is no longer existent. The animals are now being forced to remain living in cages with dead animals having not been cleaned out for weeks as a result of the bombs resulting in the healthy animals which survived contracting diseases. They need help. And fast. They need evacuating to a nearby safe zoo. Somewhere that can take care of their injuries and give them safe enclosures to remain in. Or a welfare team to visit them and keep them safe and looked after where they currently are. Someone please help. These animals cannot speak for themselves they need us to stand up and support them.
