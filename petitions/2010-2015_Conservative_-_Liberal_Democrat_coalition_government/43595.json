        "additional_details": "After hearing about the petition calling for Piers Morgan to be deported from the US (after his comments on gun control) we ask, for the sake of American citizens, that he is not granted access back to the UK.\r\n\r\nHis comments, perhaps made in a rare spell of good judgement, and pointing out some of the obvious stupidity of US gun control, clearly demonstrates how the US desperately needs commentators like Piers.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with a Christmas spirit we strongly feel that the US should get to keep Piers for as long as possible.\r\n\r\nWe ask for the opening of discussions with the US Government to ensure Pier's safe keeping on the other side of the Atlantic.",
