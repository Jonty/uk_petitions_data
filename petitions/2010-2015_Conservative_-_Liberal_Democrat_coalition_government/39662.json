        "additional_details": "This idea was inspired by Channel 4's programme which crashes a plane in hopes of improving safety.\r\n\r\nI believe that plane safety would greatly increase if the planes which are going to be 'decommissioned' or 'scrapped' are instead crashed on purpose in multiple environments to get as much information as possible as well as using independent company's to collect the data.\r\n\r\nI believe that the plane companies would comply with this because in return for doing this they would get a share of any international deal (1-5%) on the sale of British Made Planes as the safety has been tried and tested.\r\n\r\nI also believe that the money brought in by putting it on TV can be given to plane companies OR be put into something else so that everybody wins.",
