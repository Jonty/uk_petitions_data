Instead their innocence or guilt is decided by either 1 District Judge or 3 Magistrates many of whom are de-sensitised to the every day offences brought to court. This is inherently unsatisfactory, especially in cases of a serious nature.\r\n\r\nThe jury system is at the heart of our criminal justice system. Jurors bring independent thought and real life experiences to a court room. It is only through this diversity of thought and opinion that a fair verdict may be delivered.\r\n",
