The recent global marches for climate change have clearly shown that support for decades-old power generation practices is in decline.\r\n\r\nFinding and utilising new sources of environmentally damaging reserves only provides a short-term (and limited) economical lift at the sacrifice of long-term ecological balance.\r\n\r\nInvestment in Hydraulic Fracturing should instead be given to research, development and implementation of new carbon neutral energy sources.
