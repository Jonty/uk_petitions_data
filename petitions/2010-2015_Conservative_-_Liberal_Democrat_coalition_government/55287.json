        "additional_details": "I have a number of reasons why there should be more use of digital democracy.\r\nFirst reason is that it is easier participation. Digital Democracy enables citizens to express their views easily and conveniently without having to leave home. It will also encorage young people to be involved with the voting system and even for them it is quick and easy.\r\nSo that is why I think that the use of digital democracy should be used more in the UK.",
