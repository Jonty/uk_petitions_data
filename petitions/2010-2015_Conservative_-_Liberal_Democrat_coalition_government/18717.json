        "additional_details": "I would like the government to change the VAT element for childcare providers from 'exempt' to a 'zero-rated' VAT status to allow private nurseries to claw back VAT paid out.\r\n\r\nI would also propose that any government funding for 2 year olds, 3 and 4 year old pre-school education, skills enhancement, apprenticeships, graduate placements etc., be ring-fenced to allow us to put the money back into high quality childcare and reduce fees for parents.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would ask local authorities to agree a singular business rate charge for private nurseries.\r\n\r\nSavings in these areas would support sustainability, investment, training and development, growth, affordable childcare for parents and help drive the economy forward.",
