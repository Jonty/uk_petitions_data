        "additional_details": "Michael Gove's new curriculum makes teachers have to try to make children at 5 to understand fractions. For the majority of children this will be frustrating both for them and for their teachers. It will make children believe they have failed very early in their maths education.\r\nIf Mr Gove thinks that it is possible to teach such a field to children aged 5, The Government should ask him to go into a mixed ability class of children aged 5 and attempt to teach them.\r\nOver and over until they all get it, or until Mr Gove gives up and goes to find something more useful to do.",
