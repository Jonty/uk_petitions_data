        "additional_details": "The democratic process of Britain should, in an age of advanced technology and total communication, be torn from the clutches of the allotted 650, and thrust into the grasp of the citizen.\r\n\r\nIf this petition is passed, an on-line, forum-based democratic process should be initiated, wherein any citizen can raise an issue and see it voted upon.  Issues deemed to be of importance will be written into law if votes should represent an actual majority (51% or more).\r\nThe genesis of this system should herald more general reform and dissolution across the Westminster regime.\r\n\r\nThis is a viable democratic system that allows the people of Britain to become masters of their own destiny.\r\nIt is a system that reflects our capacity for peaceful empowerment and social progress, and a pursuit of constant improvement that is not only a privilege of enlightenment, but a pre-requisite of any society that seeks absolute justice and equality.\r\n",
