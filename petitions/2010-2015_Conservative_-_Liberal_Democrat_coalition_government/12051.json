        "additional_details": "There is a place for Religion within all educational facilities however parents and pupils should have the option to reject such comepulsive lessons. Religious Education should be outside of the curriculum - Catholacism to be taught at Sunday School, Islam taught at the Mosque, Judaism at the Synagogue etc. Law is a neccessity that everyone needs to be aware of and that pupils are ignorant of when leaving school. Religion is choice and when a child is old enough can make that choice by spiritual guidance by parents and religious teachers outside of school.",
