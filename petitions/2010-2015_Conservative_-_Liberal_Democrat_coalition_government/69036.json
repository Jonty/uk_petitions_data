On viewing the fathers YouTube clip we the undersign ask that the authorities to carry out any legal matters with speed so to resolve the matter and allow the parents to get the treatment they are seeking.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the red tape process will delay the treatment that Ashya parents were seeking to get for their son.\r\n\r\nWe therefore ask the government to help Ashya and his family.
