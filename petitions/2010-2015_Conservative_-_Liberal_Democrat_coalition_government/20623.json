Childcare payments were increased to reduce child poverty but this hasn't worked and the parents are either spending the money on alcohol or drugs and the children are still in poverty.  A food and clothing stamp system would ensure that the children are clothed and fed properly.  There should also be a cap of \u00a31000 per month on housing benefits.",
