        "additional_details": "I would like the Government Highways Agency to provide designated service facilities throughout the UK for truck drivers. They need to have designated rest periods, the small amount of service facilities in place at the moment throughout the UK, restrict where a driver can safely and securely park. More service facilities should be made available, at an affordable price and subsidised by the government, to allow drivers to rest adequately and then continue with their work. Truck drivers are the backbone of this country and deserve to be treated with a certain level of respect. The Highways agency should provide more service areas than they currently provide, and secure parking for trucks, and also provide them throughout the UK. ",
