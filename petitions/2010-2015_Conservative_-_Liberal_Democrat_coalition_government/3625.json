        "additional_details": "Large scale building of decent roads has not occurred since the 1970s. In the last decade, road design has focused on squeezing in cycle and bus lanes into roads at the expense of cars.\r\n\r\nWe believe this is wrong, as most people prefer driving for rational enough reasons. In the future, cars may not be anywhere near as polluting or dangerous as they are now, so to devoid the country of infrastructure now is short sighted. It is also the cause of much economic inefficiency.\r\n\r\nPlanners of the 1970s were right to build dual carriageways, flyovers and pedestrian underpasses instead of an inefficient mixture of traffic lights and cycle lanes. We would like a return to building roads that are designed for cars like this, and with the government to focus on how to make such utilitarian structures more visually appealing rather than abolish them altogether.",
