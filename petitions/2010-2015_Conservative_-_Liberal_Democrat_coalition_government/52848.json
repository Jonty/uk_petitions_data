        "additional_details": "Our petition aims to have a portion of the taxpayers money set aside for spending only on the United Kingdom armed forces and potentially slightly raise the defence budget. this is because with our current budget cuts to the armed forces, our servicemen and women are in some cases enduring two meals a day in afghanistan. Budget cuts to the military are something that the majority of the population disagrees with. with taxpayers money being spent directly on the military, it may resiult in us being more lenient with international affairs such as Syra and Iraq.\r\nThis is called Military Support Tax.\r\n",
