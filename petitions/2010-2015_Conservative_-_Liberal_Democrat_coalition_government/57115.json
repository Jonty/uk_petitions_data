        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to use the \u00a350 billion HS2 budget to instead help solve the massive increase in UK energy costs and the lack of affordable housing.\r\n\r\n\u00a350 billion would allow the design, construction and operation of new power plants using either Nuclear or clean(ish) Gas.\r\n\r\n \u00a350 billion could go some way to developing Fusion and providing unlimited clean energy for the country - (we already have JET in Oxfordshire as a test bed reactor).\r\n\r\n\u00a350 billion could help develop Shale Gas/Oil production which could provide a similar fuel boom like the US has had in recent years.\r\n\r\n\u00a350 billion could build an astonishing amount of new affordable homes and stabilise the housing market.\r\n\r\n\u00a350 billion could fill in a huge amount of pot holes!\r\n\r\nOR it could be used to do some of all of the above. Surely any one of these things developed or improved with the money available beats getting to Birmingham and back 32 minutes faster.\r\n",
