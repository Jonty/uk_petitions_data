        "action": "Get rid of car insurance",
        "additional_details": "We ask that the requirement (Road Traffic Act 1988) for motor vehicles to have a security or insurance be repealed. We propose instead that a new tax be levied on fuel to finance a fund for compensating those affected by accidents. Driving a car would cease to be prohibitively expensive for young drivers. Unlike conventional insurance, which is evaded by some drivers, it is impossible to drive a car without buying fuel and paying the associated taxes. The total cost of insuring the nation's vehicles would be reduced because profit would no longer be part of the process of insurance. The cost of insuring a vehicle would be proportionate to the miles driven. The use of fuel efficient vehicles would be incentivised. Commercial and public transport enterprises would be eligible for reduced tax fuel similar to red diesel.",
