Warfarin treatment can help prevent formation of future blood clots and help reduce the risk of embolism (migration of a thrombus to a spot where it blocks blood supply to a vital organ).\r\n\r\nWarfarin is used as treatment for people with atrial fibrillation, the presence of artificial heart valves, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism (where the embolized clots first form in veins). Warfarin is also used in antiphospholipid syndrome.\r\n\r\nMany people have to take Warfarin daily for life and failure to do so could prove to be fatal!",
