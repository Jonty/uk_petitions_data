I want all under 16's to have a curfew so they are not outside causing trouble when people are trying to get to sleep.\r\n\r\nI think children under the age of 16 should be given a curfew on which they should return to their homes by a certain time at nights unless they have a valid reason, in a vehicle or with parents.\r\n\r\nIf they are caught outside after curfew then i think they should be brought back home.\r\n\r\nChildren are outside causing trouble at night. Also with the late nights coming in then more accidents may occur due to children not wearing bright clothes.",
