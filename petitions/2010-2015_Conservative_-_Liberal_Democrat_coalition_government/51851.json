        "additional_details": "Stop the constant prosecution and imprisonment of former Royal Marine Stephen Gough, known as the \"naked rambler\", for being naked in public, and free him immediately.\r\n\r\nThis man has already spent more than six years in prison for public nudity.  Many people might find nudity in public objectionable but imprisonment is totally disproportionate.\r\n\r\nIt is also absurd for the taxpayer to pay thousands of pounds for his continued incarceration when he is harming nobody.  This is not how a mature and free society operates.\r\n\r\n",
