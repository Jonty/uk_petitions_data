The minster should not take into account how long an alien has already been living in the United Kingdom they should be sent back to the country of origin.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a waiting period of one year should be introduced for people who are bringing their partner over. An \u2018import bride\u2019 or bridegroom will only be eligible for independent residency after five years \u2014 until that time, he or she is legal only on the basis of the relationship with the partner. Currently, the period is three years. In this way, this will hopefully  prevent marriages of convenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
