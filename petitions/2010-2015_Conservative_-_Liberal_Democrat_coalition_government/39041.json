        "additional_details": "When capital punishment was originally removed the idea was that life imprisonment meant just that. Now, with murderers being released on parole after 10 years, what is the deterrent to take all that another person has or will ever have? There is only one deterrent that is suitable for this. We have to bring back state executions. The recent tragic case of the cold blooded murder of two female police officers highlights this. The offender should  not be able to lead a life of luxury with a tv, xbox and 3 meals a day.  The government need to restore the death penalty for the most serious of offences",
