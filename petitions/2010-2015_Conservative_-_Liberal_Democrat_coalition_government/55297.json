        "additional_details": "This e-petition is to ask the government to offer more support to under 24's that live independently and make ends meet. Who work, but all the wages go on bills and end up starving on a daily basis. All the under 24's that have come out of care homes or hostels needing more financial support and struggle. People that live alone, have the stresses of bills even when they work or debt collectors banging on there doors cause they needed to eat rather then pay bills?\r\n\r\nWe want the government to take notice! Make a change and support the vulnerable independent under 24's who struggle. Possibly the prime minister to sit down and talk to us, actually work out an agreement and listen to our problems and stories.\r\n\r\nPlease support us: https://www.facebook.com/HelpUnder24s",
