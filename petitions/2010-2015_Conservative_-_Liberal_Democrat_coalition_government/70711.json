        "additional_details": "Some MPs are asking that the government votes on recognising Palestine as a state. This should not take place. Israel's role as our political, cultural and military ally should not be weakened by its closest European ally recognising its enemy as a state. Palestine has never been a state in its own right and the Palestinian people aren't a nation or even a distinct ethnicity. Culturally and ethnically most Palestinians are of Egyptian or Arab origin, unlike Lebanon to the north they are not and never have been a country. This is directly opposite to Israel which was a sovereign state thousands of years before most western states even existed. Recognising Palestine would be a kick in the teeth for our only true Middle Eastern ally and a nation in which both genders, all sexualities, all races and religions have equal rights and protection. Israeli is also the last line in the sand for the spread of radical Islam to the west and as such should be respected as our ally",
