People's disposable incomes are not increasing above inflation. Increasing rates will kill off the recovery. Interest rates must be debated in parliament, together with an orchestrated media campaign to stop the rise for at least 12 months. Businesses' cashflow  will also be affected, and, ironically we, the taxpayer will have more interest to pay on the current budget deficit. ",
