At the moment coats are not alloud to we warn in the class room becasue school rulles say taht coats are forbiden inside the classroom. This simply does not make any sence becasuse coats are part of the school uniform and items of clothing which are part of the school uniform should not be restricted around ceratin ares of school. Also lost of the time in the winter mnay of the schools heater fail to warm up a room in the shcool so we end up getting extreamly cold because we are not alloud to put our coat on which can in ways effect our education. To sum things up wearing an item of clothing which in fact is part of our school uniform will not and does not effect our education ",
