        "additional_details": "\"Spare room subsidy\", \"bedroom tax\", \"under-occupancy penalty\", call it whatever you want, for the effects are the same. The 14%-25% charge for Social Housing tenants in receipt of Housing Benefit is unfair and it should be axed. The charge of, on average, \u00a3728 a year hurts the disabled, foster parents, lone parents, carers, cancer sufferers, and parents of soldiers serving our country in Afghanistan. Not even a majority of Conservative voters support this unfair measure. We, the people, call for it to be scrapped in its entirety. ",
