There have been many headlines of people commiting crimes which are influenced by watching soaps and reality shows.\r\n\r\nMost soaps and reality shows are being shown at peak times when children are watching television therefore a higher number of children are getting influenced by the programmes. If the soap operas and reality shows were shown after 10pm this will decrease the amount of children watching the shows whilst still being at a time when most adults watch televsion. It also means less children will be influenced by the crimes on soap operas and reality television shows.",
