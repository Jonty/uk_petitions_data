        "additional_details": "The health and care needs are being lost or ignored by the Government and the NHS. Veterans and serving HM Forces worldwide are being denied vital social help and health care. This is made worse by this government's, and previous government's, continued misleading and ineffective efforts at recognising and tackling this issue. Veterans want the Government to recognise fully the current and previous incredible suffering and ill health of HM Forces veterans, and serving soldiers, caused by the effects of 'Gulf War Syndrome' or 'Multi Systemic Disorder', initiated whilst serving before, during and after the first Gulf War in 1991 and also in following conflicts.Current and previous veterans feel the Armed Forces Trust and moral covenant has been thoroughly stamped on as regards this issue",
