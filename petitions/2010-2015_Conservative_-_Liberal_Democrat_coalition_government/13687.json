        "additional_details": "Just as drivers with 12 points usually get a driving ban, I propose that the Government adopts a similar \"Life Licence\" scheme.  All crimes are scored according to their severity, for example a minor theft = 10 points, murder = 99 points, and so on, plus whatever fine or prison sentence is given by the Court.  Offences 'expire' after 10 years and the points for that offence are removed.  However, anyone scoring 100 or more points in 20 years loses UK Citizenship, all benefits and is deported from the country.",
