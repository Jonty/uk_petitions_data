        "additional_details": "This petition is to call for David Cameron's Dissmissal as Prime Minister  by resignation or sacking by the Queen and a general election to be held ASAP.  David Cameron has betrayed the public by denying the public a referendum on our continued EU membership as expressed through petition. He has betrayed the will of the people who he governs by consent only.  He is also trying to water down employment laws by making it easy for employers to hold employess to ramsom by dissmissing them without explanation.  We the undersigned feel that employers need to gather evidence to support any claim before dissmissing anyone and by changing this leaves employees open to abuse and no more then politicians.  Therefore we call for David Cameron, to resign or be sacked by the Queen because he's government has lost the consent of the governed, and we the public have given him a clear explanation!",
