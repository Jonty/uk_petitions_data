The recent awarding of the franchise to FirstGroup is based on a bid which certainly looks very difficult for them to achieve.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of all rail customers who use the UK's busiest rail route, please reconsider all the bids and properly assess whether the First Group bid is realistic or whether it will let the British taxpayer down, much like the ECML under National Express and GNER.",
