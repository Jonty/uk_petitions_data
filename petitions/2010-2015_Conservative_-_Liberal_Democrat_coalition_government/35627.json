We have already been told that our troops are to be pulled out of Afghanistan, so are being killed for what? These brave men and women are training these people to assassinate our own. Too many of our brave soldiers are being killed, not by an hidden enemy, but the people they are training to take back control of their own country. How many more coffins draped in the Union Jack have to land on our soil before we all say NO MORE? No more life's should be needlessly lost. Bring back our Troops now before any more live's are lost.   ",
