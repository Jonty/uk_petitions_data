        "additional_details": "The HA is not fit for purpose. The HA say they do not record average motorway speeds to direct investment.  \u00a3millions spent to, alledgedly, upgrade motorways so they are 'managed. ' No evidence of management however: Traffic jams persist after upgrades, often worse, matrix signs state the obvious 'Congestion.....' every day; useful information about additional works, lane restrictions, accidents is rarely displayed.  Illuminated speed signs state speeds which are aspirational at best.  No HA communication directly with the public or businesses organsiations affected by their actions, FOI requests are ignored and there is no accountability. The government should order an immediate review of the effectivness, efficiency and value of the HA.  ",
