        "additional_details": "I feel that teenagers leaving school and wishing to continue their education at college should be entitled to free or heavily subsidised transport costs. At this present time this does not seem to be the case in rural areas whereby colleges can be up to 30 miles away.The cost of a bus pass \u00a3500-\u00a3600 a year creates a heavy financial burden on working parents that are not entitled to any financial help. This is enough to deter parents from letting their children continue in education due to financial restraints.",
