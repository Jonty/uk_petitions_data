        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition to halt to closure of public libraries. Libraries are an essential community resource- particularly in rural areas and low income communities.\r\n\r\nHow can Government justify library closures when 1 in 3 children leaving primary school can't read or write to an acceptable level? 1 in 10 boys start secondary school with the reading age of a 7 year old (see 2011 SAT's results).\r\n\r\nGovernment needs to recognise the importance of making free learning and information resources available to all sectors of the community. Investment in libraries and the services they offer should be increased. Closures need to cease.\r\n",
