        "additional_details": "The dress regulations of the Royal Regiment of Scotland should be amended to allow soldiers at ceremonial events commemorating former Lowland regiments; or in former recruiting areas of Lowland regiments, to wear trews. Currently, all battalions of the regiment are only permitted to wear kilts for ceremonial events. Members of the Royal Scots Borderers (1 SCOTS), Royal Highland Fusiliers (2 SCOTS) and 52nd Lowland (6 SCOTS) should be allowed the flexibility to wear trews on ceremonial occasions. The regiment will be involved in official First World War Centenary events over the next four years and it would be appropriate for events such as the commemoration of the Gretna Rail Crash and the battles of the Lowland Division in Gallipoli to be marked with the Royal Regiment of Scotland wearing trews in memory of the five historic Lowland regiments \u2013Royal Scots, Royal Scots Fusiliers, King\u2019s Own Scottish Borderers, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) and Highland Light Infantry.",
