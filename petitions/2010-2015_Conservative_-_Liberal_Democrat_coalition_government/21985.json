        "additional_details": "A solution to the scraping of a third runway at Heathrow airport is building an airport on an artificial island.  Airports built on artificial islands & land masses, would reduce noise & smog pollution, congestion, as well as acting as a barrier against flooding. British built Hong Kong airport is built on an artificial island, for example. A group of architects & other experts have put on a drawing board design for a \u00a320 bn four-runway airport in the Thames estuary, twice the capacity of Heathrow. Another \u00a330 bn to build an integrated transport system with the airport, new flood protection barrier, hydroelectric power station with enough energy for the airport. A four-track high speed rail route system that circle London will link the airport with the rest of UK. The airport can handle 150 million passengers per year & will be ready by middle of next decade. This will be money well spent on acquiring real estate and infrastructure for UK, as well as stimulating industry & employment.",
