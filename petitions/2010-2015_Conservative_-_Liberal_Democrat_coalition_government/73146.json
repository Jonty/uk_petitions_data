One would not be allowed on a building site without such apparel and this regulation undoubtedly has saved many lives. So it is hard to see why this cheap and simple measure would not worth adopting especially as it is common for cyclist to be dressed completely in black.\r\nI am mindful of the costs to children the less well off but I am sure that companies would be willing to use this as an advertising opportunity and provide these free of charge.
