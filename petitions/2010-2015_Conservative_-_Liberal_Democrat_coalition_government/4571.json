        "action": "Install micro renewable energy production units on all homes in the UK, (solar, small wind turbine, water power)",
        "additional_details": "This petition asks that the Parliaments debate and approve the introduction, funding, development and administration of a scheme to place energy generation in the hands of the many. Specifically the placing and integration into the national grid of small scale power generation on every home (private, rented and public) in the kingdom.  Thereby making the country's energy more robust, reducing our reliance on other energy producing nations, giving power back to people and as a practical way to act as a community to tackle climate change issues.",
