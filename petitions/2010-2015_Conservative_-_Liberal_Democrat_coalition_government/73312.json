        "additional_details": "In this day and age, you can get wind turbines no bigger than a satellite dish. The Government have pledged funds for things such as \"Cavity Wall Insulation\" and solar panels for people on certain benefits but we call upon the Government to go one step further.\r\n\r\nInstall a small wind turbine or solar panel on EVERY house in the country. Obviously, a move like this would not be cheap but it would benefit the country in the long run.\r\n\r\nHouses that use little electricity would generate enough to not only run their electronics but also feed it back into the grid saving fossil fuels at power plants. There would be less demand from power plants therefore reducing greenhouse gasses and combating climate change. They also have a minimum 20 year lifespan so there would be no maintenance required.",
