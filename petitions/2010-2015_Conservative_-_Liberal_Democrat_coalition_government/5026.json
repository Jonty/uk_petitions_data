To save the cost of speed limit sign manufacture, installation, maintenance and night lighting, and to remove any doubt that might be in a driver's mind; I would propose that 20, 30, and 40 mph speed restriction signs should be removed from carriageways and roadsides and be replaced with different coloured road surfaces.  A black surface might be retained for 60+mph.  ",
