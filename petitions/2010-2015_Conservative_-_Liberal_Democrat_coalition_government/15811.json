They are also the least able to cope with the process involved in the current round of benefits change. They are being lumped in with all of the governments targets for benefits reduction, and are in general unable to stick up for themselves.\r\nA \"Fair Deal\" should be put in to place, where a person is already receiving DLA at the high rate for Mobility or Care they should be automatically processed, on to the equivalent benefit with no loss to themselves.\r\nThe High rate for Mobility should be increased to account for fuel prise rises.\r\nThe Care component should rise with average earnings.\r\nThe Carers allowance should be paid for at the minimum wage.",
