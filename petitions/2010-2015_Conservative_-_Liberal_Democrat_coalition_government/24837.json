        "additional_details": "The cold weather payment scheme is currently set up for \u00a325 every seven day period of very cold weather between 1 November and 31 March but you have to be on ...\r\n\r\n\u2022Pension Credit\r\n\u2022Income Support\r\n\u2022income-based Jobseeker's Allowance\r\n\u2022income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)\r\n\r\nI feel that this is wrong and our children on high rate disability allowance should automatically be eligable too, such as kids with major heart defects need constant heating through out the cold months but yet they are not entitled to any help unless the above is claimed, even if their parent is on carers allowance no help is provided. Carers to DLA kids/ families end up with a much higher fuel bill than those who are eligable for the payments, Carera allowance should be included.\r\n\r\nIf you agree that DLA kids should automatically be included for cold weather payments please sign this petition.\r\n\r\nThank you for your support\r\n..",
