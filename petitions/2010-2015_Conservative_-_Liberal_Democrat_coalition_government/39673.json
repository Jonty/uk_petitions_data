        "additional_details": "To demand the end of the Roman Catholic Church bias in school / church adjacency.  In the London Borough of Havering several catholic churches were built with catholic primary schools next to them or very near-by.\r\n\r\nChurches of the Church of England are not allowed to build schools adjacent to them or very nearby. For example, the central Church of England Church in Romford Market is St. Edwards The Confessor (of year 1410) and its associated school is more than a mile away !\r\n\r\nSign the petition to demand the equality of school / church adjacency irrespective of christian denomination (or other acceptable faith). All children should have the opportunity of a church school if they wish to apply and not just Roman Catholics. ",
