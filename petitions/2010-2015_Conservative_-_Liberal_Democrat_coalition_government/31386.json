        "additional_details": "This petition is to help Britain in many ways. If fares are reduced, it would be an incentive for people to use public transport more frequently. This would lower congestion on our roads and lower our carbon emissions. In addition to this, more people using public transport will mean we would have to expand and improve our already well integrated transport system. This would create jobs and so would also take care of another problem. If more people use public transport we will, be able to afford lower fares",
