        "additional_details": "Ever tried to book tickets to go see a band, artist or comedian and they have sold out within minutes? Then looked on ebay and people are selling high quantaties at double sometimes triple the price? Annoying isnt it?\r\n\r\nWell selling of the Olympic tickets has been made illegal on ebay and people who cant go genuinely sell them back to the ticket office. This should be done for normal tickets to allow people to purchase tickets.\r\n\r\nSign this petition if you feel strongly about this. ",
