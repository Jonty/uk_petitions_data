        "additional_details": "We have created this petition to raise awareness of the importance of local wind turbines in Sussex. If the petition is successful we will use it for evidence that people support the idea of wind turbines and wouldn't mind them in there area when we appeal to the local council for support in actually getting them built. Wind turbines can be on land or off shore, there is advantages and disadvantages to both. Off shore: Can be built far out from the coast to avoid eye sore and can be built in great numbers. But would have to be built in specific areas so they don't disrupt  local fishing areas. On land: There isn't many areas that they could be built in, because most of the suitable land would probably be privately owned. Wind turbines are important! Its as simple as that...",
