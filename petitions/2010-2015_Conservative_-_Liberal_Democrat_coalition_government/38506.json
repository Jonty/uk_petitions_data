It is the older and disabled person's poll tax.\r\n\r\nThe long-term costs of failing to invest now will be far greater for the millions of people who rely on social care at present and those who will in the future. Without good quality support, many people will see their physical and mental health deteriorate.\r\n\r\nPlease support this petition to campaign for a free national care service that meets people's needs equally and fairly, and is funded out of general taxation.\r\n",
