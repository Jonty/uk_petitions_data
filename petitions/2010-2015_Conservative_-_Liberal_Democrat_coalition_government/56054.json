If families choose to have more than 2 children, they are expected to provide all further support without asking and expecting the government to help. This can take the form of insurances to provide income in cases of death or disability.\r\nThe point is: why should members of the population expect the state to support their increasing family numbers, when other limit the number of children they have on the basis of affordability.",
