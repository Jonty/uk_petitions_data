They will however  be the ones who will suffer the most , if this tax is not stopped.\r\nThis is simply not acceptable to punish those who merley have a spare room or two ( for what ever reason they have them)  There are other ways to address the country's problems without having to resort to this. Therefore, we say look elsewhere to make savings ( tax avoidance etc ) and stop this unacceptable spare bedroom tax - now!  - Thank you.",
