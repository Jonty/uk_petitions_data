At every turn, more ways are found to squeeze out every penny. Taxed when you buy a car, double-taxed when you insure, taxed to have it tested, double-taxed when you fuel it, taxed on parts, taxed on maintenance, taxed on lubricant, taxed when you drive it, sometimes several times, taxed when you park it and, soon, taxed when you use roads!\r\n\r\nThis has to STOP! We don't have any more money. End the vehicle excise duty. End all tolls. Cap parking charges. End insurance premium tax where insurance is a legal requirement. Cap VAT on road fuel at 5%.\r\n\r\nVehicles are no longer a luxury, they are essential. Join the 21st century!",
