        "additional_details": "The government want both parents to be involved in their children's lives, yet they take away the Legal Aid needed to help pay for the solicitors and court fees. So many fathers are missing out on their children's upbringing because they can't afford legal fees.\r\n The government say they have to make cuts somewhere, but they are doing so at the cost to the children. The child deserves to have BOTH parents in their lives unless there is abuse.\r\n The absent parent is expected to pay maintenance through the CSA even though they can't see the child because one parent wants to use the children as a weapon against the other parent.\r\n Cuts can be made elsewhere, PLEASE NOT AT THE COST OF THE CHILDREN!!!!!\r\n Many fathers out there want to be fathers to their children but it is roughly \u00a35000 just to get to see the children. Not everyone can afford this.  ",
