(\"Agenda for Change\" is the current system used to standardize NHS pay nationally)\r\n\r\nStop any further reductions to nurses pay.\r\n\r\nThere is currently a move in this direction in the South West.\r\n\r\nA move away from \"Agenda for Change\" and cutting pay further will negatively effect patient care.\r\n\r\nIf pay was different in some areas of the country to others then there would be a migration effect; this would be likely to negatively effect patient care.\r\n\r\nNurses will be forced to strike on the issue of pay. Many nurses rely on unsociable hours pay and already work extra hours.\r\n\r\nMore nurses will strike on this issue than on the pension issue.\r\n\r\nPay has already been effectively cut due to the pay freeze.\r\n\r\nNurses are professionals but not highly paid.\r\n\r\nPlease sign if:\r\n\r\nYou are or know a nurse.\r\n\r\nYou respect how hard nurses work.",
