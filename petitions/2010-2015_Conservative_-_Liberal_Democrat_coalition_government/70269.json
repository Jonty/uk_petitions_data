Politics is about moral choices represented by all Lords and MPs.\r\n\r\nSign the petition for a fair and prompt reform of the House of Lords to ensure every seat is open to all of society, with no privileges to those with special birthrights or specific beliefs.\r\n\r\nVisit www.holr.org.uk for more information.",
