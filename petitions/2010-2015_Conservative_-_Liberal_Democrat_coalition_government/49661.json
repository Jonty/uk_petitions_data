We are particularly aggrieved with the current situation regarding the new community based business, Doopo Doopo, located at 15 Dartmouth Road, SE233HN.\r\nWe believe that assets within the Borough that are social businesses and clearly supporting the local community should receive discretionary relief on the same basis as neighbouring boroughs and trust that you will reconsider this decision and re-evaluate the current charges.\r\nThis petition is supported by:\r\nFOREST HILL SOCIETY\r\nAnd\r\nSHOP REVOLUTION:\r\ndelivering POP-UP SHOPS for SEE3\r\n",
