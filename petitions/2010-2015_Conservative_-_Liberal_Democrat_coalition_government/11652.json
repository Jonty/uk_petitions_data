        "additional_details": "We would like the government to establish residential military schools for young people who commit anti-social crimes because they are trapped in situations where they have no education and no hope of contributing towards society.\r\n\r\nThe school would be responsible for educating these young people and providing them with the discipline they need to work in the future. The school would be run by the army.\r\n\r\nGraduation from the school would be at the discretion of a judge and dependent upon whether the young person was literate and numerate.\r\n\r\nNo welfare payments would be made for those at the school, but bonuses would be made (for collection upon graduation) dependent upon good behaviour.\r\n",
