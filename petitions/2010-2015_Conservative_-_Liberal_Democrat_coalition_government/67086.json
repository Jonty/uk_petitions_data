Blue mondays would be a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nThe Guardian reports that a YouGov survey found that 57 per cent of workers are up for a four-day week and that 71 per cent agree with Ashton in that it would make Britain a happier place.\r\n\r\n\"It is viable. We need an ambition in the next 10 to 20 years to move to that on a European level. We've had the European working-time directive.  Why cant we have our own new one. The fifth day could be a community activity day, a giving back day. This is how you operationalise the big society.\"",
