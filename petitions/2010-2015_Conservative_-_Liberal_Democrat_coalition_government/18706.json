        "additional_details": "Kingston Communications (KC) is currently the only telephone and internet service provider available in Hull and most of the East Riding of Yorkshire. They are notorious for providing both poor customer service and slow broadband download speeds. This coupled with high prices and over convoluted connection methods leaves residents of the local area frustrated with the lack of options and the inability to \u201ctake your business elsewhere\u201d. KC currently only permit connection to another provider through the expensive process of the installation of a new phone line meaning that any potential saving made by changing providers would be eaten up in both time and money.\r\nI believe there should be a transparent review made by the Competition Commission into whether KC operates a local monopoly, detailing clearly the methods for secession from KC for those who wish to leave. It should look into the legal and practical implications of allowing other service providers into Hull and East Yorkshire",
