        "additional_details": "Andrew Mitchell is fortunate that he was not arrested by the police officer for a Public Order offence having allegedly continued to abuse him after receiving a warning.  This is not the kind of behaviour the public expect from someone in the public pay and Mitchell's words and behaviour show just out of touch with normal people he is and how unworthy he is of a government post. Maybe these qualities are just what you admired when choosing him to be Chief Whip but bullying Tory MP's is one thing, abusing an officer of the crown is another, especially only days after two of their colleagues had been murdered.  You said on the news that his behaviour was 'unacceptable' - now show us how much you really believe that by sacking him immedialtely as he hasn't had the decency to resign.",
