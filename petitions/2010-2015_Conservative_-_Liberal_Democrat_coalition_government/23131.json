        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call on the government to introduce legistlation to require any strike action to command the support of a minimum of 50% of the union membership.  In addition to a requirement that, in order to be legal, the strike ballot return must be above a 50% threshold of union membership.\r\n\r\nRecent union ballots have seen a return of between 23% and 39%, well below what would be considered reasonable when gaining a mandate to strike.  The government should take action that requires any strike action to be supported by at least 50% of the union membership.  This would enhance accountability, and improve the engagement of the unions in more reasonable action, rather than simply considering strike action as a first course of action.",
