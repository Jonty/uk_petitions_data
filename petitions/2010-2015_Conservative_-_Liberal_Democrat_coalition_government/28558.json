        "additional_details": "Too have any dog shot and killed by a farmer, and the devastating effect this has on a person/family. I do believe this law is so outdated that the public have no protection of their pets who are very much part of your family, Humans make so many mistakes, some take other peoples lives, do we shoot them? dogs are dogs they love the chase the play some are viscous, not the dogs fault most of the time, makes one mistake and is shot dead for it. In Africa they shoot animals with darts, why cant this approach be taken here. Farmers are doing themselves no favors shooting dead someone's beloved pet, it's their livelihood granted, too many farmers use this as just an excuse, too trigger happy, some use it to threaten people on public footways with a gun in hand, I would like the government to change this law and stop the shooting of beloved family pets and use a stun method instead giving greater protection to dogs and owners, and taking away the distress it causes\r\n",
