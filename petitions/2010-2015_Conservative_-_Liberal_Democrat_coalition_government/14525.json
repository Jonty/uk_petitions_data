        "additional_details": "The BBC , under the Freedom of Information Act refuses to release details of the Balen Report which was an independent report covering the BBC's coverage of the Israeli / Palestinian dispute. Many people believe that the BBC were biased in such coverage and concealment of the report implies this. The public should be aware of the agenda, if there was one, that the BBC had and the personnel responsible for racism and or bigotry if such existed in the BBC. The fact that the BBC has used taxpayers money through the legal system to keep the report concealed implies they are ashamed of their coverage and indeed that legal proceedings could be brought against certain individuals and the BBC subject to the reports findings.",
