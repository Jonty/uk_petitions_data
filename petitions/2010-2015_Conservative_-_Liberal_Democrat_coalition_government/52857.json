        "additional_details": "Michael Jones was the coroner at the inquest into the sad death of Michael Thornton.  Rather than concentrate on the real cause of Mr Thornton's death, ie the drunk driving of his friend, he focused on the ambulance crew and launched an attack on them for not jumping into cold, shoulder depth water in the middle of the night.  His encouraging of emergency workers to ignore safety procedures means he is no longer fit to hold public office, and he should resign immediately. ",
