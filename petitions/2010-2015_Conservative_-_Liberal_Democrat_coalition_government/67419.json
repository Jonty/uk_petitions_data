        "additional_details": "It is currently possible for almost anyone to purchase a license to carry out body piercing from their local council. This requires zero proof of competency or knowledge of body piercing or health and safety procedures. All you need is money and a studio space that can pass the simplest of checks.\r\n\r\nThis allows entirely unqualified piercers to practice possibly highly dangerous procedures on members of the public, risking many thousands of people's health and quality of life. It also allows piercers with no qualification, using poor quality equipment and materials to undercut those with training and high quality equipment encouraging clients to visit those piercers more likely to be lacking competency\r\n\r\nUnregulated piercing poses a great risk to health, especially as body piercing becomes ever more popular. A simple test of competency, and allowance of competency spot checks after a license is granted, could cut these issues very successfully - this is what we call for ",
