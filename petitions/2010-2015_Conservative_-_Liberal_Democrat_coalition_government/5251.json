        "additional_details": "We would like the government to introduce a new non-religious oath for witnesses in court. There are numerous benefits to this:\r\n\r\n    It would keep religion in the private realm and out of the public realm;\r\n\r\n    It would remove the notion that religion is associated with \"truth\" or \"goodness\" or \"justice\";\r\n\r\n    It would be a step in the direction of equality as all people would be saying the same oath;\r\n\r\n    Perjury laws and other sanctions already exist for anyone giving false evidence;\r\n\r\n    A religious oath might give religious jurors a false sense of confidence in a person's testimony;\r\n\r\nIn addition, a new oath should make clearer the consequences for those who commie perjury. For example it could include the phrase \"and that to tell lies on oath is perjury \u2013 a serious criminal offence, the punishment for which is imprisonment upon conviction.\"\r\n\r\nThis way, people will clearly know the law, and will also not be subjected to a religion while testifying.\r\n",
