We call upon Cheshire West & Chester Council to find an alternative site in the Ellesmere Port area for BASE Motopark as a matter of urgency to ensure that this much valued community project is able to continue. We also call for a full independent inquiry into how BASE were allowed to invest time and resources into a site that the Council had no intention of allowing them to occupy in the long term.",
