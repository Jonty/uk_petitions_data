        "action": "Reduce fuel tax, increase vehicle tax",
        "additional_details": "I propose that the increasing fuel prices are being unfairly enforced onto motorists whom use large amounts of fuel, in economical vehicles.\r\n\r\nIt would be in the best interest of the general motorist if the taxes imposed on motorists were in favor of reduced fuel costs, but increased vehicle tax.\r\n\r\nThe currently vehicle tax on a 125cc motorcycle is approximately \u00a320 per year. That motorcyclist will travel 5000 miles, on average, in a year. At 60mpg, the cost of fuel tax is approximately \u00a3185. To reduce the fuel tax by 40%, and increase the vehicle tax by 100% would mean the motorist would save substantially. For an MPV, or 4x4 vehicle, however, the vehicle tax would be a much larger increase, and the big gas guzzling pointlessly overpowered vehicles of the road would be penalised as a result.\r\n\r\nIt could also be noted that motorcycles and vehicles of smaller engine sizes, with less CO2 output, are generally lighter and smaller, causing less pollution, and less damage to the roads.",
