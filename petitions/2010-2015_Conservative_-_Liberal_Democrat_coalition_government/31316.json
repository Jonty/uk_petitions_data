        "additional_details": "The last OFT enquiry into the distribution and sale of petrol was in 1998 and the \"market\" has changed substantially since then.\r\nIn the last 20 years the number of petrol retail outlets has reduced from 20000 to 8500 with the demise in that number in particular of the independent retailer.\r\nIn the last two years the price of petrol/diesel has increased by 27% a rise that has decoupled from the price of crude oil. Clearly the market is not working and that and the supply chain needs to be investigated by a reference to the OFT/Monopolies Commission to see if a complex monopoly exists amongst oil companies.\r\nThe cost to the consumer and business is holding back to growth of the UK economy and our prosperity as a nation.",
