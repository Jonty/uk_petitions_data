        "additional_details": "Despite local opposition, the Ministry of Justice has instructed that the now defunct prison site be marketed as being suitable for a large scale housing development. The village does not have the infrastructure or facilities to support such a development, which would see the number of houses in the village grow by approximately 50%. At a meeting earlier this year, villagers put forward ideas for more appropriate uses for this site and were strongly in favour of the site being sold in tranches so it could be utilised for a number of different purposes, although there was acceptance that this may include some small scale housing development. However, it seems that the Ministry of Justice has totally ignored the opinions of the people who live in the surrounding area, and forged ahead with the one thing that the majority of villagers were vehemently against.",
