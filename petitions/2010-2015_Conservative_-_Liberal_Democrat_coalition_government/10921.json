        "additional_details": "For many years, motorcyclists have been allowed to drive \"Motor Tricycles\" (aka three-wheeled cars) on their motorbike licenses, but they can now drive \"quadricycles\", (aka lightweight 4-wheeled cars). What this means is that a motorcycle licence holder can put their family in what is, in all but name, a car, and teach themselves to drive on the motorway. We  call for this to be stopped, and for anyone wanting to drive a \"quadricycle\" to pass a driving test in such a vehicle, or a category B car.",
