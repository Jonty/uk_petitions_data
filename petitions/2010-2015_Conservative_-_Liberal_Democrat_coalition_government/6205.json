        "additional_details": "Having seen this from the perspective of both the customer and the seller's point of view, I have highlighted my points below!\r\n\r\nThis form of selling is considered 'hard selling', you are caught off gaurd by someone selling you a product, service or even a 'charity', pitching you stories of what they can offer you, or how much they can do, etc. These techniques are taught to salesmen in classrooms for 2 - 3 hours everyday, during this time they practice certain principles, pitching, overturning negative answers and not accepting 'NO' as an answer.\r\n\r\nAs 'potential' customers, I'm sure many of us feel the same way, nobody likes to be harassed on a relaxing evening or weekend. If you ignore them, they come back, if you answer you feel 'trapped' by them!\r\n\r\nFinally, more towns (even in the UK), communities and countries have banned door to door salesmen for these reasons. If you feel that life would be better off without door to door salesmen, PLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION!",
