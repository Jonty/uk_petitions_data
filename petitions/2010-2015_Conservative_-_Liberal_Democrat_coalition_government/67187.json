        "additional_details": "Tarfside pre-school was suspended due to insufficient numbers. There are now a number of young families in the Glen. We have started a toddler group for the 6 children in the hope that we can get the pre-school provisions reinstated. This is however proving difficult. 3 of these children are eligible for pre-school provision during the next school session. The school currently has 4 pupils enrolled. These rural schools depend on these young children to keep it open. It is vital not only for the children but for the community that the nursery is re-opened. Bear in mind these children live 15 miles up a Glen road, an hour round trip from the nearest town (without the winter hazzards!). This nursery was opened previously for 1 child! I am asking for your support to sign our petition and help get the best start for our children's future.  ",
