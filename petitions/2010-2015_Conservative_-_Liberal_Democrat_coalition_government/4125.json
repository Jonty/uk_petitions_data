        "additional_details": "The \"English Defence League\" are an organisation devoted simply to violence, racism and public disorder. It is a national embarrassment that in the year 2011 this band of ignorant thugs would take it upon themselves to terrorise those of minority descent and what's more, do it in all our names. Naturally, it is vital that the freedom of expression we enjoy be maintained, but a line must be drawn where a small group would choose to abuse that right by instilling fear and inflicting violence on members of our society.\r\n\r\nIf you do not agree with current policy on immigration, that is your right and I respect it. But will you allow yourself to be represented by violent bigots?\r\n\r\nThe \"English Defence League\" are an organisation devoted to violence, public disorder, hooliganism, and the incitement of hatred under the convenient guise of making some kind of political statement. They must be stopped now before they can go further.",
