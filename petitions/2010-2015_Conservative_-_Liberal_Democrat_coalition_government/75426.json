This creates a major disadvantage to the smaller operators in the p2p industry.\r\n\r\nIncluding a range of p2p platforms would spread the risk of taxpayers money, encourage innovation and create employment.\r\n\r\nWe would like to see the BBB embrace the many small platforms commensurately to the large platforms.",
