        "additional_details": "Currently citizens must choose to become organ donors. Only 29% of the population are organ donors despite 90% of people stating that they support organ donation; this discrepancy is largely due to people not \"getting round\" to registering. An opt-out policy would still allow people of strong conviction to not donate their organs after death while preventing people, who are otherwise supportive, forgetting to register. This will dramatically help the 10,000 people in the UK who need an organ transplant.",
