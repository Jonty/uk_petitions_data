        "action": "No 50cc vehicles on 60mph + Dual Carriage or Motorway",
        "additional_details": "The petitioners agree that the removal of 50cc vehicles (such as Scooters or Motorcycles) from high speed, high capacity roads (such as national speed dual carriageways and motorways) would make Britain's roads substantially safer for all motorists, especially the operators of 50cc vehicles.\r\n\r\n50cc vehicles struggle to achieve sufficient speed so-as to keep up with the flow of other traffic, constituting an obstruction to the safe and expedient flow of said traffic.\r\nSuch obstructions too often lead to other vehicle operators executing risky overtake manoeuvres, potentially causing accidents.\r\n\r\nThis petition contends that a vehicle of Category A, B or P (including sub-categories thereof) incapable of achieving the stated speed limit for a given road should be prohibited from the use of said road, for the reasons previously stated.",
