        "additional_details": "Most voting systems are flawed due to their methodology (see Arrow's Impossibility Theorem for more details) but some are more 'fair' than others. The Schulze method, based on the Schwartz criterion is a voting system which is mathematically 'fairer' and will generate voting outcomes which are a better representation than most voting systems. This petition aims to start a debate into the practicalities of introducing this system into UK public voting systems.",
