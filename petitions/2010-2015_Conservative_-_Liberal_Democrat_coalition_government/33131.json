        "additional_details": "The government is looking to replace the currently appointed Lords with a system in which the Lords will elected.\r\n\r\nAlthough this would increase accountability and legitimacy, doesn't this technically mean the Lords could have a mandate?\r\n\r\nThis would therefore make a change from asymmetrical bicameralism to symmetrical bicameralism and if both of these legislative houses have power then this could lead to longer parliamentary ping pong (currently the Commons gets the final say on a bill), which would lead to legislative gridlock.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the current Lords are appointed by meritocracy and/or party loyalty and for their expertise. There are 186 crossbenchers in the lords with no party attachment, and as the electorate tend to vote party-based this means that there's little chance they shall be elected, potentially missing out on their expertise.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords can only remain independent from the House of Commons if it remains unelected.",
