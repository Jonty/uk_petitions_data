Time after time we hear of public offenders being let off with ridiculous sentences - hardly a deterrent for other criminals. The lack of respect in society is there for all to see after the recent riots across the UK - it is time for this to stop. Criminals need to be taught a serious lesson. This needs to be done before it is too late or the next generation will turn out just as bad as this one if not worse.",
