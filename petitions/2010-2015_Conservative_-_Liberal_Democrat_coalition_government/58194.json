Oh, how about you offer me \u00a35.50 for it, I might accept that.\"\r\n\r\nSo, if you're in a shop and you see a bag with a label\r\n\"small bag \u00a35.50\" and you take it to the counter and the man behind the counter says \"That will be \u00a37.99 please,\" as the law is you would have to pay \u00a37.99 or go home empty-handed, but I believe the price on the tag should be a legal offer so the shop has to sell the item to you at the advertised price.\r\n\r\nShort legal explanation:\r\nI want the display of an item with a price to be an offer to sell and not an invitation to treat.",
