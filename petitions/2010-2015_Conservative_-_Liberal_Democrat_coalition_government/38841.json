This is all very well for those who are in the business of renevating houses/landlords or those who own their own home.\r\n\r\nHowever it is particularly difficult for first time buyers for two main reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Mortgages are harder to get because banks are not loaning money.\r\n\r\n2. Because the general cost of living is more expensive there is less money left over from your monthly paycheque to save for a deposit for a house/flat.\r\n\r\nMr Cameron, it was reported a few days ago that in the longer term it is less expensive to buy your own home than to rent one. Therefore we ask that you to make it easier, especially for first time buyers, to buy their own home.\r\n\r\nThank You",
