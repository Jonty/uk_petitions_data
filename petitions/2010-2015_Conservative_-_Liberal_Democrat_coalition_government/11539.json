        "additional_details": "The current Act stops us from handling our own internal affairs.  We are being stifled by adhering to laws that the majority of British people would vote against. Agreeing our own set of Human Rights would help us regain control of the following: Police being allowed to use reasonable force to regain control of our streets .Teachers being able to take control of classes .Immigrants /illegal immigrants using the current Act to avoid deportation. Travellers not being \"moved on\" or taking up permanent residence on other peoples property. Prisoners using the Act to improve their \"stay\" behind bars. People being prosecuted when taking reasonable action to protect themselves and their property. Parents being threatened by their children when using reasonable chastisement when trying to teach them right from wrong.\r\nThe above is just a taste of why we should put together our own Human Rights guidelines.",
