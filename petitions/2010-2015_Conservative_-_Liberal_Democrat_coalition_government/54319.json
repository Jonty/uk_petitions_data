        "additional_details": "The UK Government led by Mr. Cameron are once more meddling with issues in the Middle-East while at home the United Kingdom remains with a high level of public debt, a large deficit and austerity measures made to stop the deficit growing.\r\n\r\nEntering Syria is not in our national interest and will cost our country billions. I am angered at this use of public tax and resources and feel that we should not condone such a waste of money. Aid should be sent, weapons, armies and bombs should not.\r\n\r\nSign now, we need to halt the attempted intervention. Save our boys before they enter!",
