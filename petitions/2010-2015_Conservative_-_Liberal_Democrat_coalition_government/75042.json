In the UK there are between 600,000 - 2.1 Million horses so why does no one know how to pass us!\r\n\r\nI myself have come across more times than I would like, drivers who either do not care enough to be cautious when passing and choose to ignore my waving arm to slow down and those who simply do not understand how to pass or what my signals mean.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is a \u2018Think Horse and Rider\u2019 advert much like the \u2018Think Bike Think Biker\u2019 which was released many years back,\r\n\r\nI believe it was very effective and I feel the same can be done to limit the number of horse related accidents on the roads.\r\n\r\nThese are the figures reported to the BHS in 2014\r\n\r\nH= Horse R= Rider\r\n\r\n5 Fatal (H)  4 Fatal (R)\r\n\r\n11 Severe (H) 12 Severe(R)\r\n\r\n16 Moderate (H) 27 Moderate (R)\r\n\r\n45 Mild (H)  37 Mild (R)\r\n\r\n191 None 188 None\r\n\r\nThis isnt good enough please help pass this petition on.\r\n",
