        "additional_details": "The fee charged by estate agents to sell your house is a percentage of the sale price of the property. Some estate agents charge up to 3%.\r\n\r\nThis is an extra prohibitive burden on families who need to change house. It is an extra 'tax' on our hard-saved money.\r\n\r\nThe work done by the estate agents to sell a property is very much a constant AND not proportional to the price of the house. The fee charged by Estate Agents should be a fixed fee, e.g. \u00a3400, rather than a percentage.\r\n\r\nHence, by voting for this petition, you will encourage our MPs to consider this subject and to discuss it in our parliament.",
