        "additional_details": "The BBC program Top Gear promotes high octane automobiling. Unfortunately, it also promotes motoring which removes responsibility in driving. It also promotes a desire for high powered vehicles which can exceed the national speed limit by an order of magnitude. Top Gear is watched by about 2 million people every week and this means the program is very popular. I argue that the philosophy promoted by Top Gear presenters is in direct opposition to the governments drive for safer driving and lower deaths on the road. I would like Top Gear removed from TV screens in the UK.",
