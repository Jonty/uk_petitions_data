        "additional_details": "There have been a few headline stories about \"dangerous dogs\" in the media recently. People will common sense know that it is how the dog is brought up and not what breed they are that governs how that act. There are more reported dog attacked by labradors than bull terriers yet the media always seem to use pictures of bull terriers when talking about this topic giving them a bad name and making public shy away from the breed! Sign this Petition to stop Bull Terriers being portrayed as \"dangerous dogs\"!!",
