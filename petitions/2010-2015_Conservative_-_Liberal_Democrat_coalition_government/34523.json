        "additional_details": "Since the inception of NHS Foundation Trust our hospitals have become independent of anyone and are doing what the internal leaders in each hospital like. Patient care is poorer. Patients are no longer treated in the most appropriate place. The NHS has the largest number of highly paid executives in the world. In short there are too many NHS Foundation trusts, there are too many directors of these Trusts and this costs us the British tax payer too much. This results in less money being spent on front line staff which means patient care is lower. The government should decide on a reasonable number of Trusts across the country, It should look for volunteers to run what replaces foundation Trusts, particularly from those with long and successful careers. The internal NHS career path to executive director is not appropriate. These organisations should be led by more experienced individuals.",
