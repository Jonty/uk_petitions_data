        "additional_details": "Many courier companies charge extra to deliver to the Highlands of Scotland. These charges are unfair to individuals and businesses as they are being penalised for being in the Highlands.  For example to get a bookcase delivered within the UK may cost \u00a310, but to have it delivered to the Highlands can be anything from \u00a310 to \u00a335.\r\n\r\n There is no solid explanation given by the courier companies or by the companies that use these couriers as to why the surcharge is so much higher than the original delivery cost.  These charges are wrong and something needs to be done about this.\r\n\r\nThe Government needs to look at the surcharges that courier companies add on for delivery to the Highlands.  The charges are unjustified and outdated.  Either a cap should be imposed or the surcharges should be abolished completely.  ",
