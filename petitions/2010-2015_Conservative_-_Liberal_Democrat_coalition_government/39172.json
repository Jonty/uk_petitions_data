Alternatively we seek to extend the definition of \u201clivestock\u201d to include \u201cpoultry\u201d.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we do not seek to kill any bird of prey; merely to take them from our pigeon lofts, or vicinity, so that they can be lawfully relocated and either released unharmed or given to a person licensed to keep it in captivity.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned humbly request that Her Majesty\u2019s Government to grant this petition.\r\n",
