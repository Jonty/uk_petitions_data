        "additional_details": "The level of VAT should be reduced for house repairs/refurbishment. This would allow the tens of thousands of derelict and sub standard houses to be upgraded. This would take the pressure off housing associations, homeless families, local councils and the taxpayer, and provide a boost for the building industry. It would allow rapid development of run down communities, and help protect Britains green spaces from over-development.",
