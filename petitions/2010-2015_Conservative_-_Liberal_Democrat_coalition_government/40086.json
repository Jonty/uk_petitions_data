        "additional_details": "Ban sports sponsorship and advertising by companies whose main business is making payday loans or similar short-term credit at high rates of interest. Ten years ago, tobacco companies were barred from sponsoring sports, because they used sponsorship to recruit young customers and to glamourise smoking. In the same way, payday loan companies want to associate themselves with popular sports in order to win more business. Their activities add to personal debt, trap many families in poverty, and are targetted at those most in need. The recent sponsorship deal between Newcastle United and Wonga suggests that the current recession may lead to more such deals. Their immoral business model has no place within St James' Park or any other sports ground.",
