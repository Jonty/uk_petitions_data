        "additional_details": "Free child care hours for ALL ages should not be restricted to certain days/hours/sessions/term times.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to legislate further against and provide definitive terms over the usage of free child care hours to make the hours much more accessible for all and to prevent nurseries/daycare settings from 'making up' their own free child care policies that prevents parents utilising the hours that the government have entitled them to.\r\n\r\nThe 15 hrs entitlement is to help enable parents back to work. The fact that nurseries can severely abuse a HUGE loop hole and policy flaw WILL prevent some parents from returning to work OR force them to pay out for childcare and not claim their full entitlement.\r\n\r\nWe need to prevent nurseries from restricting, penalising and discriminating against parents by stipulating for example only paying parents are allowed certain hours at the nursery or you can only use X amount if hours if you pay for X amount of hours.\r\n\r\n",
