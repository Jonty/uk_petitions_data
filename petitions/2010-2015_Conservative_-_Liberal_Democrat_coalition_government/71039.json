        "additional_details": "We have all grown up and now realise that religion has no place in the Government - where laws are taken from vague messages from the Bible, 26 bishops of the Church of England sit in the House of Lords and among many other instances God is mentioned in the national Anthem.\r\n\r\nReligion holds people back, it doesn't hold people back too much in the UK but around the world it does and one nation needs to take a stand and cut links with all religions and urge others to do the same.\r\n\r\nAll discrimination between religions should be taken away, so no Christian Schools; targeting impressionable people and children should not be allowed and in some cases should be child abuse - directly impeding the development of the child.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need to cut connections with religions and not stand for religious laws being implemented into national laws.",
