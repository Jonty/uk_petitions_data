        "additional_details": "This country should join the Schengen agreement on open frontiers with our European neighbours, removing the need for lengthy bureaucratic border controls within the EU so British citizens can enjoy one of the key benefits of membership: faster transit at airports and the feeling of being part of a community rather than a grumpy outsider. At the same time Britain should join with our fellow Europeans in strengthening the frontiers of the EU as a whole.",
