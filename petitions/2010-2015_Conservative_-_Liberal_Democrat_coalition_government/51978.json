        "additional_details": "[My previous petition, which was specific to a particular person, was rejected on the grounds that it \"names an individual who has been accused of a crime\" - never mind that the individual in question had made his own name public and had been named in most major national and international newspapers - so I have created a general petition]\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned ask the UK government to offer political asylum to any person who reveals evidence of or information about activities by foreign governments (and/or their agencies or contractors) which contravene either international law or the constitution of the foreign country in question. This asylum is to be given irrespective of any \"crime\" that the person is alleged to have committed in releasing the information and without regard to any purported \"threat to national security\" resulting from its release.",
