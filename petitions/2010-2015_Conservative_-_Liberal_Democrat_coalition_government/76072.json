        "additional_details": "I propose to HM Government that Northern England have its own Assembly with similar powers to those of Northern Ireland and Wales. Firstly, defining 'The North' should be the six ceremonial counties of: Northumbria, Cumbria, Durham, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Cheshire (plus the northern side of Derbyshire). The Assembly should oversee the economic and social development of 'The North' which has been left to ruin by governments since the collapse of industry in Britain. Historically, local governments have enjoyed greater power but since the distrust and need for centralisation during WW2 Whitehall hasn't given it back! We want HM Government to give 'The North of England' (defined above) more power to run our own affairs in housing, education, infrastructure, business and industry. ",
