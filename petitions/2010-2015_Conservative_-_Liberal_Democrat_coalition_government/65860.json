        "additional_details": "Betting shops are opening later and later. The big issue with this is Sunday. Sunday is the only day of the week where there is no evening Horse Racing as a guarantee. With many bookmakers beginning to Single Man, staff can find themselves working up to 13hours alone on a Sunday, with a small period of relief. Betting shops are meant to open around Racing hours, so there is no reason for them to remain open until anywhere up to 10pm, when the only live betting opportunities come from fictional 'Virtual' Races. This is a big reason explaining the surge in FOBT play as a cure for boredom. Being bored at home is one thing, but being bored in a Bookmakers is dangerous!",
