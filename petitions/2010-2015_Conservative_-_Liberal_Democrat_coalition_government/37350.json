        "additional_details": "The Government currently borrows \u00a3126 billions on the international markets. To reduce borrowing for the current financial year, the Bank of England should sell the gold bullion held in it's vaults (currently estimated at \u00a330 billions). This gold was used to fix the \u00a3sterling exchange rate when \u00a3sterling was a fixed currency against other currencies. The \u00a3sterling is now a floating currency and the gold is just redundant. It is time use was made of this when gold is at such a high price per ounce.",
