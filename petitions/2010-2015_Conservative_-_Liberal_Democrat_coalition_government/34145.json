        "additional_details": "Large companies are insidiously and ruthlessly extending their payment terms from 30 days to 45 days to 60 days to anything up to 120+ days.  This is 5 months!  This is causing financial hardship to most SMEs who do the work immediately at their clients request.  There is \u00a335bn in unpaid billings in the UK currently due to SMEs as reported in the news.  I wish to gather sufficient signatures to force the government to insist that companies payment terms return to 30 days.  Without exception.",
