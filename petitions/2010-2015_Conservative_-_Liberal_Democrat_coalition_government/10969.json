        "additional_details": "In order to reduce crime, violence and anti social behaviour there should be a maximum level of alcohol permitted in the blood when in a public place, with police having right to breathalyse anyone appearing to be under the influence of alcohol. Heavy automatic penalties for those found in excess of the prescribed limit (which should be above the drink drive limit but below a level deemed to be likely to cause bad behaviour).\r\n\r\nThere is a fundamental inconsistency in current legislation which tends to treat alcohol an an aggravating factor when driving, but mitigating for other crime. The two should be consistent.",
