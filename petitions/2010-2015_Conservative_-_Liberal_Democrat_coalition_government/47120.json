John originally left the band in 1981 and many would say that their sound has never quite been the same since. The recent reunion shows would reinforce this.\r\n\r\nStatus Quo are now in search of a new drummer and now is the time to bring John back into the fold.\r\n\r\nSign the petition now to ask the Culture Secretary and PM to champion the cause to bring John home.",
