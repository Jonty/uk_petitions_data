        "additional_details": "Due to the rate of abandoned animals rising, the Government should support animal charities such as the RSPCA, Dog's Trust, CPL etc. The Government is the main reason for the incline.\r\n More animals are being abandoned because their owners can't afford to keep them. The price of vets bills, pet food and other animal products have risen and due to more people trying to save money they feel that their pets are an unnecessary drain on their finances. Also due to more people saving money, less people are donating to these charities meaning that they can not afford to keep these animals.\r\n Only a few charities NEVER put a healthy animal down but sadly not all do. It is a waste of an animals life for them to be put down for no reason. This is why the Government should support animal charities.",
