        "additional_details": "The UK needs reject the introduction of the new proposal from the EU for their road worthiness test where the components of the vehicle must comply with characteristics at the time of first registration. This may prevent most modifications to vehicles without further approval of the vehicle. (this will apply to many components and to all types of vehicle)\r\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong with the UK's existing MOT, 8-point and IVA system regarding the safety and modification of vehicles.\r\n\r\nModifying vehicles is a huge pastime in the UK and bringing in this ludicrous proposal into UK law will instantly make a tens of thousands of vehicles illegal even if the workmanship put into them is of a high quality and perfectly safe. It will also threaten to put thousands of  companies who are in the automotive industry out of business effecting the UK's economy.\r\n\r\nKeep the UK's MOT, 8-point and IVA system in place! ",
