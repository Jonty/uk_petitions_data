We have decided that we all feel strongly about how mental health issues are tackled in schools, and we believe that more should be done about the subject. I have took this opportunity to create this petition to ensure that something could be done sooner rather that later.\r\n\r\nStatistics show that one in ten young people between the ages of one and 15 has a mental health disorder; this could be depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, anorexia or schizophrenia. Which could lead to self-harm or even suicide.\r\n\r\nWe wish that schools would make it compulsory and part of the curriculum for teachers to teach students about mental health in a comfortable and delicate way.",
