        "additional_details": "It has come to my attention that if a dog attacks another dog, this is not illegal. My dog was attacked on Christmas Day by another dog, and the only reason the police are considering prosecution is because my father was injured too. The law needs to be changed to protect vulnerable pets like my dog. We as a country have a duty to protect birds, elephants, rhinos (including their poo), so why not create legislation to protect dogs from vicious attacks that are usually as a result of persuasion from the attack-dog's owner.\r\nThere needs to be an amendment to current legislation or a creation of new legislation to make it illegal for one dog to attack another, and the owner's need to be punished for this.
