        "additional_details": "The government should increase the wages for all of our soldiers fighting to protect us in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. It is not fair that they fight for our freedom and are not rewarded for their courage and bravery. Instead, the likes of MPs and Footballers earn more for doing less. Our soldiers deserve a lot more than what they get so hopefully you take the time out to join this debate and make their lives a bit fairer and more rewarding. Thank you. ",
