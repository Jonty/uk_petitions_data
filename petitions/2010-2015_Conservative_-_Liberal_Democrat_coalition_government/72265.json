If he has ANY shame he will now apologise and if he refuses to do so he MUST be forced to resign.  The people of this country deserve MUCH, MUCH better than what David Cameron has to offer them.  The feeling of shame this revealing comment has brought on the people of Witney, who elected him, MUST BE OVERPOWERING.",
