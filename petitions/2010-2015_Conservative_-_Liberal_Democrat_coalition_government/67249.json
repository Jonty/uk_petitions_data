        "additional_details": "The signatories of this petition are very proud of Britain's national alcoholic drink, beer. Britain is one of the leading brewing nations in the world and we have no reason to be shy of proclaiming something that British brewers excel at or being shy of acknowledging the billions of pounds annual contribution to the Exchequer via brewing and pubs.\r\n\r\nWe ask the Government to ensure that, when other alcoholic drinks are offered to guests, British beer is always included in the drinks offering at official government receptions including state dinners and at 10 Downing Street. Governments in other countries celebrate and showcase their national drinks at official receptions, for instance France with wine and Mexico with Tequila, so we call for the British Government to do the same with British beer by ensuring it is available for guests at official drinks receptions. Let's hear it for beer!\r\n",
