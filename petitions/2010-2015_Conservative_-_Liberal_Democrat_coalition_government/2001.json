It would be faster and easier to catch the underground from say a station in London to Birmingham or Cambridge.\r\nAn expensive project but potentially has very beneficial long-term consequences.\r\nThe Government should review modernising our transport system and create a UK underground network in major UK cities- not only will less cars be on the roads, but also will encourage use of public transport.
