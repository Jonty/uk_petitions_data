        "additional_details": "Enoch Powell is the ONLY politician to have been proven to have spoken the truth in his 'Rivers of Blood' speech in 1968.  All other politicians are in denial and are - shamefully - failing the indigenous population of this country as a result.  Enoch Powell is a national hero and we need a statue of him at the entrance to the Palace of Westminster to serve as a reminder to those who enter as to how they should carry out their duties towards the electorate of this country - WITH ABSOLUTE HONESTY.",
