        "additional_details": "The bus network National Express has dedicated bays for Disabled passengers, which are also shared by passengers with children in pushchairs, however, although they state this bay is priority for the disabled - this isn't the case.\r\n\r\nThe bus driver can ask the passenger to fold the buggy down, however if the passenger refuses - that decision is final.\r\n\r\nWhy? This is a discriminatory act for disabled passengers who are not able bodied, and are not able to use any other space on the bus.\r\n\r\nWhy should disabled person(s) not only face confrontation, but also not access a bus at any given time - like other members of the public.\r\n\r\nI'm creating this petition to allow disabled people the sole priority of the bays provided, perhaps by showing a card indicating priority. Thus, giving disabled people access to buses at any given time, diminishing confrontation, and giving the passengers equal access.",
