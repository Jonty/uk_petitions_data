        "additional_details": "My major concern comes from the fact that the black market sells drugs that are mixed with toxic chemicals and more and more people die each year from taking what they believe to be one thing i.e MDMA and it turns out to be something very harmful to the body and results in death.\r\n\r\nEcstasy is not entirely safe either, but ranked by scientists it is one of the lest harmless drugs, there are much more harmful drugs you can buy in the chemist.\r\n\r\nThe reality of the matter is that people in today's society take drugs and there are certain dangers that could be eliminated if the government controlled the distribution. They could insure no toxic chemicals mixed with the drugs resulting in fewer deaths and also could eliminate this particular drug from being profited upon in the black market.  ",
