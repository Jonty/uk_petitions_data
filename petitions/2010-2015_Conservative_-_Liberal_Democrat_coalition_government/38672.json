We wish to promote\r\n\r\n- Productivity ( Working, building etc.)\r\n- Rehabilitation (turning prison members into working members of society after release.)\r\n\r\nWe can do this in a number of ways such as labour and education for prisoners, particularly first time offenders. Needless to say the current system of prison is an ineffectual form of rehabilitation.",
