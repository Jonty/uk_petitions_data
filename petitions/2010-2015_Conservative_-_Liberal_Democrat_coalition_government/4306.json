        "additional_details": "In Scotland, St. Andrew's Day is a Bank Holiday, which means the Scots have one more Bank Holiday than the English.  In Ireland (although not part of the UK), St. Patrick's day is a Bank Holiday.  As usual, the English lose out.  So, let's make St. George's Day an additional Bank Holiday in England.   Now, the date (23rd April) isn't great timing as we sometimes have Easter around that time and then May Day just after.  So, let's eitther set Easter Bank Holiday to its correct date of 21st March or move the May Day Bank Holiday to later in the year (say October) to make way for St. George's Day on 23rd April.",
