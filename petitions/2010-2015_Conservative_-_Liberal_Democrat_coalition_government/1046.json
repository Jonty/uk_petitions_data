        "additional_details": "Currently vehicle owners are responsible for insurance leading to high and inflated premiums especially for young drivers, also wasted police and court time and resources chasing and prosecuting offenders with no insurance. I would recommend that instead of this all vehicles automatically have third party only insurance and then it is up to the vehicle owner whether they want to buy more comprehensive insurance from normal insurance companies. The cost to the goverment or department of transport  of providing the third party only cover to all vehicles will be covered by a 4 or 5p extra per litre charge on petrol and diesel - the exact amount could easily be calculated but I reckon it would cost not much more than this. This is how it works in South Africa and means that no cars are ever driven without insurance and third parties that are involved in accidents are always covered.",
