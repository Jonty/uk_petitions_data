The Benefit that person gets paid is to support that person it does not Include supporting their child.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to change this law, Parents who SHARE custody of a child should SHARE the Benefits for that child due to the fact that BOTH parents SHARE Custody.\r\n\r\nThis petition is also asking that Parents with SHARED custody of a child should be Exempt from The Bedroom Tax.",
