And yet week after week the Prime Minister does not answer questions asked simply they are side stepped with counter claims totally negating the whole of idea of PMQs.\r\n\r\nWe ask that the Primer Minister must answer questions as asked in PMQs, and not side step them. If this is not possible at the time then an answer must be posted elsewhere within 14 days of the question being asked.",
