        "additional_details": "Parents are required to pay PAYE and NI on employing nannies.\r\n\r\nBritish parents shoulder some of the highest childcare costs in the world.\r\n\r\nThe average gross salary of a full time live-in nanny in central London is \u00a327,000, which includes \u00a39,500 in tax and national insurance contributions.\r\n\r\nBecause a nanny\u2019s gross wages are paid out of the parents\u2019 after-tax income, this effective double taxation means one parent needs to earn \u00a337,000 a year just to cover the cost of the nanny.\r\n\r\nAction government should take:\r\n\r\n1). If nannies are treated as employees than parents should be treated as employers and allowed a tax deduction.\r\n\r\n2). If not the requirement to pay tax on nannies should be removed\r\n\r\nI believe that this will be tax neutral as lower childcare costs will enable more mothers/ fathers to work.",
