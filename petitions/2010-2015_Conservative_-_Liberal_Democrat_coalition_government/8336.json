        "additional_details": "There are so many drivers that do not know the dangers caused by speeding past horses and the accidents they could cause to themselves and others. There are plenty of adverts warning drivers of the dangers of speeding and motorbikes but a horse is a live animal and in most cases unpredictable in everyday surroundings and traffic. There should be adverts to show people how dangerous it could be. There are plenty stories and evidence such as videos which in most cases people need to see to realize reality. Horses and riders are being hurt or killed. Horse riding is becoming a more popular sport something has to be done.",
