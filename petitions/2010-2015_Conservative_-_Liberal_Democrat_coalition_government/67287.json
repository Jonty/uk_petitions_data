This is a matter of national road safety and should not be decided by local authority accountants.\r\n\r\nAll evidence shows that removing the service will lead to injuries and deaths to young people. In the words of Prime Minister David Cameron, (when adding his support to the UN Decade of Action For Road Safety in May 2011): \u201cRoad accidents are still the leading cause of death for British teenagers and young adults \u2013 with the loss of six or seven people in road crashes every day.\u201d\r\n\r\nLocal Authorities should not be able to cut the service and endanger young lives not just in Liverpool but across the UK.
