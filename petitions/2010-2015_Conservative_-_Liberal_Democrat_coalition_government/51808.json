        "additional_details": "TV licensing was introduced in 1946, therefore it seems archaic to still be using this system in 2013. I strongly believe that people who are struggling financially should not have to pay a TV licence. At present this is a highly unfair system with only those over 75 exempt from the fee. The BBC does not need this money, especially when they can afford to waste \u00a398 million on their now defunct \"Digital Media Initiative\".",
