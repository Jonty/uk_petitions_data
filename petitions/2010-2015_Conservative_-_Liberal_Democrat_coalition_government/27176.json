        "action": "Repeal or amend s.59 of the Police Reform Act 2002",
        "additional_details": "Section 59 allows a constable to seize a vehicle suspected of being used in a manner causing \"alarm, distress or annoyance\". Unlike penalty points or speeding fines there no right of appeal in court, meaning this legislation is open to abuse. Whilst the police should be able to seize vehicles where doing so is in the public interest, such decisions need to be accountable meaning that there has to be a right of appeal in front of an impartial court. Therefore, I call upon the government to repeal or amend s.59 to allow a right of appeal.",
