At present, any firearm which either has a barrel less than 30cm in length or is less than 60cm in length overall, is prohibited. This has effectively killed off the sport of pistol shooting, even for olympic competitors.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to ask MPs to revisit the regulations so that 'normal' pistols can be legally held by individuals for use at Home Office approved ranges and shooting clubs.",
