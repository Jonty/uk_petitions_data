The recent addition of F1 means that another sports is off Free TV essentially and on pay-for TV.\r\n\r\nI remember the days when Italian football was a fixture on Channel 4 and highlights on Channel 5. A great alternative with great support. The petition here is to bring it back. Spanish, English, German and French football are all taken by Sky, ESPN and Al-Jazeera. Italian football has the odd game on ESPN whilst plenty others are shunned.\r\n\r\nItalian football is a hidden gem and a potential goldmine for British TV. Bring it back!",
