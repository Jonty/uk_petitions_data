The school needs to be rebuilt for the sake of the pupils on the roll, for them to be able to learn in modern, fit for purpose buildings.  We must not let the school be closed down or amalgamated with another.  The  students are not to bhlame for falling numbers, they are the victims of systemic lack of investment by the LA.  I am sure they would all wish for a 21st century school environment to learn in, to go with the rest of the best of what the Grange already delivers.  Good education. ",
