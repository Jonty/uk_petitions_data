Elections on a weekday are difficult for families that work and for people who work shifts. Moving the day to a Sunday would more suitable for modern workers and for people who have children. Where workers have children the pressures at the end of the working day are doubly difficult.\r\n\r\nElection on a Sunday in France have seen to be far more inclusive of opinion due to the much higher turnout. This is good for democracy. ",
