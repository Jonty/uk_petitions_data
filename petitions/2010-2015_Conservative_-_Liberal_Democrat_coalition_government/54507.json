        "additional_details": "The stated aim of the trial badger cull is to test Defra's assumptions about the effectiveness (in terms of badger removal), humaneness and safety of culling. The trial has already proved that the killing is not humane. Protestors and residents in the locality of the Somerset cull, report hearing prolonged screams from dying badgers. If people living near to an abattoir reported hearing prolonged screams from dying animals the facility would be immediately closed, as no-one can claim that a death which lasts long enough for the animal to scream in pain, is humane. The trial has therefor proven the basic assumptions to be wrong and so must be stopped immediately.",
