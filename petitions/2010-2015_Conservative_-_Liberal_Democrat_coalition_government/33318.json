As much as I wish animal testing would be banned completely, I don't believe this will be the case anytime soon. So I put forward that we should be made aware of all products that are tested on animals by having it clearly stated on the label. We see \"This product has not been tested on animals\", so why can't we see \"This product has been tested on animals\"? Hopefully this will drive these companies to find alternative ways for testing.",
