        "additional_details": "Everyone is alway complaining that they are fed up with inflation busting increases in public transport fares and the already high prices in general. The lack of service means that these sicknening increases are a slap in the face for the average commuter. It's time to do something about it. As a public sector worker who does a long distance commute Monday to Friday, these increases are crippling. I know I'm not alone. My salary has not increased for the past 3 years yet my travel has increased by \u00a3800 per annum over the same time and is due to increase by up to 13% this January. This, what with the expected increase in Fuel and utility bills, pretty soon I am not going to be able to afford to commute to work and will join the long queue of unemployed citizens in this country. I want the government to stop these private companies extorting millions by increasing already high fares when they are already subsidised by Tax Payers Money.Bonuses in Public Transport should also be abolished.",
