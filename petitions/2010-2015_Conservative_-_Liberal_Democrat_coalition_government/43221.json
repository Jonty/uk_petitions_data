        "additional_details": "Osborne recently announced a massive investment plan for 20 gas power stations. Days later Fracking plans were authorised.\r\n\r\nWe do not believe fossil or nuclear power offers a viable future for Britain, either ethically or financially. A plant at Carrington is estimated at 600million pounds, 20 costing 12billion, plus gas.\r\n\r\nImagine the potential advances if the Chancellor gave firm confirmation that 1 year later he would order 12 billion pounds worth of renewable generators.\r\n\r\nEven ignoring Global Warming, there are many benefits of building renewables instead. Cleaner air improving public health, lowering costs to NHS. Instability in gas producing areas no longer an issue. More money kept within the UK by not having to buy foreign supplies. Improved export market, bringing more jobs and tax.\r\n\r\nIf we do master fusion or similar, it\u2019s much easier recycle renewable generators than to remove greenhouse gasses from the air.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of legacy do we want to leave our grandchildren?",
