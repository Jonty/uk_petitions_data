        "additional_details": "I feel the government should lower the tobacco purchase age back down to 16 as it it pointless to have it at the current 18+.\r\n  Smokers can legally smoke at 16 therefore they will and     have discover ways to get there tobacco products\r\n Also the age restrictions make the younger smokers more likely to'rebel' and try to purchase these products. Okay smoking can and is very dangerous to you and others but don't you think they know that? smokers know the risks and they have accepted the fact they are killing themselves but everyone has the right to do what they wish to their own lives.In July 2012 statistics show that in england 150,000 11-15 year olds are regular smokers so clearly the government system is not working! I feel that the government should reduce purchase age back to 16 and that the 18+ law is stupid because it will not stop underage smoking people will get around the system! If you feel the tobacco purchase age should be restored to 16 then sign my petition!",
