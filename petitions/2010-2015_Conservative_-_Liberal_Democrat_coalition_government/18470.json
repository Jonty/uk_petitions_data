        "action": "Reducing the levels of poverty in the U.K should be of greater importance than reducing levels in other countries",
        "additional_details": "Levels of poverty, among children especially, is rising thanks to current economic conditions. It is my belief that whilst it is admirable for the government to be maintaining aid to impoverished countries, it is a governments first and fore most responsibility to look after its citizens. More should be done to bring run-away parents to face their responsibilities, more should be done to educate people, especially from poorer areas, how to escape the poverty trap in this country. Please sign this is you wish to make a difference to the impoverished members of our communities. I don't mean an xbox or plasma screen television in every home, I mean basic living requirements, the availability of more jobs for family members, more teaching on the subject, and most importantly a bit of common sense in our welfare system. Thank you for signing. ",
