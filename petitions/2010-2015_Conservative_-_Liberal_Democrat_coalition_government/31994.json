        "additional_details": "Cigarettes are now enclosed behind shutters in shops but yet alcohol is still on open display.   This petition is to  ask the government to also shutter alcohol up in shops in order that people will have to also go through the same process to buy alcohol.... particular type,price etc.    Alcohol is just as big a killer as  cigarettes yet the government don't treat it as such.  Please sign this petition so there is an equal fairness in the way smokers and alcohol drinkers are treated.",
