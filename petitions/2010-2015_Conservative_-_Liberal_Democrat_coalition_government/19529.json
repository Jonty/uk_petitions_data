Whilst low engery bulbs may save small amounts of energy they are very hazadous to health and if a person suffers from migraine, epilepsy or any kind of eye condition they are advised not to use low energy bulbs as their condition will get worse.  Low energy bulbs contain mercury and must be treated as hazadous waste when being disposed of, including evacuation of the area should you break one.  Low energy bulbs are twice the price of incandescent bulbs but have a much worse performance record.  Forcing the public to use hazardous high cost low energy bulbs by the removal of all other choices is \"Dictatorial\".",
