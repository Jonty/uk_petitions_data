We are expected to function equally in the workplace but the effects of the menopause can be so debilitating as to disadvantage women in the workplace and they can end up being dismissed or overlooked for promotion because of the health issues arising from the menopause.\r\nThe current prescription for many HRT therapies contains 2 ingredients so women are being charged double- \u00a318.00 - why should his be so and why should women pay just to function normally? Women are being disadvantaged on the grounds of gender and age. This is discrimination. Free HRT would be a small expense on the public purse, compared to the millions of pounds lost every day in sickness absence and loss of productivity. ",
