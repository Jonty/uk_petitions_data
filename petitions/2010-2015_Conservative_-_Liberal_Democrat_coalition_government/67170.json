Lions bred in captivity in South Africa, petted and raised by volunteers & tourists and then sold to be hunted, often drugged & baited.\r\n\r\nThese tourists & volunteers are not aware of the lions destination.\r\n\r\nLion farmers also need a constant supply of wild lions to prevent in-breeding, leading to poached lions.\r\n\r\nThe likes of Melissa Bachman & Kendall Jones are clear examples of hunters & their focus on the thrill of killing rather than actual conservation of the species.\r\n\r\nWhere there's doubt over a lion trophy's origin or unethical background, the UK must take the stance of denying the import of all lion trophies.\r\n\r\nMore information;\r\n\r\nwww.cannedlion.org\r\nwww.walkingforlions.org",
