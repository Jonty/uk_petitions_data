This will mean that you have to opt out if you do not want to give your organs to those in need when you no longer need them. Why do so few people have donor cards? Because we're evil? Because we want those who need our organs to die? Or is it because we are busy and do not have the time?  Because we have not been told what we need to do or where we need to go in order to get donor cards? ",
