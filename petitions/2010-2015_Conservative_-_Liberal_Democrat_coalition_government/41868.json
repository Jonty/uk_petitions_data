        "additional_details": "Low voter turn out is often a problem in local elections.  This can clearly be seen in the recent police and crime commisioner polls.  If a politician wins the majority of votes, he can claim a mandate to represent all the people, even if he wins only 60% of a 15% voter turn out.  This means that every vote cast is interpreted as a vote supporting the political system.  There is no means to register dissent.\r\n\r\nI request parliment enact a law that requires spoilt ballots be counted and published in every election.\r\n\r\nThe following points may be relevant for parliment to consider:\r\n- A spoilt ballot tick box should be provided on every ballot paper, so the voters intention is clear.\r\n- Majority candidates who fail to beat the number of spoilt ballots should be required to resign.\r\n- When reporting election results, spoilt ballots should always be reported alongside voter turn out figures.\r\n- Voter turn out figures and winning margin figures should include spoilt ballots.",
