With flexible working (different places, routes, train operators, part time or zero hours working) they don't offer savings\r\n\r\nPlease bring in a unified electronic charging scheme across all operators based on a known and simple formula (distance, speed of journey, and time of day).  'Bulk buy' discounts for commuters could replace season tickets, but this must be flexible across operators/routes.\r\nNo charge for journeys that you haven't made, or  any excessively delayed journeys. Single journey to cost half the cost of a return journey. Discounts applied for children, students, pensioners ..\r\n\r\nThe cost and any restrictions to be shown clearly before you start a journey.\r\n\r\nThis would make for fairer, more flexible rail travel.\r\n",
