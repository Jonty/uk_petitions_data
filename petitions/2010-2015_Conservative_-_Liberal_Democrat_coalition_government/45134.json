        "additional_details": "I am starting this petition to appeal to the Department of Work and Pensions in order to make sure benefit payments are made in cash and paid directly into the recipients account and not given out on Universal Cards which would stigmatize and be offensives to people in receipt of benefits. The Universal Card scheme would also most probably not be as widely accepted and could potentially have problems with security and end up having interest rates applied to it that would have to be paid back when the person in receipt of the benefits situation changes which would also have a negative impact.
