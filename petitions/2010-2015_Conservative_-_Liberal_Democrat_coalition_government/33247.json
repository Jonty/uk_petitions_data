        "additional_details": "This petition is to gather support for my request to Government to make every care home offer and supply internet connections in every residents room so that families can plug in webcams to view how their relatives are being cared for also, the connections must have at least 99% up time.\r\n\r\nI believe if this suggestion if made compulsory will act as psychological physical deterrent against abuse.\r\n\r\nThe penalty for non compliance could be a fine with money going to the NHS and a clear negative entry on the homes CQC report.",
