        "additional_details": "In history, those of you or your parents who experienced the firm zero tolerance attitude of schooling know that this was also the perfect nurture to develop high class individuals with morals, respect and manners, such that we see so rarely nowadays in our youth. A prime example being the riots of August 2011. It would be unwise to allow disciplining of children in our homes as there being no way of maintaining a vigilant eye on excessive abuse of children by parent/guardians, but schools could do it with the appropriate support of parents and the government. Let us teach our future leaders how we are different from primates.",
