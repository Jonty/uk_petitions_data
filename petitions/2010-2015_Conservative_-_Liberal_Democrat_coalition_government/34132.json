        "additional_details": "Henry Blofeld (\"Blowers\") is a national treasure.  He does more than anyone else since John Arlott and Brian Johnstone to make English cricket attactive (and understandable!) to the people.  He truly makes it a pleasure to listen to Test Match Special on the BBC and leads one to wish to attend test matches in person.  At a time when Knighthoods (and even Peerages) are being given liberally to sports men and women, it is high time that Blowers' unique contribution to English sporting life was recognised by the award of a Knighthood for services to cricket and broadcasting.",
