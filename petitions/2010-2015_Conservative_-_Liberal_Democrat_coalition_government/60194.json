        "additional_details": "Remove Michael Gove from being the Educational Secretary and replace him with someone who has had more experience  in ensuring all children have an education that prepares them socially, culturally,  academically, morally and mentally for adulthood.  It is not just about academic excellence, it is preparing young people to be able to function in a fast-paced society. Not all children have the academic capacity to achieve so many other aspects of school life must have importance placed on them. Michael Gove is not able to see the wider implications of his current decisions. I would like the government to consult more school teachers and parents on how they could contribute towards decision making. Most importantly consult young people of all areas of society of whom these decision will directly impact to better inform decisions. ",
