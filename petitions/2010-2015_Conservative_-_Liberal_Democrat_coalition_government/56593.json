Too many family's are destroyed each year at the hands of people who have far too much power. These meetings are reccorded only in writing and by social care staff which are not nutural. Far too long have these people played god and taken children from inoccent parents that have done nothing wrong at all and childrens lives being tawn to shreds. Social workers do no always work within the law and treat parents so badly and this is the only way to stop it happening and if it does still happen gives parents the proof when members of staff treat them in appauling ways. This i feel is also key in making sure evidance provided to court is 100% factually correct rather than at best at 50/50 i think this is the only way forward to changing the system so it can work effectively. all reccordings are to be copied and given to all involved in the meeting along side a typed up copy ",
