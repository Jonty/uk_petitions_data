        "additional_details": "Stephen Sutton is a 19-yeer old man dying of cancer. Through his exemplary bravery he has raised over \u00a31.7million and counting for the Teenage Cancer Trust, the largest donation that organisation has ever received.  His fundraising will make a real difference to the lives of young people with cancer.\r\n\r\nWe call upon Her Majesty's Government to recognise Stephen's unique contribution and the terminal nature of his condition.  We believe that Stephen Sutton should be offered a Knighthood as a matter of urgency.",
