        "additional_details": "For too long the education system in this country has suffered as a result of the governmental political popularity contest.\r\nWasted funding, poor decisions, a lack of understanding of underlying issues and with both eyes firmly on the next election, we consistently fail to deliver positive change with quick fixes or mis-management at both national and local levels.\r\nEducation must be separated from the cyclical needs of political parties squabbling for votes and coming up with uneducated decisions, rather than addressing the bigger long term picture.\r\nEducation should be a tool for improvement in our society, and not a something that should be tossed around like a political toy.\r\nWe seek that this be discussed at the highest level, outside of personal and political agenda and for the greater good of the future of our great nation.\r\nWe want educational reform; for educational control free from any political agenda, with a long term view in mind, for the benefit of all concerned.",
