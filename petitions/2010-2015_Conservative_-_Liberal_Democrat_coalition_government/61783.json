        "additional_details": "Due to the noticable lack of morale across the British population I have been heavily advised to consider the introduction of a new British law which makes it compulsory for every British national to enjoy the delights of tea and biscuits on a Sunday. The law will be policed by friend and family through a whistleblowing scheme. Breaching of the law will include punishments of social isolation and scowling from friends and family, relativally minor offenses of course, but neccesary to ensure the British population can bask in the grace of tea and biscuits and the economic and social benifits which would follow through a general uplift of community spirit and morale. The law is mandatory for all peoples unless medically exempt.\r\n",
