        "additional_details": "If only 10% of our art and artifacts from our museums and art galleries were rented out, we would accrue enough income to fully fund their upkeep. We have many things that are kept in warehouses and are never seen by anyone at all - these should be brought out into the art galleries and museums to finally be viewed by the public who bought them. The chances are that if we don't change the future generations will never see these things.\r\n\r\nVote for this now.",
