PCSO's are now the most likely first point of contact between police and the public but are limited as to their powers. A small increase in the number of powers to include minor traffic offences such as using mobile phones whilst driving and failing to wear seat belts along with powers to tackle simple parking offences, will not only be a tool to more effectively police these seemingly unpoliced offences, it will also assist with financing the role and thereby relieving budgetary pressure on the police forces. A complete review should be undertaken to assess any additional powers that would better serve the needs of the communities.\r\n",
