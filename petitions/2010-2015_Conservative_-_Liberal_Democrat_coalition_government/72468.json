        "additional_details": "The DfT issued guidelines in circular DfT 01/2007 regarding the deployment of safety cameras. These guidelines are fair and concise.\r\n\r\nhttp://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070205102153/http:/www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/cameras/pdfdftcirc0107?version=2\r\n\r\nSafety partnerships adopt these guidelines as best practice, however they caveat this by stipulating that they are not legally bound to deploy cameras in accordance with these guidelines.\r\n\r\nIncreasingly, partnerships are moving away from these guidelines.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this is twofold.\r\n\r\n1. Concealed camera deployments offer zero deterrent to speeding and as such make no immediate contribution to road safety.\r\n\r\n2. Concealed cameras proliferate the perception of their use as a method of stealth taxation, undermining of the objectives behind safety cameras.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the guidelines regarding deployment of safety cameras as described in DfT circular 01/2007 to be made a legal requirement.\r\n\r\n",
