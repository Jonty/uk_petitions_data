Following his release from prison he has been searching for a second chance, a second chance we all deserve. Due to a massive media hype, also a section of the public, and other authorities he hasn't been taken on by a football club yet. Members of the public have created petitions to get him to stop playing football. This case is well known nationally and am not going to go into detail. Like I said I am creating this petition to see how far we get!",
