        "action": "Stop low expectations in schools",
        "additional_details": "Too many teachers, head teachers and school have low expectations of individuals and groups of pupils. This includes low expectations of African Caribbean pupils, working class children, children of single parents and girls in science and maths. Many pupils and parents see this, but are reluctant to complain for fear of poor treatment of their children. Teachers and\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned, ask that the Department for Education issue guidance to ALL schools - including state, academies and private schools. No school should be able to achieve a top - Outstanding or Excellent inspection grade unless they can show that they have high expectations of vulnerable groups and that they encourage parents and pupils to raise any concerns of low expectations.",
