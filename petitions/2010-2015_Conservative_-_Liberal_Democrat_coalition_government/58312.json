        "additional_details": "The production of palm oil is having devastating effects on our planet! Rainforests are being destroyed for palm crops. This kills every living thing within it, such as Orangutans, Pygmy Elephants, Sumatran Rhino, Clouded Leopards and thousands more (some haven\u2019t even been found and never will be!). Rainforests are the lungs of our earth and help reverse the effects of global warming by absorbing the carbon and releasing oxygen which is vital for our survival!\r\nCompanies are now being very sly; by labeling palm oil as vegetable oil we as consumers cannot avoid products containing it and unknowingly contribute to the damage that will eventually suffocate us all!!\r\nThis is the first stage to help save our rainforests and all the life it contains!! PLEASE sign this petition to make our government enforce that producers must clearly label palm oil in their products ingredients!!\r\nGiving us the consumers the power to choose!",
