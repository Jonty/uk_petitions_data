        "additional_details": "The Legal Aid budget for the UK is \u00a32 billion (\u00a32,000,000,000) a year all going into pockets of parasitic lawyers paid for by me and you.  It\u2019s the highest legal aid budget for any country in the world and it gets bigger and bigger every year.\r\n\r\nIt costs every man woman and child \u00a330 a year.  The average for other European countries is \u00a34 a year.\r\n\r\nIt has been driven by greedy parasitic lawyers pursuing everything and anything through the courts for the sole reason of them getting your money.\r\n\r\nSigners of this petition want the Government to stop this lunacy and cut legal aid for anything which does not involve the possibility of a prison sentence.\r\n",
