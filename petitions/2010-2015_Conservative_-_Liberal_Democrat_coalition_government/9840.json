Instead of letting people rot in prison, they will defend their country, instead of robbing stores, they will learn respect, instead of living on benefits, they will be trained in a skill and will leave the armed forces as productive members of society.\r\n\r\nIf you are living on council benefits, you will be placed under the care of the armed forces along with your family. The family will be inducted into the military community where they will also learn respect.\r\n\r\nInstead of a huge welfare budget we can have a huge defense budget and allow the forces to decide how best to utilise this huge workforce.",
