        "additional_details": "Retail Filling Stations are declining at the rate of 600 per year and have been for over 20 years. Supermarkets are using fuel as a loss leader to unfairly dominate the market, the concept that their fuel is cheap draws customers in think the rest of their produce is cheap.The consequence is that the hard working independent retailer is unable to make a living.\r\n\r\nCreate a duty rebate of 5p per litre for the first 1,000,000 litres of fuel sold per year per filling station. At the same time increase duty by 1p to finance the rebate.\r\n\r\nThis will protect rural filling stations and promote growth and jobs. This will also stimulate investment from fuel companies. Most importantly it will enable retailers to make a fair margin on a fair market share and safe guard the future of the industry.",
