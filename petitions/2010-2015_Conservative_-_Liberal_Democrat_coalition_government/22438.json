        "additional_details": "Crews of World War 2 Bomber Command aircraft were all volunteers. During the war Winston Churchill's Government pressed for area bombing to disrupt the War Industry of Nazi Germany. The crews of Bomber Command aircraft were sent out night after night to carry out the wishes of the Government. Some 55,000 crews members paid the ultimate price. This equates to about a 50 percent attrition rate. Yet once victory was achieved the men were ignored when it came to recognising their sacrifice and dedication.\r\nIt is not too late to issue a Campaign Medal and the Government should do so before it is too late.",
