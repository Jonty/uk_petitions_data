        "additional_details": "The PIP Assessment process takes too long and the inability to provide a prompt decision or provide any helpful information by the companies that are involved means that people are using their own savings to fund something that should take weeks rather than months, causing their debts to spiral through no fault of their own and therefore putting more financial pressure on the person who has applied aswell putting added pressure on the carers and families that are providing them with support.\r\n\r\nI would like for a set deadline to be discussed, agreed and put into place to prevent the prolonged financial effects that PIP applicants and their families are currently going through due to lack of indecision - it cannot be left open-ended and it cannot be expected for people to continue indefinitely without any timescales given.  Health worries on their own are diffiult enough without having additional financial pressures.",
