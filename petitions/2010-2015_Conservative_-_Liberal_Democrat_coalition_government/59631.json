        "additional_details": "The Faroe Islands holds an annual event each year as means of cultural practice, where Pilot Whales and other cetaceans such as Atlantic White-sided dolphins and Bottle-nosed Whales are slaughtered each year. And pain isn't spared, they don't die instantly by means of humane methods; but rather by using thick hooks that are cruelly and unmercifully stabbed into their bodies several time, with the creatures dying in their own blood. Although the Faroe Island have their own Parliament, they are under the sovereignty of Denmark, and therefore both parties should be held accountable. They should help by creating restrictions along with the United Nations to enforce sanctions on both countries, to force them to stop this cruel practice that we all seem to allow, while we continue to judge Japan's whaling program.",
