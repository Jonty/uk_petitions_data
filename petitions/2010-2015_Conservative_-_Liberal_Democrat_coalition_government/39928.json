It is a higher education than to what college is, basically.\r\n\r\nLying will not make people vote, because when government parties have been elected, and then they do not do what government parties say they will do, it will just make people not willing to vote until they see CHANGE HAPPEN! Government parties ought to be ashamed, that they make people believe what they say they will do, but they never do.",
