        "additional_details": "We would like the removal of Potassium Nitrate from cigarettes and other smoking materials.\r\n\r\nThe addition of potassium nitrate (salt petre) is to ensure an 'even burn' of the tobacco.\r\n\r\nThis also ensures the cigarette stays lit when discarded or forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn 2007 over 3000 accidental house fires were attributed to 'carelessly discarded smoking materials'.\r\n\r\nThe removal of potassium nitrate will mean that if the cigarette is not actively 'sucked' it will go out.\r\n\r\nI believe this not only reduce the number accidental fires, but will also help people to reduce the amount they smoke if their cigarette keeps going out.\r\n\r\nThis action has already been been legislation in Australia.",
