        "additional_details": "A typical 125cc motorcycle produces less than 1.5g/km of CO and pays \u00a316 per year in vehicle excise duty (road tax) whereas a small car producing as much up to 100g/km of CO pays nothing due to perceived environmental friendliness.\r\n\r\nIn addition to producing less CO, motorcycles do less damage to road surfaces, require less brownfield parking space and cause significantly less congestion.\r\n\r\nI would like to see motorcycles taxed more fairly and in a manner that reflects their environmental impact and encourages the use of this lower polluting form of transport. If a car producing 100g/km of CO pays no road tax then it is unfair to charge motorcycles considerably more when they have a significantly lower environmental impact.",
