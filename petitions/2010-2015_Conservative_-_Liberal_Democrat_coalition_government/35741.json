        "additional_details": "This petition is in total disgust that due to the Olympics in Portland, Dorset, a memorial bench for a young lad who was killed, is to be removed. The family and friends of this lad are totally guttered by the back handed tactics of the local council to do this without advising the family in full.\r\n\r\nThe bench is located at Black Barge on Portland in Castletown. Stop this NOW and save this family the devastating upset of having the memory of their son treated in this manner.",
