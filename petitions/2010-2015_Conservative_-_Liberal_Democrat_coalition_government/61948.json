This is extremely expensive and as the Association receives NO Government funding, our MP's should do something about this!\r\n\r\nThe Government should recognise Guide Dogs as working dogs and allow the Association to save a fortune on VAT which can go towards training more life-changing dogs!\r\n\r\nLet's Change This!",
