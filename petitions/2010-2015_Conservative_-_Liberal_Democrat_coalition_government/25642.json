        "additional_details": "All home insurance in the UK offers flood cover as standard, however this only applies where insurance is actually offered. I am buying a house near a river and have found it surprisingly difficult to get any insurance, let alone affordable. Many major insurance companies exempt previously flooded homes through their 'assumptions'. You then need to either phone them up, or in some cases they will refuse to insure those not meeting their assumptions.\r\n10% of homes are at risk of flooding, the reduction of companies offering insurance reduces competition (almost no comparison sites give many results) pushing prices higher.
