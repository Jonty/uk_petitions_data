        "additional_details": "The new immigration rules discriminate against British pensioners and other poorly paid citizens.They are likely to force many people who are British citizens to live abroad because they have chosen to fall in love and marry a non EU citizen..The new rules take no account of personal circumstances or of property owned by people wanting to marry non EU citizens..It is all based upon income.The government wants the backbone of society to be the family but at the same time they penalise poor people who want to marry.These new rules clearly  discriminate against poor people and infringe the rights of some British citizens of the right to a family life.The government needs to revise these new rules and bring in less severe rules and fund the UK Border agency to review each person's application to marry and settle a non EU spouse in Britain more sympathetically.",
