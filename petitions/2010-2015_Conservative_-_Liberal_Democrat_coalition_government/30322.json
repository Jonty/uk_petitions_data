        "additional_details": "Every day, people are dying in Syria fighting for their right to freedom. Yet, the government of Syria violently suppress the protestors, leading to a lot of deaths. They are performing illegal acts. No more observer teams, no more sanctions, the leader simply doesn't care. Action needs to be taken in the country to stop the Syrian government taking more lives. This took place in Libya and the same must happen in this situation too. This is the only way for any chance of stability in the country.",
