Businesses will pay 10p on turn over and taxpayers 10p on gross income. The  only allowance being the salary bill of employers.This way everybody pays their bit and it not only makes tax returns simple but it will also prevent the big corporations buying land or buildings to avoid paying tax.In addition it will allow lower paid workers to have more money in their wages to spend and help to get the country moving again.\r\nAfter 2 years you should see an increase in tax collected and a decrease in tax inspectors required allowing them to be reassigned to the collection of VAT.
