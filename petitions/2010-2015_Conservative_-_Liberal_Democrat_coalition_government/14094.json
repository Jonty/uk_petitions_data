        "additional_details": "Later this year the Government intends to withdraw coach subsidies for the over 60's.\r\n\r\nSmall long distance private coach companies such as Berrys of Taunton will lose a great deal of trade when the subsidy is withdrawn as currenty a large number of their customers are over 60 and will not want to travel once the subsidy goes.\r\n\r\nOther firms around the country such as National Express will also suffer in the same way and many smaller ones will go out of business as people leave them in large numbers seeking a cheaper alternatives.\r\n\r\nLarge number of over 60's use the coaches at present particularly those in rural areas which are not served by trains. Many do not have cars and so these long distance coaches are a lifeline to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Government should make a complete U Turn on this and continue to support these coach companies.\r\n\r\nThis cut has been on the cards for a long time but it is only recently it has been bought to the attention of the public through the press.\r\n\r\n",
