        "additional_details": "I would like the Prime Minister to reconsider pausing international aid and re-routing the money to help the communities in the UK who have sadly been affected by the recent flooding. I would like the government to use the aid money to give to UK citizens who have lost everything, UK businesses who have suffered because of the recent floods. And also use the money to build a network of 1m concrete piping that would be all around the country and could pump water around the uk when needed or even out to sea. this would stop any future flooding and help in drought situations. Why should we send billions of pounds abroad when we need the help ourselves, its utter madness.\r\n1: build a netwrk of concrete piping to handle flood water/rainwater around the country\r\n2: Use international aid money to help people who had no insurance and businesses etc\r\n3: Use the money to build proper permanent sea defences.",
