        "additional_details": "Approximately 45,000 so-called \"ale-trailers\" enter into villages between Batley and Stalybridge each year with around 2000 visiting these small villages along the way on Saturdays in the summer months. Alcohol is \"freely\" consumed at many of these unmanned stations causing groups of people to  urinate on platforms, urinate in the corridors of trains, trespass on Network Rail land and generally cause anti-social behaviour. Marsden and Slaithwaite are un-manned stations and it is only a matter of time before one of these \"ale-trailers\" (usually on a stag or hen do - intoxicated before 2pm in the afternoon) goes under a train.\r\nPlease \"enforce\" adequately a ban on consuming alcohol on the platform and on the train itself on this line for the safety of \"all\" using (or trying to use) this service.\r\n",
