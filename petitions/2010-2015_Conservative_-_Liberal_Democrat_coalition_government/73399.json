        "additional_details": "The song 'Come Over' by Clean Bandit is not the problem. The problem remains with the way the video has been produced for the song. The Video starts of with the Islamic Call for prayer; the 'Adhan'. The Adhan has no relevance to the song, therefore why has it been published in a music video? Especially, when Islam and Music do not even combine with one another, why was it seen ok to do this? It is offensive to the religion and therefore the video should either be altered to ensure that the Adhan is not in there or the video to be removed. ",
