Those who pay can suffer with an ever spiraling debt through practices of that sector and credit ratings that can never recover due continuos defaults, issued debt collection agencies and financial service companies. I also have an issue with debt sold; it can be worth the value of the original debt and should debtor should be told if the debt is sold and value to negotiate an appropriate repayment value. Just a few ideas but very open to discussion on such a wide subject, that open to new approach.",
