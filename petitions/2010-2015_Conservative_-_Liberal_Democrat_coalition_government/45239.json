        "additional_details": "There has been a proposal to build a skate park next to the back fields which is near the red path in bessacarr. This is out of the way and there are no lights or houses near this. As a community we would feel our children are safer if the skatepark is built on Bolton Hill Bessacarr. This is well lit, has houses all around it and is easilt accessible. The proposed location is somewhere where youths will drink on evenings as it is very dark and deserted so to send children there to plat seems ludacris. ",
