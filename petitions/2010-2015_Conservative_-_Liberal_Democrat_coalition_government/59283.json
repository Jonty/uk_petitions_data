        "additional_details": "I propose that the way the Stamp Duty tax structure works when purchasing a new home is changed to a fresh-hold based taxation structure.\r\n\r\nSo when purchasing a property at a cost of \u00a3300,000 etc. the first \u00a3250,000 should be taxed at 1% and the remaining \u00a350,000 at 3% and so on until each fresh-hold is passed.\r\n\r\nAt present once a fresh-hold is passed you must pay the relevant percentage of tax on the TOTAL purchase price. For example the tax on a house costing \u00a3250,000 would be \u00a32500 (1%), however if I was to pay \u00a31 more (\u00a3250,001) the tax would be \u00a37500 (3%)?!\r\n\r\nWith my proposed structure: the tax would be \u00a34000 (a saving of \u00a33500) which is much more fair, the increase is not be so vast and I believe this would help inject life into the house purchase market.\r\n",
