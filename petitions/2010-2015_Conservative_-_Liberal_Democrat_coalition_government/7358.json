        "additional_details": "There is a clear feeling amongst young people of today, that we are not listened too, and that politics is out of touch with our generation. The majority of students and young people disagree with the violent and often mindless few who tarnish our reputation with acts of appauling nature. A department within government, run by young people who wish to make changes and also understand the feelings of our generation, which were elected and funded by the government, could be majorly successful in combating what is an ever changing society with many difficulties. Most importantly, the government would need to listen to these young people. This is definately worth debate in the House of Commons!! ",
