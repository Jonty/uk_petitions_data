        "additional_details": "I ask the government to create several members of parliament to represent the 5 million plus Britons living abroad (expatriates) similar to what is done in France. France has 11 MPs for its 2 million expats (representing different constituencies throughout the world) as well as 12 senators and a dedicated minister. Britons abroad would vote in general elections for their own MP to represent their specific interests, including pensions and benefit rights. These MPs would better represent the interests of British expatriates, many of whom continue to pay tax \u2013 and own property - in the UK.",
