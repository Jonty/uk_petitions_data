A bank taking charges that force someone to go overdrawn, and then charge them subsequently for that should not be allowed.\r\n\r\nSomeone on a low monthly wage could find themselves trapped in this cycle wasting large amounts of money over a year.\r\n\r\nSign this petition if you think that a bank should only withdraw charges if sufficient funds are available in a persons account.",
