        "additional_details": "I am urging you to consider a constitutional amendment to change the voting age from 18 to 16 in a historic move. I believe that the younger generation should have a political say in what goes on in Britain to make this country more democratic. We should follow Scotland's example.\r\n\r\nI believe doing this would change the apathy towards politics in many younger people by letting them be involved in the decisions that are made on their behalf by the government. By letting this involvement, I also believe that politics should be taught at schools so the young people of Britain can make decisions based on their beliefs and not waste the vote that is given to them.\r\n\r\nTherefore please consider this e-petition as a matter of change that is needed in this country. Make the next step in electoral reform a vote for the younger people of this country. ",
