Also, adverts should be put in place to teach adults the importance of not approaching or provoking a dog by understanding their body language. A dog is an animal and will react but not before giving off signs that it's in distress, fight or flight. In the case of a dog being leashed or backed up into a corner results in 'fight'.",
