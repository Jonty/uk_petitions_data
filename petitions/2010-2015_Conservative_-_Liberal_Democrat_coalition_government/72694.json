        "additional_details": "Recently the government stealthily passed a series of borderline antiquated laws regarding the perceived idea of what is acceptable between consenting adults during intercourse. These laws banned the depiction of certain acts in UK created pornography which, under proper control and understanding by sexual participants, are part of normal sexual behaviour. Why the government has felt the need to ban these actions in a time when sexuality is more open now than ever is a mystery. This sets a bad precedence by the government of stating what is acceptable in society in regards to adult, consensual sexual activity, and the government has no place declaring such things.",
