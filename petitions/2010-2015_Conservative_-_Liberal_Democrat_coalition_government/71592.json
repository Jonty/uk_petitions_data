It would also create a boost to jobs and the tourism industry.\r\n\r\nThe idea of Single Double Summer Time (SDST) has been debated for years. It simply involves moving our clocks here in the UK one hour further forward than we currently do, all year round. We\u2019d still change our clocks in spring and autumn, so we\u2019d be GMT+1 in winter and GMT+2 in summer.",
