        "additional_details": "There should be a stop to the sick amount of money Premier League clubs get & share more down all the divisions even in non league clubs to enhance the prospect of younger players having a career in football and stop Premier League clubs poaching players from lower divisions and just giving them 20K. There has been a lot of smaller clubs scrapping the youth system because of the greed and even going out of business and administration, how can you pay some players 300.000 a week and some clubs have to survive all year on this as well as pay there playerys. this is disgraceful and should stop now. Please sign this to get it discussed and in the open, If you want a successful English team let smaller clubs produce the players for the bigger clubs who can then buy thus again giving lower league clubs more money to invest in youth  TIME TO STOP THE RAPE OF CLUBS SIGN NOW AND GET ACTION. I will give full details on request. THIS MUST STOP. AND NO TO B TEAMS. ",
