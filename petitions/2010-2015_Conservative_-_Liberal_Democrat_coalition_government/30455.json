        "additional_details": "After coming under attack from several DDoS attacks daily. Contacting my ISP and being told they could do nothing for me. I was shocked, disappointed and frustrated. These sorts of attacks are becoming more common and widespread. These sorts of attacks are illegal, and often the culprits operate overseas and there is little the average domestic internet user can do to prevent them except by taking manual action to prevent themselves from being attacked and in most cases users who are being attacked either do not realise and can become infected and join in attacking others. In most cases most users will not know how to secure themselves. Manually configuring network security against is no longer viable due to the scale of this abuse, ISP's should act together to prevent the groups of abusers who are causing the problem and provide better for their paying customers. I urge the government to take action in this increasing problem and work with ISP's to come to a solution.",
