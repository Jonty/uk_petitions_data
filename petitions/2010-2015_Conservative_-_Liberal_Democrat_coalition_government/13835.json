It possibly even prevents fried meat from achieving a higher cooking temperature.\r\n\r\nThe suppliers claim this is done \"as an aid to cooking\" but this is clearly nonsense - it is done to increase the weight and volume so they can charge more. The legal maximum proportion of added water should be drastically reduced.\r\n",
