        "additional_details": "Since voting electronically on a single day is technically impracticable, then allow electronic voting, by computer, tablet or smart phone, over the same time scale as a postal vote. This preserves security and secrecy and saves money. It also encourages people to vote as they don't have to go anywhere and can vote at any time of day. The November 2012 police commissioner elections might have benefitted from this.",
