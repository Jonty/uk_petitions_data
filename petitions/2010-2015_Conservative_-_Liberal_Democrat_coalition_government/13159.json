        "additional_details": "We are running a MASSIVE budget deficit and, as a result of prohibition, we are DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of individuals who are at the lower level of the violent drug trade.\r\n\r\nIt only makes sense to divert funds that are currently going DIRECTLY to CRIMINAL organisations go to the Government instead. That way we can support our schools, hospitals, infrastructure, drugs rehabilitation and put REAL criminals behind bars (such as rapists getting 4 year sentences).\r\n\r\nIt is a win-win situation, by taking such a small step such as legalising hemp, we are taking income from criminals and giving it to our public services instead. Why not use this massive pool of money to our benefit?\r\n\r\nLegalise and tax hemp for a better future.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's legalise hemp to pay back our debts quickly & painlessly! It beats cutting public services.",
