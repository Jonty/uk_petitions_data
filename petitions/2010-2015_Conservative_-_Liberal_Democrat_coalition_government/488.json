How dare a Pay TV company be allowed to monopolise almost every single sport in this country!\r\n\r\nThe majority of people either do not want to Pay to watch Sky, due to the Murdoch family involvement within the company, or cannot afford it.\r\n\r\nThe Government should give the public, as people who pay money to the BBC, the right to have their say as to what the License Fee should be spent on, AND be party to a vote upon any upcoming major changes to the BBC's schedule or coverage.\r\n\r\nThe BBC are out of touch with it's audience, are you, the Government, willing to show that you are not?",
