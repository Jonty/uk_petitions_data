Too many 'Think-Tanks' and taxpayer funded Quango's are completely out of touch with the lives of ordinary people.  The creation of a Citizens Forum would help to redress the balance by allowing people to discuss, consider and express opinions in a similar fashion to those expressed by 'Think-Tank' and Quango members. The people of the United Kingdom deserve to be heard. ",
