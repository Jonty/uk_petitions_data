The men it was dedicated to, fought and gave their lives in defence of the very Democracy you now desicrate, by allowing it to be given away by direspectful, spawning, seat polishers. Furher more we call on any future govenrment to reinstate its rightful name if this current governemnt refuse to listen.",
