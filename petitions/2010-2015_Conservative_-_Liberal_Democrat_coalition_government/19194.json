        "additional_details": "I propose that all future general election ballots should include an abstain option with a designated area next to it explaining breifly your reasons.  With this we can separate out apathy from people who have lost faith in the poilitical system and wish to tell the government in a clear and precise manner they are not happy.  This is as a formal alternative to \"spoiling the ballot paper\", which people have used in the past.",
