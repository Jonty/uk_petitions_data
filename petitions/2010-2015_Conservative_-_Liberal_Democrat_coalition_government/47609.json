        "additional_details": "Our Roads are quite literally littered with potholes and driving, especially in more rural parts of Surrey, has become hazardous. I am sure the situation is similar in other counties.\r\nSurrey County Council must be inundated with reports of potholes, both new and old, along with claims for re-imbursement for damage caused to vehicles, wheels and tyres yet nothing actually seems to get done about it. It seems quite clear that the funding does not exist to upgrade our Roads to an acceptable standard. The situation is uneconomical and it is only a matter of time before a serious accident is caused as a result of the situation.\r\nThis petition requests that either Local Councils are given adequate budgets directly from Road Tax revenues to upgrade/ fix our roads or that responsibility be passed to the Highways Agency in order that they may do what Local Councils seem unable to.",
