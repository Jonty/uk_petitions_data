        "additional_details": "I bid for the UK Government to Legalise Caf\u00e9 shops in the UK to sell cannabis products as they do in Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nThere has been no recorded deaths from consuming cannabis in contrast with the amount of deaths alcohol and smoking tobacco has. Cannabis also has huge health benefits which has been proven to ease or even cure some medical problems. -Legalisation of cannabis in UK caf\u00e9s will bring huge income to our national economy and tourists from all around the world will visit leaving us with a more uplifting economy.\r\n\r\nI order the UK government to re-think the laws around cannabis and one day we hope to see cannabis products in UK caf\u00e9s, purchased from those that want the products. An age limit of 18 and a small tax payable will boost our economy. ",
