        "additional_details": "Having been charged with perverting the course of justice, Eastleigh constituents deserve the chance to recall their MP and make him fight a by-election. There is already legislation in the pipeline to allow this and the government should pass it to give this democratic right to voters. The right should be automatic (ie not dependent on a committee of MPs 'allowing' it) on production of a petition of 10% of electors in that constituency.",
