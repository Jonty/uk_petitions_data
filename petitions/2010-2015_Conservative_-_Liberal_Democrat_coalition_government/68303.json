        "additional_details": "In my personal opinion Under current EU rules, European vehicles are permitted to drive on roads in the UK for six months before having to register with the DVLA.Thus meaning councils and police across the county are unable to trace foreign drivers costing millions in parking and speeding fines because drivers can't be traced. I ask this situation be debated in parliament with a view to The Rt Hon David Cameron renegotiating a new deal with EU Leaders to make foreign drivers register there cars after only two weeks not 6months this would be value for money for the tax payer.",
