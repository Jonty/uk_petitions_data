        "additional_details": "Since the start of the 70s we have begin to depend more and more on imports from countrys like China, Now only 8% of the work force actually works in manufacuring, Have we not forgotten that We, The United Kingdom, Began the Industrial revolution?  We invented trains, created the Spitfire and even built a Lanchester bomber in 30 hours, Why is it we have suddenly stopped?\r\n\r\nMy Proposal is to get a severe increase in Manufacturing to make it account for 15-30% of the workforce in the UK, this would give more jobs and also give the economy a large boost",
