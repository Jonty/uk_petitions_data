        "additional_details": "Stephen Sutton should be awarded the Queen's honour of an MBE for the services he did for charity, leading up to and after his tragic death from bowel cancer at the young age of 19.  Unfortunately, the current policy of the Prime Minister's office is to not award MBE's posthumously, however, I believe this policy needs to be changed for those whose contribution to the lives of others is not recognised whilst they are alive, or for people like Stephen whose life was cut short by cancer.  At the very least, the Prime Minister's office should make a special dispensation for Stephen who achieved so much in such a short time.",
