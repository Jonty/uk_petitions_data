        "additional_details": "2014 is a very important year. It marks the Centenary of world war 1 and the 75th anniversary of the outbreak of world war 2. Yet ask children nowadays and most I bet wouldn\u2019t have a clue why this is significant, I dare say a few wouldn\u2019t have even heard of these wars. It isn\u2019t their fault though. Children often have a thirst for knowledge at a young age. If that isn\u2019t nurtured then by the time they reach their teens their interest has most likely waned. I have always believed it is extremely important to teach Children from a young age about 20th century British history. After all, if we don\u2019t know where we came from how can we know where we are going? History allows us to recognise the great achievements of mankind and also teaches us not to make the mistakes again that were committed in the past. Make History relevant again. It starts in the Classrooms, it continues in their Homes. Without the right education, we are a far poorer state.",
