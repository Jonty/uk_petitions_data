        "additional_details": "We need the British government to put pressure on corrupt politician Nawaz Sharif to resign as prime minister of Pakistan.\r\n\r\nElection Fraud;\r\nImran Khan and PTI had consistently asked the government to constitute tribunals and committees to investigate electoral fraud in the four constituencies since the 2013 election results were announced. In making these demands, Khan reluctantly accepted the election results, albeit being consistently ridiculed by the PML-N government and ministers.\r\n\r\nA year on, the PML-N government made no headway or momentum in this regard and remained \"hesitant in investigating the alleged rigging\". On the other hand, Khan had consistently presented proofs of electoral fraud in various constituencies. The PTI chief had also named the caretaker Punjab chief minister Najam Sethi and former chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry in facilitating fraud on the behest of PML-N in the past elections.",
