        "additional_details": "The latest debacle with HMRC's performance has shown that the tax system is now too complex even for the Tax Office to cope with. This petition calls for the Government to simplify the whole of the tax system so it is easier to understand and operate, and fairer to all. The petition also calls for HMRC's powers to be reduced, for example, it is illegal not to tell HMRC something that you don't want them to know. They have rights of access that are not available to anyone else, and the Courts accept what HMRC tell them even if it is demonstrably incorrect.",
