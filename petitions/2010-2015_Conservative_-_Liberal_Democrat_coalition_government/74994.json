        "additional_details": "I would like a roundabout to replace the traffic lights at the junction of High Street, Church Lane, Basford Park Road and Alexandra Road May Bank, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffs. May Bank is one mile away from it's town centre Newcastle-under-Lyme, yet at rush hour, it is quicker to walk the distance between the two than to drive there. Ever since the traffic lights changed their sequence to accommodate a new set of of lights at Grange Lane, the traffic in May Bank, Basford and Wolstanton now queues for up to a mile in three directions at peak times.",
