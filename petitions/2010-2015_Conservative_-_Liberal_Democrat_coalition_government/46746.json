        "additional_details": "Fuel prices are getting out of hand, and the Government are not doing enough about it.  Theres no point reducing duty by 2-3 pence it needs to be 20-25 pence.\r\n\r\nAnd to those who say, 'Where's the cash going to come from to finance a duty cut?' I'd answer by simply saying the debilitating economic effects of \u00a31.50 plus for a litre of diesel will cost the Government infinitely more in reduced economic activity, higher inflation and loss of tax revenue.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury is already losing \u00a360 million a month because of a lower national fuel spend but this will soon mushroom to \u00a3100 million as consumers spend even less at the pumps. And if they're not driving, they're not spending which means far less activity across all economic sectors, so less VAT, income and corporation tax and serious reduction in growth.\r\n\r\nI think \u00a31.15 for petrol and \u00a31.20 for diesel is Fair?\r\n\r\nJoin me in the petition",
