A station that is already on par with most around the country and In my opinion is just simply not needed.\r\n\r\nCardiff is experiencing a shortage in social housing, lack of employment and a lack of public service resources.\r\nNational Rail will be looking to the \"UK Department of Transport\" for the money out of the budget, so it is us the tax-payer who will inevitably be footing the bill.\r\n\r\nThis is wasted money that is going to be given to the Department of Transport, that could be budgeted in other sectors that need it far more.
