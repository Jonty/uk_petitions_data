        "additional_details": "This law has been introduced in France, and in other countries across Europe.\r\n\r\nI understand that the initial thought is Health and Safety gone mad, but there is some rationality here.\r\n\r\n1. The driver can be seen from a good distance by other motorists especially in dark unlit motorway or country road.\r\n\r\n2. The advice for motorists on the motorway is to move away from the vehicle, at least this would help them to be seen by a breakdown / recovery company or Police.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, this is a good piece of kit that would contribute to saving many lives if it was implemented. I didn't realize how good it was until I passed a broken down vehicle whilst on holiday in France and could see where the driver was straight away.",
