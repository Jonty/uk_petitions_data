        "additional_details": "There is a zero tollerance approach to letting children have time off school in term-time. This is not necessary and in many instances is unfair to honest parents and hard working children.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons why it may be necessary to have breaks outside of the formal school holiday periods. Often it is not possible for parents to get the time off work, or the cost of holidays in the school holiday period is too much for a lot of parents to afford.\r\n\r\nI would propose that children should be allowed 5 days out of school without penalty, provided they are not revising or taking exams.\r\n\r\nWith home schooling children not falling under the same rules and teachers themselves being allowed to take time off to go on strike, it seems that ordinary parents and children are suffering.
