        "additional_details": "Ban firework sales to members of the public with immediate effect.  Restrict Firework Night to ONE designated night of the year (either November 5th OR the nearest Saturday to November 5th).\r\nThis is necessary because extended firework use and unrestricted availability is very dangerous.  Animal owners have no clue what night people in their area may be having fireworks and cannot take appropriate precautions.  Also many under age people are getting hold of fireworks despite current regulation and this can cause an animal welfare issue.  The Police should be given powers to act against anyone found in contravention of these laws",
