        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that the scrapping of national pay bargaining in the public sector is bad for people in less affluent areas of the country.\r\n\r\nLower pay rates will make it more difficult for schools and hospitals to recruit and retain staff.  The policy will suck money out of local economies, causing a collapse in demand and making everyone in those communities poorer, including workers in the private sector.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to drop the local pay rates policy at once.",
