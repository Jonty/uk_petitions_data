        "additional_details": "This e-petition is to stop local councils from using static cctv camera's and mobile cctv vehicles for the issue of parking tickets and other motoring offence PCNs.\r\nThere is no valid reason why parking enforcement and other motoring offences should not be undertaken by council wardens rather than cctv camera's and PCNs issued to the vehicles straight away rather than being sent by post weeks later.\r\nThe government should therefore make it illegal for local councils to use cctv for the issue of these PCNs",
