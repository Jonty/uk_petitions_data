People are poorly educated on the subject so don't realize that the consequences of legal highs can often be far worse than already illegal drugs. They're far too easy to obtain and can do even more damage if the issue isn't resolved.\r\n\r\nJUST BECAUSE THEY'RE LEGAL DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE SAFE!!!!!",
