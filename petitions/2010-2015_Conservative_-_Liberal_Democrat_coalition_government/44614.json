        "additional_details": "If there are 88,000 pylons and an estimate of under 40,000 wind turbines needed to power the whole of the UK, why is there no programme to combine the two, and minimise the impact of building wind turbines?  There are designs in existence that can incorporate turbines into pylons, and once fitted, would produce far more than 30% (2020 target) of our electricity - they could provide 100%.\r\n\r\nI believe that this is an important way to minimise both the impact upon the natural world and duplicating structures that require extracted, expensive materials.  (Off shore turbines will still kill seagulls and blight the oceanic horizons).\r\n\r\nI believe that any pylons built in the future should be required to include a turbine, as well turbines fitted onto the thousands of pylons we already use.\r\n\r\nPlease research and discuss, but fundamentally, ACT.\r\n\r\n(x-ref. http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20090513/harvesting-the-wind)",
