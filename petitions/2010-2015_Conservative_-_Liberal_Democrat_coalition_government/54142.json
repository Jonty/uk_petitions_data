        "additional_details": "97% of homes in the UK have a TV. This means that the entire TV licensing administration exists to (effectively) benefit the 3% that do not. It would save millions to revoke the TV licence system and simply fund the BBC directly.\r\nThere are many public services that we have to pay for through taxes that we may not actually use. It is not unduly onerous for the 3% to do the same with respect to TV.\r\nThe BBC is the biggest single prosecutor in the magistrates courts so this change would also free up the courts for more serious matters.\r\n",
