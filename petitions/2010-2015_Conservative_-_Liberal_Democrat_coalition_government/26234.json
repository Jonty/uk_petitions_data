        "additional_details": "A passenger dubbed \"Big Man\" and understood to be 35 yr old Alan Pollock, ejected an alleged fare-dodger from a train using physical means.  Fellow passengers cheered, but now Mr Pollock is facing trial after he was charged with assault.\r\n\r\nWhilst we cannot condone vigilantism, charging Mr Pollock sends a message that society is wrong to act against any anti-social elements in any way. Mr Pollock was acting in the interests of the wider group of commuters on the train.  Given the stabbing of a ticket-collector in a similar incident in England recently, Mr Pollock's actions indicate clearly that the general public does not wish to be held ransom by the inconsiderate actions of an individual.  We, the undersigned, wish to see charges against Mr Pollock dropped.",
