        "additional_details": "Private health care services are there to make profits for its owners, unlike the NHS. GP budget holders could deprave the NHS of funds and expertise by referring their patients to the health business for which they have financial interests or shareholdings to the detriment of comprehensive well-funded, well equipped NHS that is staffed with experienced professionals. There need to have checks and balances even for all NHS professionals. Even frontline healthcare NHS professionals who themselves (not only managers) interview & appoint new healthcare professional colleagues & services may also develop services that duplicate and over-manned healthcare services. Not only do the politicians, Judges, executives, police, media need checks and balances, so do dentists, NHS professionals (like nurses), GP budget holders, etc.",
