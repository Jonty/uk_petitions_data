Children need to spend more time learning.\r\nExtra Saturday classes should be made available for children who are behind giving them the chance to catch up as teachers would be able to give more time to improving the children that are behind in their classes. Teachers have long school holiday to offset this they should work a six-day week to help children who are behind.",
