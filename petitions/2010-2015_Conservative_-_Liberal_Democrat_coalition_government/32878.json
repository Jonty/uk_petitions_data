        "additional_details": "The centre of the beautiful,  historic city of York is blighted by the hideous Stonebow House, a tall, unsightly 1960s office block near the historic Shambles (voted Most Picturesque Street in Britain in 2010).\r\n\r\nStonebow House is \"a piece of architecture crudely designed in the 'New Brutalism' style of the late 1950s\" (David Lloyd, the Esher Report).\r\n\r\nThe Stonebow hides the impressive Central Methodist Chapel, a \"cathedral of Methodism\" built in 1840. The chapel is listed Grade II *, and attracts large numbers of visitors during York's Resident's First weekend.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the Government to order the demolition of Stonebow House, and create an open space to enhance this part of the city. This would enable people to appreciate the beauty and grandeour of the chapel,  which deserves a much higher profile.\r\n\r\nMany people in York have been calling for the demolition of the Stonebow for years.\r\n",
