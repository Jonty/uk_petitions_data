        "additional_details": "As parents of children with nut or tree nut allergies we are horrified at the news that the new set of standards for all food served in schools, launched by Education Secretary Michael Gove, include a recommendation to serve nuts.\r\n\r\nThe new standards will be mandatory in all maintained schools, and new academies and free schools.\r\n\r\nMany children suffer their first anaphylactic reaction to nuts at school. Without prompt, appropriate action, the reaction can be life threatening.\r\n\r\nFor parents of those with diagnosed reactions (currently estimated at 2% of the UK population, and rising), nut free schools and nurseries provide at least some assurance that their children will be relatively safe.\r\n\r\nSchool restaurants handling nuts poses a risk of cross-contamination; some children have airborne allergies or can react from holding hands with a child who has handled nuts or even touching the same surface.",
