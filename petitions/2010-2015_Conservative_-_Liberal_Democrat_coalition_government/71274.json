        "additional_details": "There are too many flats being put up in tows that are already crowded (Hillingdon being the example).\r\n\r\nNo provision is being made for the additional people and vehicles. Due to limited off street parking, more people use on street parking narrowing the space for two way traffic which is made worse due to bus routes and emergency services.\r\n\r\nJourneys are taking 5-10 times longer resulting in vehicles idling and adding more toxic gasses into the air, added stress to drivers and the chance for more accidents.\r\n\r\nWe need less expansion within towns especially if no provision is made to roads and other facilities. Also limit commercial applications that increase heavy vehicle flow through residential areas. Overall, we need tougher planning with consideration to the residents and impacts on their daily lives.",
