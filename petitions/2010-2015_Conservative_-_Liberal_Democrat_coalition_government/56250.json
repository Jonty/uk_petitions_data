        "additional_details": "Rail passengers endure constant delays, poor service and indifference from rail companies. Despite sometimes daily disruptions to services rail companies can act with impunity - raising rail fares each year, not providing refunds and fining customers who inadvertently get caught out through unclear rail fare rules.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to introduce legislation that will force rail companies to improve the level of service to customers and change the behaviour of rail companies such that they act like any other commercial company in its treatment of customers.\r\n\r\nSpecifically we call on the government to introduce legislation that refunds a customer directly in the event that their journey is delayed or disrupted. The level of refund would be linked to the severity of the delay.",
