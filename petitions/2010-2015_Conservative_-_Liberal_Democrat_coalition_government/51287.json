So why not for British citizens?\r\n\r\nThis makes a whole lot of sense for people who travel frequently or do not wish to carry their bulky passport out with them as a form of ID.\r\n\r\nThe card would be a smaller more portable version of a passport and could even be in addition to our larger passports.\r\n\r\nThere has been a previous e-petition for this but has been closed due to not enough signatures within the time constraint.",
