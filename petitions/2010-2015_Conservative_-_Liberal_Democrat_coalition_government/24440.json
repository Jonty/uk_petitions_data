It is operated on a \"service\" basis, not a \"profit\" basis.\r\nAny reduction in this service will be likely to result in a loss of life, at sea and in the mountains.\r\nWe would like the Government to guarantee that the service will:\r\n\r\n1) Operate on a 24 hour 365 day a year basis.\r\n2) Be free at the point of use.\r\n3) Be run on a \"not for profit\" basis.\r\n4) Operate in the same operational parameters as the Ministry of Defence and Coastguard helicopters operate.\r\n5) See no reduction in the level or quality of the current level of service.\r\n\r\n",
