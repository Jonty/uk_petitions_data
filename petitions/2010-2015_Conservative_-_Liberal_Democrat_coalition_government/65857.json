It can show balances deep into ' the red' when that never actually happened.\r\nThis is not fair.\r\n It is falsehood to show a withdrawal appearing to happen before a deposit - it's just not true if it took place the other way round. If banks should show high  levels of clear, open communication, they must reflect reality in their customers' transactions!",
