I could go on forever!\r\n\r\nIn a way you've left it open so we are the last form of people to be openly ridiculed lawfully.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask the home office to consider the above, making the abuse of people with Red hair illegal, classifying it either as discrimination, racism or general harassment. This is a serious matter with documented cases of hate crime. ",
