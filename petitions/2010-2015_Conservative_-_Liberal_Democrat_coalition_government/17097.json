When replying please submit your name, designation, department and a valid email return address (you are obliged to do so; non-compliance is a disciplinary offence)\r\nYou have again just sent me an email in which you claim' \"Your e-petition \"IDENTIFY AND BRING TO TRIAL ANY PERSON(S) RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING THE UK INTO ILLEGAL WAR\" hasn't been accepted. It did not have a clear statement explaining what action you want the government to take\"\r\n\r\nI have referred to the original petition and it clearly states what I require the government office to do and this is reiterated in the title of the petition, above. Therefore your rejection is rejected. It is clear you are merely being obstructive and blocking democratic process.\r\n",
