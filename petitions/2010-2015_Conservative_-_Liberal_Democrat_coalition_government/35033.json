        "additional_details": "This petition is to have the names of underage murderers, rapists and sex offenders released. It sickens me that someone in their early/mid teens that commit these serious crimes can't be named for legal reasons. If they're adult enough to do the crime they should be named and shamed the same as someone a few years older would be.",
