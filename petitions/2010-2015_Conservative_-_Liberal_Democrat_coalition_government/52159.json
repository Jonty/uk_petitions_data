Is this a breach of human rights?\r\n\r\nParents should not be forced by the Government to pay premium prices for their holidays taken during school holidays.\r\n\r\nParents,in top jobs including police officers, doctors etc should be allowed holidays during school term time.\r\n\r\nGovernment should allow parents to take their children off school for an annual holiday during term time provided it is for no more than 10 days.\r\n\r\nIs it not better for a child to see the world gaining cultural experiences etc rather than sitting in a classroom all the time?\r\n\r\nWho are going to man our companies if everyone with children has to take their holiday at the same time?\r\n\r\n",
