        "additional_details": "The bail conditions assigned to Mr. Assange are draconian and inappropriate - many elements thereof are strikingly similar to those faced by accused murderers and convicted rapists. These bail conditions also impede Mr. Assange's work, as (despite the fact he has yet to be charged with any crime) his house arrest prevents him from travelling and thereby improving the prolificacy of his website.\r\n    The government should review the bail conditions assigned to Mr. Assange and remove the elements thereof which impede the WikiLeaks founder's work the most - e.g: his obligatory trip to Beccles Police Station every morning and his need to wear an electronic tag.",
