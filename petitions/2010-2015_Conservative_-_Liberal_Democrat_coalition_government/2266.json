        "additional_details": "I would like to petition that anyone who moves within the EEC community should take their own Countries benefits with them. This means if a Slovenian national comes to the UK, when they apply for benefit, they should get the equivalent benefit to that available in their own country. This would reduce the number of immigrants who move to a country soley for Financial gain. Each country would have access to other countries records and a quick calcualtion made on benefit entitlement. This will result in significant reductions in benefit payouts and also fraudulant claims",
