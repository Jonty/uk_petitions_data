        "additional_details": "Immediate action must be taken to boost the reach of Green Deal and ECO funding to save the energy efficient home improvement sector.  The industry has been sat poised for 6 months now with no funding to push the scheme forward.  Relaxation of carbon tonnage calculations are needed to get the energy companies to support the scheme.\r\nAt current levels of ECO funding the Golden Rule cannot work.  ECO levels must reach the initially suggested amounts.  With the months rolling by and the March 2015 deadline fast approaching the targets set cannot be achieved.\r\nThe Government needs to hold urgent talks with the energy suppliers and come up with a workable strategy to deliver Green Deal and ECO.\r\n",
