        "additional_details": "In accordance with Michael Gove stating the government 'appoints people on merit' this petition demands the immediate removal of Michael Gove from the position of Secretary of Education due to the fact he has no formal training or experience in the field of education other than attending school and is therefore not qualified to draw up or implement policies that decides the future of those in the field, both students and teachers alike. Out of a pool of 303 MPs and 222 Peers there should be at least one candidate with a background in education who would have, by default, a higher merit to hold the post.",
