        "additional_details": "Whilst away in France, I noticed that they had a system of placing black 'human shaped' silhouettes at sites where people had died in road accidents. It is so simple, yet so effective at making drivers think twice about their standard of driving and makes pedestrians more aware of the environment in which they are walking. So, my proposition is exactly that; From now on, for black silhouettes to be placed at every site where individuals have died in road and traffic related incidents, to generally improve road user's attitudes to the dangerous environment they are sharing. I believe that this would help decrease road deaths through shock tactics; if people don't listen to the numbers of deaths through visual reminders, I can't imagine much else will work.  ",
