        "additional_details": "The plans for military action in Syria and Iraq must be opposed. Whilst ISIS is undoubtedly responsible for grave war crimes, this will not solve the issue.\r\n\r\nThe dropping of bombs by western nations will have collateral implications such as: The deaths of innocent children, women and men on the ground, imperilling the lives of service men and women, increasing the risk of terror attacks against Britons and most importantly ultimately failing to tackle the roots. This consequentially will lead to further destabilisation of the region and the world just as involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan did previously.\r\n\r\nIn order to truly defeat ISIS we should support regional forces of secularism and moderation through means of intelligence sharing, training, providing military equipment and most importantly economic assistance. Only such tactics can provide a lasting end to jihadi organisations and the spectre they create. ",
