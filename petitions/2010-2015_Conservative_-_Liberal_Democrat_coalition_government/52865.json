        "additional_details": "We are told about job creation but most are low paid, or par ttime work that effectively means these employees still needs benefits to survive. Each time a director or company announces bonuses or dividends to share holders, the question should be, how many of your full time workers are on benefits? Even just one means that the tax payer has paid for that bonus or dividends. We get worked up about the unemployed but the real scandal is employers paying low wages and claiming huge bonuses on the back of the benefit system.. They are the real scroungers. As such any full time employees claiming benefits should be clawed back via tax on bonuses and dividends so that the tax payer is not paying.",
