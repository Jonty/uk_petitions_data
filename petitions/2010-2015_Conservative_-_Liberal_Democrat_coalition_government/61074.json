In the British Army of 2014, the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.\r\n\r\nThe government must impose an independent, fully-empowered Armed Forces Ombudsman to protect service personnel. Under pressure, the Army will adopt \u2018agree and evade\u2019 tactics: purporting to accept oversight in principle, but undermining it in practice. An ombudsman requires the following powers:\r\n\r\n1.\tReceive copies of all complaints.\r\n\r\n2.\tWide investigatory and decision-making powers - able take over complaints if the Army fail to act properly within 28 days.\r\n\r\n3.\tDirect - and enforce - implementation of its decisions.\r\n\r\n4.\tImpose financial penalties - the Army responds to financial penalties, the routine means by which other regulators enforce compliance.\r\n\r\n5.\tRecommend personnel policy changes and require a ministerial response.",
