This would enable Rangers to enter the English League and is legal.\r\n\r\nBury Football Club is a League One team for a small town with plenty of supporters.  It is a historic team that was formed as part of the Football League.  This move would destroy a local football team.\r\n\r\nIt must be stopped at all cost to prevent this move from happening in the future and stop struggling larger clubs from taking advantage of the small clubs to their own gain.",
