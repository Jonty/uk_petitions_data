        "additional_details": "Here are some points as to why I believe animal testing to be outrageous:\r\n\r\nAnimal experiments can be misleading. An animal's response to a drug can be different to a human's\r\n\r\nSuccessful alternatives include test tube studies on human tissue cultures, statistics and computer models\r\n\r\nThe stress that animals endure in labs can affect experiments, making the results meaningless\r\n\r\nAnimals are still used to test items like cleaning products, which benefit mankind less than medicines or surgery\r\n\r\nAnimals have as much right to life as human beings\r\n\r\nStrict controls have not prevented researchers from abusing animals\r\n\r\nDeaths through research are absolutely unnecessary and are morally no different from murder\r\n\r\nWhen locked up they suffer tremendous stress. Can we know they don't feel pain?\r\n\r\n\r\nHopefully you agree that animal testing for cosmetics and science should be absolutely forbidden.\r\nThank you for your support. ",
