They currently stay in(and own) a flat whilst awaiting plans for renovation and meantime, professional squatters move in.\r\n\r\nThe couple are unable to to evict them without going to court.  As it is a civil matter, the Police cannot intervene.  The squatters leave the place in a disgusting state.\r\n\r\nEventually, the squatters are evicted, leaving the home owners with a \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3k bill.",
