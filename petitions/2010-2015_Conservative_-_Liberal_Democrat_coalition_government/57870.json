        "additional_details": "To some Rottweiler owners who have very calm dogs there have been some upsetting clothing lines in Topman  shops as they are selling Rottweiler T-shirts and jumpers showing that the dogs are aggressive but if you train them right they are not aggressive, so we're petitioning for Topman to rid of all stock showing the vicious picture of Rottweilers on their merchandise. We find it highly offensive and a total unnatural portrayal of the breed",
