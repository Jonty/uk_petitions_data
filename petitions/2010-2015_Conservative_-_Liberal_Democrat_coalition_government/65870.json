        "additional_details": "A 'mental health illness' can encompass a whole range of conditions, most of which persist long term and have profound effects on the individual and those around them. Most mental health illnesses require regular medication to be prescribed on a regular basis throughout the year. Although there are reduced cost measures in place, we feel that allowing further reduced cost and/or free medications for those with mental health illnesses will relive great amounts of mental and financial burden and anxiety which can prove even more detrimental to their wellbeing. Individual are more likely inclined to commence treatment if there are no crippling costs involved.",
