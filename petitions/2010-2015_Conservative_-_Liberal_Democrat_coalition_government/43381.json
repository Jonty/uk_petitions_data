        "additional_details": "The government must upgrade the A1 in north Northumberland to dual carriageway to prevent more lives being lost. Since November 2011, when my son Alex Gibson was killed in a crash north of Alnwick, there have been two more fatalities on the same stretch of road. All three accidents were head-on collisions on single carriageway. That\u2019s why we need the A1 dualled all the way from Morpeth to Berwick. ",
