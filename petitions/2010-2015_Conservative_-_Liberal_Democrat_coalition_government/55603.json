        "additional_details": "A&E departments are already stretched with patient attendance increasing each year, winter pressures growing and government targets. When out of hours care fails patients tend to fall back on their local emergency department.\r\n\r\nMost of the patients the ambulance service attends are suffering from minor illnesses or injuries that simply need assessment, reassurance or prescribed treatments. For frontline ambulance and OOH services to succeed, all emergency care practitioners whether they are qualified nurses or paramedics, must be able to prescribe.\r\n\r\nCurrently only nurses can prescribe which leaves a large gap in out-of-hours health care provision. Sign this e-petition to bring paramedic prescribing to the same level as other health care professionals and ensure an equal standard of care that is accessible to all.",
