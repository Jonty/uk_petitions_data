        "additional_details": "Ethanol added to petrol can cause serious damage to vintage and classic motor cars and motor bikes.\r\nCurrently the Renewable Fuel Transport Obligation already means that petrol sold in the UK has 5% Ethanol added to it, but this is expected to be increased to 10% in the near future.\r\nThe result of this is that many vintage and classic motor vehicles will be taken off the road to avoid the serious engine and fuel system damage that the 10% level will cause.\r\nThis E Petition is to force the Government to take notice of the problems being caused by the addition of Ethanol to petrol and ask that this process is stopped to protect the motoring heritage of the UK",
