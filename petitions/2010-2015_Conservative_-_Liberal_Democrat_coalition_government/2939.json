        "additional_details": "This petition requests that the Government establish a written constitution for the UK.  The constitution should outline clearly the rights of the citizen, the duties of the state, and responsibilities of the Head of State, as well as the restrictions to be imposed on each party.\r\n\r\nThe constitution should be compiled after a comprehensive review of existing law and consultation with the general public.  Ideally, such a constitution should clearly outline freedoms of expression, rights to protest, length of parliamentary terms etc., so that never again shall issues of public liberty and state legislature need to be referred to flimsy and inadequate legal precedent and tradition.  Controversy surrounding counter-terrorism measures, ID cards, or freedom of speech can instead be referred to a clandestine document which guarantees the liberties of the citizen.",
