        "additional_details": "Ex-pats, some of whom paid 40+ years of tax & NI contributions but left the UK just prior to their 60th birthday were denied WFA until the winter of 2012/13 when an ECJ judgment ruled against the UK government. The ruling was retrospective which should have meant that those who missed out until 2012/13 should receive back payments from the time they turned 60 up until 2011/12. The DWP / UK government is currently refusing to honour that ECJ retrospective judgment.",
