        "action": "Stop Self Employed Parents from Avoiding Child Maintenance",
        "additional_details": "This e-petition has been posted to gain support for the government to introduce new legislation to close loop holes permitting self employed parents and parents with no income but substantial assets from evading child maintenance payments.\r\n\r\nDid you know.\r\n\r\n1. If a parent has no income but has hundreds of thousands of pounds in the bank they qualify for a nil contribution towards their children\r\n\r\n2. If a parent registers as self employed they can advise the CMS they are receiving no income and won't have to prove it until their first tax return a year later by which point the CMS do not have the power to enforce a back payment\r\n\r\n3. The CMS allows an absent parent to over rule court orders without the other parents consent\r\n\r\n4. Quote from the CMS \"They have the right to be believed\"\r\n\r\n5. Quote from the CMS: \"9/10 of self employed people who evade payment get away with it.\"\r\n\r\nWe want SOLID legislation, please support our petition.\r\n",
