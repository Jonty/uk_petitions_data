        "additional_details": "Rather than forcing all our young people into compulsory national service as if they are all to be punished, why not make it that for a first criminal conviction the automatic sentence is for 2 years national service. This will allow the country to take control of those who could end up as career criminals by giving them a focus and allowing them to learn vital skills. Many of these young people will find they have a purpose and continue in the services or come out better disciplined with more respect for society. This is also an effective deterrent to those who have no wish to end up in national service.",
