        "additional_details": "The application of red wave principle where traffic lights are set to go red for as long as possible and set to red as soon as one leaves the previous set, this was devised in London in order to frustrate, annoy and make the use of a car unbearable in the hope that the public will stay away from the affected roads and switch to public transport as well as to gather more taxation as fuel is wasted and burned sitting in the artificial jams.\r\n\r\nThis scheme is wasteful, unhealthy and environmentally unfriendly. During the Olympics it was switched to 'green wave' and the traffic ran fine, even with restricted road space. So it can be done. 1 in 7 children suffer with asthma which costs us all - Improve our environment, our quality of life and the travel times remove red wave schemes!!",
