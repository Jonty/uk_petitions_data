It only takes 100.000 signatures to start a debate in parliament which could help stop cruelty to innocent animals who have no rights and cannot speak for themselves. If you are an animal lover or like most of us detest animal cruelty then please take a few minutes and sign this petition, every signature counts.-\r\n\r\n",
