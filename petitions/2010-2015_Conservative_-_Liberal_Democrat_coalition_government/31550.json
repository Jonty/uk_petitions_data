        "additional_details": "To remove a frequent congestion pinchpoint at the Dartford River Crossing, I propose a doubling of the toll charge in the northbound direction and removal of the toll booths in the southbound direction. Most car journeys tend to be return ones, therefore there would be little reduction in overall revenue. Vehicles would merely continue from the 4 lane bridge directly onto the 4 lane motorway carriageway unimpeded by the need to stop at the toll booths. Government should sponsor and drive this change forward; potential benefits to 135k drivers per day (source: Highway Agency). Benefits from reduced fuel cost from idling cars (and environmental benefits too), time saving for drivers, reduced potential for accidents while drivers manouevre for booths.",
