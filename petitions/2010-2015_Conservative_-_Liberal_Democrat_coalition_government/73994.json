        "additional_details": "Buildings cost money to build run and maintain. Schools are open for only half a day for actual educational use. Costs can be reduced by better use of the buildings and extra places can be provided for minimal cost.\r\n\r\nIn Africa students go to school in two shifts- the morning and the afternoon. This doubles the places within the building (providing that teachers are available).\r\n\r\nCopying this in the UK makes a statement that we put education above political pride. Using buildings in this way reduces overall maintenance costs when compared with running two separate facilities or expanding existing facilities. Energy costs are lower add less buildings need heating up in winter. Sports can overlap to provide better potions for after school or before school activities and clubs. Money saved from building and running the schools can provide extra teachers.\r\n\r\nWe want the Government to run two school \"shifts\" in school buildings to get better usage of the facilities and save money.\r\n",
