The cost of the transport for sixth form has risen by hundreds of pounds. How does the council expect Newport to grow if the majority of pupils have to drop out because of the costs? Other councils are following and it needs to be sorted. We chose to stay on to receive a better education, why should we suffer? Who and when was it decided that our future should be  jeopardized for the council to save money?",
