Too many dogs are bred purely for money, too many puppies are born, and most of them won't be wanted. Many will be abused, unloved, unwanted, and live in fear of humans, which, in turn will cause aggression.\r\n Micro- chipping will not stop dangerous dogs. Kind owners will.\r\nI petition for a compulsory dog license in order to prove responsibility and commitment of owners,and vetting by animal welfare organisations before being allowed to own or breed a dog.\r\n",
