        "additional_details": "Rotherham council, child protection department and police were fully aware and covered up the fact that a gang or gangs of men (irrespective of race) were systematically raping young girls, even renting them out for sex in other towns. As a father of 2 girls, I feel that criminal charges should be raised against all persons involved for aiding and abetting/ allowing these crimes to occur. Their actions are not just a failure in their duties, but a wilful and deliberate failure to stop the crimes, making them a party to such crimes.",
