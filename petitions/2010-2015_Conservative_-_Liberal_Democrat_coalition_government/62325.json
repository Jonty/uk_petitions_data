        "additional_details": "The aim of the petition is to call for a revision on the specified guidelines for donating blood, not just for the homosexual community.\r\n\r\nCurrently, all those who have had any form of sexual contact with a gay or bisexual man, even with a condom, cannot donate blood for a year after this contact. This is not just about gay men. Women who have had sexual contact with bisexual men can also not donate blood, even if they have used a condom.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for a revision of these regulations, as all groups specified above can donate organs, bone marrow, and get married.",
