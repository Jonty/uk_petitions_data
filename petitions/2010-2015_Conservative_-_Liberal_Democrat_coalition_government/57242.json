With the impending arrival in January of Mass European Migrants coming, this country will not cope. We have far too many people here on this small Island. It is time that we have a temporary withdrawal from the EU Free Movement Policy to allow a government debate on population numbers. Labour have admitted it made a mistake with mass immigration, David Cameron must now listen to the people and preserve what is left of this broken country.",
