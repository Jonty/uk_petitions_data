It is not the leaders faults, they just don't have the experience or knowledge in how to be successful in business as politics is all about 'how it looks' rather than long term success building.\r\n\r\nServing the Country is an honour, therefore I believe that those who have been successful in business within our great Country should be granted the honour and chance to give something back to the Nation by running the Nation, not politicians.\r\n\r\nI wish the Government to consider all future governments to be made up of successful businessmen or women who have already made their fortunes and only want to make the Country as successful ad they have been.",
