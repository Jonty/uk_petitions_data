        "additional_details": "This petition proposes a change in the Leader of House Of Commons' powers and responsibility to punish Members of the House that disrupt proceedings and debates by shouting out, shouting down the opposition and generally acting like schoolboys in a playground.\r\n\r\nThe current behaviour of Members of the House during parliament sessions is disgraceful. Their behaviour closely resembles the acts of schoolboys at a debate club, or fans at a football match, and frankly they should be ashamed. On an average day the noise from the chamber sounds more like a crowded pub than the center of governance over 62million+ people.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour also only leads the people further into the belief that our system of government is nothing more than an eatonian boys club. It only adds to the disillusionment and disconnect between the people whom the decisions affect and the people who make the decisions.",
