        "additional_details": "Safety Deposit Boxes should be banned on the grounds that many illegal and stolen goods can be stored securely by criminals. At the very least, every deposit should be witnessed by two members of staff and a written or photographic record of what is stored in the box. Police should have access to these records.This would be a sufficient deterrant to stop these boxes containing illicit or illegal items. Those who genuinely need secure stores for legal items can do so for a small fee at their local high street bank. ",
