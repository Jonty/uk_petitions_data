        "additional_details": "Do enough parents have enough first aid knowledge required to deal with an emergency first aid situation? How many parents feel confident enough to administer first aid in an emergency situation? How many fear they would do more harm or do something wrong or panic?\r\n\r\nI have been touched by stories of children and babies left fighting for their lives due to choking, meningitis and injuries. I have two children of my own. I have asked myself, how would I act in an emergency situation? Do I have the knowledge and training need to act? I believe it is inevitable, that at some point of my children\u2019s lives, they will be involved in an emergency situation. My husband or myself will probably be the first person there, so it is essential that we have the knowledge and confidence required to administer first aid. Having training could make a difference in saving their life.\r\n\r\nPlease sign my petition asking the Government to offer FREE paediatric first aid training for parents and carers.\r\n\r\n",
