        "additional_details": "We call upon HM Government to return the 'Rosenholz' files to Germany's federal office for the archives of the Staatsicherheitsdienst. These files relate to an important episode in Germany's modern history. To date, the Stasi archives have generally been treated honourably and made available to researchers, including British historians, working on the history of the German Democratic Republic. As that regime has been replaced by a democratic government that is one of Britain's closest allies, there is no good reason for the continuing closure of the Rosenholz files. Public decency and political transparency alike demand their immediate return.",
