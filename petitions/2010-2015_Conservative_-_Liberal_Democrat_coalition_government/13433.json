        "additional_details": "I petition the Government to make house insurance to include compulsary legal protection for incidents relating to ANY matter. This will significantly reduce the debt from public funds in relation to legal aid. If house holders become fully legally insured this would lift the burden from the State and provide natural justice to ALL walks of life and to those who cant afford it. Currently house insurance provides optional family legal protection. If this was made compulsary people will be able to be legally protected and advised in any matter. This could be through employment matters or either through the criminal justice system.",
