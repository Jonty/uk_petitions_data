        "additional_details": "Excluded permanently from school, send them to boot camp to learn what the army, airforce and navy instill in their young men and women.  No job, College or training course after leaving school then send them to boot camp for some self respect and life skills.  Caught committing a minor crime, instant boot camp, not waiting for the teenager to commit further crimes.   Ex army, naval and airforce personel could run them quiet efficiently, they would have jobs and the ex army and naval barracks could be used.  Early to bed, early to rise, work all day, and learn some respect for yourself and others and if you want to go on to join the army, airforce or navy then you should be helped to do so.  If you want to go on to take up a skill or trade then you should be helped to do so also.  If you go on to reoffend or you don't want to join the rest of society then, send them to a youth offenders institue.\r\nBoot camp should be a short sharp shock.  (Not a holiday camp)\r\n",
