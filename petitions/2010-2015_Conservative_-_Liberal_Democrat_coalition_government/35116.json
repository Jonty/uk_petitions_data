        "additional_details": "The undersigned give their signature in support and demand for the release of Lennox a crossbreed dog who was sentenced to death by a Belfast High Court judge on 12/6/2012  pending a 21 day period for the owners to consider taking the case to the Supreme court. Lennox has been deemed as a Pitbull TYPE dog under BSL. We call on the government to investigate the circumstances of this case fully baring in mind that Lennox has never shown aggression or posed a threat to the general public and was fully licensed for 5 years by Belfast city council before being removed from his family. Lennox was also neutered and micro chipped. Over 500 experts have offered to rehome Lennox out of the UK at no expense to the tax payer. We therefore ask you to Save Lennox",
