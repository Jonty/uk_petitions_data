        "additional_details": "The A431 Kelston Road is a vital, much needed route that connects the east of Bristol with Bath.\r\n\r\nAfter cracks were found in the road back in February, Bath & North East Somerset Council closed the road.\r\n\r\nThis means that all vehicles have to be diverted through Keynsham turning what should be a 10 minute route (Kelston Rd to Bath), into a 40 minute detour - costing commuters extra in petrol, and extra congestion.\r\n\r\nBusinesses in the Bitton, Upton Cheyney, Swineford, Kelston areas have been severely affected by the closure with NO financial help.\r\n\r\nThe Dawlish Rail Line was back open in 2 months after it was washed away earlier this year. Not even a temporary road has been built in Kelston. No one knows what is happening.\r\n\r\nThe UK government needs to give local businesses financial support, and hurry and get this much needed route reopen.",
