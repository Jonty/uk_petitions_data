All schools needs to do is clear designated footpaths and fire exit routes. If teaching staff cannot get into work they should be penalised like any other working person.\r\nHow many working parents lost a day\u2019s pay or had to take unnecessary annual Leave or pay extra child care fees.  Did teachers even try to get to work? They don\u2019t need to as head teachers close at the first sign of snow, even expecting you to pick your kids up early so they don\u2019t get stuck! Not one successful claim has been made for slipping in the snow. Let our kids enjoy the snow at school like previous generations! Mine already assume it\u2019s a day off at the first sign of snow. Stop hiding behind H&S. The Government should charge schools for closing or enable parents to claim losses.",
