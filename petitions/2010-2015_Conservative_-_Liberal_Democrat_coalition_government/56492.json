        "additional_details": "On the 31st of October 2013, the front page of the Daily Express displayed a call for readers to \"Say NO to new EU migrants\" by signing a petition to go to the government. By co-opting the image of a poppy and printing it alongside this 'crusade', a particularly distasteful association is made. This kind of xenophobic rhetoric is irresponsible and likely to increase racial tension. We are asking for the government to speak out against newspapers such as this abusing their platform to spread fear and hatred.",
