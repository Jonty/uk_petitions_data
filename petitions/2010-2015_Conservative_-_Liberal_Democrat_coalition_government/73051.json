        "additional_details": "I would like the government to consider reopening of the former Great Central line northwards from Aylesbury parkway station ,and onwards to Brackley.\r\nAlthough it may not be possible to extend the line into an area north of the town due to housing expansion.\r\nA suggestion of a Parkway station to the south west and close to the A43 Brackley By Pass.\r\nThis would give the town access to a London Terminal, and also link in with east west rail line where both the original lines crossed in Buckinghamshire. This would give the expanding town of Brackley and surrounding areas access by rail to London and other areas with a station where both the East- west Rail link and the former Great central meet.  ",
