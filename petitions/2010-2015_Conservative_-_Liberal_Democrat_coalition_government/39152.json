        "additional_details": "The currently working tax credit is offered to people aged 25 and above.\r\n\r\nPeople aged 21 to 24 are therefore left out of the loop and are therefore vulnerable, suffering from today's economic conditions even though they pay the same NI and tax as their 25 year old counter parts.\r\n\r\nA prime example would be a new family aged 21:\r\nThe male is earning 13.5k before tax and the female is on maternity getting SMP at  leave from a job that usually pays 16k before tax. Both full time jobs.\r\nBills including rent, council tax, gas/electricty/water/phone add up to 800 per month.\r\nThis leaves the family with around 170 per week to feed and clothe not only themselves, but the newborn they are expecting.\r\n\r\nWe need the government to change the rules on the working tax, and include those who are left in the gap of where no help can be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
