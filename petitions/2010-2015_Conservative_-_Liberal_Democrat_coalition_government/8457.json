        "additional_details": "In light of the recent shocking acts around the UK culminating in lootings, it is proposed that mandatory military service is re-introduced for all UK citizens aged between 18-20 years of age.\r\n\r\nWe propose that the Government re-enact the National Service Act 1948 when citizens performed 18 months of military training. For the proposed National Service Act 2011, conscripts are to wear a seperate uniform to the professional \"regular\" soldiers. Once the 18 months military training is completed the conscripts are to remain on the reserve list of the military for 3 years to assist our over-stretched \"regular\" armed forces; freeing up time for the regular forces to act in those areas which non-professional conscripts should/can not.\r\n\r\nThis proposed compulsory military training is to demonstrate to young UK citizens the meaning of discipline and a sense of worth within their communities.",
