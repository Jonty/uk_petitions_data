        "additional_details": "The government should bring into force laws similar to the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 covering open land and national parks in England and Wales. Wild camping enthusiasts are not a threat to our national parks and open spaces, and legalising wild camping would encourage visitors in the most beautiful and wild parts of our countryside. It works well in Scotland and is one of the reasons I chose to holiday there above England or Wales. Hopefully it would have a positive impact on UK tourism and encourage people to get out and be more active.",
