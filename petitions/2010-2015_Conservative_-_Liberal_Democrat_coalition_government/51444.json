        "additional_details": "To have a referendum to revise the current copyright laws, as currently copyrighted material is owned by the respective author for an entire lifetime and an additional 70 years following the authors death. To many this is seen as unjust as no person should own materials following death, this prevents public use to produce more media and also disrespects the original laws for copyright in this country which gave a just 28 years following initial release of an author's works. So HM Government should hold a referendum to  allow the people of this country to reduce time in which an author holds rights to media, allowing for public use following a respective time period.",
