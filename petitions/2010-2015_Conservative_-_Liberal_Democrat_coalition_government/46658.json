        "additional_details": "In the United Kingdom, it is currently not illegal to resell concert tickets and make a profit from that sale.\r\n\r\nIt is illegal to resell football tickets under section 166 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 unless the resale is authorised by the organiser of the match.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this petition is to also make it illegal to resell the tickets of music concerts and festivals unless agreed by the organiser. Profits are being made by people who had no intention of going to see the artist.\r\n\r\nTax free money is being made and we need to stop this",
