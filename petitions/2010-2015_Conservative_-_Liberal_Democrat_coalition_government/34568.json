It is very frustrating and depressing knowing that the council is offering people to buy their properties when they are not prepared to build any more affordable housing for young people and young families.\r\nWe need to have more affordable housing in Seaford as the town is growing.\r\nI urge and would appreciate your signatures as we need as much support as we can get.\r\n",
