        "additional_details": "I think the fitness requirments in the police service around the united kingdom should be raised as they are tremendiously low at the current time, and we need it to be raised so we have fit staff within the police service so they are fit and they can chase people on foot and to be able to run long distances if required and basically be fit for the job. also they should have fitness tests every month to keep there general fitness up, otherwise they will be able to get the job if they are fit at the current time but when they get in the job they might get lesser fitter and wont be fit for the job, as they need to be kept in top shape through out thier whole career in the police service.",
