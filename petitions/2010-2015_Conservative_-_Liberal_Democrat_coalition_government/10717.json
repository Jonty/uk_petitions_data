        "additional_details": "From the recent coverage of the rioting on TV and the subsequent interviews with youths it is clear that these people have no role models or respect.  A mandatory period of military service for young offenders will act both as a deterent, but also be a positive influence on the offenders lives by instilling those disciplines that have been lacking in their upbringing.  This will put them on the right path for their future, teaching them to self-help rather than spending the rest of their days believing that the world owes them a living.",
