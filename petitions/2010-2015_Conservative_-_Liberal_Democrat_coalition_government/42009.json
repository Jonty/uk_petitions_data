Recently we have seen a sudden uproar of deaths and rockets by Israel against our Palestinians. It just takes someone with a heart to realise the savageness that Israel are displaying towards Palestine. If we don't act soon, Israel may succeed in annihilating Palestine.\r\n\r\nWe want the British Government to stop these attacks, we know how powerful this government is. We want the British Government to support Palestine rather than Israel.\r\n\r\nLet's get our voices heard, let's make sure the British Government stand up for what we want. Let's show the world that we know what's right and wrong and we won't let Palestine down without a fight.",
