        "additional_details": "We think that the Death Penalty should be abolished in countries all over the world. More specifically, China. Out of 198 countries, only 20 countries carried out the Death Penalty in 2011. This means we are making progress in making sure that the Death Penalty is abolished. Sadly, in 2010, 18,000 people were on Death Row in China. We need you to sign this petition so that we can help stop this once and for all. Your signature makes all the difference.",
