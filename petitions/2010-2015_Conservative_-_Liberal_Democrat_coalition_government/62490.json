Twenty one minutes later he was killed on the M62.\r\n\r\nDue to the inadequate procedures of the Highways Agency his fate was not discovered for 13 weeks.\r\n\r\nBy chance the events of November 23rd were communicated. Imagine the heartache, frustration and distress caused because of inadequate and unenforced procedures.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous documented occasions where people's pets have been shamelessly discarded without consideration, respect or compassion for the owners rights.\r\n\r\nWe request Legislation to enforce a formulated process ensuring that HA Departments abide by the following:\r\n\r\nCompulsory scanning of all domestic animals retrieved from the highways.\r\n\r\nLog report filed and circulated to both Police and Dog Warden.\r\n\r\nPhotographs of the deceased to be held with the log report to be used for identification purposes.\r\n\r\nPlease join us!",

            "details": "As this e-petition has received more than 10 000 signatures, the relevant Government department have provided the following response:\r\n\r\nThe government does understand how important pets are and regrets that, sadly, a number of them are killed or injured on our roads each year.\r\n\r\nThe High\u00adways Agency is an Exec\u00adu\u00adtive Agency of the Depart\u00adment for Trans\u00adport (DfT), and is respon\u00adsi\u00adble for oper\u00adat\u00ading, main\u00adtain\u00ading and improv\u00ading the strate\u00adgic road net\u00adwork in Eng\u00adland on behalf of the Sec\u00adre\u00adtary of State for Transport. The Agency\u2019s role in main\u00adtain\u00ading and improv\u00ading the net\u00adwork is deliv\u00adered through a large and com\u00adplex sup\u00adply chain through a num\u00adber and vari\u00adety of con\u00adtracts. The Agency also sets and main\u00adtains tech\u00adni\u00adcal stan\u00addards for roads and struc\u00adtures which con\u00adtrac\u00adtors are required to adhere to and which are referred to by many local and other national author\u00adi\u00adties for the roads that they manage.\r\n\r\nThese standards are set down in the Net\u00adwork Man\u00adage\u00adment Man\u00adual (NMM). The NMM gen\u00ader\u00adally describes the processes for the man\u00adage\u00adment of the main\u00adte\u00adnance ser\u00advice includ\u00ading the inter\u00adface between the High\u00adways Agency, its ser\u00advice providers and other stakeholders. A link to the NMM is here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dft.gov.uk/ha/standards/nmm_rwsc/docs/nmm_part_7a.pdf\r\n\r\nSection 7.17 of the NMM describes processes that must be followed when canine remains are found on the network, although it does recognise that it is impossible to guarantee that remains can be fully identified due to the high speed nature of the Agency\u2019s roads.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of the processes already in place, the Government has no plans to enforce adherence to the NMM through legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.",
