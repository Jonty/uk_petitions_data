        "additional_details": "With Ther Hermit, Brentwood re-opening on the 25th January 2013, it has come to everyones attention that the council have leased out the building to a not-for-profit organisation under grounds that the building is only available to those 19 & under. This comes as rather upsetting news for those who have been devoted to hermit since a young age and are now over 19.\r\n\r\nThe youth service provides support for those up to the age of 21 and 25 if disabled or under foster care/social services.\r\n\r\nI aim to get the signatures required and present this petition to Brentwood Council to change the grounds of the lease and allow The Hermit to be open to everyone who has been a devoted Hermit Goer from day 1",
