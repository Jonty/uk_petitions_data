        "additional_details": "97 Acres of Beautiful green land just on the outskirts of Ballymena at Ballee is being devastated by a local church ironically calling themselves green pastures. They intend building a small town outside of the town when derelict buildings and sites could be redeveloped. This land is full of wildlife, birds, rabbits, squirrels, bees, beautiful butterflies, and maybe even bats too. It is the only piece of land left for people to enjoy the countryside on their doorstep. Why destroy this land when the actual town needs redevelopment? Sign to save the REAL Green Pastures!\r\n\r\n",
