        "additional_details": "We the undersigned do entreat Her Majesty's Government to enshrine in statute a commitment not to allow any further referendums to be conducted on the question of Scottish independence for a minimum of 30 years. Given the free, fair and decisive vote in favour of Scotland remaining a part of the United Kingdom in the 2014 referendum, we believe it would be an affront to the will of the Scottish people and the the integrity of the democratic process if a second referendum on this question were permitted to occur. Furthermore, the uncertainty and stark division in Scottish society caused by the referendum was immensely damaging, and the Scottish people deserve better than such a sword of Damocles perpetually hanging over them. Campaigners for separation proclaimed that the 2014 referendum was a \"once in a lifetime\" event. We believe it was such, and that Scotland's constitutional status is now a settled question that does not warrant another referendum for a minimum of another 30 years.",
