        "additional_details": "We the undersigned, petition the Prime Minister to reverse Newham council\u2019s decision to close Atherton Leisure Centre in December 2011 and have the council release the funds to repair the main swimming pool roof as it is the only Leisure Centre in E15 (the heart of the Olympics).\r\nThe council\u2019s own report shows that 23% of all leisure centre visits in Newham are to Atherton and that there is not enough capacity in other venues. The closure of Atherton leaves the residents of Stratford without any sporting facilities for the foreseeable future.\r\nWhere is our Olympic Legacy?\r\nRobin Wales claims that a new 'state-of-the-art' centre will be built to replace Atherton; however, the report from the council\u2019s meeting states, \"There is significant risk that the capital financing will not be secure for a replacement facility\".\r\n\r\n\r\n",
