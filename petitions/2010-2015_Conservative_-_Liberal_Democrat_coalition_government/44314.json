Why should we have to pay for this when it is something that is being forced upon us.\r\nI believe that the government should abolish the fee or abolish the expiry date on the licenses.\r\nThere is already enough taxes on drivers:\r\nFuel duty AND VAT on Petrol, Road tax.\r\n\r\nDrivering is the most expensive neccassity of the day without the need for \u00a320 every 10 years, the average driver is going to spend another \u00a3100 in their life time driving on top of the \u00a350 that is already spent for the provisional.\r\n\r\nAverage cost:\r\n\u00a350 - Provisional\r\n\u00a3100 - 20-70 renewal\r\n\u00a331 - Theory test\r\n\u00a361 - Practical test\r\nLife cost: \u00a3242 before the other regular costs like petrol, insurance etc!\r\n",
