        "additional_details": "Currently Public Consultation is not a mandatory requirement when developing on Greenfield or Greenbelt land and the level of consultation is usually dictated by the Local Authority's Statement of Community Involvement, which may only require limited and passive advertising of such proposed developments. Even then a developer can usually choose not to do any public consultation without prejudice to his application. Having Mandatory Public Consultation and Active Notifications will mean that developers will be forced to fulfil their moral obligations. The area that this should cover should be fixed relating to the size of the development.",
