        "additional_details": "The Human Rights Act 1998 gave effect to the fundamental rights and freedoms contained in the European Convention on Human Rights. Unfortunately, this act has been used to frustrate the will of the British people and the UK Government resulting in many common-sense violations such as the inability to deport terrorists and criminal;  encouraging the claiming of state benefits for those who have not made any contribution to the UK and facilitating increasing immigration.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition seeks to encourage the Government to introduce legislation so that the rights and freedoms contained in the European Convention on Human Rights cannot be used by those who have abused their position in UK society.",
