Every nation has the right to express itself in democratic structures.\r\n\r\nWhile, our nationality should remain British, an institution of a parliament and all that entails creates a sense of confidence and self-worth.\r\n\r\nAny English parliament should include the whole of England, but be sub-divided into regional branches guided by a process of referenda for decision making in-line with the Canton system in Switzerland. For example, London would be its own \"Canton\" as would the \"North West\" each reporting and being a part of the English Parliament. ",
