        "additional_details": "A news report on the 13 March 2014 from BBC Northern Ireland stated that four men from east Belfast have been given two year suspended prison sentences for animal cruelty offences that are so sickening and horrific I needed to do something about this. Police said a custodial sentence would have provided a greater deterrent. How can they let this happen and let them get away with this. The only way it seems is to get heartless people like this to learn, is to give them what they deserve and lock them away. How can any judge who should be expected to be competent professional and caring in there work let them get away with it. The Injuries included, among other sickening injuries, a recording found on a mobile phone in August of that year, showing four dogs killing a cat. I needed to seek justice and not let this get swept under the carpet. I would like to ask the government if they would overturn this decision and put them behind bars now.",
