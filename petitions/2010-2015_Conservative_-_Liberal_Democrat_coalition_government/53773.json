        "additional_details": "Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTs) is a a dysfunction of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS). It is an invisible illness with a large variety of symptoms that can completely debilitate the sufferer.There are so many parts of the body that can be affected from the heart, blood pressure, temperature tolerance, hearing, vision, breathing, digestion and much more. This is why POTs symptoms can vary so much between one person and the next. Whilst people with POTs all have some similarities, there are also many differences, which has added to the difficulties in recognising and diagnosing the syndrome. As a result many sufferers struggle to get diagnosed properly or get treatment at hospitals and GP surgeries. This can be very difficult due to a lack of knowledge and sensitivity to how serious the condition is.There needs to be more funding, awareness and support towards research for POTs. Hospitals and medical staff need to be educated about the condition.",
