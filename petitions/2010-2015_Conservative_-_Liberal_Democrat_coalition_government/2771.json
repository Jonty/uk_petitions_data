        "additional_details": "Current system of car tax discs should be abolished.\r\nInstead, the equivalent amount of money generated from all road tax discs should be collected as a levy on the price of petrol and diesel. This would only add a tiny amount to the cost per litre. It would also mean that the cost borne by any individual or family would be in proportion to the distance they drove and the fuel consumption of the vehicle. Persons owning vehicles seldom used would pay less than persons with vehicles covering long distances. Insurance companies should issue discs to display the details of cover applicable to any vehicle.",
