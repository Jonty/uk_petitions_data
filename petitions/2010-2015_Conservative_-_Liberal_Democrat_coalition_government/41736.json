        "additional_details": "No public utility entity providing essential services such as water, electricity or gas has the power to criminalise a member of the public for non-payment of a bill.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that an organisation providing non-essential media services has the right prosecute for non-payment in the courts?\r\n\r\nDo we consider watching Eastenders as more important than heating in winter or cooking?\r\n\r\nOther media organisations manage without public funding; The independent sector is accountable to the viewing public as if they don't like it, the public will turn over. If this happens too often the media supplier will cease to exist.\r\n\r\nThis is not so for the BBC. They are unaccountable to the public and pursue an agenda and policies with which much of the public disagree; Nevertheless the public is forced to pay anyway.\r\n\r\nThis decision should be put to the country in a Referendum with the question \"Do you want to be criminalised for not wanting to fund the BBC? Yes or No\"\r\n",
