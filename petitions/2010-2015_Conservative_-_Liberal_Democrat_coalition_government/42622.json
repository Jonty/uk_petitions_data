        "additional_details": "A free press is one of the safeguards of democracy. Parliament  established a free press in 1695 and we change that at our peril. There is a need for regulatory body, but not one that is underpinned by law ,as this would hand control of the press to politicians. It is not in the Public Interest to hand over to MPs the power for amending now and in the future a statutory regulation for controlling the press.We call upon the Government to set in place a system whereby all Publishers choose to sign up to a Satisfactory Self-Regulatory Body, backed up by significant incentives to do so",
