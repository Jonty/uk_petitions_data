        "additional_details": "The only proven safe limit of alcohol during pregnancy, is no alcohol at all throughout the entire duration of the pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to request that the UK guidelines are updated to reflect this evidence, and to bring our government's advice in line with the majority of all other developed countries including the U.S., Canada, Spain, Germany, Australia, the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nCurrent UK guidelines suggest that it is safe to consume 1-2 units of alcohol, once or twice a week, during pregnancy. This is simply not true. To eliminate all risk of FASD (foetal alcohol spectrum disorders), a woman must consume zero alcohol during the entirety of her pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe guidelines must be changed to encourage expectant mothers to make the correct, informed decision for the health and safety of their unborn child.",
