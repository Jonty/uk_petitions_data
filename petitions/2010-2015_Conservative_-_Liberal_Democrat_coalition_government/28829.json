        "additional_details": "Ordinary workers are sick and tired of those in our society with millions of pounds of income using tax loopholes to avoid paying all or part of their income tax. It\u2019s about time the wee man (ordinary worker) get a little help with constantly escalating fuel prices. To this end, this petition is proposing that we, the ordinary PAYE Tax payers get our share of tax relief. After all, we\u2019re all in this together, are we not? In that, we insist that the Inland Revenue refund all fuel duty for the miles we have to travel to get to and from our place of work. Also, tax relief for PAYE employees travelling to and from the workplace by other means.",
