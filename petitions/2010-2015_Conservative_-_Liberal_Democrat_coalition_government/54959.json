        "additional_details": "Bullying destroys not only the victims lives but the families too, bullying takes place in every school but in some cases the victim is so mentally tortured that some develop suicidal thoughts, this is unacceptable, young people should all have the right to enjoy their school days without feeling afraid and alone, all schools have an anti bullying policy but this just seems to protect the schools legally, it does nothing for the victims. Please look into this matter, it needs to be taken seriously, don't ignore the victims of bullying, we shouldn't be seeing young people suffering with depression and self harming due to mental and physical abuse by their peers\r\nThank you ",
