        "additional_details": "Please do not deport Isimeli Baleiwai.\r\n\r\nThe border agency are planning to deport a former British soldier who served in the army for 13 years.\r\n\r\nIsimeli Baleiwai served in Afghanistan and Iraq, before leaving the Army in June. He is married to a UK national and he has two children aged 3 and 6 with his wife.\r\n\r\nDue to a short fight he had with a colleague, which he pleaded guilty to at a military tribunal, he is being denied citizenship in the UK.\r\n\r\nHe himself admits that he was suffering from the effects of a recent tour in Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nA man described as \"charismatic, selfless and well-liked\" is being deported for a brief one minute altercation after 13 years of serving our country.\r\n\r\nSign this petition if you would like the Home Office to go back on its decision and allow Isimeli to stay.",
