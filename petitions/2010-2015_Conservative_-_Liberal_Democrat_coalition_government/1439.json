        "additional_details": "The purpose of a road fund licence is to fund the roads. Yet increasingly certain vehicles are paying less towards this cost at the same time large families are penalised for having large vehicles.\r\nA farmer who provides our food is swept up in the same high tax rate as all other 4x4 users.\r\nElectric and so called low emission vehicles pay nothing.\r\nA family can have two cars yet the smaller engine car do double the miles of the large engine but pay less than half the road tax.\r\nA flat fee, of around \u00a3150 per year, should be applied to all vehicles to bring fairness to this now out of control the system",
