        "additional_details": "The attempt  of Channel 4 to increase ratings based on a complete disregard to our Romanian community and fully humiliation, broadcasting \" The Romanians are coming\" , in 3 episodes has to stop.  The image created doesn't reflect the Romanian community as it is in reality. It's time to follow a true path on what we really are as a majority. The etiquette for hard working and educated people has to be shown too, we are here to adapt  and respect your terms and conditions. It's an aspect we don't forget and we can't tolerate anymore the discrimination based on isolated, despicable facts witch doesn't  describe us as a whole community. Thank you!",
