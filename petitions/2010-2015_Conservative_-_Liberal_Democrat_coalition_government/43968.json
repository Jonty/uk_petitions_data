It seeks to bring in a reform to the British approach to petitions and referendums with the introduction of direct 'citizen propositions'. These are where members of the general public can (through an appropriate British mechanism to be identified through consultation and debate) incorporate local and, potentially, national motions/questions for the general public to vote upon directly during election years.",
