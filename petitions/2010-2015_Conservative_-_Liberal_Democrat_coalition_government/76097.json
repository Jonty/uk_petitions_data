If a private company had done this they would have been prosecuted. The government needs to make amendments to this policy to ensure it has encompassed the fair and legal aspects of it. The extension of age should be to the people who have come into the country and not paid into the pot but expect to get a pension from it for  those of us who have paid in for 45 years surely we have a right in her somewhere.",
