        "action": "Reform in funding from Student Finance England",
        "additional_details": "This is a petition to review the amount of funding students receive in their maintenance loans. After conducting research with fellow university students, it is clear that the amounts currently offered do not cover the cost of living. In most cases, the loans barely cover the cost of accommodation, with no regard for money for food and other essentials. The right to higher education should be made available for all, therefore these reforms need to be made in order to offer everyone the chance to better their education. In summary, larger maintenance loans should be offered to students of all household incomes. In addition, assumptions that families with a higher earning bracket can provide more money for their children should be stopped as this is not always the case.",
