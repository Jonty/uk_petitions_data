He should not because he doesn't want to debate with the other leaders be allowed to impose his own terms on how he address the public. He says he is a great believer in the great British media yet goes against this when it is convenient to himself. He should be subject to the same scrutiny on a level playing field as all the other party leaders no ifs no buts",
