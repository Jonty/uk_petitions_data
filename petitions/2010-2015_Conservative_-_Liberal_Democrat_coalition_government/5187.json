        "additional_details": "We know that competition is a good thing. It has been introduced to many of the essential markets in this country; electricity, water, transport and soon healthcare.\r\nI propose that Parliament itself should be privatised. Companies should be able to stand in elections like an individual, this could bring about the following benefits:\r\n- Cost savings in the running of parliament (the private sector is apparently always cheaper)\r\n- Increased competition would ensure constituents get the best deal on price and quality.\r\n- An MP cant be in Westminster and his constiuency at once, a private company could maintain a presence in both places at once.\r\n",
