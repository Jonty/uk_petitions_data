        "additional_details": "We the undersigned request Her Majesty's Government to create, debate, and pass a bill requiring all Internet-based 'social networks' (as defined in current common usage) which operate, trade, or recruit users, in the UK, to enable and permit those users to choose and display a psudonym instead of their real name, should they wish to keep their 'real name' private.  The networks may still collect real names, but should users choose to use a psudonym then that must be displayed throughout the relevant network, and the real name kept private and known only to the network's own operators.\r\n\r\nThis will uphold our common law rights to use and change names as we wish, and in addition protect those for whom being searchable by their real name could create risk of harm.",
