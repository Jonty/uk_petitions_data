        "additional_details": "On Tuesday 20th March, Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude suggested, on the National news, that drivers should fill up their cars to 2/3rd's tank plus any spare Jerry cans, with petrol and keep them in garages.\r\n\r\nThese irresponsible comments have caused uneccesary panic-buying and have been widely criticised by petrol retailers and fire safety experts.\r\n\r\nConveniently, according to the AA, fuel sales in just 24 hours could have earned the Treasury an extra \u00a332m in excise duty.\r\n\r\nTransport minister Mike Penning said Mr Maude's comments had been a \"mistake\"; \"He didn't understand the size of a jerrycan, he has apologised since,\" he told the BBC. The cans can hold 20 litres of fuel.\r\n\r\nIt's absolutely unacceptable that a Cabinet Office Minister speaks so irresponsibly on National Television.\r\n\r\nMr Maude should be asked to resign. Or, is it quite feasible that the government condones his 'advice', at a time when fuel prices are at their peak, in-order to maximise fuel duty revenues.",
