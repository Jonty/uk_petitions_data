This would allow the electorate to express dissatisfaction with all the choices offered (or even the whole process, as possibly in the case of the imposition of Police and Crime  Commissioners) without the political establishment being able to to interpret abstention as voter apathy. In the long term, this should motivate greater self-examination and democratic responsiveness from political parties.",
