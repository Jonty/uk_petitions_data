        "additional_details": "As the founder of both Missing Cats In Scotland and Missing Cats In England I feel it is a tragedy that cats that are run over and picked up by the local councils and/or cleansing departments, do not check if these cats are micro-chipped.\r\n\r\nDaily I receive reports of cats that have been run over and daily I receive reports of cats going missing. If the cleansing and council departments across the UK had micro-chip scanners then owners of cats that are found dead can be alerted quickly and given the news, which then gives them the closure they need.\r\n\r\nI am looking to collect as many signatures as I can across the UK in order to make this happen and make the jobs of rescues/charities and organisations easy, when dealing with owners of lost or missing cats.",
