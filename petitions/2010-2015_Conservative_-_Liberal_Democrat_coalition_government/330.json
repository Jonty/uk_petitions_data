        "additional_details": "Trans-fats have no nutritional benefit. They are partially hydrogenated vegetable oils that turn oily foods into semi-solid foods, used by the food industry as a cheap baulking agent and to extend the shelf life of products. Trans-fats are present in everyday food.\r\n\r\nConsumption of trans-fats lead to a elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (heart disease and stroke) the biggest cause of death in the UK. Trans-fats increase the levels of \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol and decrease the level of \u2018good\u2019 cholesterol in the blood. Even a small reduction in trans-fat consumption can reduce heart disease.\r\n\r\nTrans-fat consumption increases the risk of other chronic health problems including obesity, diabetes, cancer, infertility in women, liver dysfunction, Alzheimer's disease and depression.\r\n\r\nTrans-fats have already been banned in some countries (Demark in 2003). Banning trans-fats in the UK would benefit people in having a healthier diet and would provide a direct saving to the over-stretched NHS.\r\n",
