        "additional_details": "This petition is to get betting shops to stop letting their staff work alone. It is not a safe environment, particularly during evening trading, for anyone to be made to work alone. Customers can get very aggressive and abusive when they have lost money and the business is a high risk for robberies. One man working for Ladbrokes has already lost his life due to this. Don't let it happen again.",
