        "additional_details": "Wedding photographers are routinely prevented by Registrars from taking photos during wedding ceremonies at venues other than registry offices, even when photographers assure the utmost discretion and respect for the occasion.  This means that couples miss out on recording the most important part of their wedding day.  Registry offices throughout the UK have very different policies that registrars exercise outside of the registry office itself and registrars often don't stick to the policy, often preventing any form of photography during the ceremony. I believe they have no legal power to do this and would like the government to set a UK wide policy on photography that allows photographers to discreetly record wedding ceremonies in their entirety.",
