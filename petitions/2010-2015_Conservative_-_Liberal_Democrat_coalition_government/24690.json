        "additional_details": "HMG should consider the possibility that that a future monarch of Great Britain & the realms may have no religious faith & is an atheist or agnostic. The Act of Supremacy 1534 provides that a British monarch is supreme over the Church of England. How could the head (Supreme Governor) of a Church be a non-believer in God or Christianity? The monarch formally appoints high-ranking officials of the Church, after consulting the PM of the UK & church leaders. The monarch appoints the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland but the monarch holds no leadership position in the church. King Henry VIII broke from Catholicism to be able to be able divorce his wife (Anne) & also to break the pope\u2019s interference, influence &jurisdiction over wide-ranging affairs like politics, sciences, arts, laws, etc. Religion is a matter of individual faith and preferences not to be regarded as the ultimate prescription for everyone in laws, life, the universe & everything.",
