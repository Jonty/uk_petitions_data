Their apparent dispute with Jeremy Clarkson should not alter the programming schedule as it is extremely unlikely that the alleged fracas/dispute is featured, glamorised or covered within the remaining episodes and therefore should not allow the BBC to use the suspending of the programmes as a form of supposed \"punishment\" against not only Jeremy Clarkson but the TV license paying public as well!!
