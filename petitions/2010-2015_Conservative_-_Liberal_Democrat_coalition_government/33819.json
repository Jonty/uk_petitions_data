In order to earn their pay, they train for war and eventually deploy. They are required to pass a random urine test to detect any drugs, which is acceptable. What is not acceptable is the distribution of their taxes to people who don't have to pass a urine test. Shouldn't one have to pass a urine test to get a benefits cheque because our soldiers, sailors and airmen have to pass one to EARN IT for them? ",
