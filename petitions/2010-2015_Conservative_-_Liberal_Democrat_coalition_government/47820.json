        "additional_details": "I feel that the medical director of the NHS, Sir Bruce Keogh has taken a personal vendetta against the people who depend on the Childrens Heart Surgery at Leeds, and the wonderful NHS staff that run it.\r\n\r\nIn an act that can only be described as malicious. The day after the high court ruled that their initial plan to close the Heart unit was un-lawful. He personally arrived at the Hospital and demanded the immediate shut down of the unit. His actions spat in the face of the UK\u2019s legal system and also placed lives at risk. His actions were personal and were not in the best interests of the National Health Service and the lives it was put in place to save.\r\n\r\nI therefore petition that he is immediately removed from his position, and stripped of his knighthood. Personal vendettas have no place in a 21st century democracy.  I also petition that the Childrens Heart Surgery should be re-opened with immediate effect.\r\n",
