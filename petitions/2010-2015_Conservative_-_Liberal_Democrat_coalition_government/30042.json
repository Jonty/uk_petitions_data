        "additional_details": "The Mental Health Systems are bringing into effect a clustering system, meaning that if you dont have Schizophrenia or Psychosis, you are likely to have less of a service and eventually be discharged, for example, if you have Borderline Personality Disorder, depression, anxiety, ocd, that is not deemed \"ill\" enough to need a service. Everyone with a mental health illness needs support, please sign this petition if you agree and dont want the clustering system to decide whether you get treatment or not.",
