        "additional_details": "We, the British people, do not believe the American procured Trident SLBM system to be operationally independent of the American military complex. We insist on this Country being a truly independent nuclear weapons power. No launch codes needed from a foreign country or the fact that we are reliant on America for this system compelling us to follow them into wars where our armed forces are maimed and killed. No to pretargeted missiles. What good is a deterrent that can only be used against certain countries? We want what we are told we have-an independent nuclear missile system.\r\n",
