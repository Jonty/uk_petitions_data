More effort should be made  for parents to gain these skills and not just to attend courses that supposedly correct bad behaviour. Parents need to know what a child needs to develop into a socially aware individual. These skills were once instilled by parents, wider family, schools and churches, but have slowly been eradicated by the changes in society. These courses are available but usually run by charitable organisations Make Surestart use the money it is wasting on silly fun days to implement these courses.",
