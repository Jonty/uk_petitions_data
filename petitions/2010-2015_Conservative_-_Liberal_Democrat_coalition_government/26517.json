        "additional_details": "Reviatlise the economy by allowing lorries to travel road tax free at night. All lorries, foreign or local, should pay road tax if they travel by day. By gaining overnight a 100% increase in road capacity this alone would enable huge savings to the economy and allow for lower prices on the high street. The feel good factor would be massive as motorists by day did not have to compete with lorries for road space and they got to work much quicker. Haulage companies would save a fortune in tax and fuel. Fuel savings for the average family would be enormous, people could get to work and school quicker and more efficently, lorries could get to their destinations in record time, fuel imports would be substantially less. It's an all round win. Why aren't we already doing this?",
