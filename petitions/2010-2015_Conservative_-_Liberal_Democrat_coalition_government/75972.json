        "additional_details": "After working at various 5* hotels and restaurants around London, I was shocked to see how much food is simply thrown away at the end of the day. Big containers full of food that is still in date, still tastes good and what can still be eaten by people. Its shocking the sheer amount of food that is thrown away by these restaurants and hotels every single day. I propose the government sets up a non-profit orgsanisation to somehow collect this food and distribute it to those who are most in need. It should be taken around to homeless shelters and hostels, to take the financial load of these organisations and do something worthwhile for those who are down on their luck. All of this food cannot be wasted while there are thousands of people who are starving, living on the streets of the capital. ",
