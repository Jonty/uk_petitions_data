        "additional_details": "We demand the British Government to clearly denounce the Military Coup in Egypt and to stop all co-operation with the Egyptian Military and the Puppet Government installed by them. They suspended the Egyptian constitution, ousted and arrested a freely and fairly elected President, dismissed the Egyptian Upper House. Already, 10 TV channels have been closed, journalists and politicians locked up in a regime of terror and a shoot-to-kill policy has been put in place against protesters resulting in more than 200 deaths and 1000 injuries. The response from the UK government has been shameful, betraying the British values of freedom, justice and equality.\r\nMost Muslims want democracy, personal freedoms, Islam in political life, and denounce terrorism and violence. We should respect their choice. British complicity in burying the nascent democracy in Egypt is a message that will resonate throughout the Muslim world loud and clear; \"Democracy is not for Muslims\".",
