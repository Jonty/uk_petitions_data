MP salaries and associated expenses are adequate and the role should take up more than enough time to deal with the concerns of their electorate and other government functions.\r\nIf MP's are allowed to have second jobs or private industry roles, it is inevitable that they will try and influence decision making in the interests of that business rather than the wider good of society.",
