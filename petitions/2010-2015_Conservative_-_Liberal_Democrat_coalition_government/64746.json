This includes, but not limited to, cutting the limbs off thieves; stoning to death those who commit \"homosexual acts\" or \"adultery\".\r\n\r\nThese are archaic ways of treating any human and no state owned group should be permitted to earn millions from the UK market while they implement such sick acts of punishment.\r\n\r\nFor the UK to be an advocate of Human Rights, they must demonstrate this by blocking any ownership of publically trading spaces (e.g. hotels) while Brunei continues with its anti-humane laws.\r\n\r\n#ProtectTheHuman",
