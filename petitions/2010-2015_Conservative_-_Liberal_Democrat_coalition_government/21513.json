        "additional_details": "Enrolled Nurses were classed as having a level 2 qualification - Staff Nurses were level 1.  There are many Enrolled Nurses in the UK with years of nursing experience that are not being allowed the opportunity to convert to Level 1 - for Nurses in England there are no conversion courses and NMC states that if they want to convert they have to start their training from scratch - However there are conversion courses in Wales, Ireland and Scotland.  Surely this is unfair - Enrolled Nurses in England should be given the same opportunity as other countries and conversion courses should be available for all in the UK in accordance with equal opportunities and the umberella of Life Long Learning.",
