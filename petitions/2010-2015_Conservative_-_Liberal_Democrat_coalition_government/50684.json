Restore Capital Punishment!\r\n\r\nThis should be used for any convicted murderer where there is no doubt of the crime. eg The killing of Lee Rigby. For more examples see the deaths of PC Fiona Bone and PC Nicola Hughes.  The UK needs to take action so show this behavior is not acceptible.\r\n\r\n",
