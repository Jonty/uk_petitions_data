        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned fully support the proposed Lidl development on the site of james and Jenkins in Llandaff North, but we oppose the removal of the Pineapple skittle alley and beer garden.  The Pineapple is a community facility and the only pub that has a beer garden that provides a play area for children in Llandaff North. We believe that to remove the skittle alley and beer garden would make the Pineapple financially unviable.",
