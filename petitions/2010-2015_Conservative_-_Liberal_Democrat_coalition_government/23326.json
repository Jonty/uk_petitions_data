        "additional_details": "I petition this government to cut income tax for adults earning under \u00a350,000.  Under the current system the tax rate for people earning between \u00a335,001 and \u00a3150,000 is 40%.  People earning under \u00a350,000 should not have to pay the same tax as a person with a six figure salary.  People earning under \u00a335,000 should have the same tax rate as people earning under \u00a335,000.  This would lower the tax rate from 40% to 20%.",
