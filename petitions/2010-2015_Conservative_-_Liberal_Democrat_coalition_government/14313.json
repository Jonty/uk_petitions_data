        "additional_details": "London Fire Brigade is seeking to privatise the training of London's Firemen. This has the makings of a disaster for the general public, who rely on the expertise of these public servants to come to our aid in times of need.\r\n\r\nThis decsion has had little or no public debate yet it is such an important issue that we the general public deserve to know all the facts.\r\n\r\nNo other developed country uses the private sector for such training. This is for good reason - the expertise does not exist outside the fire services.\r\n\r\nThis misguided action must be stopped. Please sign this petition.",
