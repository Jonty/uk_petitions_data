Could raise \u00a3250 billion a year globally. Well-tested, cheap to implement and hard to avoid. - - - 2. Increase the bank levy. The one implemented in January wasn't enough. - - - 3. Financial Activities Tax (FAT) - could raise billions through taxing excess profit and remuneration. Broadly equivalent to a VAT-style tax on the financial sector. It could raise \u00a33.9 billion a year in the UK alone \u2013 and up to $93 billion across the OECD countries. The UK government has said it is open to implementing a FAT tax, but only together with a group of other countries, for example at EU level. - - - For more info visit www.robinhoodtax.org",
