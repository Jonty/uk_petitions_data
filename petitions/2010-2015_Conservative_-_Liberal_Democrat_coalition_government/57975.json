        "action": "Make energy companies directly responsible for the consequences of their price hikes",
        "additional_details": "With record profits at the expense of more and more people plunged into fuel poverty by price hikes, the knock on effect will be that more people will be unable to properly heat their homes. This will lead to an increase in sickness and death over the coming colder months, especially among the elderly and the already infirm. This petition proposes that energy companies be made responsible in law for any death or illness caused by their greed and profit-mongering, with additional fines imposed by act of parliament to ensure that excessive price hikes are longer profitable, and that the rights of the people come before the profits of energy suppliers.",
