        "action": "Regulate information food companies put on their packaging",
        "additional_details": "We need tough regulation of all manufacturers who sell packaged food in this country that will ensure it does not contain misleading information about the nutritional value (or lack of) of the food it contains. Currently, they can suggest that a generally unhealthy product is good for you by emphasising low fat, when it actually contains an unhealthy amount of sugar that is not emphasised to help people make an informed choice. Packaged meals are even allowed to make unsubstantiated claims that they contain a proportion of '5 a day', with no way of the public knowing how accurate this is as the logos used are unregulated.\r\nIt\u2019s therefore vital and frankly common sense that to tackle obesity, such basic lapses in legislation need to be addressed urgently, WITHOUT cuddling up to industry bosses; a new concept for Andrew Lansley I fear but if progress is to be made, we need to regulate food packaging to ensure accuracy so consumers can be sure that 'healthy' choices actually are healthy.",
