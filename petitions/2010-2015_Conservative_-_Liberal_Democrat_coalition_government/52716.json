        "additional_details": "Stop the privatisation of the Royal Mail as it is not in the long term interest of the British people. Short term revenue gain from the sale will be outweighed by longer term welfare payments due to job losses and lower wages, loss of income tax because of the former, loss of profit revenue into the Exchequer from growing parcel market and potential loss of corporation tax as a result of creative tax measures of any new owners. We want the government to stop the privatisation of the Royal Mail completely.",
