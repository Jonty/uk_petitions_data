        "additional_details": "Banning 'sugar free' squash in schools is causing most children to not drink anything during school time. This is causing dehydration, urine infections and poor concentration as they are just not drinking enough. There should be the option of water, weak squash or milk. Certain areas of the country also have strong smelling treated water which also puts the children off drinking the water on offer. ",
