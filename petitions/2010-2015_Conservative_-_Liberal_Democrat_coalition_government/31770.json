        "additional_details": "After some searching I can fine no one arguing that an increase in fuel duty is a good idea. on the contrary many argue it is damaging to the economy. Why then at a time when businesses and individuals are struggle does this government choose to punish us further.The cost of the increase will be passed on through consumer products and service industries that rely on engineers and sales reps to travel to do their jobs have no choice but to increase service charges. I would like to know how the government can justify these taxes or is this just an easy way to raise money? If so tax income and profits it is much fairer.",
