        "additional_details": "The Extreme pornography legislation relied on a Rapid Evaluation Assessment which was flawed and on emotional argument with no factual basis.\r\n\r\nIt has only served as a minor secondary offence and has not fulfilled its purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Home Office have failed to comment on the impact on the arts, specifically works the like of Mapelthorpe's which was in exhibition in \"Seduced, Sex from antiquity to now\" which was in the Barbican in 2009. It has also failed to detail the saving of one life, past, present or future.\r\n\r\nThe REA was not asked about removing pornography from our society. The majority of the research examined by the REA (that I could easily access) found no correlation between pornography and rape. The REA complained about lack of time given to it; and the student studies confirmed that it is people who seek material, not the material that makes the person.\r\n\r\nIn the face of this, plus the subjective nature of the legislation, it serves no purpose and should be revoked.",
