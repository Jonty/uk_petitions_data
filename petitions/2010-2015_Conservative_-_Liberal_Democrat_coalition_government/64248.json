        "additional_details": "The Ministry of Defence wants to lower the number of Armed Forces personnel drastically, the Army: from just over 100,000 in 2010 to just over 80,000 by 2020 but with only an increase of reservists from 24,110 to 30,000. The Navy from 35,500 to 30,000 and additional reservists from 2,630 to 3,100. Finally, the RAF from 40,130 to 35,000 and reservists from 1,340 to 1,800. With our nation being as powerful as it is it makes us an even bigger target from developing enemies and terrorist organisations, therefore it is essential that our United Kingdom is protected with a sustainable and large Armed Forces. I, as well as millions of others across our country believe  that the Government should immediately cease military cuts and increase the Ministry of Defence's budget drastically to ensure our Armed Forces prosper and grow to adapt to the forever changing threats we as a nation come across.
