        "additional_details": "I would like the government to initiate a sell-by date policy for tobacco products. As a perishable product, it should be treated in the same way as any other product that can go stale. This could possibly save the NHS money by not having to treat patients suffering from heightened respriatory problems caused by smoking stale tobacco, and maybe stop tobacco manufacturers from repacking old stock, especially around budget time.",
