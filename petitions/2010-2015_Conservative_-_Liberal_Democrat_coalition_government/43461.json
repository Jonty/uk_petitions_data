        "action": "HM Government to remove Clause 8 from the Growth & Infrastructure Bill and retain the legislation protecting the natural beauty of our National Parks",
        "additional_details": "HM Government is proposing to remove some of the protection afforded our most spectacular landscapes.\r\n\r\nThe Bill proposes to allow the installation of communications infrastructure, including overhead telecoms cabling for broadband, without the need for prior approval from the planning authority, for a period of five years.  This is likely to lead to a proliferation of ugly infrastructure, which will damage these landscapes and undermine Ofgem\u2019s recent announcement to enhance National Parks by undergrounding power lines.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is made in the name of economic growth.  But, there is no evidence that the legislation protecting National Parks has delayed the roll out of broadband.  By contrast, careful planning in National Parks has ensured that they continue to attract visitors from around the world.\r\n\r\nWe believe that National Parks should be protected and enhanced for the future, not spoiled by new infrastructure.  We call on the Government to remove Clause 8 from the Bill.",
