The telephone number is associated with a private organisation who deal with probate and they then use \"sales\" people to take instructions to administer estates.  It cannot be appropriate for government departments to hand out information which favour one commerical orgnisation over others, despite the fact that many registries have been informed of the true nature of such \"free\" service and handouts.  We wish to know if the probate registries receive any reward for handing out such information associated with a commercial organisation. ",
