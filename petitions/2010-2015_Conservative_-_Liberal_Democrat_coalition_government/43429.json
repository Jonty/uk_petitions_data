In the final analysis in these circumstances the taxpayer pays twice - one in the increase in charges to cover the cost of the fine and secondly in the lost taxes that accrue because the company can put the fine against its tax bill.  THIS MUST BE STOPPED IF FINES ARE TO BE MEANINGFUL, OTHERWISE, JUST WHAT IS THE POINT OF THE REGULATOR FINING COMPANIES?",
