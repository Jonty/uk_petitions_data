        "additional_details": "We think the rules monitoring the chimes from ice cream vans are too strict.\r\n\r\nWe particularly think that ice cream vans should be allowed to operate their chimes before midday, and more often than once every two hours per street.\r\n\r\nThe 12 second limit to ice cream van chimes is too short, as we particularly like the sound of Greensleeves on a hot day. For this reason, we also think the 80dB sound limit is too low.\r\n\r\nAlso, ice cream men should be allowed to taunt children by playing their tunes outside of schools during school hours. Ice cream men are human too, and we think they should be allowed their fun. Same goes for outside churches on Sundays.",
