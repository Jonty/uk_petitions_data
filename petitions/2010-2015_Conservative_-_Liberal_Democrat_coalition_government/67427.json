They can't use it to fund enforcement or to employ more staff; they can't use it to save jobs that otherwise would have been lost and the only route to income is to find reasons to fine landlords who join the scheme.\r\n\r\nIts the political version of pyramid selling. Take a lot of money off the 'marks' for a product that doesn't really exist.\r\n\r\nThis scheme should be abolished.",
