        "additional_details": "A sail training yacht would seem to be the most appropriate type of vessel and could provide disadvantaged children a love and respect for the sea as well as teaching discipline, respect for others and above all sefl-respect.\r\n\r\nThe yacht would be 100%British from the hull to blocks and yes even belaying pins and would reflect our status as a great sea faring nation The suggestion that it could also be used for research also seems to be an excellent idea.  After all we have only benefitted by 1% the true potential for sea life to provide man with a host of medical discoveries.\r\n\r\nAs for the name, would not KING GEORGE VI be a fiting tribute to the Queen's beloved father? An alternative might be HORATIO NELSON as an example of the best our Royal Navy has produced.\r\n",
