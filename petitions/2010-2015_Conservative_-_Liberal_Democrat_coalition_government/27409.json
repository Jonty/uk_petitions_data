        "additional_details": "The Class 142, 143 and 144 railbuses have been a workhorse of many railway lines since their introduction in 1985. Indeed the majority of these lightweight trains are still in active service in Northern England and South Wales, working everything from rural, low density services through to busy commuter services. These railbuses, officially known as \"Pacers\" are British designed, British built and a key part in the history of Britain's railways.As such, one representative of the Pacer railbuses should be officially preserved in the National Collection, for the benefit of future generations.
