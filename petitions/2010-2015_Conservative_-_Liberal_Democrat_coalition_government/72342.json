It is clear these tickets have been purchased simply for profit and not entertainment.\r\nReselling tickets at over the face value should not be allowed.\r\nThis would not only allow those actually interested in the cultural event attend, it would prevent the extortion of those who have no choice but to buy the overpriced tickets.\r\nPlease sign if you agree. Thanks!",
