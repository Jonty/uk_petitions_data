        "additional_details": "Discrimination of any form is abhorrent.  Government\u2019s approach to anti-discrimination law has been to set up expensive teams to ensure that the Departments do not fall foul of the discriminations laws, rather than having anti-discrimination as a culture within the Department.  A recent example is Job Centre plus which put a job advert on hold without telling the employer because the advert asked for drivers over 25 years old due to an insurance requirement. In order to get the job advert posted the Employer had to fill in a form and provide evidence of this.  The employer was told this was a requirement of Equality Act.  This is not strictly so.  It is an over interpretation of the Act by the Department for Work and Pensions, Operational Excellence Directorate, Social Justice Integration Division, Equality Legislation Team.  Such teams, organisation and departments within Central and Local Government need to be abolished.  They are expensive and a hindrance to the enterprise culture.",
