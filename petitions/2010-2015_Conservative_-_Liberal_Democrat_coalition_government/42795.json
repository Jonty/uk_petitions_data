        "additional_details": "I believe London Taxis should be put back under the control of The Metropolitan Police. Since TFL \"took over,\"  we have seen rapists allowed to do The Knowledge, touting by mini-cab drivers has increased dramatically, so has sexual assaults by said \"touts\", and we have seen the invention of \"Satellite Offices\", where mini-cabs can illegally \"rank\" outside venues. The old Public Carriage Office, (under Met' Police) not only used to test you on your knowledge of London, but also test the character of its candidates , something TFL, sadly, does not seem to do any more.\r\nThe Public Carriage Office, was once described as \"the last bastion of The British Empire\". The examiners (all ex-Police Officers) demanded respect, and got it, which in turn, made the candidates realise, that is the correct way to treat the public, with respect. Unfortunately, \"the bastion\" has been invaded by unknowledgeable civil servants.\r\nThank you for signing. ",
