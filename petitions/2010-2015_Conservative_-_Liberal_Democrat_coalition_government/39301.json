        "additional_details": "Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted, has said that inspectors would mark down schools that gave pay increases to teachers who were \"out the gate at 3 o'clock\".   This is both denigrating to teachers & potentially discriminatory to teachers who are also parents.   At the same time the Government is calling for teacher pay scales to be removed.  The enquiry should focus on whether Ofsted is operating independently from Government or following a Government agenda.    ",
