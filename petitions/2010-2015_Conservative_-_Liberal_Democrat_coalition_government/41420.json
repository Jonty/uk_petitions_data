This will allow the public to know the truth about the image. Hopefully preventing eating and weight disorders,Many weight issues are caused by the desire to be 'model thin \u2018. Young people in particular see these images of 'perfect' women, with 'perfect' hair and 'perfect' curves, they then aspire to mimic this false figure. Many people turn to crazy diets and even bulimia to achieve this goal. The determination to become 'perfect' results in eating disorders and even DEATH. We need to pull together as a society and prevent the next generation being forced into a world of misconceptions and lies. These lies are affecting people all around the world. Putting a logo onto these images will give young people the confidence they need in their own skin, knowing these images are not true and are unable to achieve. Saving lives and the next generation.",
