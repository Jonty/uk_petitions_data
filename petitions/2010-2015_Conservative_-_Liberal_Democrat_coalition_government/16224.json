        "additional_details": "One of the major reasons for todays economic and social ills is entrenched structural unemployment.  This needs to end.  All working-age, able bodied and minded people must take employment.  If long term unemployed refuse work, their benefits are stopped in total. Benefits must only be a 'bridge', not an alternative lifestyle. If there are not enough jobs, they are created - by the government and by incentives to the private sector.  There is enough work to be done in the country, and those out of work need to be brought into the economy and mainstream employment to do it.  This will involve costs, but they will be offset by savings in benefit payments, tax revenue from those formerly unemployed and their increased spending in the economy.  There is also a social need to eliminate the existance of an unemployed underclass for the good of the fabric of our society.",
