        "additional_details": "I as a parent who has lost a child through medical misdiagnosis/negligence hereby demand a law to be introduced forcing all medics of all ranks to listen and take action where necessary on the concerns voiced by the parents.                                    No amount of training, degrees or letters behind a medics name overrides the instincts of a mother.                                                          A mother\u2019s natural instincts must be listened to this will save lives of children dying needlessly of misdiagnosis/negligence.                                                                                                                     Had I been listened to and not just heard it is extremely and highly likely that my daughter would have survived. When a parent continuously takes their child to hospital with the same symptoms it is necessary and vital for medics not to dismiss but to take notice, Mother\u2019s Know their Child Best.",
