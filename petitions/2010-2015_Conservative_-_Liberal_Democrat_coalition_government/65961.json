This is absurd!\r\n\r\nUK intervention is paramount and is required  immediately. Send the Media, the troops, whoever and whatever so to stop the injustices that would not be tolerated elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost; the media must highlight the above. Secondly, the UK government must intervene and not remain oblivious and complicit.\r\n\r\n ",
