The process is time consuming and adds another cost to the NHS budget.\r\nAnti-microbial surfacing applies a layer of a microbe destroying solution to tools/surfaces that prevents the need for disinfection (as any harmful microbes are destroyed on contact).\r\nCross infections would drop dramatically by using this technology.\r\n\r\nIf curious, please google \"anti-microbial technology\".",
