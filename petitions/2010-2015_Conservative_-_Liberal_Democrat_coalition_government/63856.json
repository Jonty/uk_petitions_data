Avoid the risk of having the World Heritage Site status removed.  http://jurassiccoast.org/\r\n\r\nRecommend that Edward Davey the Secretary of State for Energy & Climate Change refuse planning permission for the construction the Navitus Bay Wind Farm who want to build 122 wind turbines 200m tall.\r\n\r\nRemove any subsidy for the building of the Navitus Bay Wind Farm.\r\n\r\nMake sure that that Navitus Bay are told they will not get any subsidy for providing power from the 8MW wind turbines.\r\n\r\nMake sure that Navitus Bay know they will only get paid the market rate for power that they actually provide to the National Grid.\r\n\r\nMake sure that Navitus Bay pay taxes to the UK government.\r\n\r\nSpend \u00a33 billion to make old property more efficient rather than subsidize a French and Dutch Company.",
