        "additional_details": "I belive that compulsory education for all ages could save lifes and money.\r\n\r\nthose in primary school  could learn about emotions and how best to cope positively with them.\r\n\r\nthose in high schools could  learn about different mental health conditions, how to spot them, how to support a friend, who to tell if they feel they have a mental health condition, the effect of stigma and discrimination and positive coping mechanisms.\r\n\r\nI personaly do this as a parth of my project, the black cat project. And i belove this can save lofes raise and awarness. No one should suffer in silence, and receive  the discrimination that so many with mental health problems.\r\n\r\nWe all have mental health and its just as important as our physical health. So let make a diffrence now for our future generations!\r\n\r\nwww.facebook.com/blackcatproject\r\n",
