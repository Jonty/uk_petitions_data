        "additional_details": "Formula 1 is a sport that is watched by millions of people in the United Kingdom and next season the coverage on the BBC will go down hill. This is because Sky now has a deal to broadcast the full season on pay-to-view channels. The BBC will only broadcast HALF of the season and that is not good enough for a sport that is watched by millions and some people class it as a British sport due to it starting in this country and due to the many teams that have their base in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe Sky coverage will have a different presenting and commentary team, and worst of all you will have to pay Rupert Murdoch hundreds of pounds per year for the privilege of watching it.\r\n\r\nFormula 1 should be kept on free-to-air channels. Not everyone can afford the Sky packages and it is a great shame millions of people will miss out on watching a FULL season of one of the greatest sports the UK has took part in. ",
