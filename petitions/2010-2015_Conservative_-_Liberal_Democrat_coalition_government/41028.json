It is responsibility of ICO to enforce the law\r\n\r\nICO has the power to fine companies up to \u00a3500,000 but this rarely happens as companies use legal loopholes to claim they are making legitimate calls\r\n\r\nDespite registering with TPS, people are still harrassed by sales calls without action being taken\r\n\r\nWhether its double glazing, PPI or energy grants - companies flout the law knowing they have little chance of being prosecuted\r\n\r\nSuch calls are a misery to those who receive them with some companies phoning the same number many times per day\r\n\r\nTPS is a toothless organisation which needs sweeping new powers and reform to reduce the number of unwanted calls and prosecute persistent offenders\r\n\r\nWe need new laws for TPS, ICO and OFCOM to tackle the problem",
