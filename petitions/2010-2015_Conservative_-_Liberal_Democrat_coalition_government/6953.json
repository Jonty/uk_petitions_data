Cheating on their expenses claims, unashamed sexual misbehaviour, deliberate infringements of the law, abuse of parliamentary privilege and general misuse of their position have ably demonstrated that they are, indeed, not honourable members of society.  They show no respect for the electorate, and their behaviour has led them into disrepute in the minds of the general public.",
