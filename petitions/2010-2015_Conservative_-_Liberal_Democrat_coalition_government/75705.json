        "additional_details": "'Affordable Rent' was introduced in 2011 which allows Housing Associations to charge up to 80% of private market rate.\r\n\r\nHowever, the rent is allowed to increase every 12 months above inflation, calculated at CPI+1%.\r\n\r\nIn the North West, this is resulting in rent increases up to 5 times faster than the local rate it is supposed to be no more than 80% of.\r\n\r\nThis is a scandal in the making as social housing costs are catching up to and will in the near future exceed the market it is supposed to be no more than 80% of.\r\n\r\nIt is pushing low paid workers into poverty and costing the tax payer a fortune as the housing benefit bill is soaring year on year ABOVE inflation!\r\n\r\nI am calling for this policy to be reviewed and social housing rent increases under the 'Affordable Rent' policy to be lowered to be more in line with the local market it is set against.  If the rent is set at 80%, then this should be consistent and move with that market.",
