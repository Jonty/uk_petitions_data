        "additional_details": "On the 15th August 2013 it was announced that a ban on HIV positive NHS staff carrying out medical procedures such as dentistry and surgery on patients is to be lifted. This has been welcomed by many HIV/aids charities.\r\n\r\nWe ask the government and namely the department for health to reconsider this decision. Although treatment for HIV has improved dramatically since the 1980's when this ban was created, the fact remains that transmission of the virus occurs through blood to blood or other bodily fluid transfers. In surgery or dentistry this would make it easily possible and highly likely that at some point somebody will pass on the virus to a HIV negative patient. This would be a disaster and something which is not even being considered by other comparable European countries.",
