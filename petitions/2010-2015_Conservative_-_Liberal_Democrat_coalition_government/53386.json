        "additional_details": "I am creating this petition to make the government rethink its policy on guaranteeing mortgage's.\r\n  If Government continues to believe this will boost our economy, it is wrong, It may, in the short term stimulate a small tax boost to the treasury but over a short period of around twenty months it will create a down fall,and have a negative effect on the economy. We need to be building houses, cheaper and bringing the cost down on our existing housing. There are options for this but firstly we need to stop fueling the fire of dept that the housing market put us in. For more info please support this petition,and I will get the details for consultation shortley    ",
