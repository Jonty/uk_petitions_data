Daily lives are being affected, people feel they are under an enforced curfew, crime is rising as a result, dog walkers can't see where to go, less abled people are severly compromised, road accidents will increase.Shift workers, late workers and all those returning home at night are affected. No light = accidents for pedestrians and drivers alike.\r\n\r\nOur Facebook group is the current focus of the campaign (ignore the title limiting to Hertsmere and Hertfordshire - facebook won't change it). This site has a huge resource of media information, scientific information and personal experiences.\r\n http://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/189605187792781/\r\n\r\nTHIS IS A 3 MONTH PETITION TO COINCIDE WITH LOCAL ELECTIONS IN MAY 2012.
