No doubt other supermarkets are following suit.\r\n\r\nTesco's slogan this year is \"Helping you [to] keep Christmas special\" but their opening hours are the exact opposite of this.  Their staff are no doubt being forced to work and there is no NEED to open this late.\r\n\r\nAll supermarkets should be limited to opening until 12.00 midday on Christmas Eve.  Customers and the staff could then spend the time as they please getting ready for Christmas.\r\n\r\nChristmas is about more than just shopping.",
