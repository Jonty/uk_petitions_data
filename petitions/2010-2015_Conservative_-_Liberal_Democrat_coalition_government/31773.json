        "additional_details": "Since Margaret Thatcher froze the pension increase that is paid to people receiving when they reach 80, it has stuck at 25p and continues to be awarded. This is added to a person's pension when they reach the age of 80. They are sent a letter to inform them of this. The paper in the letter and envelope cost's more than that. To those receiving Pension credit it only then get's recalculated and deducted from their money anyway. It's a disgrace and should be raised to a minimum of \u00a35 with immediate effect. Happy 80th Birthday. Please sign this e-petition to show your disapproval of such a 'slap in the face' pension increase. ",
