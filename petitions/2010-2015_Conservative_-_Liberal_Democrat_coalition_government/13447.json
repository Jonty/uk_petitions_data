        "additional_details": "Every year thousands of North American bears will be hunted and killed for their fur. They are lured with food before being shot, and those who are not killed outright are likely to die more slowly of their wounds or from starvation. This cruel hunt is supported by  taxpayers' money in order to provide bear fur for The Queen's Guards' ceremonial caps.\r\n\r\nWe wish to see faux-fur fabrics that look the same as the original but don't require the cruel killing of bears to replace bear fur. In this way, The Queen's Guards can keep tradition without cruelty.\r\n",
