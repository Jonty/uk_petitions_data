        "additional_details": "Food labeling in the United Kingdom should carry clear, front of package, carbohydrate information to allow diabetics, both type 1 and 2, to make an informed judgement when planning their meals. Carbohydrates play an integral part when calculating insulin to carb ratios. This will help countless individuals,who currently suffer from diabetes, in controlling their illness and lowering the impact of complications from poor control. This labeling should extend to menu boards in restaurants and fast food chains.",
