Save our Women's Aid!!\r\n\r\nNorth Ayrshire Women's Aid is the largest serving agency in Scotland and presently employs 32 staff in outreach, children's services and refuge for women fleeing domestic violence.\r\n\r\nOn the day that '16 Days of Action' begins, to raise awareness of violence against women and in support of Clare's Law, staff were told that the service would be going out to tender - cutting staffing levels from 32 to a possible 7 or 8 with the LOSS of specialist Children's workers.\r\n\r\nThis is a much needed service for women AND children - it isn't the largest in Scotland for nothing - and we want it to be FULLY staffed and equipped to deal with abuse.\r\n\r\nPlease help us raise awareness of how these cuts (austerity measures) affect families, directly affect children and can have a huge impact on the safety of women.\r\n\r\nJoin our Facebook Campaign to add your voice;\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SaveNAWomensAid/timeline",
