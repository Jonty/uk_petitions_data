David Cameron is complicit in the facilitation of continuing deaths of individuals in Africa through his refusal to stop foreign aid payments to despots who buy bombs and bullets with our taxpayer pounds and now he personally contributes to the death of patients being treated in NHS hospitals through refusing to stop gagging order payments.  David Cameron needs to be put on trial as an accessory before the fact of mass murder.  If there is a God he soon will be.",
