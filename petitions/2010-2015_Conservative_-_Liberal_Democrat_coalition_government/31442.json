        "additional_details": "Change the Guilty Plea system to prevent Court and Jury Time wasting.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Public are attending Jury Service to do their Civic Duty and most of their time is being wasted. This is due to Defendants pleading guilty at the last possible moment. This means that the time of at least 15 Jury Members and Court Support Staff has been wasted. It is proposed that a 'Guilty' or 'Not Guilty' plea is heard between 14 and 28 days before the Crown Court will fully sit. Creating a 'Freeze' time. If a 'Not Guilty' plea is entered, it cannot be withdrawn within 'Freeze' time, and the case will be heard. This should save both the Ministry Of Justice and UK Industry a significant amount of time and money, as currently approximately 200,000 Jurers are being called each year.",
