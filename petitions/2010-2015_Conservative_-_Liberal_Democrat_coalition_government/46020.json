        "additional_details": "Pregnant women workers are rightly protected by law to enable them to attend antenatal appointments without loss of income. This enables them to attend the appointments at 12 and 20 weeks pregnant, when they will have an ultrasound scan.\r\n\r\nSeveral government agencies, including the former department for trade and industry, have supported fathers who also want to attend these appointments.\r\n( http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file20795.pdf )\r\n\r\nHowever, fathers remain unprotected by the law and it is possible for them to be prevented from attending these appointments by their employer.\r\n\r\nThis is not the 1950s. The law is sexist and should be changed to include expectant fathers.",
