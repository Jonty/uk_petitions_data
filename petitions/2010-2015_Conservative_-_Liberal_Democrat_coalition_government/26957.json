        "additional_details": "Eastenders is directly responsible for many of today's social issues. It clearly depicts rape, drug abuse, murder, suicide, violence, prostitution, sex, and use of weapons.\r\nIf any of these were to be shown in a film, it would have to be shown after the 9pm watershed, yet for some reason Eastenders gets away with it. I believe this is because the BBC is aware that it's ratings come from children, who watch Eastenders to feel grown-up.\r\nAnyone who should be subject to such adult content will be able to watch after 9pm when children are in bed.
