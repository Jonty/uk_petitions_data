        "additional_details": "This petition is to ask the Government for help to limit the amount of time children spend daily on electronic devices (e.g. iPods/iPads) and smart phones. This is so there is a reduction in any potential detrimental impact they may have on children's social and educational development.\r\n\r\nAnecdotally, many parents complain that their children have been affected by them, and indeed is the main cause of arguments in the family.  Issues about their usage include; Becoming 'obsessed' with using them; Finding it difficult to concentrate on other activities when having access to them; Displaying limited interest in other activities; Having a limited written and verbal vocabulary. This is due to the 'reduced' style in which many post messages trough social media; Becoming overly focused on 'self' as a result it the cultural obsession with taking pictures of oneself an posting on social media (referred to as 'selfies')\r\n\r\n",
