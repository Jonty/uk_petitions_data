It is clear that children growing up without fathers are more vulnerable because of the many positive contributions that available, engaged and committed fathers make to children.\r\n>Analysis of 4,000 young offenders by the Youth Justice Board found that 70 per cent were from non-intact families.\r\n\r\nChildren need fathers and fathers need legal aid to assist them in gaining and reinforcing contact.\r\n",
