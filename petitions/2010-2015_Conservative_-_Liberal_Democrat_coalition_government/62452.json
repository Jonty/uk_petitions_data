        "additional_details": "The government should encourage the building of whole new towns with good community facilities, infrastructure and road links instead of relaxing planning laws to allow developers to build large developments which spoil existing towns and villages.\r\n\r\nAt the moment local authority housing targets and new planning laws mean that developers are being allowed to add hundreds of houses to small villages and towns. As a result the nature of our countryside is being changed for ever.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and stop our towns, villages and countryside being spoilt for ever.\r\n\r\n",
