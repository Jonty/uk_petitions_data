This was a political act by Labour and should be stopped immediately.  Tax payer\u2019s money should not be used to fund the financial wing of the Labour party.  These are the same Unions going on strike to force the tax payer to pay for their Golden Pensions, they should pay for their own pensions like the rest of us.\r\n\r\nThe Government should force the Unions to return the funds they have been given.\r\n",
