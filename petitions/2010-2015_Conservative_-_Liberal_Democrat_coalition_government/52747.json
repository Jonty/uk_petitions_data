        "additional_details": "There is a campaign to impose blanket  20 mph speed limits across the country on all residential and minor roads. This is based on the idea that the slower we drive the fewer serious accidents will occur. Of course if the limit was 10 mph, 5mph or even better that we were banned from using cars altogether road traffic incidents would become zero.\r\n\r\nThis is another attempt to prevent us using our own intelligence and discrimination as we go about our daily lives, in this case as motorists. The 30mph limit has been in effect for decades and has proven suitable for residential areas. The people who drive recklessly and cause accidents will continue to do so whatever the speed limit sign.\r\n\r\nThis petition asks that the current 30mph speed limit be retained for all residential and minor roads except for special cases such as  accident black spots or areas of specific risk such as outside of schools where there is a proven case for a reduced speed limit.\r\n",
