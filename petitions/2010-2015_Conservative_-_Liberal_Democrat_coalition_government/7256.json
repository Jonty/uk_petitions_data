        "additional_details": "The recent handling of riots/protests leave a lot to be desired. My view, which i feel is echoed throughout the country, is those who participate in damaging riotous behaviour need to be stopped. The Police force are either scared to act with appropriate force, or do not have the power. I am petitioning for the Government to discuss the powers riot Police have during incidents, and the force is given the authority to act. I also wish to see the Government show some allegiance to the people of the UK who wish to see a harder approach in dealing with these incidents. A terrorist in the UK is dealt with swiftly. Why are the participants in the recent riots seen any differently when they are firebombing people's homes? ",
