Not only are you awarded with an income that the majority of the population can only dream about, but the expenses that are claimed are adding a massive cherry on the big-pocketed, tight-fisted and selfish cake that many of them take second-helpings from, and, unfortunately, these people represent our views and direction that the country will move in. (The amount of Millionaires in Parliament should be setting off alarm bells to the rest of us in the real world),\r\n\r\nBy reducing the financial allowances that an MP has the luxury of, hopefully this will work towards creating a Government that is comprised of individuals who care about Politics and the British population more than themselves.\r\n\r\n",
