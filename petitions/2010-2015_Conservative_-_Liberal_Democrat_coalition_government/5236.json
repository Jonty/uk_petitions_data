        "additional_details": "Access to university should be a right, not a privilege. The idea of \u00a39000 tuition fees is one that is again, an ideological adventure into ending education for all and giving it to the elite few.\r\n\r\nIf no fees have to be paid at Scottish universities, then why can't it be done over the border in England? It is unequal, unfair and an outrageous imbalance.\r\n\r\nDon't lump our students and future generations with 10's of thousands of pounds worth of debt. Invest in their future, create an education that goes on for as long as is wanted and abolish tuition fees.",
