        "action": "Renationalization of the UK rail network",
        "additional_details": "This Petition states that the privatization of the UK rail network in 1993 was a major error of judgement and has resulted in an overly complex and fragmented organizational system and fare charging structure.\r\n\r\nThat privatization of the rail network has compromized safety standards, increased fares, the level of government subsidy, and delayed essential improvements in the UK's national rail infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThat in view of the above, the UK government should enact legislation to return both the national rail infrastructure and the train operating companies to full public ownership under a single unified organisational structure.",
