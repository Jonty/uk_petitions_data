        "additional_details": "This Channel 4 programme discussed how the betting shops spread on the high streets of the UK and their negative impact on society. http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/4od/\r\nThe programme presents studies showing that betting shops dominate high streets of mainly poor areas attracting anti social behaviour and high levels of crime and thus higher cost of Policing. It is also worth mentioning that the punters in most of these poor areas of high unemployment are usually using their benefits to bet. It is a situation where the tax payer is almost funding betting companies. Benefits should be used to support families, to help people to get back to employment. Benefits should not be funnelled to betting companies helping them make billions.\r\nPlanning Laws should be tightened. The Benefits system shouldn't allow taxpayers money to be wasted on funding gambling habits of many.",
