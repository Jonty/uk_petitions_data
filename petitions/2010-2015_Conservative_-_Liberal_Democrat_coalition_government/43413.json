Recent studies show that three out of every four people who accept these alter T&C have not actually read them.\r\n\r\nI hereby petition the UK government to bring in legislation that forces such companies operating in the UK to, in addition to the current method of presenting the updated T&Cs, provide a brief document showing exactly what has been changed in these T&Cs verbatim, and where this new wording can be found in the T&Cs. So that users are provided an extra level of awareness to exactly what they are agreeing.",
