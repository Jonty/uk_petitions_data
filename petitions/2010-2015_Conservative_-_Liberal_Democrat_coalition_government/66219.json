        "additional_details": "Driven grouse shooting protects the environment and maintains stocks of wild birds due to the efforts of Gamekeepers.If it was not for Gamekeepers and believe it or not, grouse shooting they would be very rare indeed.\r\nAccording to Wikipeadia 2014 -\r\nReasons for the decline include loss of heather due to overgrazing, creation of new conifer plantations and a decline in the number of upland gamekeepers. Some predators such as the hen harrier feed on grouse and there is ongoing controversy as to what effect these have on grouse numbers.\r\nTherefore please sign this petition to ensure driven grouse shooting is maintained and this will protect the grouse numbers in turn.\r\nI would like the government to make a law to protect driven game shooting as a rural pursuit and to enshrine the gamekeepers role in law.",
