Increases road rage.\r\n\r\nFor safety sakes, you should always keep a distance between you and the vehicle in front of you of AT LEAST one car length per every 10 mph that you're driving. For example if you're driving 60 mph, make sure there is at least six car lengths (about 80 ft, if not a little more) between your car and the one in front of you.\r\n\r\nWe need enforcement and we need a specific law, so drivers are prosectured for this?",
