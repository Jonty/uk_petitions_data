        "additional_details": "This is a simple petition to restrict the sale of 'loud' fireworks to professional displays only.\r\n\r\nExtremely loud fireworks start being used weeks before bonfire night , and in some cases go on for weeks afterwards. This directly affects people's well being.\r\n\r\nPet owners , the elderly and children all suffer unnecessarily due to these ongoing extremely loud fireworks.\r\n\r\nIt is my suggestion that retailers are only allowed to sell 'quiet' fireworks to the general public. Thus still allowing an enjoyable bonfire night without disturbing the peace.\r\n\r\nCurrently the sound limit for fireworks is 120db , which is the equivalent of sitting on the front row of a rock concert. At 132db eardrum vibration becomes noticeable. Hearing damage starts at 85db.\r\n\r\n",
