        "additional_details": "Over recent years many serious crimes such as torture and killing of children have resulted in shorter sentences than would be given for the equivalent crime against an adult. Adults involved in such cases are often charged with failure to protect a child unless there is absolute proof of exactly who killed or harmed the child. If adults are living in the same household in which an adult is tortured or killed, all those who may have been involved are often charged with more serious offences, and adults can be seen as aiding an abetting a serious crime.\r\nThere are many similar examples of the low sentances passed in the Baby Peter case in the news. Ask the Government to investigate why there are such discrepancies in the sentances given, and why identical crimes against children and adults result in such different outcomes.    ",
