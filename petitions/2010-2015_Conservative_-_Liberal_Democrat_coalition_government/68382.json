The economic situation for the ordinary citizen becomes increasingly difficult to manage. The only solution to this crisis in this situation is to keep prices absolutely stable.\r\nTherefore, the government should aim for price stability and set the inflation target to 0.00%.\r\nTo clarify, I mean the inflation target, which is set by the goverment and not interest rate, which is set by the BoE (http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/framework/framework.aspx)",
