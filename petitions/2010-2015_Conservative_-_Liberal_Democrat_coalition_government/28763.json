        "additional_details": "Some judgements by ECHR & aspects of treaties in which UK is a signatory are not in UK\u2019s best interests & contrary to wishes of Westminster Parliament.  Constitutional Law stresses that Westminster Parliament is supreme sovereign & cannot bind future Parliament. Westminster Parliament can legislate on any matter whatsoever (including retrospective legislation). Perhaps Human Rights Act, EU Charter of Fundamental Rights & the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees should be repealed & replaced with a British Bill of Rights. We did NOT have a referendum on the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, which gave effect to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Article 2 of the Charter provides that \u201ceveryone has the right to life\u201d The abolition of the death penalty is a key objective for the European Union\u2019s human rights policy. Often illegal immigrants cannot be deported from UK as it was ruled contrary to Article 8 which provides him with 'a right to private and family life'. ",
