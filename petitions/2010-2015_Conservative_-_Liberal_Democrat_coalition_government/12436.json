        "additional_details": "The government should tackle \"gang\" culture in all its forms; \"gangs\" include groups of companies coming together for a specific purpose. For example, the recent price hikes in utilities prices by the major energy suppliers leave those already without sufficient funds (e.g. pensioners) at risk of greater poverty. As people need these services and they have no other means of securing gas/electricity, this should be classed as a crime tackled in the same way that other \"gang\" related issues are; criminally. The government may wish to appoint a specialist advisor to deal with this looting.  ",
