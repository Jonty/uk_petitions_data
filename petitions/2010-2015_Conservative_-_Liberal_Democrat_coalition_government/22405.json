        "additional_details": "Energy companies need to offer capped energy tarrifs for people on benefits, the disabled, the elderly and people on low incomes. The price paid for energy should be a set percentage of their total income no matter how much they use. This would not only ensure the elderly and the disabled don't die of hypothermia, but also to make sure those on low incomes don't have to choose between heating and food. In a country where every house in the country has access to hot & cold running water, warmth and heating, we still have thousands of people dying every year because they cannot afford the exorbitant prices that the share-holders of these energy companies demand for something which, in the 21st century should be a fundimental human right - the right to keep warm in your own home.",
