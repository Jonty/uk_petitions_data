        "additional_details": "I propose that the DfT further subsidises train travel in the UK, particularly for students still in compulsory education, as it is an environmentally friendly method of public transport. This could be made possible by imposing fuel tax/VAT on air travel, which is one of the least environmentally friendly ways of travelling.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the government should aim to reduce the disparity in ticket prices between train companies, as noted here: http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/02/rail-fair-increases-commuter-routes\r\n\r\nThis caught my attention when searching for a train ticket that it was over \u00a310 cheaper to get a coach to London then fly to Leeds from Heathrow than it was for me to get a train ticket from Kent to Leeds with the applicable railcards. Travelling by train instead of plane would save 17.53kg in Carbon Dioxide emissions.",
