The results provided in Trusts are not independent.\r\n\r\nPublic Health England is the only public organisation that could run all Microbiology laboratories in England and provide their service to all public bodies, the private and academic sector\r\n\r\nThe following could be achieved if all health microbiology laboratories were transferred to Public Health England\r\n\r\n(i) independence and confidence in respect of the results\r\n\r\n(ii) rationalisation of microbiology in the UK releasing cash in NHS Trust's to front line services\r\n\r\n(iii) world class microbiology facilities\r\n",
