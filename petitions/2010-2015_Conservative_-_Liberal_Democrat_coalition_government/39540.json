        "additional_details": "Local Government is experiencing almost a third cut in funding from the Conservative-led Government. This has led to service reductions and the situation is becoming a national emergency.\r\n\r\nLocal Government is being asked to find savings that far outweigh Government expenditure reductions in other areas. In 2014/15 there will be a 0.6% reduction in public expenditure but Local Government will experience a cut 9 times higher.\r\n\r\nLocal Government has been providing its share of deficit reduction but the Conservative-led Government is using deficit panic to attack public services.\r\n\r\nAt the 2010 General Election no party won. The Conservative-led Government has no mandate for their destructive course of action and the Government only exists because of choices made by the Liberal Democrats.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call for a parliamentary debate on the issue that leads to a change in direction.\r\n\r\nEnough is enough.",
