        "additional_details": "In my personal opinion the House of Lords should be abolished. The pressures on local government from central government mean that soon councils will be unable to provide services like road maintenance or children's centres or be made bankrupt .The lords is an antiquated retirement home for lords .The money saved from the closures of the lords should therefore go straight into local government and councils across the UK. I ask if my E-Petition is successful that this issue be debated in the house of commons.",
