        "additional_details": "It is proposed to site another waste disposal dump in Park Royal near to residential housing.  This will generate more unealthy air pollution and heavy traffic.  We already have two which are Powerday and Quattro.  Park Royal is no longer just an industrial area.  More residential accomodation is being built.  We also have a hospital sited in this area.  Nobody is checking our air quality which is already very poor.  Future generations need to be protected and there should not be more than one of these sites in this area.  In fact there should be none at all. We want to stop this dump and protect ours and our children's health.  Waste disposal dumps and incinerators should be sited on land where there are no houses.",
