        "additional_details": "The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority does very little in terms of providing clarity to the public tax payers.  We need to see some real transparancy with regular publications and in particular regarding expense payments to MP's.  Further we need methods and accountability incorporated to avoid scandals and satisfy the British public.  Members governing the replacement should encompass various areas of expertise including accountants and lawyers.  In addition a report should be made available monthly in parliament outlining achievments. ",
