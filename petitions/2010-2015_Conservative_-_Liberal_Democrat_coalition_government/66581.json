Every security officer should be armed so it's a fair fight against any armed threat allowing security to shoot on site of threat and shoot to kill. People that send threats to our country or attack our country don't deserve a life in our society. None of us real British people don't want no weak minded British persons who took them selfs to join jihadist groups back in our British country.",
