        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the Government to incorporate a full eye test as a compulsory part of national driving tests.  Research has revealed that a third of UK drivers admit to having sight problems behind the wheel. A further one in five have been involved in at least one driving related incident due to poor vision, such as damaging their vehicle or a more serious road crash. Having seen the devastating effect that road crashes can have on people\u2019s lives, we request the Government take action in order to cut the number of serious road incidents from visually impaired drivers.",
