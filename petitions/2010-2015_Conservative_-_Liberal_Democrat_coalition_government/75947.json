        "additional_details": "Vegetarians don't like meat - I think that's a fact everyone can agree with, yet they continue to use meat related product names to describe their quorn produce.\r\n\r\nTake for example the 'Quorn meat free chicken nuggets' - its never seen a chicken in its life and if it had, vegetarians would no longer be interested!\r\n\r\nWhen was the last time you had a meaty carrot steak or a meaty cabbage nugget? Would you be happy if you ordered a salad from your local pub only to find out that all the vegetables were in fact derived from meat?\r\n\r\nI believe that the government should ban this confusing product naming scheme, stop the false advertising, and force the companies that make vegetarian foods to come up with their own names for stuff.",
