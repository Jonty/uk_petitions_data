        "additional_details": "The time has come to simplify the UK tax regime . PAYE doesn't work, other initiatives can be evaded by cash in hand workers or those that set up companies within the UK or in tax friendly environments. However, we all have to buy goods and services. So my proposal is to scrap income tax totally and apply VAT at a rate say 30%  - those on benefits have a swipe card reducing the payment due. You can't evade a purchase tax!",
