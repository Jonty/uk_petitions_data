        "additional_details": "I find that over the past 50 years more and more aid is given to countries in the form of money or goods.  Has it worked? At the same time our armed forces are being cut to save money but aid is increased.  Why not scrap the aid budget and pass it to our forces and offer our forces instead.  If a developing country needs water, then use the army, they have engineers and the equipment to help.  At the same time this promotes our country as forces that protect and help people.  Aid is not about money, its about helping people.  Our forces can help these people in need.",
