        "additional_details": "Make all state schools secular.\r\n\r\nA balanced overview of all faiths, and no faith, should be given in all state funded schools. Religious instruction should be given outside of the education system.\r\n\r\nState funded religious schools legally discriminate against persons not of their beliefs. Children are forced to travel past local schools to a non discriminatory school; undertake enforced religion via their agnostic parents becoming temporarily believers and 'church' attenders; or suffer enforced religious instruction against their own different belief/non belief system.\r\n\r\nSee article by Victoria Richards in The Independent 11th June 2014.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition today to promote non discrimination, free thinking and tolerance in our state education.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
