        "additional_details": "North West Action for Animals are calling for a review of current dog breeding legislation. Under current legislation, any person who keeps a breeding establishment for dogs at any premises and carries on at those premises a business of breeding dogs for sale must obtain a licence from the local council. Those people who are not in the business of breeding dogs for sale, so called \u201chobby breeders\u201d, and produce less than 5 litters in any period of 12 months do not need a licence.We would like to see licensing provisions extended to cover 'pet' dogs, prohibiting the breeding of any dog without a license. We believe this will help with: 1) Dangerous breed population control. 2) Stray and unwanted dog numbers and collection costs to LAs. 3) Reducing numbers of animal welfare and neglect offences. 4) Overall welfare of dogs used to breed from.
