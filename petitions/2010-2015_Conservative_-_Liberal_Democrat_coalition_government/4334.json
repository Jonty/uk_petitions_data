        "additional_details": "Robert Gabriel Mugabe was once hailed a hero and liberator by much of the free world. Far from being the saviour we all presumed he would be, Mugabe has driven his country to the point of destruction. Despite the recent economic growth in Zimbabwe, hyperinflation as ravaged the market to the point that the Zimbabwean dollar has now been completely scrapped. Add this to Mugabe's distinctly racist policies of land reform, uncomprimsing views of homosexuality, inability to control the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and continued physical supression of political opponents, this supposed hero is nothing but a tyrant. Given the recent uprisings across Africa and the Middle East, we the people believe it is morally and constitutionally right for Parliament to debate whether or not Britain should instigate the immediate deposition of Mugabe and the disbandment of his ruling Political party.",
