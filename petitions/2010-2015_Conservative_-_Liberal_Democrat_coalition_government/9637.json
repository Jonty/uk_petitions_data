        "additional_details": "As many between the ages of 18-23, unemployed and on benefit find themselves drifting into crime and gang culture especially in larger cities. Isnt it about time that the UK Government introdued mandatory 2 year national service conscription for those not employed or in full time education. Those non UK nationals who wish to come to this country yet cannot find empoyment or wish to take advantge of the UK benefit system would also qualify to be included. Other major trading partners and allies of the UK operate a conscription scheme, why not here in the UK? Conscripts would not provide any front line service but would however recieve basic military training and would be used to provide domestic 'security services' as back up to the Police etc (example Policing Football Matches instead of Police Force) and would provide services to the local community following national and local government initiatives.",
