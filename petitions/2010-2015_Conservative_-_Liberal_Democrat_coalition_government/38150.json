        "additional_details": "Although we are told that Maternity Allowance has to be applied to through Jobcentre Plus, there is no people physically to talk to other than over the phone.\r\n\r\nYou have to wait at least two weeks for any response, and then if its rejected you have to wait another two weeks on top of that to receive any information.\r\n\r\nThis petition says that people are not given enough support and help in claiming, which has led to much stress and worry.\r\n\r\nWe need to be able to talk to people face to face, and we need to somehow get the turnaround time reduced. Presence should be given in centres.\r\n\r\nPeople have to pay rent and bills and cannot do so easily at all on the current process.",
