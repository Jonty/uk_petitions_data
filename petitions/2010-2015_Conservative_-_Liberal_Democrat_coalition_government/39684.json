Whilst the Police have developed sophisticated ways to detect crimes, the law has fallen short in preventing crimes such as child murder, child rape and Murder of Police Officers from taking place. Police have the right to keep the Queen's Peace and Children have the right to play without fear of who is watching them. For those intent of committing such crimes, it will act to deter them if they knew the consequences of their actions will result in a death sentence. Equally, if we do nothing, then what message are we sending to the people we most need to protect?",
