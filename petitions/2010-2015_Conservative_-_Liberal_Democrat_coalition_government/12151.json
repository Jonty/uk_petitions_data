An hourly rate, set independently, every year (by the GLA in London). It is calculated according to cost of living and gives the minimum pay rate required for a worker to provide their family with the essentials of life.\r\nIn London the current rate is \u00a38.30 per hour.\r\nOutside of London the current rate is \u00a37.20.\r\n\r\n(Ref: http://www.citizensuk.org/campaigns/living-wage-campaign/ )\r\n\r\nI would also like to see the government remove age discrimination in the application of the minimum wage.",
