        "additional_details": "In 2010 a number of small British based oil exploration companies started exploring for oil in the waters off the Falkland Islands and there are now plans to produce oil from 2016.\r\n\r\nWe call on the UK government to support the islands by investing financially in the emerging oil industry.\r\n\r\nThe government has supported the banks when they failed, it is time that the government supports businesses that succeed.\r\n\r\nThe success means the government will make a return on its investment that will be essential in contributing to the British economy, supporting public services and getting on top of our financial deficit.\r\n\r\nWe therefore ask the government to take a position in providing financial support to Rockhopper Exploration and look to support the other publicly listed companies exploring for oil in British waters in the South Atlantic in ways that it sees fit.\r\n\r\nSuch an investment would make long term financially prudent sense.\r\n",
