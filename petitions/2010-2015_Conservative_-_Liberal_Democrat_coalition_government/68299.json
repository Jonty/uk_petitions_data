        "additional_details": "The British Government has not yet gone beyond calling for a ceasefire and appears to regard the Israeli attacks on Gaza as justifiable. They are not. The Israeli attacks are indiscriminate and have already killed over 1000 civilians. Schools and hospitals have been among the targets, on the dubious pretext that Hamas is shielding behind these. Even if this is the case it is immoral that that children and hospital patients should be made to suffer and die because of this. There is considerable evidence of a lucrative arms trade between UK companies and the Israeli military. In the cause of humanity this must now cease. ",
