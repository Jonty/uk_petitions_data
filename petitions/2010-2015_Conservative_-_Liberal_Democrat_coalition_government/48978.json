        "additional_details": "For many years now animal welfare organisation's in the UK have campaigned, fought and made significant progress in the way animals are treat.\r\nHowever' in this ever shrinking world and with globalisation, we the British people can not be sure that animal welfare in other countries is comparable to ours.\r\nWe therefore propose an outright ban on the sale of all fur goods, be it a full length garment or fur trimmed gloves or shoes.\r\nThis will ensure that Britain is not being complicit in the suffering of animals at home and abroad.\r\nWe need to be world leaders in animal welfare and the environment.",
