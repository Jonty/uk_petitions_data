        "additional_details": "I would like Parliament to debate if there are sufficient independent controls and checks in place to ensure quality objectives of the DWP are met.  In particular I would like Parliament to debate the implications of the minutes of the GMC Investigation Committee which considered the case of Dr Mallios dated 4 October 2010, the response by Jane O'Brien, Assistant Director, Standards & Fitness to Practise Directorate GMC to the letter \"Getting welfare to work: Health professionals\u2019 advice: the ethics\" By Edward S Cooper, BMJ 2011;342:doi:10.1136/bmj.d1155 (Published in the BMJ 22 February 2011) and the record of Atos supplying GP services in Tower Hamlets.\r\n\r\nI would like Parliament to debate whether the reasons for the failure of the DWP to audit Atos and to allow Atos to police itself (Independent Tier) and ignore the NAO recommended procedure can be justified considering the desire by Parliament, often expressed, for value for money, for accountability and for transparency.",
