Other nations seem to have stronger mechanisms to deal with such criminals with more vigor. Shops & private property have been vandalized as well as police officers injured, it is now time to cast aside human rights worries. So the police should procure items such as tear gas, water cannon and potentially rubber bullets. In order to deter and deal with such occurences if and when they occur again.  ",
