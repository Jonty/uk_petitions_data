        "additional_details": "The Police should - in law - be granted immunity where persons known or strongly believed to possess a lethal weapon (firearm, knife, crossbow, attack dogs, etc.) are killed by Police in the reasonable course of carrying out their duty to protect the public.  This should not be conditional upon actual or attempted use of the weapon.\r\n\r\nConcealed firearms, for example, tend to be unlicensed, illegally converted, and held by persons of known criminal associations.  There is no justification for a \"normal, family man\" to be armed, so the presumption must be that they intend it to use the weapon.  Requiring Police to wait until it is simply puts brave officers in unnecessary danger.  Put the responsibility and blame where it lies: with the criminal causing the situation, not the officers society expects to stop and arrest them.",
