        "additional_details": "My aim is to get back the Lido (outdoor pool) that once sat at the foot of Waterloo lake roundhay park Leeds. Many have amazing summer memories from this place and I want to bring it back, our children deserve to indulge in the fun my parents and grand parents once had and many others in a safe environment. I have no doubt this would also save lives of those children who have gone to enjoy the sun in our beautiful inland waters and Have lost their lives . My step son David Cullen lost his life to Waterloo lake n 2005 with a friend and I want to prevent this happening again and I think this is the answer too a lot of our problems that and water safety activities that could be done here too. Please join me and sign this petition today. Thank you",
