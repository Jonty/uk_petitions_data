        "additional_details": "The people of Scotland have been allowed a referendum over their future as part of the UK, despite the fact that parliament had no mandate for this.  The debate over Scotland's inclusion in the UK is one to be decided by the people of the UK, and not Scotland alone.  A Scottish referendum over their continued inclusion in the UK, should have been opened to the UK at large. With this in mind, the whole of the UK should be allowed to vote for the continued participation of Scotland in the UK, regardless of the outcome of the Scottish referendum.",
