No loaner deserves unlimited ever-increasing amounts from a loan to the destruction of the borrow who has paid back many times over but cannot overcome the interest.\r\nThis would also have the effect of making loaners careful to lend to those who can repay.\r\nThis rule should not depend on the amount borrowed. This would also help out impoverished countries who have paid their debt many times over but are crushed by the interest.\r\nExact details can be decided by consultation.",
