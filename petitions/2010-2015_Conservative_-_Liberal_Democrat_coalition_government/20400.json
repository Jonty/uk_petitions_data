        "additional_details": "I propose a solution which makes it either a legal requirement on all telephone networks in the UK to provide all consumers with a service that allows them to block any specific number from calling or texting them, or encourages all telephone networks in the UK to offer this service voluntarily.\r\nMY proposal would be that consumers would be able to block\r\n\u2022\tAll withheld numbers from calling their number if they wish.\r\n\u2022\tSpecific withheld numbers, by dialling a code into their phone after receiving a call from a withheld number. (This would work because all though the recipient does not know the number calling them, the telephone network does).\r\n\u2022\tCreate a block list of numbers.\r\nThe exception to this would be that certain official government telephone numbers could not be blocked, such as the police and other government enforcement bodies.\r\n",
