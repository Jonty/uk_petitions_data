        "additional_details": "This petition would like the Government to take action on encouraging investment in Hydrogen fuelling stations. Hydrogen is one of the fuels of the future for vehicles, and it is vital that investment is made by the Government along with companies like Shell etc. to fund fuel stations of the future. Electric cars have had investment in infrastructure which is good, however, there needs to be investment in this technology as well.",
