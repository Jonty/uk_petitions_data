        "additional_details": "The current benefits system is wrong. If you don't work or have never worked you get more benefit and help than someone who has worked and has lost their Job.\r\n\r\nThis is the wrong way round. Families who work and lose their jobs have more to lose and end up getting penalised for having work as opposed to families that just live off the state.\r\nIf you don't work you will get more benefit and help and someone like myself who has a baby coming next month and cannot claim for any benefit assistance due to getting made redundant. I could lose everything because I can't pay my mortgage etc but others who cream the system are well taken care off.\r\n\r\nPlease put hard working families first and lazy people should only get the minimum financial support to force them to get work.",
