We value the Scottish contribution to a great and historical Union between our individual countries. It has bought our great and proud nations closer together and it has helped the countries of Scotland, England, Wales and  Northern Ireland to enjoy the benefits of an ever closer, peaceful and successful Union. Together, the United Kingdom has a significant place at the table of world affairs and our influence is greater together than apart. We respect your freedom and right to choose for yourself but we the citizens of England, Wales and Northern Ireland thank the Scottish people for being a part of our Union and appeal to you to stay with us as a United Kingdom for we are stronger together than if we are apart. We would like the Scottish people to stay together in the Union and to say \"No\" to independence.",
