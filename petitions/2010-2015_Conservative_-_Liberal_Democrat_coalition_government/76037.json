        "additional_details": "At the end of the London 2012 Olympics, the government made a promise for a lifelong legacy of Sport. Fast forward to 2015 and the government are standing idly by while schools slash the amount of curriculum PE time to focus on their Maths and English results. Not only does this fly in the face of the lifelong legacy promise, but writes off a lot of pupils who's only outlet, and way into school is through sport. Please sign this petition to the government to bring back a minimum of 2 hours statutory curriculum PE at Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4.",
