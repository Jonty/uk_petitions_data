        "additional_details": "Great Britain should not pay the new EU \u00a31.7 billion demand. The EU have suggested that because GB has a stronger and better run economy then we should contribute even more money. Surely,they cannot expect the hard and successful efforts of the GB to be diluted amongst the other 27 EU states. Surely we should not be seen to condone economic and social failure of the other EU states.\r\nThe original common market was set up to remove trading barriers and not to give free handouts to countries with poor management skills and an inability to control their own tax affairs.\r\nThis demand for money off the UK is timed as a slap in the face for Cameron.\r\nIts time we slapped the EU in the face and turned our back on its loony biased ideas.\r\nI request the UK government  NOT TO PAY this outrageous demand and let the EU raise their own members taxes if they need more money in Brussels ",
