        "additional_details": "For years now mothers have been given automatic rights to keep children in broken relationships however there seems to be a growing amount that feel that they can use this as a tool to prevent any kind of access for fathers.\r\nI am currently experiencing this issue where the mother seems to put every brick wall possible in front of me to prevent me seeing my daughter including asking me to remove my name off birth certificate, but when it suits her i.e when questioned she states that I dont try enough for access but unfortunatley the law wont allow me otherwise I end up breaking the law myself.\r\nThe government needs to address this matter and have this issue dealt with quickly rather than going through solicitors, mediation etc the process is too long and I feel that the matter should be dealt with directly with the court i.e once relationship ends apply directly to the court for hearing and to gain access rights.",
