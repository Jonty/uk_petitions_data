        "additional_details": "Over the last few years eBay has brought into practice a number of policies that are abusive to the integrity of distance selling. Its feedback and DSR policy is coercive and its buyer resolution service both in the eBay and PayPal consoles lacks impartiality and transparency.There are currently over 14m registered active users of eBay within the UK. Despite the fact that eBay.co.uk is designed and set up to serve the UK, UK users have little or no protection via UK regulatory authorities. It is my proposal that eBay and Paypal should be regulated within the UK. That regulatory authority should have the power to investigate all aspects of their operations and if those policies are found to be unfair should have the power to force eBay to make changes. The regulatory authority should also be required to act on individual complaints and provide documented resolutions for those complaints. I hear people complaining about eBay all the time. Now is your chance to do something about it.",
