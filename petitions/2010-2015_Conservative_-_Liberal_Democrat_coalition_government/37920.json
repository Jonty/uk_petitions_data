        "additional_details": "For example the M3 (and M27) gives access to Portsmouth and the M23 gives access to Brighton, but the A27, the road between these cities, is inadequate and, in parts, dangerous. Building motorway to fill this gap would provide good local benefits, better utilise the M3 and M23, and reduce pressure on the M25. In other words, completing this part of the network would have far-reaching advantages, incur relatively low costs and represent value for money. Other opportunities, similar to this example, can be found throughout Britain.",
