As far as I am aware, these areas do not get cleaned so the rubbish that people very kindly throw out of their car windows just accumulates. This is not only unsightly but presents a risk to local wildlife.\r\n\r\nCriminals who are sentenced to community service could clean these areas up. I have no doubt that, with all the rubbish we have, they will be able to comfortably fill their hours. In the process, they will help make Britain a cleaner and brighter place.",
