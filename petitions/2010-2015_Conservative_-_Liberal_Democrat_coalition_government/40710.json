Accounting for freelance and independent businesses is outdated. Terms like self-employed or part-time don\u2019t reflect the diversity and momentum behind the \u2018free-style\u2019 or portfolio careers that many now choose. Without knowing the facts how does Govt create policies that enable growth and sustainability? How do larger businesses find them in order to trade with independents? How do local communities plan for the change in working patterns? How do we encourage employers towards a more fluid workforce for the future?\r\nWe\u2019d like a new way to measure the size of the sector and contribution that we make to the UK economy. We\u2019d like tax & other incentives to encourage growth, and we\u2019d like the Govt to encourage local authorities to provide much needed facilities to bring homeworkers together for peer support and reciprocal exchange.\r\n",
