My petiton requests the following to help alleviate this trauma:\r\n*seperate access areas for women needing to attend EPAU - not the same as those going to labour suites/leaving with healthy newborns\r\n*no waiting to be admitted via a & e when a women is suspected of having a m/c - they are heavily bleeding and require some dignity, sensitivity and privacy\r\n*opportunities for d & c's to be carried out without delays\r\n*followup care/counselling offered to all women\r\n*clear and concise explanations  given to women by medical staff so they fully understand what is happening and what their options are.\r\n*book of rememberance for all lost babies at each hospital\r\n*leave of absence from employment, not through sickness and with the same financial benefits as maternity leave - length of time to be discussed further",
