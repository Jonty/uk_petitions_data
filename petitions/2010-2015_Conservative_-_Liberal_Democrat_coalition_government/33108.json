        "additional_details": "We the undersigned are appalled by the abusive treatment revealed by Panorama of an elderly care home resident with dementia. The abuse occurred in a care home passed as \"excellent\" by the national regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC).\r\n\r\nWe agree with the Relatives & Residents Association that CQC is failing in its remit as a regulator of adult care homes.   We further note that CQC has been criticised by the Health Select Committee, the Public Accounts Committee, the Audit Commission, and by the Department of Health in its  Capability Review.\r\n\r\nWe agree with the  Relatives & Residents Association who are calling for:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAn increase to the frequency of inspection to a minimum of two per care home every year;\r\n\u2022\tThorough and in-depth inspections that rigorously scrutinize for tell tale signs of good and bad care;\r\n\u2022\t A friendly and approachable regulator which listens to and acts upon individual complaints about care\r\n",
