        "additional_details": "IVF should be made free to ALL people that have been reduced to IVF to have a child (no matter what age or circumstance). According to guidelines, couples may be eligible for IVF treatment on the NHS if: The woman is between 23 & 39 years old. (NICE) guidelines recommending that SUITABLE couples receive upto 3 cycles of IVF treatment on the NHS. Priority is often given to couples who don't already have children. It has also been proven that alot of hospitals don't even stick to these guidelines. This is all wrong,We have rights to have children. Infertility isn't a choice, we can't help having fertility problems. It's asif we are being punished for something that's out of our hands. It's cruel & hurtful. Age shouldn't even be a issue either, aslong as your in a commited relationship or can provide the child with love and support!! Please sign this petition. This needs to change and fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
