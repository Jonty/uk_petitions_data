        "additional_details": "This petition is simply asking UK Government and   Ofcom to ban  all UK mobile carries in charging the general public for : 0800, 0845, 0808, 0500 and any such numbers that relate to general enquires to UK Limited companies and PLC companies.\r\nOn average 85% of the British public have a mobile contract with free minutes its time that these firm give value to the British consumer and not rip them off by charging for the above numbers. Of course premium numbers such as 0901 and so forth are not included in this petition.At a time when the country is in deep financial crisis, the ordinary working people of this country are still losing their jobs, suffering wage freezes while living costs are spiralling, and the government cutting or capping benefit payments.  Is it right for these firm to charge the general public? For something that they already should get as part of their free minute allowance.\r\nWaheed Rafiq\r\nMember of the General Public\r\nwww.waheedrafiq.com\r\n",
