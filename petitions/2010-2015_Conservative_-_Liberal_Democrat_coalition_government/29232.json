I would like to see a change to regulations that govern the time limit that institutions have to retain records.  This will allow for much greater protection of individuals who have been mis-sold any financial products. I would like to see the time limit currently set at 6 years increased to 20 years or more. If you are the victim of any mis-sold product the financial institution can no longer be protected from imposing or hiding behind unfair time limits from those who seek redress. ",
