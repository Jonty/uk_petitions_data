David Cameron took the moral high ground and said we could not stand by and watch the people of Libya be slaughtered, where is that same moral concious now? We all understand international law and the rules of the UN but surely we have a much higher moral duty as human beings to not just sit by and watch while this despicable regime murders its own people. We are no better than Bashar Hafez al-Assad for standing idoly by and watching while these innocent people are slaughtered.",
