        "additional_details": "Allow Driving Lessons to begin at the age of 16, but only in a dual controlled car with an Approved Driving Instructor. At the age of 17, learners may continue to learn to drive, with family or friends who are over 21 and have held a full licence for 3 years. Then at 17 and a half they will be allowed to take their Practical Driving Test. This wouldn\u2019t affect the age at which the vast majority of young people would be ready for their test, but it would create an 18 month window in which Driving Lessons may legally be taken before a Driving Test is allowed. At present no such window exists. ",
