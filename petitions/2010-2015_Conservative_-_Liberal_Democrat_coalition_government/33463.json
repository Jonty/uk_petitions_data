        "additional_details": "Duke is an 18 month old male pit bull. He has been taken from his owner Jon Smilie by the police because of his breed, NOT because he is a dangerous dog, as you will see from the support and comments he is one of the softest most loving dog out there. And i can honestly say he is one of the best dogs i have had the pleasure of meeting which is why i'm so passionate and determined to help Duke and Jon be reunited asap. The laws are out dated and wrong and need to be sorted.",
