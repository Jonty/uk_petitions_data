        "additional_details": "According to various reports, there has been a so called 'overload' of immigrants entering the United Kingdom. The problem of the strain of public resources is typically blamed at immigrants, who have, apparently, increased the population of this country. This is utterly incorrect. The correct reason behind this 'strain' is due to the lack of public resources we have. This lack exists due to many larger, more fundamental corporations not paying taxation and therefore failing to contribute to the aggregate public resources. The primary objective of this petition is to put a cap to this and ask all large corporations, who currently don't pay their taxes, to start and contribute, like the rest of us, to this country's welfare and resources.",
