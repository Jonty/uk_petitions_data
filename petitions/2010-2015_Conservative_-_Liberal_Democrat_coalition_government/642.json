        "additional_details": "The BBC's decision to half coverage of formula one coverage is being promoted as a \"win\" for fans. This however is misleading and insulting to the many f1 fans that have enjoyed the BAFTA award winning coverage of the BBC team that has seen viewing figures rise to an all time 10 year high. The BBC is neglecting and marginalising those who cannot afford additional television programming and is contributing to the widening social gap between those who have and those who do not. As a public body this is unacceptable and requires government intervention to reinstate full coverage.",
