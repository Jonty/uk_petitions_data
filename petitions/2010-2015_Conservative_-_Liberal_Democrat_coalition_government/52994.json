        "additional_details": "The legalisation of Cannabis within the UK will have a variety of different benefits.\r\nIt is my hope that with different monetary incentives, the government legalises Cannabis, treating it like Alcohol andTobacco, allowing for taxation and regulation of the product.\r\nA few short facts\r\n- 69% of the UK want cannabis decriminalised (BBC 2012)\r\n- The estimated cost of policing cannabis is \u00a3500million per year\r\n- Cost of policing alcohol related crimes is \u00a36billion, legalising cannabis has been estimated to reduce this by 25% - Professor David Nutt\r\n- Cost of alcohol to the NHS is estimated to be between \u00a32.7 and \u00a33.5, also estimated to be reduced by 25%\r\n- Ability to control and relate the drug\r\n\r\nTaking these figures into account, they would allow for approximately a \u00a32.75 billion reduction in expenditure, Pre Taxation of cannabis.\r\n\r\nGet sharing, after all, it is your money which pays for these services.",
