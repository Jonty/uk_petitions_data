Rio 2016 organisers are nervous about how they will match the success of London 2012 and specifically the Gamesmakers' efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n70,000 gamesmakers represent 0.001% of the UK's population - that's one person in a 1000 - who selflessly gave up their time .  To promote the spirit of ongoing public service and to instill the 'Big Society' ethos, all gamesmakers should be recognised for their contribution by a special, public service award by the Queen.  The government should fully support this concept.",
