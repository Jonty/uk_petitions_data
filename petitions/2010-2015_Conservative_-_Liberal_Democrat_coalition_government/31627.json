The tax was initially levied for just this reason and was supposed to be a temporary measure. Well if you are going to keep the promise on it being a temporary tax at least do the decent thing of spending it on what it is raised for.\r\n\r\nAs more cars take to the road and we are expecting growth in vehicles of some 40% over the next 30 years or so, then money will be raised to improve our road system to cope just as we would now if the current revenue was spent one the roads.",
