        "additional_details": "Today, the East Midlands Ambulance Service has just informed staff that Coalville ambulance station will close on the 14th of August 2013. This is without any proper consultation with the local population, and also with no alternate North West Leicestershire facility in place. This closure will lead to increased response times to Coalville, Ashby, Whitwick, Ibstock and all other surrounding towns and villages, and potentially could be the difference between life and death. Despite the fact that they are facing a parliamentary review on plans, they are going ahead with all proposed changes before anything can be done. We need an urgent review on all aspects of their Being The Best plan before its too late. As a local resident, I feel passionate about the fact that my family and friends will undoubtedly suffer as a result of what the local ambulance service is trying to do.",
