Like other more civilised countries, the UK needs to start making it a legal obligation for its citizens to be involved in the running of the country.  There are those who will continue to refuse to vote, in which case there should be a MANDATORY AUTOMATIC NON-APPEALABLE fine which can be used to set against the national deficit.",
