        "additional_details": "The signatories agree with and support the following statement :\r\n\r\n\"Access to blood glucose testing should be offered to every person who has Type 2 Diabetes, who wishes to test as part of the structured education that the present NICE guidelines recommend. This should be an ongoing process to enable people with Type 2 Diabetes to manage their health on a permanent basis. There should be no 'blanket ban' by PCT\u2019s or GP\u2019s on self monitoring of blood glucose levels for Type 2 Diabetic's on 'diet only' or any other regime. It should be the Patients choice to test or not.\r\n\r\nWe ask the Government to make the provision of blood glucose testing equipment (meter's and test strips) mandatory for all Type 2 Diabetes Patients and to order PCT\u2019s to fund the prescribing of  a supply of  test strips at the Patient\u2019s request, if required. \"\r\n",
