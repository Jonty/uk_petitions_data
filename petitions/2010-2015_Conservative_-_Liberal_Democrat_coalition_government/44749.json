        "additional_details": "The government needs to ensure that the title of \u2018Engineer\u2019 is legally protected as it is in many other countries around the world, including Germany, France, USA and Canada. The title needs to be legally protected for Professional Engineers.\r\nProtecting the title will:\r\n-Increase the salaries of Engineers\r\n-Increase the respect society will have for Engineers\r\n-Increase the number of youngsters wanting to pursue careers in Engineering\r\n-Increase the reputation of British Engineers once more\r\n\r\nSociety misunderstands what an Engineer actually does; they do NOT fix coffee machines and boilers. They are Problems Solvers, Designers and Analysts full of ingenuity and creativity to solve the technical problems they face. Within academia, Engineering is regarded as one of the toughest subjects; the students deserve a little recognition for their efforts. Other professions have protected titles, yet Engineering \u2013 a field that has made Britain what it is today is not protected.",
