        "additional_details": "The London Borough of Barnet has shown their utter disregard and contempt for football fans.  Not only has Barnet FC been forced to move outside of the borough through failed negotiations with the Council but Claremont Road, the much loved home of Hendon FC, was left for 3 years to rot into decay and evolve into a slum ghetto whilst Barnet Council strove to break the covenant preventing development. We demand that the Government make Barnet Council set aside land for the building of a football ground as detailed in their statutory unitary plan Policy GL1",
