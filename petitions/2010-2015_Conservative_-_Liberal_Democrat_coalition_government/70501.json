        "additional_details": "The hours of daylight/sunshine lost in the mornings in early summer when 99% of people are in bed,should be added to the end of the day so putting the clocks forward by a further hour.\r\nWould give us a greater feeling of there actually being a better summer year on year.\r\nWe have all had our childhoods&family times taken away from us.\r\nProductivity would improve in the work place&people would be more tolerant&friendly to each other&people would want to holiday in the UK from the UK&from abroad.\r\nAs soon as the sun goes down in the summer when families are having BBQ's etc everyone goes inside because it gets chilly.\r\nOur outlook on life would improve as a nation with an extra hours daylight in an evening in the summer. Health would improve but bringing families&friends closer together.We would be more European in our attitudes&be less stressful.\r\nWinter sunshine as no benefit to us.\r\nWe spend most our waking lives generally in darkness than in light.",
