        "additional_details": "Motorways currently being widened will have a full width gantry every 800m or less. (Every 22 seconds at 70mph). When this primary programme is complete they will be installed on every mile of motorway in the UK. (Interim Advice Note 87/07). The reason given by the government is that to control motorway speeds, a driver must be able to see the next gantry as he passes under one (all drivers have a short term memory apparently). As can be seen around the M25 and M6, these gantries are a blot on the landscape. They will be seen for miles around marching across what was open countryside. Their real use will be speed cameras and road toll charging. I would ask the government to halt the installation now and the billions of pounds saved passed to better causes.",
