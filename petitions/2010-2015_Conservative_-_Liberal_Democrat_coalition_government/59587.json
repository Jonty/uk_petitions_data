Video games which contain content of an obscene nature are rated MATURE and that people who have taken an official audit hold a license in order to buy these games, WHATEVER circumstances they come from.\r\n\r\nAudit will include psychological status, understanding of nature of games and how that extended times on video games can affect health.\r\n\r\nChildren of all nature should be allowed freedom when it comes to hobbies. Scientific research shows video games of such nature do not affect a child's behaviour.",
