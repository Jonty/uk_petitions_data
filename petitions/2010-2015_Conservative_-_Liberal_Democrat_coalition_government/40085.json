        "additional_details": "Popular 'disposable' nappies are estimated to take upwards of 500 years to decompose and some sources say that the plastic component of them will never do so.  The government needs to pass legislation to force all nappy maufacturers to only produce nappies that are fully biodegradable, and to encourage the use of washable nappies where possible.",
