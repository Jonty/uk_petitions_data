People need cars you cant just put the price up and expect everyone to hop on public transport and the government get the benefit, they say its because its more expensive to buy, well if the Government stopped buying themselves new items and raising there own pay it wouldn't backfire on us were we have to pay for these items in tax and other ways we are paying ridiculous prices.
