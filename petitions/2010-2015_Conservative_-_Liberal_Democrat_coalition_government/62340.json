The bond between our nations is far stronger than any artificial purely economic union such as the EU.\r\n\r\nWe live in a time where the world is getting smaller and nations must form closer bonds to survive, however this is best served by uniting our common allies together into a union which is right under our noses in terms of common history, culture and language (the basic building blocks of a nation).",
