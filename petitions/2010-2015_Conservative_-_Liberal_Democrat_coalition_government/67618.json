        "additional_details": "The current Family Court system makes it too easy for mothers to deny children contact with their fathers. The government claims to be 'clamping down' on absent fathers, yet many fathers are being kept away from their children\r\n\r\nAt the moment fathers have to prove themselves beyond ridiculous means to be worthy of being a fit and loving parent, and if one wrong word is said, it can count against them massively, whereas if a mother goes back on an agreement, it can take months to get back into court and even then, several repeat visits before action is taken\r\n\r\nThe only way to stop this is to have the threat of losing main parental responsibility becoming a reality. We would like a stricter policy, two or three strikes and then the father gets sole responsibility\r\n\r\nThese dads, if given responsibility,would still make sure the children saw their mother as they know the effect this can have on their children\r\n\r\nWe want the same rules for both parents!",
