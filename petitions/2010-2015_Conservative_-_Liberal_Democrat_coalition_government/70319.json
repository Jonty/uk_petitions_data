I would like to see the policy and law changed for this group only, To allow anyone who is in this group to go abroad on holiday for up to 28 days without informing the DWP.\r\nIf we go on holiday in the UK we do not have to inform the DWP. I feel this policy/law is unfair and should be changed and have a more common sense approach to it.",
