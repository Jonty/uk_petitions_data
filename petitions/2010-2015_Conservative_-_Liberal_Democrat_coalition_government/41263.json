        "additional_details": "I take the cross country train service from Leamington Spa to Oxford 5 days a week. This route spans  Newcastle to Bournmouth. Ordinarily at peak times (usually between 4 and 6) in the evening, there are not enough carriages and It's common place to be left standing. It costs a small fortune to travel regularly on this \"service\" but the service doesn't accommodate the amount of passengers that take it at peak times. I wish it was a rare occurrence but it is every day, not to mention the awful stench of the chemical toilets. Season pass holders cannot reserve seats and this is another problem. A lot of other services seem to have double the amount of carriages for a lot less people.\r\n\r\nComplaints are not listened too and nothing improves.  The government need to have some kind of regulation for how many people can go on per carriage and if a rail company fails to accommodate passengers fully then there should be some kind of compensation or ticket refund.\r\n\r\n",
