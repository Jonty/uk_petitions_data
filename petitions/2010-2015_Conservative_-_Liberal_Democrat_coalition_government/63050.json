        "additional_details": "I want the government to adapt a law making lashing mandatory for anyone convicted for Jail time including probation and young offender's institute.\r\n\r\nOne lash per day for the duration of the sentence. Repeat offence will increase it to double the amount. So repeat offenders will be lashed multiples of their previous lashing.\r\n\r\nThis will prove a strong deterrent for repeat and one time offenders. It will also install the value of education in jails and rehabilitation and will reduce the chance of repeat offence. Sadly, we have no deterrent for offenders in this day and age. All the PS2's, TV's, SKY, GYM and internet is clearly not sending the message and they are not getting it.\r\n\r\nWith the Lashes program, they can still enjoy the perks of a paid holiday and a gentle reminder at 9am in the morning that they need to get out of here and not come back. This is not their home.",
