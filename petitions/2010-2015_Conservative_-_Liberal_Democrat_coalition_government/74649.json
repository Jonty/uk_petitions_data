        "additional_details": "I am a nurse and have worked in serveral care homes in the UK. One thing that is a problem for all care homes at times in the UK is unsafe staffing levels. I have worked in homes where there has been as little as one nurse for forty-four residents, and two carers for thirty eight residents. This results in poor care being delivered and many vulnerable elderly residents getting very little care. Care homes try to run on as few nurses and carers as possible to increase profit margins. I want to see however one nurse to no more than fifteen residents and one carer to no more than five residents in all care homes in the UK. Please sign this petition to cause these minimum safe staffing levels to be introduced in law for all care homes in the UK. At present minimum safe staffing levels do not exist for care homes, and they therefore are legally allowed to run on very unsafe levels of staff. ",
