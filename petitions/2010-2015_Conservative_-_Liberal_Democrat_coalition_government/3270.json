        "additional_details": "I ask that parliament reviews the blatent age discrimination being allowed to take place in a country that takes pride in being fair for all. Two examples of this are minimum wage, ie, a 16 year old can be doing the exact same job and to the same standard as a 21 year old, however the 21 year old has a higher minimum wage and therefore earns more.\r\nMy second example is car insurance. After the decision was made that it was unjust to charge men more than women on the grounds it was sexist, even though statistics show women are involved in less accidents, I was disgusted to learn no attempt at reviewing the difference in insurance between ages was made, and essentially this is exactly the same kind of issue.\r\nDo not allow young people to be singled out for their age when they are perfectly capable of making a very valuable contribution to society.",
