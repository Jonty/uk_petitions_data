They used to cost around \u00a3150 . This huge range of stimulating courses will not appeal at triple the old price. The demise of these courses will be a sad loss and do harm to the O.U.\r\nCan government please allow the O.U to find a loophole that allows these short courses to remain affordable for recreational users.
