        "additional_details": "I am campaigning for the discreet storage of wheelie bins where possible.  The Wheelie Bin is devaluing and degrading  homes in open plan housing estates all over the country, and I would like the government to make it law for the bins to be stored at the back of the property, and NOT stored on the open plan front gardens, which makes the estates look  like slums.  It would be nice if we took a pride  in our housing estates and keep Britain looking Great. Please sign to respect your community.    ",
