They should be nominated or elected in by head teachers and consultants respectively, Union leaders should have a say in stead of being continuously ignored.\r\n\r\nIf constituents get to vote in who they want to represent them, why shouldn't experts in the life changing feilds of healthcare and education, ones that have been there, ones that know and understand, why shouldn't they get the chance?\r\n\r\nIt seems clear from an outsider that Rachel Tomlinson head teacher for Barrowford school (google her) in Nelson has already made a better impression with the UK public that the latest secretary for education ever could.\r\n",
