        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the House of Westminster to hold a referendum in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to run on the same date as the Scottish Independence Referendum and include the questions:-\r\n\r\n1] Do you vote for the constitutional status quo between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland?\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n2] Do you vote for a \"United States of Britain\" with England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland being independent WITHIN the Union as a Federal/Nation State option?\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n3] Do you vote for the complete independence and separation between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland?\r\n\r\nWe believe that it is constitutionally fairer for the entire nation of Britain to vote on this subject.\r\n\r\nFurthermore we believe that England should be given it's own Parliament. It is constitutionally wrong for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to have their Parliament and England to be left without an equivalent constitutional Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
