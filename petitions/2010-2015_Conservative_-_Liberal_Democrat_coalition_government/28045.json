Why? Especially given the terms in the Declaration and obligations in the UN Charter to comply with its Resolutions and Treaties.\r\n\r\nHe also needs to confirm that under The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969), no UK laws which have failed to 'give effect' to those rights are, or have been, legally valid since that became effective.",
