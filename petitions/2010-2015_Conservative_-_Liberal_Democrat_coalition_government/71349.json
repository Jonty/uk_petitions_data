Some use petrol and tools to create paths which breaches their access rights. Check out the corstorphine riders antics on utube. And if anyone challenges them, the average response is abuse and threats of more destruction, arson etc!\r\nOh and the council in Edinburgh think this should be managed with no signs and minimal ranger/police input. They have the power to create a by law but the politics of promoting cycling is more imprtanant than conservation and common legislation.\r\n",
