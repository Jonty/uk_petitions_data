Advertising of e-cigarettes should be banned.\r\n3. There should an accreditation process for suppliers of the nicotine liquids to protect people from bogus or contaminated liquids.\r\n4. E-cigarettes are not seen as an opportunity for the government to create a tax stream as this will deter smokers from moving to vaping.\r\n",
