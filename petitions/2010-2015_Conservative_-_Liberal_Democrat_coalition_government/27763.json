        "additional_details": "To abolish VED and add the value to fuel duty so the amount motorists pay for their vehicles would be proportional to the number of miles driven and the fuel efficiency of their vehicles (hence fairer to low mileage users and more efficient vehicles). Adding the VED to fuel cost would result in vehicles with higher fuel consumptions or covering higher mileage paying more through the additional fuel needing to be purchased (and thus higher duty paid). This would encourage more fuel efficient vehicles to be used.",
