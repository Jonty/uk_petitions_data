The cries of the gulls goes through the ears and the mess they leave on cars and patio is a daily occurrence.\r\nWhen asked to stop doing it the reply was harsh and there was no reasoning with them. I'm all for feeding the smaller birds but when big chunks of bread is chucked into a big open area it's clearly only going to attract one thing.\r\nI know I'm not the only one with this problem so please help and sign. Thank you.",
