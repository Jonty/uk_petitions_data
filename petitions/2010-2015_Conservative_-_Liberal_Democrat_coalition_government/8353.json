        "additional_details": "The riots currently underway, whilst now mostly motivated by criminal factors, did have initial causes in Tottenham which cannot be ignored. Apart from the obvious shooting of Mark Duggan, other factors such as racial tensions concerning stop and search tactics, and anger about unemployment and budget cuts almost certainly made a contribution. Action should be taken by the Government on these issues.",
