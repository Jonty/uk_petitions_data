        "additional_details": "The criminalisation of those or cannot or do not wish to finance the BBC is both an iniquity and an anomaly. The virtues of state broadcasting are waning.  The BBC now carries only a minority of major sporting events.  Its drama output is rarely at the cutting edge and seems often aimed primarily at export markets.  Its schedules are largely filled with low quality programmes or repeats.  Its news service, while laudible, increasingly places the journalist as protagonist rather than reporter.  If the BBC service had not been inherited, it would never be invented today on the existing model. Minority interests, including cultural ouput, are capable of surviving as advertisment free services financed by willing subscribers.",
