        "additional_details": "The petition is to allow bus users to have cheaper fares depending on their delay of service, if a bus is delayed 10 minutes or more to their service, users are entitled to having their fares halved. If a bus is later than 25 minutes or more the users are entitled for a free bus fare or refund on their day riders ect. This will allow bus services to realise if time schedules are unrealist and that customers feel their time isn't being wasted.",
