Rather than struggling alone on the outside with a multitude of responsibilities and incessant bills, prison life and its institutional care can often look like an attractive prospect - more pronounced human rights, accommodation, food and heating all found, preferential medical care (mustn't contravene those human rights), access to educational facilities, help in securing employment once 'released' and help and advice to claiming benefits.\r\n\r\nPrison should be such that NO-ONE would want to go there.  Prison life should NEVER be better than life on the outside. ",
