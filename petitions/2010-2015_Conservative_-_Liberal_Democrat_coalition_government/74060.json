        "additional_details": "As an owner of a very small limited company , whose turnover is less than \u00a310,000,  I  spend a vast number of hours complying with Government imposed schemes as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Corporation Tax Online Filing - Using HMRC's online facility takes me an extra week compared to filing on paper. Sole trader businesses can file on paper.\r\n\r\n2. RTI - I am forced to report to HMRC online even though I have paid myself nothing.\r\n\r\n3. Pensions Auto Enrolment - I will have to know my staging date, register, examine my workforce etc. I am spending hours researching what I have to do again probably to report nothing.\r\n\r\n4. In 2016 FRSSE will be replaced by FRSME, which is based on FRS 102. This is for large companies and the document is over 350 pages long.  How many hours am I going to spend on this?\r\n\r\nI request that for  limited companies with turnover below say \u00a310,000 the Government exempts them from the first three requirements, and that FRSSE can continue to be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
