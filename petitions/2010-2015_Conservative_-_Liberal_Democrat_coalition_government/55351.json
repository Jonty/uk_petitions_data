The topic has been studied tested and considered in a morale light. Friends of the Earth are against GM as they see it as being 'against nature' and they are frightening the public who may not know the details by using propaganda. GM is nothing to be afraid of, it is being developed so that it can help humans, other species and the natural environment. Stop Friends of the Earth from putting a negative and incorrect light on it. ",
