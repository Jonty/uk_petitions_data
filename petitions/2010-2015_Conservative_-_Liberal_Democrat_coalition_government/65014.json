        "additional_details": "As the summer months approach all our children play outside.  On Cocker avenue the street is used as a cut through road. People use our street as a racing track.  The current speed bumps are not suitable anymore as they do not slow people down.  Would like more adequate speed bumps that are closer together and actually slow people down. Please sign and add people. Thanks for taking the time to sign to make our streets safer. ",
