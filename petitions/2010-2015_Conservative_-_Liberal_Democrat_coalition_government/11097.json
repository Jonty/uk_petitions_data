It's hard to fund IVF on top of the high maintenance bills for existing children, currently there is no government funding.  The current sociological stigma arises from the belief that they 'knew what you they were getting into' ... REALLY?  Give us a chance to parent, we pay our taxes, we've worked hard, we've found the person of our dreams and shown huge commitment to them to take on them and their baggage!",
