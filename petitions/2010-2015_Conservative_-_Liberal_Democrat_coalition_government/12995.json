        "additional_details": "When visiting friends and family in hospital you should not be subjected to unfair parking charges. Parking charges were only introduced in the past few years, and the money raised barely covers the cost of running them (with most of the money going to privately run car park operators, rather than the hospitals), so the charges could easily be scrapped. Nurses and other front line hospital staff provide an essential service and they should be guaranteed free parking too. ",
