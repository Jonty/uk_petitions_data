        "additional_details": "A discussion in the House of Commons needs to take place to discuss the unlawful relegation of the Doncaster Belle's from the womans football league first division because:-\r\n\r\n'Doncaster Belles won\u2019t be in the top division next year. Not because of relegation, not because of liquidation, not even due to rebranding. They will not be in the top division next season simply because the FA has decided they will not be. In 2014 the FA have elected to further build upon the Women\u2019s Super League with the introduction of a second tier FAWSL2. All current Super League teams have retained their seat at the top table for the new FAWSL1 except one, Doncaster Rovers Belles, who will be replaced by Manchester City.\r\n\r\nThe FA announced this decision via a news story on the FAWSL website on Friday 26th April. No fanfare, just a curt 120 word article which outlined the two divisional make-ups. There was no reasoning given.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n",
