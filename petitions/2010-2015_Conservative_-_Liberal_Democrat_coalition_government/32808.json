        "additional_details": "We ask the Government Department for Culture, Media and Sport to lobby British Broadcasters to bring back Laurel and Hardy to UK TV. Laurel and Hardy slapstick humour is the bedrock of our world renowned comedy culture and without them, there would be no Tommy Cooper, Monty Python, Young Ones, Lee Evans, Ricky Gervais, etc. There is now a generation growing up who have never had the pleasure and cultural enrichment of watching the time-less classics of Laurel and Hardy. By signing this e-petition, you will be highlighting the importance of Laurel & Hardy and helping to bring this cultural void to the attention of the DCMS so they can take action to remedy this most unsatisfactory situation.",
