        "additional_details": "The Parliament in Westminster should hand over power on all scottish matters to Alex Salmond and transfer full fiscal powers to the Scottish Parliament and allow Scotland to be independent which it deserves to be in its own right as Scotland is more than capable of managing its own future and prospering greatly. The UK government has already in the past prevented this when a majority of voters voted in favour of this which was wrong. Scotland does not need financial 'assistance' from westminster in a grant it needs to take control of its own resources and not be robbed of the opportunity to do so as has happened throughout the history of the 'union'. People in England who feel Scotland should not be part of the UK are more than welcome to sign this petition whether they agree with this view or just simply that scotland should be independent and left to run our own affairs as i am sure people in england would like to separate the union as well whatever their reasons may be for this.",
