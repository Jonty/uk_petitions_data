        "additional_details": "It has been reported that each citizen currently owes \u00a316,000 towards the National Debt.\r\n\r\n1. I propose that the government create legislation to ensure that when a citizen dies and they leave an estate which is large enough to incur Inheritance Tax, the first \u00a316,000 of such tax is paid off of the National Debt.\r\n\r\n2. I propose that the government create legislation to ensure that when a citizen directs their earnings out of the country, perhaps to support family members in other parts of the world. That those citizens pay into an \"insurance scheme\" to ensure that upon death there is sufficient funds to pay their liability of National Debt.\r\n\r\n3. To debate this e-petition should sufficient signatories be found.",
