        "additional_details": "Street lights in Hitchin are turned off after 11:30pm resulting in dark streets dangerous for people to walk through. It's so dark in places that there could be someone else walking near you and you wouldn't have a clue. It doesn't take much to realise how dangerous and inconvenient that is. If lights are too bright for certain houses (due to bad initial positioning of the street lights) they could be just turned down-not off. Or more to be kept on to avoid completely dark areas in the streets.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to turn back on our street lights in Hitchin!",
