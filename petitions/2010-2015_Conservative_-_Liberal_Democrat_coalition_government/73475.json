        "additional_details": "The current method that transgender people have to use in order to have their gender legally recognised is extremely discriminatory. The Gender Recognition Certificate requires a long list of requirements for the Panel to consider giving a transgender person the right to an identity. These Requirements include a compulsory two year duration proven, and a ridiculous fee of up to \u00a3140, amongst other requirements. I believe that a more sensible option, both for reducing unnecessary costs that the taxpayers are having to spend, and for liberating the rights of trans people, is to completely do rid of the outdated and discriminatory need for a Gender Recognition Certificate. Instead, the government should allow people to change their legal gender as they choose, similarly to how people would change address or name details. ",
