        "additional_details": "I feel that the government should move to sack David Jones MP from the government immediately after his comments on gay parents today and that they 'clearly' cannot provide a 'warm & safe environment' in which to raise children.  This is clearly against the equality ethics of the UK and as such he should not hold a position in which he represents our country. ",
