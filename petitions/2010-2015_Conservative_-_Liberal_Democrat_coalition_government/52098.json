        "additional_details": "Currently CSA maintenance payments are only calculated and awarded on the Non Resident Parents total annual income.\r\n\r\nNo system is currently in place to allow the assessment of the financial situation of the Parent With Care.\r\n\r\nThis means Non Resident Parents are paying endless and limitless monthly sums from their salaries, often (if/where arrears are payable) crippling their own family economy regardless of the financial situation and security of the Parent With Care.\r\n\r\nIn illustration, is there reason why, in the Governments eyes why NRP families should pay up to 40% of their total income EVEN if the PWC family are in a better or equal financial position.\r\n\r\nHelp where help is needed!  Stop crippling NRP families with unrealistic demands without first means testing the PWC!\r\n\r\nIf we are both equally responsible for our children, we are both equally financially asses able. ",
