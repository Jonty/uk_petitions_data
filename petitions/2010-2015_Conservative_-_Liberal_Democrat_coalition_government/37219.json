        "additional_details": "As someone living in the West Midlands, the decision to award First Group the Franchise to run West Coast Mainline, will have a huge impact on the train service in my area. Virgin has lost it's franchise and it will now be run by First Group who just happened to bid a higher amount. Authorities have not paid any attention to the general public or the great service levels that Virgin provided. We need the government to consider the service and satisfaction levels and not just monetary benefits as the criteria for selecting a major Public Service Provider. Let's all hope that the Government will re-think the bids to select the right company on the basis of their merits and to engage the public on decisions that affect their daily lives.",
