        "additional_details": "In the UK, more than half of women in prostitution have been raped and/or seriously sexually assaulted. At least three quarters have been physically assaulted. The mortality rate for women in prostitution in London is 12 times the national average.\r\n\r\nMerseyside police declared crimes against sex workers hate crimes in 2006. In 2010, the conviction rate in Merseyside for crimes against sex workers was 84%. The rape conviction rate was 67% (the national average is 6.5%).\r\n\r\nThe National Association of Police Chiefs recommends the Merseyside model be adopted by all police forces.\r\n\r\nIn a report commissioned by the Mayor of London, Andrew Boff (Conservative Member of the London Assembly) recommends it.\r\n\r\nWe want the Merseyside model for crimes against sex workers to be compulsory in every UK police force.",
