Research shows that alcohol marketing plays a significant role in encouraging young people to drink at an early age and in greater quantities. The current regulations are failing to protect our children and young people from being bombarded. Government must introduce regulations which stop the alcohol industry from recruiting the next generation of problem drinkers by preventing alcohol marketing targeted at young people  through social networking sites and all other forms of media and sponsorship.",
