        "additional_details": "As an industry we must stand together and ask for your help to stop this bill from going through.  As ARLA agents we all agree with regulating our industry to stop rogue traders. If government want to vote on agents, they need to help us bring in good robust regulation and not even consider voting on removing the small fees we have to charge to tenants to cover our costs. Professional letting agents run businesses and have to charge tenants small fees to cover our administration costs. The fees we are generally known as \"commitment fees\", without these fees it would send the majority of agents to the wall. Do MP's really want to be responsible to collapsing our industry now when private renting for the first time ever has now overtaken the numbers of social lettings!\r\nMP's please vote AGAINST this bill tomorrow\r\n",
