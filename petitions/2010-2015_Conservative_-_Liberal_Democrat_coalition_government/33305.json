        "additional_details": "This Petition is for a Financial Subject to be made Compulsory throughout secondary schools in England. Like P.S.H.E it will develop financial life skills and teach young people about credit cards to investments, loans to mortgages etc.\r\n\r\nThis NEEDS to be put in place. This IS the long-term solution for solving our Economical crisis.\r\n\r\nTo add to the financial knowledge for young people, I would like to see schools be more entrepreneurial-friendly. The school system now is all about creating potential employees, not potential employers. This NEEDS to be changed if we want a good economy again. People who have endured degrees and A-Levels struggle to find work, instead of making work for themselves because the system pressures you into being an employee.\r\n\r\nMore Businesses = More Jobs = More Money.\r\n\r\nWe CANNOT leave our country to the Next Generation who will have no financial sense. This MUST be put into place.\r\n\r\n",
