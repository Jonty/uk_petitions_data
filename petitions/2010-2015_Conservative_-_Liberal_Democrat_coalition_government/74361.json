Six Nations may no longer be live on free-to-air TV after current BBC deal ends\r\n\r\n BBC\u2019s arrangement comes to an end in 2017.\r\n\r\nThe championship is a Category B event under the Listed Events code, meaning it can be shown on pay-TV, but has to have highlights, it would also be shown very shortly after the whistle on delayed coverage on terrestrial\r\n\r\n\u201cThree years lefft on this existing contact.\r\n\r\nThe risk in opting to jump into bed with pay-TV would be that it would restrict the Six Nations\u2019 reach, with many still not subscribing to either BT Sport or Sky.\r\n\r\nSo with the cost of an average match ticket rising many home nation supporters have to watch on the bbc. However with the planned sale to sky or bt, more will be punished for not being able to afford these options, meaning supporter can not, simply give their support and enjoy the game of \"Gents\", let's get this stopped and make people aware we will not stand by this decision.",
