BUILD A WATER NATIONAL GRID.\r\n\r\nNO PROFITS FOR SHARE HOLDERS UNTIL THIS WORK IS COMPLETED.\r\n\r\nI think that with the scandalous water leakage rates of ALL water companies you should suspend ALL of the profits of ALL the companies, until they have got their house in order.\r\n\r\nWe are at the moment under emergency drought conditions so go that step further. ALSO, make the companies to use those profits to build a national water grid, so water can be pumped to the area that needs it. With the planet shift, the condition is going to get worse, so you have to act now.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n",
