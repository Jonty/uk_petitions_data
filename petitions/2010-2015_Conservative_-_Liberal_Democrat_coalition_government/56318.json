        "additional_details": "A company called \"The Hunting Agency\" is a UK based company profiting on Murder. The Hunting Agency offers large scale hunting all over the world for a large price. The animals or \"Trophy's\" as they call them include Elephants, Big cats, and Baboons among others. Considering the opposition to Fox Hunting in the UK I believe most of the UK population would be very disturbed to learn that this kind of company is able to operate within the UK. I want the government to review the law on companies like this operating in the UK, especially companies making a profit from murder. What does this say about our country? The Company even boasts photographs of children posing with the slaughtered carcasses of these beautiful animals. Is this what we want the next generation to become when we already live in a world of countless endangered species and global warming. It's time to start taking care of the planet and the UK should not be condoning and contributing to this type of sick fetish. ",
