This is an example of an organisation blatantly living beyond their means for many years and avoiding paying their share of tax to HMRC.\r\n\r\nNo individual citizen would be allowed to  avoid the payment of tax and neither should big business.\r\n\r\nIn recent days the owners of this club have attempted to shortchange the people of this country by using the threat of administration to pressurise HMRC to accept a lesser amount than that which is owed. Such manipulation should not be tolerated.\r\n\r\n",
