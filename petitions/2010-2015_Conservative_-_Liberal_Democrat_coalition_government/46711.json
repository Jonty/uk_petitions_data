Are protected by us from their catastrophes\r\n4. Lend small businesses barely a pittance\r\n5. Pay us derisory interest on savings\r\nA disgrace that has not been satisfactorily addressed.\r\nThe Treasury will refund us up to \u00a385,000 per \u2018failed\u2019 account, from our own taxes\r\nto keep investing in this corrupt financial system. The Government should make:\r\nThe SAME \u00a385,000 GUARANTEE for PEER TO PEER LOANS\r\nSo we can fund getting Britain back to work, while not seeing our hard won savings\r\nwither weekly, or even weakly.
