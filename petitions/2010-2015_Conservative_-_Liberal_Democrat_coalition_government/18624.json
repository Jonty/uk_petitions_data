        "additional_details": "Flashing or blinking front lights as often used by cyclists are more dangerous than not having lights at all.\r\n\r\nThe flashing is often uncomfortable to the eyes forcing motorists and other cyclists to look in the other direction and can also make it difficult to see what else is going on around the cyclist.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to ban the sale of such lights in shops and to make them illegal for use when cycling.",
