        "additional_details": "Allotment prices in this region have risen beyond any other prices I know of.  For a 200 meter squared allotment (enough to support one person) the yearly charge is now \u00a391.  I have heard that further price rises may occur next year, possibly hiking the prices to around \u00a3116.  Please, can you do something to reduce this outrageous pricing, a cap on this amount would be sufficient as it means that unemployed or low waged allotment tenants can still afford the rent.",
