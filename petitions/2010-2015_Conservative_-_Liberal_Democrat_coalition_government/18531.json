        "additional_details": "Each year people are seriously injured and killed by careless cyclists going through red lights and general reckless riding.  Therefore they need to be treated the same as motor vehicles and their users should be compelled to have some form of registration plate or device fixed to the bicycle, this and a requirement to have personal liability insurance to cover accidents the same as a motor vehicle would.  If a motor vehicle breaks the law going through a red light, it should be the same for cyclists.\r\n\r\nI was hit by a cyclist who went through a red light at a crossing and as a result have lost my taste and smell, it could have been a lot worse, please help by signing the petition and hopefully together we can make the roads a safer place.",
