        "additional_details": "Temporary curbs imposed in 2005 to protect the British labour market from large numbers of migrants originating from Romania and Bulgaria are set to expire from December 2013.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of British citizens, the Home Office and Government should endeavour to take any moves to extend these vital curbs. Removal of these curbs may be damaging in relation to opportunities for British citizens to get access to jobs over migrants as well as to be prioritized for public services such as welfare, housing, health care, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Home Office has not produced an official estimate of how many of the 29 million Romanian and Bulgarian citizens will take advantage of their new freedoms when controls are lifted giving many British citizens great uncertainty about the potential problems a removal of these curbs would cause. These curbs must remain in place for the foreseeable future. ",
