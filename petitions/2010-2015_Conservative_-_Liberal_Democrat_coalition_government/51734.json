        "additional_details": "Reigate & Banstead County Council has proposed to remove Keats Playground. I understand that they feel it needs modernisation, and they would rather remove it, than invest any money on it.\r\n\r\nRecreational areas for our children should be preserved; this is especially true since new housing developments have smaller gardens that wouldn\u2019t be dreamed of 50 years ago. The creation of flats in the local area makes this doubly important.\r\n\r\nCouncil Tax is expensive, this playground is financially insignificant and will probably last in excess of 25 years. The playground was originally built by the developers who also built the housing estate 25 years ago and should be preserved.\r\n\r\nIt is a SAFE area for children to play, overlooked by dozens of houses; but not intrusive to homeowners.\r\nOur children deserve so much better than what is currently being offered by society.  Childhood is precious and should be preserved.\r\n\r\nIf this is ignored; hopefully our MP will support our children.\r\n",
