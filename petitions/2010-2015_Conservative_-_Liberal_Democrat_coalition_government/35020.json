        "additional_details": "We call upon the Queen to make a significant gesture to commemorate her Silver Jubilee. Our suggestion is to lease or sell Buckingham Palace or another of her nine mansions and Palaces. Leasing it to a hotel chain will help maintain it, employ more people and generate income to be reinvested in housing for her hard working citizens. Selling it will generate a capital receipt sufficient to fund many social homes. The government is keen to tackle underoccupied, empty and underused homes with its bedroom tax. A modern monarchy should not be above playing a part and there can be no more appropriate year than the Jubilee Year. We call upon the government to persuade the monarchy to make this really significant sacrifice.",
