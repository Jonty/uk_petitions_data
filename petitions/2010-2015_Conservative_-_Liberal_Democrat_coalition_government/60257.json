        "additional_details": "The proposed law is anti competitive, anti European, anti drinker; a government initiated cartel for the exclusive benefit of the companies that helped create the current state of affairs by loss leading on alcohol products. Supermarkets, amongst the most profitable companies in the UK, will be guaranteed further profit at the expense of drinkers. The huge additional profits will be ploughed into promoting alcohol consumption on a scale not previously seen. Cheap alcohol products will be imported or developed to maximise the gain to be made from having a guaranteed minimum price at point of sale. If this is genuinely for health reasons, increase the duty payable on alcohol and direct any proceeds to fund the facilities required to deal with the problems, not just extra profits for already fat cats.
