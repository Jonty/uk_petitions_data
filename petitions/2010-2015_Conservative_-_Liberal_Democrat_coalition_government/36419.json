        "additional_details": "This e-petition calls for the Higher-Education Funding Council for England or the Department for BIS to rescind their rule on the number of outputs to be submitted for the Research Excellence Framework by people that have had a career break.\r\nIn June 2012 HEFCE ruled that there would be *no reduction* in the number of expected REF outputs to be submitted by people that have had career breaks but remained in HE (http://www.ref.ac.uk/faq/individualstaffcircumstancesref1b/). That is, those academics that have moved temporarily to a teaching-only contract or into management have to submit as many outputs as a full-time researcher.  But there *is* a reduction for those that have had career breaks *outside* HE.\r\nThis discriminates unjustifiably against those that stay in HE for their career breaks, and it means that they have to do unpaid research on the side for which their university will later take the credit. We call on HEFCE to reverse this policy, and treat all career breaks equally.",
