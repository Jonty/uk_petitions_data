Yes they will if you live in a COUNCIL HOUSE they might even evict you or they can move the poor victims. What if you're a homeowner with home owning anti-social neighbours try complaining it's a different kettle of fish.If a rule or law exits in social housing to protect tenants from anti-social neighbours, then why is there nothing to protect the home owner from home owning anti-social neighbours in the same way. Surely this must be discrimination in some form or fashion? How can the full weight of the the law be applied?",
