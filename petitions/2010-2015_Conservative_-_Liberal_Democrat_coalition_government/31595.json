Autistic children should be involved in decisions which affect them and have the same opportunities no matter who they are or where they live. Teachers also need a better understanding in order to provide the right support.\r\n\r\nTo do this we recommend the Government ensures:\r\n- that all teachers have effective autism awareness training.\r\n- school councils involve students with autism.\r\n- all students with a special educational need have a  personalised plans.\r\n- the local offer proposed in the Green Paper should comment on the support available for children with autism.\r\n\r\n",
