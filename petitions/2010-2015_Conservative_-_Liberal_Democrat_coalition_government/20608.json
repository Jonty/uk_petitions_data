        "additional_details": "Police have to make cuts and that means Job losses and for each time an officer is out on Duty he/she has to do paper work which keeps them of the streets for about 2 - 4 hours so this means if nothing is done about the paper work this will cause less of the less officers to be dealing with crime and less paper work may give us enough Police on our streets.\r\n\r\nSo what I want to see is less paper work to Police Services.\r\n\r\nPlease make a move and sign this petition today!",
