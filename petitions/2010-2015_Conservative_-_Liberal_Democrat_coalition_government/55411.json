A standing ticket at the o2 on the 1st April 2014 is being sold for over \u00a3120. This is appalling and not uncommon.\r\n\r\nThis leaves these events of cultural significance completely out of reach for a vast majority of society.\r\n\r\nI propose a ceiling of a MAXIMUM price, of \u00a349.50 for these types of tickets to allow everyone the chance to participate.\r\n\r\nWHO AGREES?",
