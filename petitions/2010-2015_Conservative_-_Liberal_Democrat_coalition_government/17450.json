        "additional_details": "I created this petition in the hope that young people especially, will be better educated about abortion in FULL detail in the near future.\r\n\r\nI was only educated on abortion very briefly in R.E (surprised it wasn't Biology) in my 3rd year at Grammar School. Many knew the word, but nobody had a clue on methods, mothers welfare etc. We were old enough to take in what was being taught, but it was an awful lot to work out in our heads in so little time.\r\nIt concerns me how little time was spent on it and how little people knew given the age of some pregnancies.\r\n\r\nI propose educating ALL young people THOROUGHLY on the issue in 2nd or at latest 3rd year at Secondary School. Include the likes of the welfare of the mothers, aborted babies that survive, the lot.\r\nIt's a big choice for all involved, with big consequences. Lets at least make sure people understand it as best we can.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading. I appreciate your time whether or not you decide to sign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
