It should not therefore be an excus for the parties to decide among themselves who is fit to govern.\r\nIf a party is elected by a majority it would not be premissable for them to hand goverment to another party of their choosing therefore please can the government explain the legality of the third place party deciding on the outcome of an election, surely this is AV by proxy? If a coalition government is a necessity then surely it must be formed by definition of the parties with the two largest voter results.",
