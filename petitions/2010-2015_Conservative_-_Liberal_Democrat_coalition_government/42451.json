        "additional_details": "William (not his real name) is a young man that received a criminal record for travelling with the wrong ticket. He was returning his sister\u2019s disability freedom pass when he accidently used it. Then a ticket inspector lied and said it was just a warning. As a result of this lie William admitted he had used it on purpose as he is incredibly shy and suffers from anxiety so he just wanted to get out of there.\r\n\r\nHe thought it was a warning so he was shocked to be summoned to court and receive a criminal record for an incorrect offence.\r\n\r\nWilliam is a friend and he has lost everything. He had to leave is university due to the stress resulting in him wasting thousands.\r\n\r\nWilliam is constantly depressed and has lost a dangerous amount of weight and he has become a shell of himself. He has truly lost everything as a result of a lie.\r\n\r\nI ask that a retrial is given so William can sort this situation out. I am really worried about him so please help him.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",
