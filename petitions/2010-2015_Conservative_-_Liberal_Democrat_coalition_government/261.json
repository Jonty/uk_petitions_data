        "additional_details": "I would like HM Government to recognise the events that overtook the Armenian population [of what is now E Turkey] around 1915 as 'genocide'. HM Government to follow the lead of EU partners - such as France & Austria - who already recognise those events as 'genocide'. As part of a parliamentary discussion, MPs should consider whether the terrible Jewish holocaust/genocide differs from that which overtook the Armenia population [of E Turkey] around 1915.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, why, since the Jewish genocide has been officially recognised by HM Government, is it the case that the Armenian genocide remains unacknowledged - given the criteria set down in the 1942 UN declaration on Genocide?",
