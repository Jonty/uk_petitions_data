        "additional_details": "Those who are unemployed and choose to find employment by starting up their own business should be supported by the government. A loan is available via a third party but the legal issues surrounding this are draconian and could get new business directors and proprietors into serious debt. A grant of at least \u00a32000 for each new business start or company start would provide a solid financial base to start with. Many businesses are failing due to a lack of practical help (that could be provided by professional ex-businessmen  perhaps) and financial help which does nothing for our economy. The grant could then be paid back at a reasonable rate through the tax system once the business has reached a financially stable level. Should the business/company fail the money could then be paid back over a five to ten year period by the director/owner at an affordable rate for them.",
