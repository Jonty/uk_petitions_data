        "additional_details": "We recently lost our son at the young age of 25, who was born with biliary atresia, he recieved his first liver transplant in 2007 and was awaiting his second in 2013. He wasn't treated as a priority due to the NHS predefined liver allocation policy, a priority is classed as per the attached link, someone who has abused their body through drug or alcohol overdose. http://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/about_transplants/organ_allocation/liver/liver_organ_sharing_principles/oss_liver_11-2007-1.doc\r\nHe left behind a little boy of 4 years old and therefore lifestyle and age should be considered. A point scheme should be generated to prioritise a person and treat them as a life not just a NHS number.\r\nPlease sign so that no other family has to go through all the heartache and mistrust in the system. Why should an alcoholic or self inflicted person have priority over people that want to live, pay their taxes and pay for their healthcare. ",
