Since that promise was made, life sentences have all but become meaningless with the average time spent in prison by a criminal who pleads guilty to killing another human being has reduced to 7 years.Even the indeterminate sentences, meant to keep dangerous criminals in jail, have proven to be just as feeble .I propose that murder and manslaughter should carry a whole life tariff which means the criminal dies in jail.",
