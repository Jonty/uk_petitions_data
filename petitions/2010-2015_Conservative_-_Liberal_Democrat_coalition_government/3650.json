        "additional_details": "Currently the UK has a Space agency however its presence on the world stage is mediocre at best,\r\n\r\nWith the collapse of NASA's shuttle programme this timeframe proves a purfect opportunity for the UK to enter the space race as a world player,\r\n\r\nbeing an economic superpower with the worlds sixth largest economy surely a nation as developed as ours should be able to afford such technological innovation,\r\n\r\nThe UK already has a developed space industry with many satellites made in the UK, surely it should be custom to also place these sattellites in orbit.\r\n\r\nThis petition supports the debate on the funding of a British Space Agency to rival that of the EU, Russia and Nasa,\r\n\r\nWith funding into more advance spacecraft such as the Skylon spaceplane the cost of sending people into orbit is significantly reduced to reasonable levels.\r\n\r\nMake the first man on Mars British, support this petition!",
