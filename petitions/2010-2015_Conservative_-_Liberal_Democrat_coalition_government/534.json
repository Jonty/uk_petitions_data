        "additional_details": "The current system of road tax is a tax on ownership rather than use. This should be abolished and the tax put on fuel as required, therefore you only pay tax for the fuel used and distance travelled. Larger engined cars will pay more tax as they are more inefficient and therefore use more fuel, keeping the current green credientials of the system.\r\nBy putting the tax on fuel, the drivers who travel the furthest will have to pay the most tax. For example a lot of elderly drivers do far less miles than average yet still have to pay the same rate of road tax.\r\nIt will also encourage people to use the right vehicle for a journey, without tax on ownership this allows people to buy more than one vehicle and therefore use a smaller car for commuting, while keeping the larger family car at home for use at the weekend. This would help environmental targets and potentially boost the car industry.",
