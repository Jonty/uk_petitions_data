        "additional_details": "As a young person in full time (higher) education I believe that it is important to have work experiance as well as qualifications. When job seeking, I have found that most employers (when asked about u18 pay) have stated they will pay the nmw of \u00a33.68. The petition calls for the national minimum wage for under 18's to be raised by 50p to \u00a34.08. I beleive that this low rate of pay for under 18's is detering many young workers (in and out higher full time education) to not to seek work. If the minimum wage for under 18's is raised many more young people would be adamant to find work.",
