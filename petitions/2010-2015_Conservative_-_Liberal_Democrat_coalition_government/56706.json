        "additional_details": "Chris Thomas is a family man who relocated to Canada and married and had children. Chris was left with a brain injury due to meningitis and fought for his life in a Vancouver hospital. He remains in hospital being treated due to his serious brain injury. Before Chris was taken ill he had separated from his wife but remained & continued to work in Canada to be with & support his Children - He is still in hospital in Vancouver where he has been since February 2013 being cared for & receiving treatment but is all alone as his family and friends are all in Liverpool, UK. Chris's family need to bring him home but the Department Of Health will not give him the treatment or care he needs here as he has been out of the country for more than five years - so he is now alone in hospital thousands of miles away and without the love and support of his family and friends. We need to bring Chris HOME to the UK to his family - please sign this petition and help bring an ill man home where he belongs.",
