This, in my opinion, will alienate a vast resource of potentially outstanding and engaging teachers. If we do not prevent this we will end up with people going into teaching for the wrong reasons and becoming the type of teachers that we all knew and only learnt resentment from.\r\nEducation does not make a teacher. A teacher makes an education.",
