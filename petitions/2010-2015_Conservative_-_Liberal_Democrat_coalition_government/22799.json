        "additional_details": "Begin the building of modern carbon capture and storage coal powered electricity generating stations. Then proceed to bring coal mining in the UK back to previous highs to power our country from our own resources. Given that energy costs are set to increase dramatically over the next decade and that the UK has many decades of supply of coal, NOW is the time to utilise this resource. This would also generate hundreds of thousands of jobs at a time when they are most needed.",
