        "additional_details": "Kibworth high school want to change their school from a middle to an 11-16 school. However this will reduce the amount of places avaliable for pupils as they cannot increase their intake. This has meant that some schools in the catchment area will miss out on a place as the school wants to change its admission rules. These are pupils that go to St Cuthberts, Foxton and Billsden primary schools. It is proposed that Kibworth do not make these changes and remain as a middle school because of the impact  this will have upon the villiages and childrens education and emotional health.",
