Under a bilateral trade agreement with China, our unemployed workers who are persistently difficult to place in work could spend a two year term working in China as guest workers. This would free the UK from liability for paying benefits, and give the person valuable experience of being in the workplace.\r\nThe government should immediately open dialogue with this potentially important trading partner to initiate this program.",
