We would like to see government intervention to persue this. PDA has been recognised as a form of autism for over 30 years with the National Autistic Society, yet getting a diagnosis through the NHS is a postcode lottery. This condition affects hundreds of children and their families, yet because of lack of diagnosis, there is also lack of support. ",
