        "additional_details": "We are a small group of students who believe in Justice for youth crime. We think the way in which the government deals with youth crime is not sufficient. Sometimes when a child or teenager goes into youth offenders, they turn out worse than they were when they went in. We think that the government should not send young criminals to youth probation centres or youth offenders where they can share stories with peopel who are similar to them, instead they should share themselves with the victims and ask victims to help them change.",
