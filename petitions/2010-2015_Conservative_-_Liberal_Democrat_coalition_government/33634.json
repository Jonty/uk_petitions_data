        "additional_details": "Paying almost as much for water as I do for electricity when one is freely available and falls out of the sky, is treated and piped and the other has to be generated from fuels whose prices are rising across the world, before any distribution costs is insane.\r\n\r\nIn addition with the flooding of May 2012 it seems crazy that the message delivered is that it is acceptable to continue a hosepipe ban. Clearly with Climate Change leading to increasingly volatile weather patterns it seems long overdue for Government to force suppliers to invest in better and larger storage facilities, especially in parts of the country where there has been rapid population growth but no investment.\r\n\r\nThe recent flooding has shown that the UK, an island nation, does have enough water, but due to inefficiently and complacency it is being wasted and underused.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call for Government to force this long overdue investment and protect this basic human right and the mark of a civil nation.",
