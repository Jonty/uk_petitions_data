        "additional_details": "Car insurance for young males in comparison to young females is unfairly and extremely disproportionate.\r\n\r\nAs an 18 year old apprentice me and my family struggle to afford my car insurance for my 1.1 litre car (\u00a32800) to be precise. However if I was female I could insure the same car for 1050. Even if I had my license for a year and collected a years no claims, my insurance as a male would still significantly be higher than a female being insured for the first time. If the situation was vice-versa, I feel there would be an uproar as it would be deemed 'sexist'.\r\n\r\nI feel car insurance for you males should be lowered or at least raise females in order to compensate for lower male premiums.",
