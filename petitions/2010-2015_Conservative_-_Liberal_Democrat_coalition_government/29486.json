        "additional_details": "We believe that it is unethical to pierce any part of a child under the age of 10.\r\n\r\nMany mothers tend to pierce their child's ears for pure vanity, we believe the age should be raised so a child can make their own choice if they would like their ears pierced.\r\n\r\nJust because they may not remember the pain does not mean they cannot feel the pain.\r\n\r\nHaving a piercing at such a young age is a safety hazard as children under that age (especially babies and toddlers) will play around and mess about increasing the risk of infection and tearing the tissue from knocking the jewellery.\r\n\r\nIt would mean a lot if we could re-consider this current  rule, and only allow children aged 10 (with parental/guardian permission).\r\n\r\nThanks.",
