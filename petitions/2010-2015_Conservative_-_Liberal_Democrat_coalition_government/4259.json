        "action": "Reverse devolution and restore all powers to Westminster",
        "additional_details": "The devolution experiment has been a resounding failure. We now find ourselves in the ridiculous situation of having four governments in the same tiny country, all battling each other for power, all with their own enormous bureaucracies, all adding thousands of unnecessary workers to the public payroll... talk about \"big government\"! Devolution has proven to be inherently unfair and has left Britain riddled with inequality. The West Lothian question remains unanswered. People who are the \"wrong type of British\" face discrimination under the veil of devolution, such as English students having to pay thousands more than their Scottish counterparts. And it's now blatantly obvious where devolution is leading us \u2013 towards the breakup of the United Kingdom. I want this farcical, grotesquely expensive experiment shelved once and for all. I want us to revert to the simple system of one person, one vote, one parliament. If you agree then I urge you to sign this petition.",
