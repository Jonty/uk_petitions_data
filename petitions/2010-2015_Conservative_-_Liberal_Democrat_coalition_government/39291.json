        "additional_details": "The Government should demand that hospitals employ sufficient staff on A&E to assess and treat seriously ill patients within 2 hours and send home non urgent cases who can be seen by GPs.\r\n\r\nThe Government should ensure that reception staff record the time that it takes for each patient to be processed and fine hospitals that do not do so.\r\n\r\nAll patients should have the choice of filling in a multiple choice feedback card that can be processed electronically to assess patient satisfaction. This would be fed into a box and results displayed in A&E showing the current percentage patient satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the Government should increase funding to cover the cost of additional doctors and equipment. Current situations where people spend 5 hours or so at A&E are inhumane.",
