This including going to fair grounds, parks, amusment parks, etc.\r\n\r\nThe reality of it is that if a know child sex offender is going to these types of places clearly shows their intention to re-offend.\r\n\r\nThe only way to prevent them re-offending is to put legal restrictions in place preventing them from entering any place intended for under 18's and preventing them from being in the company of a minor without supervision from the childs parents/guardian.\r\n\r\nPlease help up take this to the top and make our voices heard.",
