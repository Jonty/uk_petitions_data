        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to honour their pre-election promises to ammend the Extradition Treaty (described by the present Attorney General Dominic Grieve as \"crude and clumsy\" and \"diluting the safeguards protecting British Citizens\"), and to bring into effect the 'forum' amendment (proposed in the Police & Justice Act 2006) to amend the Extradition Act 2003, to prevent the unnecessary and punitive extradition of UK citizens to foreign countries where the conduct alleged has taken place in part, or in whole, on UK soil. We further call on the Government to give urgent consideration to incorporating all of the recommendations of the 15th Report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, published in June 2011, dealing with the UK's extradition arrangements, and finally we call on the government to show respect to e-petitions that have exceeded 100,000 sigatures by having a full commons debate.
