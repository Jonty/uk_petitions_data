        "additional_details": "The government should force mobile telecommunications providers across the UK to make usage of SIM only deals cheaper than mobile phone contracts.\r\n Currently, if you subtract the cost of a mobile phone from a mobile phone contract and then compare the remaining sum of money to be paid out over the contract duration, with a SIM only deal that has the same contract length, and that offers the same amount of minutes, texts and data, you will see that the SIM only deal costs more in most cases.\r\nThis actively encourages a consumerist society where people keep buying mobile phones which of course have an impact on landfill sites. Even recycled mobile phones results in some hazardous waste which is unnecessary, and could easily be reduced. Therefor the government should actively provide an incentive to consumers for using SIM only deals and provide incentive for affiliate businesses such as http://www.comparisim.co.uk and mobile providers who work toward this goal.\r\n",
