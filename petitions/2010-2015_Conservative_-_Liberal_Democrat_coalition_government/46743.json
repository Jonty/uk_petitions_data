        "additional_details": "It has come to light that member of the Digital Spy Forums that goes by the name pinkteddyx64 has unfairly been banned from the Digital Spy Forums. Long story short, he posts some quite interesting threads and replies to threads, and when a lot of the other forum members criticize his threads and replies to threads in a very negative sort of way, they usually got away with it, with pinkteddyx64 being the one to recieve the unfair bans.\r\n\r\nNow, I implore the Minister to get involved in this case and put it to the owners of the Digital Spy Forums that this guy, pinkteddyx64, is harmless in comparison to the vast majority of other Digital Spy forum members.",
