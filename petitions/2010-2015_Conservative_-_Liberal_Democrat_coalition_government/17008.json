        "additional_details": "PLEASE SIGN IT !!\r\nThousands of tonnes of asbestos could be dumped close to one of region\u2019s biggest supplies of drinking water. Councillors in Bath and North East Somerset Council have rubber stamped a plan to use a quarry near Chew Valley Lake in Somerset to dispose of up to 645,000 tonnes of the substance, despite strong objections from the company that controls Bristol Water, which serves the city and many parts of Somerset. Bristol Water says the plan by a Cheshire company to use Stowey Quarry to dump asbestos presents a real danger to the drinking water.\r\nInformation taken from Bath Chronicle + Western Daily Press.",
