        "additional_details": "Our existing coalition government is comprised of Conservatives with 307 seats, and Lib Dems with 57 seats, making a total of 364. Meanwhile the Labour Party have 258 seats. Our political system, like most others, is two party adversarial. This petition proposes that in the event of one of the two major parties having the most seats but no majority after a general election they are required to form a coalition with the second strongest party. This act would rid us of the preposterous current situation where a party with less than 10 percent of parliamentary seats is in government and a party with about 45 percent is not. If coalitions are to work they should not include fringe parties, leaving 40 to 49 percent of voters disenfranchised.",
