        "additional_details": "There is a genuine housing crisis brewing in the United Kingdom. The average houseprice is about 6 times the average national salary. This is not good for the economy, the country and society at large. Many people are simply priced out of areas, limiting life changes and encourage deprivation.\r\nI believe a government scheme aimed at building large numbers of social homes is needed. The project would be long term and all upfront costs would be returned by rents paid my tenants. Tenants would not be able to buy the property but (assuming they comply with tenancy agreements) they should have a 'home for life'.\r\nThe rents would be affordable for those working at the minimum wage/living wage standard.\r\nThis policy would create employment in the all important construction industry, producing a positive result for the economy & government as well as ultimatly reducing crime and improving aspiration for those who will never be able to afford a home.",
