        "additional_details": "The X1 bus service run by Ensign Bus Co links Thurrock to Basildon, especially to Basildon Hospital.  Ensign intend to cancel it from 19/4/2013, but this will cause hardship to residents of Grays and Chadwell St Mary who don't own cars and who need to access the hospital as out-patients or to visit family and friends who are in-patients.  We therefore ask the DfT to investigate ways to enable this service-route to be retained, either provided by Ensign Bus Co or another bus company.",
