        "additional_details": "Under the future restructuring of the Territorial Army (TA) it is planned for a disbandment of The Royal Mercian and Lancastrian Yeomanry (RMLY) in favor of a Scottish Yeomanry.\r\n\r\nThe RMLY has proved itself to be one of the best recruited TA regiments in the British Army contributing above its quota to recent operations. The regiment has delivered all that has ever been asked of it and been held up as an example of its kind. Recent recruiting activities have shown an ability to attract applicants far in excess of those required to sustain manning.\r\n\r\nThe government promised no loss of 'cap badges' and a fully resourced reserve. The proposed disbandment of the RMLY in favor of headquarters hundreds of miles outside the regimental area breaks both of these pledges.\r\n\r\nThank you for supporting our e-petition so that government might rethink the future of this fine regiment continuing to up hold the values of the modern British Army.\r\n",
