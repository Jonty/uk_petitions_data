        "additional_details": "In response to recent news on Birmingham which could lose its second city status, one of the major factors which is leading to this decline is the fact that the public transport in Birmingham is heavily reliant on buses and it is time for the Department of Transport to help Birmingham with expanding the Metro that currently only goes to Wolverhampton across the whole city to neighbouring businesses such as the Fort Shopping Centre which is only accessible by car.  The positive impact of this change would be seen instantly.",
