        "additional_details": "Quality newspapers play an important part role in informing democracy but with the advent of new media, newspapers like 'The Guardian,' 'The Telegraph,' 'The Independent', 'The FT,' and 'The Times,' are struggling to adapt and are facing ever declining circulations.\r\n\r\nWhy not use part of the license fee to subsidise each printed copy or each 'hit' on the websites of quality newspapers? The BBC, which does a great job at broadcast news, is currently in direct competition with the websites of said newspapers, and takes people away from the detailed written analysis available in quality newspapers. Why not redirect some of the money used at the BBC website to quality newspapers?\r\n\r\nThe independence of newspapers would be guaranteed in a similar way to that the BBC.\r\n\r\nIt would also help to keep costs down to ensure access to quality news for those on low incomes.
