We were always supposed to be animal lovers in this country but millions of these animals have terrible \"scientific\" experiments done on them, are left in great pain and trauma, but now it seems that clubbing them to death is the way we deal with them when they have given their utmost. It is wicked and barbaric. I fear that man is becoming very like his ancient ancestors.",
