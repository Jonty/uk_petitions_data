        "additional_details": "Over the past 24 years Joseph Kony and the Lord's Resistance Army have been terrorising Uganda and other nations East Africa, kidnapping children to force them into sexual slavery or to fight as child soldiers. In 2011 the USA sent a force of military advisers to aid the Ugandan military in their attempt to capture Kony and bring him to justice for crimes against humanity. In 2012 there will be a global effort to make Joseph Kony famous and in doing so pressure the United States government and governments around the world to take action and help stop the terror Kony is inflicting on children across East Africa. We call upon the UK government to join in this effort and lobby the USA to provide Uganda with all the help they need to arrest Joseph Kony.",
