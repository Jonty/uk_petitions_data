When it was launched by the then minister of health, Aneurin Bevan, on July 5 1948, it was based on 3 core principles:\r\n\r\n\u2022 that it meet the needs of everyone\r\n\r\n\u2022 that it be free at the point of delivery\r\n\r\n\u2022 that it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay\r\n\r\nThese three principles have guided the development of the NHS over more than 60 years and remain at its core.\r\n\r\nNHS services are free of charge, except in limited circumstances sanctioned by parliament.\u201d\r\n\r\nGeneral taxation has already paid for all NHS services, including dental provision; Dental treatment should be free to all, inline with mainstream NHS services.\r\n\r\nI petition the Government to remove NHS dental charges for OAP as they have paid the longest into it.
