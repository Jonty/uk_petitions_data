        "additional_details": "We are once again in \"winter fuel allowance time\" an extremely welcome one off yearly payment; a financial leg up for all people over sixty years of age. Why the Gonernment never considered the severly impaired population under sixty years of age is beyond me. They have the bigger need for a winter fuel payment; especially the wheelchair users. Please sign our petition to try and change this injustice. ",
