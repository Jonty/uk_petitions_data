This will greatly reduce the complexity of tax law, and make it much more difficult for those affluent individuals and corporations who currently employ lawyers to find and exploit loopholes in the law to evade tax. This measure could raise sufficient revenue to make current plans to cut public services unnecessary, and will only take money away from people who can easily afford to pay it.\r\n",
