There are now thousands of \"valid\" current e-petitions with no easy way for the public to find one they might completely agree with (and therefore wish to sign). This makes it almost certain that a popular theme with many hundred e-petitions will not achieve 100k votes for any 1 e-petition even though the aggregated total for similarly-themed e-petitions might exceed that total. Solution: government to review similarly-themed petitions close to the 100k & email a new composite e-petition asking those who have voted if they wish to vote for the new one.    ",
