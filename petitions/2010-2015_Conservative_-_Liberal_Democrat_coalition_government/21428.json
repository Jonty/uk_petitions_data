        "additional_details": "Petting farms in the UK are buying or borrowing baby animals, often days old, at the beginning of the tourist season in order to attract children and families. They then cynically discard them some four of five months later, either back to the farms for slaughter or, in the case of the pet animals, through the local press.\r\n\r\nAmongst these animals will be calves taken prematurely from their mothers intentionally so that they can then charge the public to bottle feed them. Some even claim some element of education though it is difficult to imagine what such practices teach the children about the care or good management of livestock or pets.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of good education of our children in the responsibilities incumbent on humanity regarding the well-being of those animals under our care and the sustainability of good animal management such practices should be abolished.\r\n\r\n",
