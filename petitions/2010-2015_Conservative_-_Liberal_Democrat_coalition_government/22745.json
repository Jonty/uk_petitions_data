        "additional_details": "Why when the government places duty on the cost of fuel, do we have to pay VAT on the duty as well! VAT stands for Value Added Tax and is a tax on the purchase of goods and services.\r\n\r\nAt present the actual cost of fuel per litre stands at approximately 52p, that is made up of 45p for fuel and 7p profit for the fuels station. If VAT was paid on this amount alone, the VAT would be only 10.4p, whereas we also pay VAT on approximately 70p - 80p of fuel duty.\r\n\r\nSurely this is not right and we need to stop paying tax on tax. If this situation was changed the price that everyone pays at the pumps would drop by upto 20p per litre (depending on where you live in the country).\r\n\r\nI therefore propose that VAT is only chargable on the actual cost of the fuel not on the duty as well.",
