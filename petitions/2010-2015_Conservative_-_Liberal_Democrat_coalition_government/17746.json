This is clear discrimination and makes a mockery of the concept of being British. The UK is one country and those born south of the border should not be treated any differently to those born to the north. In addition to this blatant discrimination why are British tax payers, in these difficult economic times, paying for foreign students to receive a free education?\r\n\r\nThe action I would like the government to take is fair tuition fees, regardless of where in the UK you are from.
