        "additional_details": "Secular humanism is demanding the outlawing of creationist teaching in schools in favour of evolutionary theory. This is wrong because a) evolution is not proven and all evidence is circumstantial (it can be used to demonstrate either evolution or intelligent design), and b) free schools are being started by Christians who are sick of the poor standard of liberal state education and have a right to choose what their children are taught - what right do secular humanists have to interfere with that? Christian education has been shown to be superior to the state system concerning moral standards, so leave this to the parents to choose.",
