I want the government to support people on benefits/pensions and low income with the cost of living on a special diet. Gluten Free bread, pies and pasta etc. are approximately 4 times the price of  regular  bread, pies and pasta. I want the help to be an independent allowance that is not counted as income. Being able to afford to eat a healthy balanced diet that complies with a persons special dietary needs would in time have a positive financial impact on the NHS.",
