        "additional_details": "I believe that this idea for longer school days and less holidays is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nUnderstand that families need time together; by introducing longer school days would be cutting into time you are meant to be spending as a family unit.\r\n\r\nAre you really going to be saving money by allowing mums to return back to work; as once you have paid extra for teaching staff, extra wear and tear on school building etc does it balance the books; I think not.  If the government looked at themselves and stopped claiming for all and sundry instead of having taxpayers pay for hired trees in the halls of parliament; or sub canteen or yes moats around your 2nd homes this might start to improve the UK.\r\nWhy is this important?\r\n\r\nIt's not important it is essential - family units have to work together from teaching right and wrong; learning life skills to be a child not  an android in society. There are enough pressures on children from an early age and yet trying to impose more.",
