Transparency and honesty are critical to ensure the most painless of procedures.\r\n\r\nWhen selling, you are often put under immediate pressure to organise your finances, find new premises and have all the required paperwork in place. You may even need to pay a cash deposit, or when relocating, travel far and wide to find the place of your dreams - All to make way for a buyer who, to the best of your knowledge, has nothing but good intentions to carry out the purchase of your property. All in all, it often involves emotional, as well as financial attachment when finding your new home.\r\n\r\nIt is because of these reasons that buyers must be held liable for the financial burden caused in the event that they pull out of a purchase.",
