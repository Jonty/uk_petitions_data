As responsible dog owners we want to be able to give our dogs the freedom of play without worrying about if they will get knocked down by traffic.  Somewhere we can keep loose dogs away from and off children's play areas.  As responsible dog owners we don't want to leave any smearing of dog poo in an area where children play.   This e-petition is asking local government to create a Dog Park in Boston, Lincolnshire.",
