Breeding schemes of native horses and ponies are not managed effectively inparticular that of the welsh ponies. Markets are inundated with substandard breeds that sell for less than \u00a310. Equines are shipped out of the country for slaughter for the European meat trade.\r\nWe are calling for better regulation of breeding using the following methods;\r\nGelding of all horses as soon as they are sexually mature which do not meet a minimum standard. Owners should have to apply for a stallion licence.\r\nMares used for breeding via Artificial Insemination must be approved for breeding suitability by a Veterinary surgeon.\r\nBreeding tax on all foals bred and registered.\r\nTighter controls on native equines left to breed on the commons, Hills and Moors Including a temporary withdrawal of stallions for a set period to reduce breeding.\r\n\r\n",
