        "additional_details": "As most leading economists now agree, the belief that by taxing the richest very lightly, they will be encouraged to invest, and the economy will grow to everyone's benefit, has proved to be wrong, I call upon the government to change it's taxation strategy of the richest 1%.\r\n\r\nThe richest 1% have doubled their wealth in the last 6 years, whilst most working people have seen their own living standards fall.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be right, and cannot be allowed to continue.\r\n\r\nWhy should FTSE100 directors see annual pay increases 10 fold that of their workforces?\r\n\r\nI thought we were all supposed to \"be in this together\".\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition, get it to the 100,000 level, and get which ever party wins the election in May 2015 to debate it!
