We propose the immediate adoption of a programme similar to the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program, which has been used as a model for other states' own medical marijuana initiatives and registration systems.\r\n\r\nWe furthermore demand a moratorium on the current laws and penalties regarding medical users and growers,  if said patient meets the requirements stated in the model programme, and chooses this alternative course of treatment.\r\n",
