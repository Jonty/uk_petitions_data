        "additional_details": "This is a petition is for all the betting shop staff who are made to work alone, in fear, afraid of attack or robbery and for the families and friends of those employees affected by single manning.\r\nIt needs to be compulsary for ALL bookmakers to have more than one member of staff working at any time.\r\nThere are many robberies and attacks everyday in this type of industry and although ending a single manning rule may not end this completely it can act as a deterrant to robbers and make employees feel much safer.\r\nPlease sign. This needs to be the biggest petition yet. Employees have become seriously injured, traumatised and even killed. Betting shop companies cannot keep pretending that this is okay.",
