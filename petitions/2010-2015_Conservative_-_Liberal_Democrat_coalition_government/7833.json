(Genesis 17:7-8)\r\n\r\nAnyone/nation involves in dividing the Holy Land will pay a heavy price (Obadiah 1:15)\r\n\r\nIt is God who owns the land of Israel - He gives it to whoever He wishes. (Act 17:24)\r\n\r\nPsalm 125:2 as the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the Lord surrounds his people both now and forevermore.",
