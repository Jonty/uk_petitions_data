        "additional_details": "Sky is a beautiful 5 year old girl... A girl like any other child her age except for one thing - Sky uses a wheelchair as her main way of getting around.\r\nI have never seen such a determined and amazing girl - a child that wants nothing more than to stay at school with her friends.\r\nThe problem is the Headmaster of her current mainstream school has decided the school can no longer cater for sky after year 2 (she is currently in year 1). Why... Simply because he doesn't want to.\r\nEveryone understands that changes will have to be made to the schools academic structure, changes that parents will support. ",
