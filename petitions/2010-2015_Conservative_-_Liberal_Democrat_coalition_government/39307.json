        "additional_details": "This central government post was abolished in 2011. Without a key figure in a specific Governmental role to co-ordinate all UK efforts, this topic risks being further marginalised. This petition asks that the British Government re-instate the post at the next cabinet reshuffle. Doing so will raise the profile of the practice and enable educational and preventative initiatives to be implemented nationwide. Campaigners need a central spokesperson with a voice in Government who will stand with us to see this cruel and inhuman practice stopped",
