The video showed that there are children in our country that only have toast to eat. The plea was to provide \u00a32 a month (\u00a324 p.a.).\r\n\r\n Our government on behalf of UK citizens will be donating \u00a311.5bn over the next four years to overseas aid.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to ask our government to take \u00a31m a year from this budget for the next four years for deprived children in our country and donate it to Save the Children expressly for that purpose.\r\n\r\n In doing this it will help 125,000 children out of poverty in our country over the four years, while having little effect on the aid we provide overseas and no affect on the tax payers of this country. Please support this petition.\r\n",
