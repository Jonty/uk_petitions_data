        "additional_details": "The existing e-petition site allows an e-petition to be set up, and for people to sign it. However, when an email is sent to the person signing, it requests that they confirm that signature. On clicking this link one is unable to approve it, as the site doesn't link correctly to the appropriate page, or says page not found. I request that this site is upgraded whereby professional IT personnel are able to correct the errors, and ensure that there is sufficient capacity in the system, so that it doesn't keep crashing. This e-petition appears to be the only way of getting that message across..................",
