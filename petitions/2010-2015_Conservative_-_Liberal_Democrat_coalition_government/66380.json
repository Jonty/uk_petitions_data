        "additional_details": "I have a number of credit cards with large balances which never go down due to the extortionate interest rates. I would like to be able to convert the credit card debts into loans and cancel the cards. I can't because I'm told that I cannot afford the loan repayments, yet I've been paying the interest on the credit cards for decades. It should be a right for a citizen of this country to convert a credit card debt into a loan at the standard high street bank loan interest rate, without having to go through all of the affordability tests. Also, doing this should not affect any credit rating.\r\n\r\n",
