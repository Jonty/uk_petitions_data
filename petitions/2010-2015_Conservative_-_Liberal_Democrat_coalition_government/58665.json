        "additional_details": "I think it is wrong that many disabled people and other vunerable groups are undermined by social workers who come across as knowing it all better than the clients. In reality they can be taking decisions for disabled people they themselves make in everyday life but as non-disabled people. They are deciding what is reasonable or unreasonable for disabled people. For example, how long it takes to shower or expecting the person to shop online when they may not want to do so but go outside to do it. I want to see more personalisation, less charges for social care, and the cost of money paid to those who calculate these charges publicly disclosed, which is where I believe savings can be made for the disabled and vunerable in our soceity while their own privacy is properly safeguarded. Social care charges can force them to pay out when they have not designed, structured or personalise their own care in their own way for their own lives.",
