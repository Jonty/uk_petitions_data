This will certainly help to solve crimes, even those committed decades ago, as well as to help to deter crimes.  The civil liberty considerations should be focused on the right of individuals not to become victims of crime and having perpetrators of crime dealt with accordingly. Some people are in the misapprehension that recorded DNA profiles can be used to detect genetic illness or clone whole individuals. This is not so, as a small DNA sequence will not be able to do this. DNA profiles should be recorded and archived even more securely than birth certificates, driving licence, passport presently are.",
