        "additional_details": "I would like the government to enable legislation to stop owners of football clubs from re-branding, changing the name, team colours etc. without proper consultation of the fans. I feel that our football heritage is being damaged by wealthy owners/businesses who do not have the clubs' best interests at heart and do not fully understand the impact that these changes have on the supporters.",
