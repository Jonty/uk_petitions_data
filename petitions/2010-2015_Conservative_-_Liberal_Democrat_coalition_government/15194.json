        "additional_details": "We petition the Prime Minister to promote through, the National Health Service a regulated ultrasound scan for females of childbearing age.\r\nAffecting around 10% of females of childbearing age, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is the leading cause of infertility. Other risks affecting PCOS sufferers include Endometrial cancer, Type 2 diabetes, Hypertension, Kidney problems & Heart disease. In addition to these risks PCOS has a host of awkward symptoms including Obesity, Acne\r\n& Hirsutism\r\nPCOS is often left untreated & undiagnosed. The public must be made aware of both the multitude of symptoms & potentially fatal consequences arising from PCOS. Sufferers, together with friends & family of those affected, feel the Government is doing little to increase awareness & offer support.\r\nThe NHS Cervical Screening Programme, (NHSCSP) is a well respected programme and a similar programme for PCOS should be introduced, with the possibility of incorporating it into the existing NHSCSP.\r\n",
