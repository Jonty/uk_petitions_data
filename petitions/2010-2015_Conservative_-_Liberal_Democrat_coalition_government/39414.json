Gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgenders should be allowed equal rights.\r\nI feel so strongly about this as I, a girl, wish to marry my girlfriend some time in the near future. Civil-partnerships aren't the same as a marriage, although they are both beautiful symbols of love.\r\nLEGALIZE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. ",
