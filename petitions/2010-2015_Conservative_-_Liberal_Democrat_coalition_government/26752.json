We are constantly told entrepreneurs will leave the country if the higher rate is increased, this is rubbish, properganda by the likes of Murdoch. Call their bluff and increase the upper rate of tax to a minimum of 75%. Protect lower paid by increasing personal allowance to \u00a310,000 and change to higher rate to \u00a350,000.\r\n\r\nFinally help world situation by suggesting all G20 do the same. Massive poverty levels in all these states is a disgrace and a sleight on the ruling classes.",
