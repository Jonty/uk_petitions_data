Also there is significant prove that god doesn't exist so your lying to kids by making them say prayers. When I was at primary school I got in a lot of trouble for not praying in assembly and I was so stubborn they just gave up on me. Teaching kids medieval beliefs instead of the truth is disgraceful so please strip all c of e schools of there church of England status. Also ban other religious schools in the UK.",
