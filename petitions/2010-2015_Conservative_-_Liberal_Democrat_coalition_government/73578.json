        "additional_details": "Since the obesity crisis hit the UK, many people with no experience and no recognised nutritional qualifications (qualifications from recognised national bodies (city&guilds, for example) have jumped on the 'weight loss' bandwagon.\r\n\r\nThese people not only call themselves 'nutritionists' or 'wellness coaches' without qualfications, but also give advice to people often without the legal authority to do so.\r\n\r\nBecause the public are so desperate to lose weight/be healthier, a lot of this 'advice' is taken as red, which is not only legally wrong, it is morally and ethically wrong too\r\n\r\nSo, I am asking that regulation of the 'wellness' industry is tightened up for the sake of the safety of the general public, and that ONLY those with professional, recognised qualifications have the right to (1) use the term 'nutritionist' and (2) give advice to the general public with respect to health, wellbeing and weight loss",
