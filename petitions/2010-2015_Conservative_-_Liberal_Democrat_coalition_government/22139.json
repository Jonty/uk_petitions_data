        "additional_details": "CtL pays up to \u00a3160pw (\u00a3175pw in London) per\r\nchild towards the cost of registered or approved\r\nchildcare for teenage parents in education. It is\r\ntargeted at some of the most vulnerable\r\nlearners: 71 per cent of recipients are in receipt\r\nof income support. The total cost of CtL is around \u00a339m per year at present. The Department for Education is proposing to cut funding to this astonishingly successful public policy intervention that for 77 per cent of young parents is essential to enable them to access education. DfE is consulting on four options: making CtL discretionary; means-testing CtL; reducing the weekly payments; or removing entitlement to those aged 19 at the start of their course. The DfE's favored option is the last \u2013 but CCNSU rejects all these options and believes it is imperative CtL is not reduced in any way!!",
