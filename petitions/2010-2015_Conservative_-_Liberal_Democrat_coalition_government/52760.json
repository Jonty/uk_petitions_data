        "additional_details": "The welfare bill of over \u00a395 Billion and rising is not sustainable. I am amazed that \u00a325000 is a amount that can be currently claimed. This should be reduced to at least \u00a320000.. Most people in UK do not earn \u00a325000 a year and the Cap should reflect what we as nation can afford. The money saved could go into lowering Business taxes and projects that are wealth creating and Job creating. ",
