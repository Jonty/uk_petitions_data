I URGE TO CREAT DIFFERENT TIERS TO THE NATIONAL REGISTER AS YOU CREATED SICNE 2011. OTHERSIWE TO DISSOLVE IT AS THE NATIONAL REGISTER HAS LITTLE IMPACT NOW .\r\n\r\nOTHERWISE IF THE NATIONAL REGISTER WOULD STILL EXISTS I BELIEVE IS FAIR THAT ALL QUALIFIED INTERPRETERS JOIN  IT. OTHERWISE THE NAME WOULD BE NATIONAL REGISTER FOR INTERPRETERS AND TRANSLATORS WHICH IS NOT THE CASE.\r\n",
