        "additional_details": "Since its foundation in 1993, the CSA has been ineffective in its role of assessing and enforcing CSA Payments, the institution also fails to command an appropriate level of respect. In fairness to CSA staff they do not have sufficient powers to make an accurate assessment furthermore nor do they have strong enough powers to implement any decisions. We propose that enforcement of new and existing assessments is transferred to HMRC with immediate effect as they have all necessary powers. This would also help with the Governments deficit reduction programme by eliminating bureaucracy. Furthermore these measures deliver fairness, transparency and quality of service in general to mothers, fathers and children. Payments should be collected directly, in line with income tax and national insurance: i.e. included on PAYE payslips and on self-assessment forms. The Deputy Prime Minister has previously suggested a very similar policy and we call upon him to set about the legislative process.",
