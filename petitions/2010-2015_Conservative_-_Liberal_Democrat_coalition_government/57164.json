        "additional_details": "What is tongue tie?\r\n\r\nTongue tie occurs when the piece of skin under the tongue (frenulum) is too short and tight, restricting the full movement of the tongue. It is a hereditary condition affecting up to 1 in 10 babies. It can prevent the baby latching correctly onto the nipple and can lead to the following:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tNipple soreness and damage\r\n\u2022\tMastitis\r\n\u2022\tProlonged and frequent feeding\r\n\u2022\tFailure to gain weight\r\n\r\nIf it is not treated quickly, it can ultimately lead to the baby being weaned from the breast.\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n\r\nIntroduce a mandatory check for tongue tie in the routine postnatal examination. If tongue tie is present this will be followed up by a midwife or lactation consultant before the mother and baby leave hospital. If problems with breast feeding are present, an urgent referral will be made for revision (frenulotomy).\r\n",
