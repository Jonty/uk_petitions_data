Although her previous statements may have been extremely offensive ( her vile attitude towards overweight people and towards children from a poor economic background), her recent messages have not only supported the murder of innocent Palestinians (she says \"restart the bombing campaign\") but have also categorised the race as \"dirty rodents\". Public figures are frequently investigated for much milder statements and she deserves to face justice for publicising such distasteful and thoughtless opinions.",
