        "additional_details": "We hereby request that all tax on pensions be scrapped. Having worked hard and made pension provisions for our old age, we now face a tax on that pension. We consider this unjust when the Government squanders huge amounts on non important projects, and foreign aid when pensioners in our own country are struggling to make ends meet. Scrapping all tax on pensions would help all pensioners and support those who have contributed to this Country through tax and national insurance contributions throughout their working lives.",
