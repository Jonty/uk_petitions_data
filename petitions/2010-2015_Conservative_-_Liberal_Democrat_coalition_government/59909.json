        "additional_details": "Child has been prohibited from membership in his most local community scouting group, despite no fault of his own. The Cub unit has space and he has been made the written offer of a place which he has accepted. This child is part of his local community but is not being allowed to continue to be part of the group. I believe this exclusion goes against the all inclusive nature of what scouting was set up for and believe that scouting or any local community groups should be available to all in their most local community where there is space available. Community groups should be inclusive and offer a full equal opportunities policy. This petitions aim is to make sure a community is for all to be part of not just an exclusive and chosen few, while others have to go elsewhere. I hope that the local decision to prohibit inclusion in the most local group with his peers will be overturned so all can enjoy. ",
