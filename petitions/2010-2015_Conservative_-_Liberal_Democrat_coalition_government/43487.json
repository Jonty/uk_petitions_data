        "additional_details": "Why everytime I walk through my local shopping centre, high street and general urban area's are there so many gambling shops? If I walk around Liverpool city centre there are close to 20 different \"bookie\". What is the justification for this? The machines used inside drain money from the local people, the majority of these people tend to be living on the poverty line. I challenge anyone to compare the same bets, same stakes and at the same frequency to prove they are as equal as their Casino counterparts.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition is designed to get the government to curb the amount of bookmakers and their machines in poorer regions. And to also start banning new bookmakers and their gaming machines opening up, once a threshold is met.",
