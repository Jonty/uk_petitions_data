        "additional_details": "Sir Norman Bettison is, as of this writing, the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police.\r\n\r\nIn April 1989 he was a senior officer with South Yorkshire Police and subsequently took part in South Yorkshire's internal inquiry into the Hillsborough tragedy (which the publication of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report has shown to have been compromised).\r\n\r\nDespite the report absolving Liverpool fans of blame, he continues to insist that the fans made the police's job \"harder than it needed to be\".\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence for his claim.\r\n\r\nIn light of his \"contributions\" towards the discredited South Yorkshire post-Hillsborough inquiry, and his continued insistence of fan culpability, we do not believe he is fit to serve as chief constable of a police force.\r\n\r\nWe call upon Her Majesty's Government to remove him from his post.",
