        "action": "Reject EU proposed legislation disallowing vehicle modification",
        "additional_details": "The EU is proposing legislation tightening Type Approval laws to prevent either modification of, or fitment of after market parts to motor vehicles, and to severely tighten testing. This will raise costs for ordinary motorists as well as preventing many people from pursuing what until now has been a legitimate hobby, giving employment to many. Moreover many vehicles already modified will be rendered unusable. Tests are proposed for trailers (including caravans) below 3.5 tonnes, and for vehicles more stringent testing including checking for modifications, and this will cost everybody more.\r\n\r\nEspecially at this time of economic austerity, the government should reject this proposed legislation as unwarranted and unnecessary interference in the existing national arrangements which have proved satisfactory over many years, and if it is allowed to become UK law will have a severe impact on private individuals  industry and the economy.\r\n",
