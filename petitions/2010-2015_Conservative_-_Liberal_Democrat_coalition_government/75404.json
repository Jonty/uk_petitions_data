Add an hour, and the majority will be travelling home in the light.\r\n\r\nThe benefits would include:\r\n\r\n1. Reductions in road fatalities and serious injuries.\r\n2. CO2 emissions reduced\r\n3. Happier people (less S.A.D.). Increased natural Vit D production. Increased exposure of body's light sensors.\r\n4. More opportunities for family time, sports, leisure and gardening to improve people\u2019s wellbeing and health.\r\n5. Reduced energy bills\r\n6. Increased tourist income by \u00a33bn per year.\r\n7. Sharing same time zone as many European countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial should start in 2016 when British Summertime (GMT +1hr) will be observed from the last weekend in February. This will SHORTEN WINTER psychologically.\r\n\r\nThis can pave the way to a discussion about British Summertime (GMT +1hr) lasting through the winter.\r\n",
