This problem is probably due to poor understanding by the staff of the present 111 service  who do not have basic knowledge of medical matters.\r\nThe use of retired doctors at nominal expenses, located at the supermarkets dotted around the country could be a way out. The supermarkets open for very long hours and hence could host these centres at minimal disturbance to their services.",
