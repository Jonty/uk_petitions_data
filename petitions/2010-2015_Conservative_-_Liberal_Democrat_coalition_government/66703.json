        "additional_details": "Recipient's of Child Maintenance must be asked to provide proof that payments have not been received, as well as the payee providing proof that payments have been made directly via Standing Order.\r\n\r\nAfter providing numerous statements to the CSA, along with standing order set up sheets, filtered print outs of standing order payments. The only evidence that CSA will accept that payments have been made to the recipient are statements with the reference of 'maintenance'. As it is a standing order, the payees statements do not contain the reference, whereas the recipients do. The CSA, however, refuse to request the statements of the recipient and continue to take her verbal claim as definite.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this petition is to have equal rights when challenging a CSA decision.",
