        "additional_details": "Recent policy announcements - such as DfE\u2019s desire to replace GCSEs with the EBacc - have been heavily criticised by organisations, such as the UK statistics authority, for being based on flawed interpretations of raw statistics.\r\n\r\nBy way of a solution to this problem of poor understanding and use of statistics, this petition requests that all current and prospective Members of Parliament are required to possess at least a GCSE equivalent of grade C in Mathematics, the three sciences (Biology, Chemistry and Physics) and English.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of ensuring a base understanding of these subjects within the UK\u2019s political elite is that MPs would be better versed in understanding statistics and the interpretation of them, and would avoid the more common statistical mis-interpretations for which they have been criticised.",
