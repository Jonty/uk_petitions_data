Whilst it is right that anyone working with young people or vulnerable adults should be fully checked, it is not right to allow the process to be inconsistent in regards to time frames. local police forces should not be allocated 60 days to complete their checks, they should be given a maximum of two weeks.to assist people into employment. The crb process should not have to check previous local authorities if the applicant has already provided clean CRB searches for these addresses.  In short any criminal information should be centralised, to ease administrative difficulties.",
