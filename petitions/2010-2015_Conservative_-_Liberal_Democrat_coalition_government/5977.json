        "additional_details": "Convicted paedophiles can never be rehabilitated and the current system of releasing them very lenient sentences places children at risk. Therefore it would make sense to castrate them as they will lose their urges and could be successfully reintroduced into society. Many paedophiles would actually welcome this as they know what they are doing is wrong but often they have no control over their desires.",
