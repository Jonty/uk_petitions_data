        "additional_details": "The Race For Life is a fundraising event that helps raise money for the research into ALL types of cancer. Originally, this superb charitable event was designed to raise awareness of women's cancer. However, since the late 1970's in Great Britain, the incidence rates for all cancers combined has increased by 20% in males. This leads me the ask \"Why is the Race For Life a women-only event?\"\r\n\r\nCancer is not gender specific, so why is the Race For Life? In 2009, cancer cases in the UK for women totalled 158,170. For men, this number was actually 162,297. If this life threatening disease affects anyone, then anyone should be allowed to participate in the event. My argument would increase the raised money dramatically and would help develop the research into cancer - potentially saving thousands of lives each year!\r\n\r\nI aim to make the Race For Life open to both genders and an event in which people unite to help spread the awareness of ALL cancers.
