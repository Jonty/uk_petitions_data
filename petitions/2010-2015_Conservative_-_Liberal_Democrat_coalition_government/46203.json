        "additional_details": "According to the Guardian \u201c2bn tonnes of food are wasted every year\u201d an alarming amount by any measure, but a tremendous opportunity rears its head; if we can manage the waste better in a way that we can make use of it, we must do it! Surrey County Council is already running a scheme that separate food waste from general waste; so that they can make use of the food waste to make compost. This could be put to better use in one of the soon-to-be-closed power plants for regeneration or updating to a biogas facility that will eventually produce compost from the slurry that is left behind. If every council would set up at the very least one biogas power plant, to collect bio-degradable waste from homes and businesses and process it through the biogas system. The gas can then be used to either warm homes or supply electricity.",
