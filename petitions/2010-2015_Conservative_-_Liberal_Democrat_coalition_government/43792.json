        "additional_details": "We are calling for the government to investigate the lack of action over the inaccessibility of polling stations to wheelchair users.\r\n\r\nA survey carried out during the 2010 general election showed that only 59% of polling stations provided level access, and only 62% provided low-level booths. (Scope, Polls Apart). This is not only unacceptable but also against the law. We would like the government to investigate how these failings were allowed to occur.\r\n\r\nPrevious governments have argued that disabled people have access to the postal vote system. There are many reasons that this response is inadequate, not least that voting on polling day is an important civil right. We urge you to support this petition so that disabled people are granted this right by the next election, due in 2015.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found on the website of World on Wheels, a pressure group campaigning for equality, at www.world-on-wheels.org",
