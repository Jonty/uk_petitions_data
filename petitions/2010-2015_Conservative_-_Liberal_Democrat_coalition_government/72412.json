In some cases, as much as 7-8 weeks before Christmas, 'Mirth' is imposed upon us through both visual and auditory stimulae. I hereby call on the government to restrict the practice of 'Mirth' to the traditional expectation or no more than two weeks before, and no more than two weeks following the date of December 25th.\r\n\r\nI would also like to suggest that Government introduces legislation that allows for a 2 month TV licence fee break for those that find BBC radio programming introducing Slade records in mid-November offensive.",
