        "additional_details": "The intoduction of HS2 to the country in 2033, is an embarrassment. The fact that China as a prosperous country can have thousands of miles of high speed rail, and us as a proud nation struggle to introduce such an ecomonically viable way of growth. We cannot be allowed to be left behind in the 'global race', we need to keep up, and allow our country to prosper as a result. The announcment of the 2011 census, provides reason for this argument, and ultimately would provide stability and growth for a struggling nation. ",
