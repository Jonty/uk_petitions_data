        "additional_details": "On the 13th January 2015. The Tory led Leicestershire County council voted to close a much loved museum in our area.\r\nSnibston discovery centre, in Coalville Leicestershire.\r\n\r\nInstead, they plan to sell off the land for further housing development.\r\n\r\nIt's a disgrace. When museums in London get millions in government funding so that they can be kept running and free to enter and yet Snibston only costs \u00a3900000 a year to run.\r\n\r\nThis is an important heritage site that is used by  local schools and visitors to the National Forest in which Coalville sits.\r\n\r\nWhy is it the rest of the country has to watch London always get major attractions, events, sporting events, which is all paid for by our taxes and yet our local attractions have to close.\r\n\r\nThis has to stop and the government needs to dig into its pockets and find money to keep our local attractions open.\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition for the government to start funding to keep Snibston Discovery Centre open.
