        "additional_details": "The NHS needs to acknowledge that gym prescriptions will benefit those suffering from anxiety and depression so much more than a typical long-term supply of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication.\r\n\r\nTaking solace in the gym is much better than waiting for a next dosage of medication that has several side-effects; including tolerance, dependance, and in some cases suicidal tendancies.\r\n\r\nIt's naive to think a pill will solve everything. Exercise truly is such a beneifical way to improve our lives in so many ways. Yet, we're still not seeing more memberships on the NHS?\r\n\r\nThe benefits would be in plenty. The health of patients would be in such better shape, in so many areas.",
