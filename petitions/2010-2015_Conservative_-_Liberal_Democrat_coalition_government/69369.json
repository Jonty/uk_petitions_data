        "additional_details": "A conservative estimate of 1,400 victims has been made for this scandal, with some cases reported girls being doused in petrol, threatened to being burned alive.\r\n\r\nThe reality is, these are not their only victims, their parents, their family, all of whom will be forever scarred, and will never get their original life back.\r\n\r\nThere are criminals getting 11 years in prison, and some getting as low as 4 years in prison.\r\n\r\nWhat message does this send to other aspiring rapists? It tells them that they will get off lightly with organised gang rape.\r\n\r\nWhat of those who have failed to do anything to stop this scandal? What of the political correctness going on for years, labelling these men as Asians, rather than Pakistani?\r\n\r\n\"The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.\" - Albert Einstein",
