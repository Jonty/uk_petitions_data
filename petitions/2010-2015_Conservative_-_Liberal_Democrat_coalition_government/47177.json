        "additional_details": "Over the last decade Britain has seen a baby boom on a scale not seen since the 1950s, when it was understandable as the population had been depleted during wartime. But this is alarming. Our depressed economy cannot afford the high welfare bill, and our already crowded island is on course to become Europe's most populous country, with over 70 million inhabitants and no end to the relentless growth.\r\nThis needs to be controlled. It's not just about limiting immigration. It's time for the goverment to ditch the political correctness and make family planning an issue, for the good of the whole nation. Limiting child benefit to a woman's first 2 children (in most cases) should help to bring the birthrarte down.",
