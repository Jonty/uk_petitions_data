        "additional_details": "We want Police & local authorities to take this issue seriously, taking action against those who obstruct pavements.\r\n\r\nGetting about safely on pavements is essential.\r\n\r\nIn too many places, drivers park on pavements - mistakenly thinking they are doing the right thing by keeping the road clear.\r\n\r\nThis means that blind & partially sighted people may collide with cars parked on pavements potentially causing injury. If cars don't leave enough space people with sight restrictions, mobility problems, wheelchair users, or people with small children in buggies may have to walk into the road to be able to pass & this obviously means they're at risk of being hit by other traffic.",
