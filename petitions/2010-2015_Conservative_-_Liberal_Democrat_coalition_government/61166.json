This could be administered by a local Veterinary Practice.\r\n\r\nThe sole responsibility would lie with the owner to renew yearly. Failure to do so would result in a substantial fine, the animal being removed and/or a relevant punishment.\r\nI am sure Responsible Owners would gladly support this and hopefully in time animal cruelty would be a thing of the past in the U.K.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
