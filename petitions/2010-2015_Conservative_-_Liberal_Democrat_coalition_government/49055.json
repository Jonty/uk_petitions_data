        "additional_details": "Michael Gove has performed dismally in his role as Secretary of State for Education, making a series of ridiculous proposals that make of a mockery of the teaching profession. Not only has he never been a teacher, but he thinks he has the authority to constantly undermine our fantastic profession. He has no idea what children need in schools, or how they learn. He should be removed from office and replaced with someone more suitable for the job.",
