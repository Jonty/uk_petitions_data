        "additional_details": "The cost of a single trip from Surbiton to London Waterloo on an oyster for an adult at peak times is currently \u00a35.90. This is due to Surbiton being a London Zone 6 station. However just down the road is Berrylands station and the cost of the same trip at the same time from Berrylands is \u00a34.90. This is because Berrylands is a London Zone 5 station.\r\n\r\nSurbiton is the main station in the Kingston Upon Thames area with trains to London Waterloo pass through very frequently. Berrylands has 1 train to London Waterloo every half an hour.\r\n\r\nTo boost the local economy and encourage a greater use of public transport, Surbiton Rail station MUST be reclassified as a London Zone 5 Station.",
