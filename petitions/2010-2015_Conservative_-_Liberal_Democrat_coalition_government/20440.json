We cannot afford to be sending millions of \u00a3's abroad where it is proven the money lines the pockets of the corrupt organisations (Governments) and very little of the amount goes to the individuals of these nations. For decades this country has sent millions and millions in aid to poorer nations and the nations are no better off in fact many are worse off.",
