Offenders should be made to improve the physical appearance of our communities, by clearing and cleaning the streets, repainting and repairing and rebuilding property damaged during the riots.\r\nHM Government should also consider extending the Community Payback, so that offenders should be made to complete longer community rebuilding exercises, which help to improve the overall appearance of our civic spaces and which helps to instill pride in the public realm.
