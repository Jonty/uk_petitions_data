        "additional_details": "To the House of Commons , I Adrian Grocott an Englishman, who has spent over 25 years serving Her Majesty in her Armed Forces and Emergency Services. Declares that the individuals responsible for the horrific, barbaric and senseless attack on a member of the HM Armed Forces  in london today should be denied medical and legal assistance provided by the tax payers of our land. As they clearly do not respect our democracy and freedom of speech this country allows, they should be denied the benefits of them. In place of their treatment and legal expenses I would like to see the monies donated to our Armed Forces killed or wounded trying to uphold what our country stands for. I therefore request this petition,  should it reach the 100000 signatures,  be debated  in the House of Commons in accordance with the E-petitions website",
