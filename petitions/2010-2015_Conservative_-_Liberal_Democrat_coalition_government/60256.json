It will target issues that, rather than being solved by throwing money at the problem, requires a concentrated targeted effort to build a long term solution.\r\nHaving a large idle workforce is unacceptable when there's vital work that needs to be done, at home and abroad. It would improve relations with other countries and get you a hardworking adaptable workforce, with an ever expanding skill set, ready to come home and get jobs, knowing that they have helped make the world a better place.\r\nTo quote the character Jim Trott, \"No more children dying, when we do actually know how to save their lives. No excuses. No more.\"",
