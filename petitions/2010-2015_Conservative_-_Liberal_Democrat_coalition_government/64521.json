        "additional_details": "From the 30th of April 2014 SUBWAY\u00ae branches across the UK and Ireland decided to sell only Halal meat. This replaced popular meats from the menu with religiously accepted substitutes. There wasn't any consideration or public vote of any kind before this decision.\r\n\r\nAs customers we should have a choice of what meat we choose to buy. There is nothing wrong in a Halal selection for religious customers, like we have vegetarian options. But it is unacceptable to remove all meat and not consider the opinion of everyone else.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to make SUBWAY\u00ae realise their mistake, and to consider further meat options for their branches. Otherwise they have made a huge controversial mistake and are segregating the majority of their customers.",
