        "additional_details": "I understand that children should attend school as a matter of course and that regular absence from school is a problem. However I also understand the benefit of family time and  holidays. Travel to new and exciting places can give children an education that they cannot get in a school environment and it can also build a confidence and develop an interest and a practical and physical  understanding of other cultures. This new system that fines parents for taking a child out in term time also does not allow flexibility for the many parents who cannot get annual leave at the same time as their children through work commitments. I feel this new fine system lacks a true understanding of  the everyday working family and needs to be reviewed and I request all, that are reading this to sign the partition and spread the world.\r\n\r\n",
