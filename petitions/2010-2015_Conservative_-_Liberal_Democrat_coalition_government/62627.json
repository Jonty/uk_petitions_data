        "additional_details": "Every year thousands of young people travel to the UK on a working holiday visa and most of them meet the love of their life whilst over here... But once their visa has expired they are expected to return to their home country to apply for a partner visa which may not be approved which also cost a lot of money. These rules are absolutly ridiculous! Please sign my e-petition for my visa for love if you have been or are currently in my position",
