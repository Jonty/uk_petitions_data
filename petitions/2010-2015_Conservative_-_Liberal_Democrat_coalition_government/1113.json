        "additional_details": "The EU is practically running Britain. Our MPs are emasculated, our Justice system is over-ruled on a daily basis by unelected, obscure officials - we no longer control our borders, military, aviation, etc., etc - in short, Britain has been subjugated by faceless, bureaucratic quangos - add to this the myth perpetuated about our trade with Europe which, if sound, would be largely unaffected if we left the EU, together with the now inevitable collapse of the EU currency and fiscal system - it is now clear that there is only one way for us to go - OUT NOW!  We were promised a referendum, which has been reneged upon - it is time to deliver on this promise! ",
