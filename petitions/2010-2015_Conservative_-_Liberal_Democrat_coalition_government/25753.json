We strongly recommend that the business of the House of Commons be improved if the Members reviewed their own systems to create a more efficent place of work: to  encourage courtesy; to not insult colleagues; to cut playfulness; to ensure serious debate; to listen to each other without interruption and to work together wherever possible to the greater good of this country,  demonstrating they recognise the purpose for which the public have voted them into the House.\r\n\r\n",
