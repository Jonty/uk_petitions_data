The population of Scotland and Wales do not pay for their prescriptions even if they work, yet we in England pay \u00a37.40 for each item.\r\n\r\nThis is clearly not fair to the population of England and needs to change.  If Scotland and Wales paid for their prescriptions the price of prescriptions for all would be more affordable.",
