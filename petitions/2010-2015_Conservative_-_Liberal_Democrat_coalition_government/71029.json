        "additional_details": "Police officers of the MPS have a difficult and dangerous job, facing possible injury or even death to serve and protect us.\r\n\r\nAt the moment the terror level on police is at an ultimate high. Recently in the news 5 men have been arrested for suspicion of terror on police. 218 terror-related arrests have been made this year.\r\nYet why are officers still being made to go out single crewed (on their own)?\r\n\r\nA single police officer is surely an easy target.\r\n\r\nWhat this petition asks is that police officers should be made to go out with a partner when going to an unknown situation while the terror level is high.\r\n\r\nWe must remember police officers are people, they are husbands/wives, fathers/mothers. We must look after our officers as they look after us.\r\n",
