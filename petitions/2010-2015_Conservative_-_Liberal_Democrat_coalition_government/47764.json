        "additional_details": "To form a cross party working committee to look at restricting pension age benefits to those below the Personal Allowance Income Tax threshold. In a capitalist society, where the over 65s are the most asset rich group, it is patently unfair to tax the working age population to subsidize the costs of prescriptions, dental care, public transport and fuel costs UNIVERSALLY for those often in a far stronger financial situation than the young. These \"universal\" benefits should be targeted at the poorest pensioners only AND SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED FOR THIS GROUP. This would assist those in genuine need and  reduce the burden, significantly, on the Social Security Budget.",
