        "action": "Outlaw petrol sales to untaxed, non-MOT'd, un-insured vehicles",
        "additional_details": "There are simply too many vehicles on the roads today that are being driven illegally, and which are both a huge cost burden to all law-abiding drivers & potentially dangerous for other members of the public.  Whilst the police can use methods such as checkpoints & ANPR systems to identify potentially illegal vehicles, they are totally overwhelmed by the challenge, and likely to be ever more so in the future as police budgets are cut and car numbers increase.\r\n\r\nThis petition proposes that it becomes a legal obligation of all petrol sellers to validate potential purchasers on their forecourts before they are able to dispense fuel to a vehicle.  An uninsured, unsafe vehicle with fuel is a dangerous weapon; the same vehicle without fuel is both useless and unusable.  The technology (ANPR) to underpin this proposal is already well proven, readily available, AND already installed in most forecourt operators (for tracking drive-offs), and therefore requires no significant investment.",
