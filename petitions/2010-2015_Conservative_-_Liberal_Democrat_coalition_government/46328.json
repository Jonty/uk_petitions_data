        "additional_details": "It's time that our leaders made saving Britain as a nation a priority. For instance, Britain only produces 2% of the World's co2, yet our leaders would have us believe that by adopting so called 'Green Policies' we can save the planet. WE CAN'T! Very soon we will have higher fuel bills and the spectre of power cuts due to our Government's obsession with tilting at windmills. Let's save Britain first, the planet can wait. It's been here umpteen billion years, a few more while we put Britain back on it's feet won't make any difference.",
