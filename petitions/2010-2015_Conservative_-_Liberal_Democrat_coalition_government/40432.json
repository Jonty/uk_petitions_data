This means in the event of a puncture you have to call out the breakdown services.\r\n\r\nWaiting for a patrol to arrive can take up to 2 hours leaving a car in potential danger on the side of the road, causing a hazard and inconvenience to other road users.\r\n\r\nI believe this is dangerous and Spare tyres should be compulsory.",
