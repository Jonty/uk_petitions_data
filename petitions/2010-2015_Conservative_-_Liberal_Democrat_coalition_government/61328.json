        "additional_details": "At present, Boston and Skegness travellers hoping to spend a day in London have to drive to Peterborough to take a direct train to King\u2019s Cross, or take a train from  to Grantham, changing to take a direct train, again to King\u2019s Cross. It came the local newspaper in 2011 that rail bosses have drawn up plans for a direct line running from King\u2019s Cross to Skegness - which would make access to the capital so much easier. Plans was to run four trains per day, which could raise more than \u00a32 million per year. The proposals - which would include stops at Spalding, Sleaford and Boston - was put mooted in the Network Rail 2016 Capacity Review which document shows an \u2018aspiration\u2019 for a line linking London King\u2019s Cross to Skegness. Nothing has been finalised so far.\r\n\r\nProposal: We people of south Lincolnshire want a direct rail link from Skegness and Boston to London.\r\n\r\n",
