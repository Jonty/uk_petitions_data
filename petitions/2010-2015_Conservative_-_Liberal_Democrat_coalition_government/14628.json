        "additional_details": "Yorkshire was founded as the Angle Kingdom of Deira in 626 by King Edwin after annnexing the ancient kingdoms of Dunoting, Elmet and Meicen to the lands of Ebrauc and Deywr already under his father's control. That territory had had remained 'Yorkshire' until 1974 when, without reference to the Yorkshire people, great tracts of land, including many towns and villages were placed in neighbouring counties whilst the rest of the former great county was divided into several new counties and autonomous authorities.  'Yorkshire' now only has an historic meaning. No current map will show its existance as a single entity.  We want the government to reinstate Yorkshire to its pre 1974 boundaries  as a single county with internal administrative districts.",
