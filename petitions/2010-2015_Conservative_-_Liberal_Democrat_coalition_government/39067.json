        "action": "Change Government's school transport policy",
        "additional_details": "The Government give due consideration to amending the Home to School Transport Guidance and Education Act 1996 with a view to reducing the distance from 3 to 2 miles for children aged 8-16 years before they qualify for free transport, thus avoiding age discrimination. Furthermore, the guidance pertaining to what consitutes a \"...reasonable safe route\" is flawed and inadequate. It is contended that such routes should have at least street lighting, should not be too isolated and should be safe without the need to be accompanied by an adult.\r\nFree school travel should be more widely available to families on low incomes. Currently, only those families with their maximum entitlement to working families tax credit who reside over 2 miles away from their school qualify. This should be amended to include families with any earnings replacement or means tested benefit or tax credit regardless of the rate payable.  ",
