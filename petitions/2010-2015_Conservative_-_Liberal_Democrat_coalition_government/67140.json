Veterans should not have to hope that when they need help to deal with the trauma of war, some charity or other may be around to help as the NHS is woefully ill equipped to deal with PTSD associated with military service.\r\n\r\nI would request that you support mine and other ex-military families in advocating the following changes\r\n\r\n1.\tProvision made within the budget to facilitate suitable after service care for veterans experiencing mental illness.\r\n2.\tEnsuring that all veterans have access to a clearly defined \u2018care pathway\u2019 which brings together the right skills, services and specialists properly equipped to support the treatment of PTSD.\r\n",
