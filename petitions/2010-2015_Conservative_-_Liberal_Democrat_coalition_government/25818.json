        "additional_details": "Currently Magistrates can only sentence animal abusers to a maximum of 6 months imprisonment even though the law has a maximum tariff of 51 weeks.\r\n\r\nBecause animal abuse cases are prosecuted by the charitable funds of the RSPCA these cases never reach Crown Court where the maximum penalty can be given.\r\n\r\nWe the petitioners want to see Magistrates being able to fully implement the law and allow sentencing of up to 51 weeks imprisonment for those convicted of Animal abuse.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n",
