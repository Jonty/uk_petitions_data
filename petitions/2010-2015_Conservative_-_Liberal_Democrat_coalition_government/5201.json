        "additional_details": "Higher education \"top up\" fees should be completely eliminated, as they do nothing more than create a barrier to access to higher education for the poorest students.\r\n\r\nIf current financial means do not permit the funding of all higher education places, then funding should be allocated on the basis of academic merit. This will ensure access to university places to the brightest students, regardless of financial means, even if this means a net reduction in the number of higher education places which are funded.",
