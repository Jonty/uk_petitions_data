        "additional_details": "We the people of Shropshire demand a review of Ambulance provision in Shropshire. Patients are lying in roads waiting for Ambulances, critically children have been delayed getting to Hospital due to delays in Ambulance attendance. Ambulance crews are under severe pressure due to the lack of front line Ambulances. Ambulance staff are feeling undervalued because of this situation. We the people of Shropshire support our Ambulance crews and implore you to look into the severe lack of Ambulances.",
