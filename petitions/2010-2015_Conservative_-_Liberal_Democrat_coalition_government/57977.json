This is wrong when so many people in the UK are facing  unemployment and austerity. This government should be putting to the welfare of the British people first.\r\n\r\nWe oppose these changes and propose that anyone who has paid into the state pension fund for most of their working life is entitled to the terms they were promised at that time.\r\n\r\nWe want to be paid our State Pension at 65 as promised and to see the Additional State Pension paid to those who were previously due to receive it.\r\n\r\nIf a Private Pension Provider was to act as the government have they would be prosecuted.\r\n",
