        "additional_details": "The site at Shoeburyness ran by Qinetic should no longer be used for testing bombs and commercial disposal of explosives by detonation given close proximity and amount of people nearby along the coastline.\r\n\r\nThe vibrations radiate along the East Coast, and is worse on dull overcast days as the shockwave travels further, causing vibrations to houses, windows and conservatory roofs similar to earthquakes even 15 miles away. There are email alerts weekly but this disruption happens randomly & disturbs the peace of not only us, the citizens, but pets and wildlife, which is also terrified by the explosions.\r\n\r\nLocal MPs can't help us despite raising this in Parliament and the official line is that the noise levels couldn't possibly cause this - well it does.\r\n\r\nThis should be relocated to a more remote location offshore, perhaps also somewhere not near the Nuclear Waste site at Bradwell.
