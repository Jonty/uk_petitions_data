        "additional_details": "David Cameron has decided not to take part in a head to head debate with Ed Miliband and to only take part in a seven party debate. This is more then simple 'cowardice' as alleged by some. This is a cynical attempt to win the election by relying on unfair advantage. The conservative party has been bankrolled by wealthy individuals and as such has three times the funds to fight the campaign as the labour party. The media is also owned and controlled by corporate business interests in this country meaning that most TV and radio stations and newspapers are conservative with a small if not a large C. Cameron is aware of this and is hiding behind this unfair advantage. The Dep't of Culture Media and sport should therefore instruct the BBC to go ahead with these debates withour him.",
