I propose that a complete review of traffic lights be carried out and when there is a low amount of traffic during weekdays and weekends (Sunday especially) traffic lights be switched off. Do what other countries do which is to have the amber light flash to make sure drivers are aware there is a junction or hazard, it works, less pollution, keeps traffic moving and is a greener option.
