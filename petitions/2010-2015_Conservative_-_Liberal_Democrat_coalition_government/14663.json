        "additional_details": "I would like there to be more recognition and awareness of Selective Mutism among Health, Social Care and Education professionals. This would increase the chances of earlier diagnosis of the condition and a better outcome for recovery. I would like there to be a clearer more appropriate path to the right treatment and appropriate levels of support for both Children and Adults with the condition and better support for their families. It would also be nice to see some recognition from the government of the existence of Adults with the condition who have been failed by systems that should have been there to help them as children to overcome the condition, but failed to even recognise it. I\u2019d like a commitment for the future to improve the outcomes for both Children & Adults living with Selective Mutim.",
