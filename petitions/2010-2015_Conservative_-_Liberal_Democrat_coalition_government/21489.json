        "additional_details": "When the coalition government came into power they changed the rules for pensions/benefit rises from RPI  to CPI.\r\n\r\nHaving mismanaged the inflations rate they are now actively seeking to move the ''goalposts'' again and move to an average yearly inflation rate of 2.5%. This means that the government would not pay the CPI rise of 5.2% in the 2012 benefits/pension increases\r\n\r\nThis will disadvantage thousands of people in receipt of benefits and thousands of pensioners who have an annual inflation rate in excess of 7% due the huge increase in energy costs.\r\n\r\nThe government should honour their pledge on CPI and increase benefits/pensions by the 2011 5.2% CPI rate",
