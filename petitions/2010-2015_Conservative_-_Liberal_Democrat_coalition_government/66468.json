        "additional_details": "The situation currently exists where motor insurers are allowed seven days to update the national database, used by the police, when a policy is renewed or updated. Sometimes they take much longer and make errors\r\nHowever, the police are permitted to seize a vehicle , under section 165A of the Road Traffic Act 1988, for being uninsured as long as the database shows it to be uninsured. Discretion is allowed but is rarely exercised.\r\nThis has resulted in perfectly legal vehicles being impounded illegally, and the owner has to pay for recovery in any case.\r\nThis is wrong and is bad legislation.\r\nI want the law changed so that the national motor insurance database is updated within 24 hours of a policy being changed and the road traffic act changed to remove the ability of police officers to impound vehicles on the word of a third party database that is acknowledged by ACPO to be inaccurate.",
