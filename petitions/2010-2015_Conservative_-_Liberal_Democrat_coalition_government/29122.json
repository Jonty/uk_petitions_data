These people often are bored and feel a lack of achievement. Others may feel these people give nothing back to the community despite the fact they are living of other people\u2019s money. One way this could be stopped is to make it compulsory for people living on benefits to do community work like helping out in libraries community centres and most importantly youth centres (which have been underfunded since the 1970\u2019s).\r\n\r\nSomeone's opinion about my topic:\r\n\r\n\"I was angered and disappointed when I heard tuition fees would rise to \u00a39,000, I felt that the government was letting down a whole Generation by leaving those unable to pay tuition fees upfront with debts as high as \u00a370,000 when graduating. It makes me especially angry that the present Government, of whom 23 out of 29 are millionaires, all benefited from a completely free University education.\r\n\r\n",
