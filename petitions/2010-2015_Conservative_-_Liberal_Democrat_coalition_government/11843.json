The Job center should be the only place that advertises jobs.\r\nThere are so many ways to look for a job for me its making it tougher not easier to find suitable work. You can type in a job description online and be bombarded with jobs it becomes a nightmare to actually see what your looking for or if there is really a job or some key words set by the site to draw you in. Why not make the Job center the only advertiser of jobs, if your looking for work you go to the job center not 20-30 different agencies, 100's of different websites etc What I,d love to see happen is the Job center become the focal point for people who want a job at the moment it isn't which seems crazy as people out of work will have allot of contact with there local Job center, looking for work should be easy not hard.",
