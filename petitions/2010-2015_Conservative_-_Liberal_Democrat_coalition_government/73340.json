Most of the people do not meet the requirements and with few jobs and min wage it's doesn't help those whom have no money or are deprived of a mother or father because they are in another country . We have Human rights and freedom rights . Why can EU nationals come but genuine people can't have their family without having certain tests. Lower the requirements , there are people torn between two worlds , people that didn't chose to fall in love with a foreigner it happened it's no ones fault . Give us the choice , give us the chance to be a family . ",
