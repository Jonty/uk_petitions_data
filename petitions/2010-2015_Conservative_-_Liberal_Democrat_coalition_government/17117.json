        "additional_details": "The pound has lost 33% of its value in the past few years and because we import alot of food and essential good it costs us more at the supermarket for our shopping so we need honest money. meaning a second currency that is backed by gold.this means if people wanted they would have a way out if for example the pound looses so much value that it would cost too much in pounds to buy essential food and goods.In this situation you could exchange your pounds for the gold backed currency and because the price of gold has gone up by 300% in the past 6 years this would mean it would be cheaper to buy foods and essential goods.",
