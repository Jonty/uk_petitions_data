But in many cases, that is not enough as death can be out of the blue and lifechanging, Also, depending on where the deceased lived, the next of kin have a week to clear out the home, ready for the next tenant. To do this, arrange the funeral and sort out paperwork in a week is not enough.\r\n\r\nThe govt needs to introduce statutory leave for a maximum of 6 weeks for a partner, parent or child, plus for those relatives like an aunt that raised them like it was their own parentrs",
