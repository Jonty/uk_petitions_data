        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to have a good think about about the laws that surround how bikes are allowed to swerve in and out of traffic and allowed to ride in between lanes in busy roads.\r\n\r\nBikers come out of nowhere at high speeds swerving and rushing past cars. It's up to the car driver to look out for bikers, make space to be safe and this adds to the other dozens of things that a car driver needs to be looking out for.\r\n\r\nIf they must continue to ride at high speeds, swerve in and out of lanes then please can they be restricted to be able to do this only between the slow and middle lane, where traffic is usually a lot slower than between the middle and fast lane, where cars travel at greater speeds, thus increasing the chances of an accident actually occuring with bikers.\r\n\r\nPut some of the responsibility back onto the biker. If caught inbetween the middle/fast lanes; they should be fined and be given points for not 'Thinking...CAR!'",
