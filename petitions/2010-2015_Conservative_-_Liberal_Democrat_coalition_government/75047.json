In the interest of fairness and equality and principles of the rehabilitation of offenders Act.I therefore move for the government to review their current filtering policy and allow for some or all of the convictions filtered particularly if;a significant period has elapsed since the conviction (7 years is significant), the convictions are not serious or of a sexual or violent nature, the offence is a victimless crime, the offence is not relevant to the post for which a DBS application is made, the convictions did not elicit a custodial sentence or if the custodial sentence was suspended.\r\n",
