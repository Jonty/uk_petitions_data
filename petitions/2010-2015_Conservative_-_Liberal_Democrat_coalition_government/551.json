        "additional_details": "Most local authority car parks charge an hourly rate for parking in fractions of \u00a31, for example \u00a31-20 per hour. The motorist seldom has the correct change. The machines give no change, so the hourly rate that is paid  is often much more. This should be illegal. Machines exist to give what is paid for, in terms of time. In other words, \u00a32 buys \u00a32 of time, and not \u00a31-20 of time. This is another example of local authorities forgetting who they work for. Drivers, please help me to ban this. ",
