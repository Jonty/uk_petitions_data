Groupings of MPs could be around issues and directly related  issues ONLY but NOT under a Party umbrella that covers all issues. The Cabinet and PM would be directly elected by all MPs for the 5yr fixed term of Parliament. Ministers and the PM could be removed at any time through a vote of confidence triggered by a simple majority.",
