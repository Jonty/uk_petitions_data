        "additional_details": "To assist in rush hour traffic conditions, I propose that we ban HGV's from the roads during the times of 07:00-09:00 and 16:00-18:00 to allow commuters to get to and back from their workplaces. Commuters usually cannot determine their own work times therefore have to use the roads during these busy times. Having 24 hours in a day, we still leave 20 hours for HGVs on the roads, but reduce traffic at peak times when commuters and parents of school children really need to use the roads. ",
