        "additional_details": "Boston's Ceasefire is a gang violence intervention strategy,implemented in \u201996.Before Ceasefire,Boston averaged around 100 deaths a year.By '99 it was down to 31.This approach was used in Strathclyde,Glasgow with positive results.Gangs and their activities should be identified and the nature between gangs analyzed.Community leaders should give clear messages against violence and social services/youth groups should provide education,job placement,mentoring and rehabilitation for those who want to turn their back on crime.Ceasefire deals with the overlooked issue of an exit route.Not only relying on enforcement,it acknowledges that youths need an alternative to gang life.To ensure effective targeting of resources identify gang zones and provide these areas with key infrastructure;education and parenting services,alcohol/drug treatment, prevention/intervention,and welfare-to-work support.After four months,119 Glasgow gang members had taken up the offer of a way out. Try Boston\u2019s way!",
