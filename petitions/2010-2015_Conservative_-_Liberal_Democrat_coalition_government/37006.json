There has been a very big reaction to the page but Facebook refuse to remove even though the material on it is extremely offensive, and the amount of bullying and nasty comments made to those who oppose the page is quite scary.  We are hoping that raising the issue with the e-petition, that perhaps someone in the Government will help our cause",
