For this the driver for a company receives on average of \u00a38.00 per hour rising to around \u00a310 per hour.\r\n\r\nwe would like the government to set a standard hourly rate of \u00a310 per hour for day work and \u00a325 per night if staying away from home.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility that drivers have is huge, having to take care of a coach that is worth upwards of 250K plus all of the passengers just doesn't warrant \u00a38 per hour.  all drivers in the country should be compensated by paying them a decent wage.",
