        "action": "Reissuing Of Obselete Vehicle Registrations Over 10 Years Old",
        "additional_details": "Under current government legislation Vehicle Registrations which have been scrapped/destroyed along with a vehicle in the past cannot be reissued for registration purposes in the future and the registraions are considered \u2018Obsolete\u2019.\r\n\r\nTherefore over the years a large amount of these \u2018Obsolete\u2019 registrations have built up in the DVLA Records. Therefore there are potentially large sums of money to be gained from reissuing these registrations for sale in the Personal Registraions Market. Money gain from this goes directly to the govenment which could go towards helping the  fight the deficit.\r\n\r\nThis petition puts forward that once the proper checks have been carried out that the government change current legislation so Obsolete Vehicle Registrations over 10 years old can be reissued for sale. This move would benefit the buying public, vehicle registration enthusiasts, the government itself and the country\u2019s deficit.\r\n",
