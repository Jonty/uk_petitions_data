        "additional_details": "The divorce process through contentious litigation is damaging to couples and their children.  Some limited progress is being made to facilitate mediation rather than aggressive battles over arrangements for children and finances. But a much wider range of mediation and conciliation facilities must be introduced and made available.  Steps must be taken to prevent divorce solicitors from engaging in contentious proceedings until every last avenue of amicable conciliation has been exhausted.  If the court system does have to be used, as an absolute last resort, families must be supported emotionally to limit the damage done, and solicitors, judges and court staff re-educated to behave more sympathetically and respectfully towards divorcing couples.",
