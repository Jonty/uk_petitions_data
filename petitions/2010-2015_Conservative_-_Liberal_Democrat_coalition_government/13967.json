        "additional_details": "British Parliament should be transparent due the impact it has on the lives of its citizens.  To ensure that MPs act in the best interests of the public they should be open to a formal process of challenge which is accessible to all.  Public services such as the police have these systems yet, still there seems to be no formal process to make complaints against MPs when they appear to have acted unlawfully, broken a promise, breached a code of conduct, or failed in their duty of care. An Independent Parliamentary Complaints Commission, along with a Code of Conduct, Parliamentary tribunal hearings, and a system accessible for all citizens to complain would open our Parliament to challenge, improving the quality of service it delivers to the public and would allow for real sanctions to be placed upon MPs who breach the trust of their citizens.  Our Government needs to make Parliament accountable to all citizens trough a formal system of challenge, conducted independently of politics.",
