Up to 600 chemicals are put into cracking fluids and all too-often, these chemicals leak into the natural water supply and then into the water table.\r\nHydraulic fracturing and drilling for fossil fuels have also been known to cause EARTHQUAKES which have been reported in Lancashire before.\r\nTim Farron, the local MP wants the government to resort to Renewable energy.\r\nThe Government has until Spring to decide, but this is an issue which MUST be stopped at the roots.\r\n\r\nSources: telegraph.co.uk, dangersoffracking.com\r\n",
