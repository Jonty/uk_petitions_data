It is now time to bring back national service, with the aim and goal to prevent anything like this from happening again.\r\n\r\nThere should also be a new system brought into place, which works on a 3 strikes and you are out. If a person commits three minor crimes he/she should be automatically sent to the army and serve a minimum of 1 year.\r\n\r\nIts about time the government took action and stopped this nanny state, whereby disobedient children are taught how to respect the people and places where they live or face the consequence of their actions. We have to act quickly to prevent us from loosing a whole generation to mindless violence, lack of respect and crime.\r\n",
