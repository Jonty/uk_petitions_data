National science museums play a pivotal role in educating and informing the public and developing a passion for these subjects in future generations.\r\n\r\nClosure of any of these museums would be a national tragedy and a national disgrace.\r\n\r\nThe government must ensure that adequate funding is made available to ensure these invaluable institutions remain open and free for all.\r\n",
