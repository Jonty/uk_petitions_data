        "additional_details": "Hastings is home to the largest beach-launched fishing fleet in Europe, the remains of the first castle in England to be built by William the Conqueror, a preserved Old Town and a strong local arts community. However, deprivation in Hastings continues.  This is without doubt perpetuated by the slow and expensive commute to London.  London commuters provide an important source of income for the Hastings community.\r\n\r\nCurrent plans suggest that the already poor service from Hastings to London will be reduced further.  Improved transport links are essential to the future prosperity of Hastings.\r\n\r\nWe petition the Prime Minister to promote, through the Department for Transport, a new and improved transport link between London & Hastings.\r\n",
