What chance do our children stand if they cannot even gain entry to the start of their education? This is our future generation; if this is not addressed immediately, what hope do we have as a society? Every child is entitled to an education and is required by law to attend school . This needs to be addressed ASAP, my grandson and others like him are being educationally stunted through no fault of their own\u2026",
