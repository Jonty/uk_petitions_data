What if it's a beloved pet missing from home?\r\n\r\nI'd like to change this, I'd like firstly for the law to state that a cat killed accidentally on the roads must be reported & logged. Even if its on the thousands!\r\n\r\nSecondly, if a beloved pet is killed purposely - then surely it's animal cruelty, animal murder!\r\n\r\nCats should have the same rights as a murdered dog has, no more of this \"it's just a cat, they're ten a penny!\"\r\n\r\nPlease sign.",
