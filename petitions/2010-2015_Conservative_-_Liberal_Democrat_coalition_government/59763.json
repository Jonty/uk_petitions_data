        "additional_details": "All Saints Practice in Tower Hamlets is in a complete and utter shambles, I'm sure that the following happens all over the country. I called at 8am this morning for an appointment and was told that I couldn't have an appointment as there were none available until the 2nd week in February.  I asked for a call-back from a nurse and was told that 'on the day' triage system isn't in place at the moment. This is a situation which has gone from being bad to being disgraceful. In the last few months we have struggled for my 85 year old father-in-law to get the medical treatment for prostrate cancer. It has taken a lot of phone calls and complaints to get him the treatment.  It shouldn't be this way.   The NHS on-line review for this surgery says it all.  http://www.nhs.uk/Services/GP/ReviewsAndRatings/DefaultView.aspx?id=41039   How many people are dying because of this lack of care and compassion for the community.\r\nPlease sign this petition and demand better health care for everyone now.",
