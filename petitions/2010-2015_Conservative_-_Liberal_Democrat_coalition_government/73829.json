If you have to use South Eastern or Southern Trains for the next year or so through London Bridge you should have a good case. Unfortunately we get ripped off for public transport in this country, more so London, compared to other countries. Another issue is people who live in North-East Kent have no other transport, okay if you live East, South South-West you have the underground quiet close to where you live. Let's have more investment for the North East Kent area.",
