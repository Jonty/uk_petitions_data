        "additional_details": "Touch-tone telephone menus, such as those used by Government departments, banks, etc., are neither time-saving, nor are they practical for those who are elderly, those with poor English and also those with special educational needs.  In addition, those who have rotary dial telephones are unable to use these services.  I would request a ban to these services, so that when you call one of these organisations you are put straight through to a member of the customer services team.",
