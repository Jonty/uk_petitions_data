The so called golden pensions are a myth but it seems clear no contributory pension that MPs are entitled to are in fact GOLDEN.\r\nMP's pension rights and entitlements need to be debated, the voters given full accountability for the running costs and potential running cost of the MP's pension scheme, and a full independent review (not one carried out by the MP's themselves or civil servants frightened of losing their jobs if they conclude a reduction is appropiate!!).",
