Meaning we are funding the NHS.\r\n\r\nWales abolished their prescription charges in 2007,  followed by Northern Ireland in 2010 & Scotland in 2011.\r\n\r\nBy making prescription medicines available to all has removed the barrier to work, so more people are coming off benefits. People are also managing their conditions better so the number of people admitted to hospital is lower, and therefore lessening the burden on the NHS",
