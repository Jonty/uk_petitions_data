        "additional_details": "Current road fund licence is based on the emissions rating of the vehicle.  The driver of a low emissions car travelling thousands of miles a year will generate far more green house gas than a high emmissions car driven for fun at weekends.  High milage drivers also make more use of infrastructure, which emmissions based tax doesn't account for.\r\n\r\nI propose we abolish road fund licence and add the loss of tax revenue back to fuel duty.  This effectively gives us \"pay for use\" of the infrastructure and \"pay to polute\" for higher consumption vehicles.",
