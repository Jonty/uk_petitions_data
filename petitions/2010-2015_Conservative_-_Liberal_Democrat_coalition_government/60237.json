People need to know about the rights enshrined within this document as it is seen as the foundation of any civilised society.\r\n\r\nAt home we need to ensure that each right within the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is successfully and wholly enshrined in our legal system. Human rights should be taught in schools so that children are aware of the rights they are entitled to.\r\n\r\nWe also need to be the voice for countries where many of these rights are not enforced.\r\n\r\nThe people of the UK can make a change to global human rights.",
