        "additional_details": "I believe there are so many bad drivers on the road because they have not been educated properly and have not been taught the consequences of what driving can do. This problem leaves the younger generation of this country to run riot and drive without the fear of the consequences. ift we start educating the people who are about to leave school then i believe that this would make people wiser on the roads and will help prevent so many acidents on the road. I am not asking for the age limit to go down but only that younger people start learning about the roads before they hit the age to gain a much safer place for people to drive.",
