        "additional_details": "Network neutrality is based on the principle that internet service providers (ISPs) are to treat all web traffic equally, regardless of content type or origin - for whatever data is passing from content providers to end users.\r\n\r\nCurrently some ISP (Internet Service Providers) are trotting the internet speeds of some users in order to encourage them to pay for more expensive plans.\r\nThey may also be offering preferential treatment to certain websites for bandwidth. If this continues you may find that, as an example, that the BBC Iplayer service loads quickly and smoothly yet 4OD (a rival content delivery service for another television company) may be slow and unusable, all because they didn't pay an expensive fee to the internet service provider.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be allowed to continue, as it violates the very principals of the Internet's foundation and could lead to households having to pay even more for internet usage!",
