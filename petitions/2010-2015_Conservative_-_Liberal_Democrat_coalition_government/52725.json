        "additional_details": "I kindly call upon the government to put funds towards the NHS to increase the amount of staff available to diagnose autistic spectrum disorder at birth or at a later date (if autistic traits are found later).\r\n\r\nThis is to reduce the amount of time for a diagnosis as some institutions require a diagnosis to allow a citizen to gain certain aid within the institution. The waiting list currently is long for a diagnosis, this leads to the citizen being restricted of aid or acess to an institution that asks for a dignosis. It does not have to be like this. Simply give funds to the NHS to employ more diagnosis staff.",
