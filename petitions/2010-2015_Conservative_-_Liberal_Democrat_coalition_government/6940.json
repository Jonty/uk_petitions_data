        "additional_details": "Like other 'jobs', there should be a clear job description of the role of an MP- expectations including code of conduct, responsibilities, profile of an ideal candidate & skills needed. Background is important and should include a number of years in holding down a paid job in the private sector. Only candidates who meet the minimum criteria should be selected for shortlisting by the appropriate political party. This would make the candidate more representative of their voters and stop 'jobs for the boys' with no understanding of 'real life'. Pay & conditions should be clearly defined and be for a fixed term",
