Now of course all that money wasn't spent on the Olympics Russia is very corrupt. But this is just another reason to privatise the Olympics and take it out of the hands of corrupt world leaders.\r\n\r\nYou can radically reduce costs if you run the Olympics in local parks and get sponsorship from Coca Cola etc to fund the games. Your costs then have been reduced by 90% just by being frugal and not spending a fortune on massive stadiums that will just get torn down in the end anyway.",
