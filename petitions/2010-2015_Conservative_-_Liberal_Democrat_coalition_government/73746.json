        "additional_details": "On 12th 2015 January David Cameron stated that it was his party's intention to introduce far reaching legislation allowing the government to access private individuals electronic communications. Mr Cameron stated that \"There should be no means of communication we cannot read.\"\r\n\r\nThis legislation would also effectively outlaw some forms of social media such as Snapchat, which the intelligence services are unable to monitor.\r\n\r\nI call on David Cameron to therefore lead by example and ensure there is no communication we, the people, cannot read, by releasing all personal electronic communications, including email and texts, into the public domain.",
