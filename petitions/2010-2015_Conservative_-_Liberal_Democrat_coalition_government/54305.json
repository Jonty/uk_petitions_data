        "additional_details": "This petition is to stop the press, including local newspapers, invading the privacy of the families and friends during times of grief when a loved one passes away.\r\n\r\nThe Media currently has the right to inform family members and also friends of a person that they have died, in order to get information from them to produce a story. This can be before the family may have even had the chance to tell them personally. Imagine how hard this would be if you found out a loved one had died by a stranger who wants personal details.\r\n\r\nThey also have the right to post information about deaths including images and stories, days after the death, without the consent of the grieving families. Some of this information comes from Facebook, some of it may not be entirely true. This then gets made public.\r\n\r\nThis needs to stop and the government need to help make a change. Not only can it be life destroying, it makes the grievance process a whole deal harder.",
