        "additional_details": "On 3rd January 2012, the London Low Emission Zone will be extended to cover all Transit sized vans more than 10 years old, including camper vans, ambulances, recovery vehicles, buses and courier vans. Over 300,000 vehicles in London and the South will require either expensive modification, or will have to stay out of the Greater London area. Vehicles which do not comply will be charged \u00a3100/day to enter. In the middle of a recession, this is absurd, and there is no need to introduce this extension until 2018 in any case. We, the undersigned, request that the introduction of the LEZ be delayed by at least 3 years. ",
