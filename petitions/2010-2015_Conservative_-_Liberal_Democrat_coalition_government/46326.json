Residents who are older, with a learning difficulty, with a hearing impairment or dementia can feel very isolated if the staff caring for them have an insufficient grasp of spoken English or an unintelligible accent.\r\nCare staff should be able to take a test which would form part of their certificates for employment. Homes should be forced to make sure that there is an 80% minimum of fluent English speakers.",
