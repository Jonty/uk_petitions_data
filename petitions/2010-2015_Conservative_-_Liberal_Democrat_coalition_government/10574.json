In addition, fines must be paid within six months failure to pay will mean bailiffs will take goods to the value of \u00a31000. If the fine is in lue of a custodial sentence failure to pay will result in the prison sentence. All fine must be index linked and be based on 15% of the household income the base line for fines will be \u00a31000 with the 15% added. It is unfair to expect a person on \u00a320,000 income a year to pay the same fine for the same offence as a person earning \u00a350,000 a year. Justice must be fair.",
