Furthermore, it should become a compulsory sport practised by our nations youth whilst at school.\r\n\r\nThe long-term aims of the increased funding/school participation would also be that the sport ultimately receives Olympic recognition, with the target of the sport becoming an Olympic event by 2028.\r\n\r\nFunding would initially be used to set up a nationally recognized controlling body to help lay the foundations for this great nations future dominance of the sport.\r\n\r\nTraining academies and coaching systems could be set-up, and hopefully, within the near future, the very first Hardcore Catch Stadium could be built.",
