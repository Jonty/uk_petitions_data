        "additional_details": "Following a 2011 poll (Source: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2009487/We-stayed-Britain-Shock-poll-reveals-60-Jamaicans-think-theyd-better-colony.html) revealed that 60% of Jamaicans thought Jamaica would be better off with the British, I waited eagerly for a referendum in Jamaica over this issue. This has not happened.\r\nI thus awaited the UN or the British Government to highlight this issue and bring it up with the Jamaican government. This has not happened\r\n\r\nI wish for the British Government to take the issue to either the UN and/or the Jamaican government and request that they hold a referendum on the matter in the name of democracy and self determination. As a vital member of the Commonwealth and the UN, it is the responsibility of the Crown to ensure that these principle are upheld and as such the Jamaican Government should be asked by the UN and the UK to hold a referendum.",
