        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, ask that Strep Equi, a highly contagious disease in Equines, is made a notifiable disease to DEFRA and to The Animal Health Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA).\r\n\r\nStreptococcus Equi is Endemic within the UK & is highly contagious, being spread by close/direct contact in horses.  If this was made a notifiable disease, this would stop the spread of the disease ensuring that it is contained in one area & equines could then not be moved therefore spreading the bacteria to other horses.\r\n\r\nStreptococcus Equi can prove fatal in some cases despite best practice & Veterinary Treatment.\r\n\r\nStrep Equi in other countries within the EU such as Sweden is a notifiable disease.
