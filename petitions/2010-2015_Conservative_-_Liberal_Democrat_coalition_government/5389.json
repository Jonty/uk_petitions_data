        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call upon the government to reverse the recent decision on university tuition fees. This is an unfair decision that will rapidly return this country to the days when higher education was only for the privileged wealthy few, it will increase unemployment and subsistence level employment and inhibit personal and societal growth. This is also in direct opposition to the commitments made by the liberal democrats in their election manifesto.",
