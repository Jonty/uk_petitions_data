        "additional_details": "Rotherhithe is in central London zone 2, however, max broadband speed is up to 1.5MB. In contract, next door Deptford has broadband speed up to 50MB. There is no fibre optic cable thanks to BT who have once again postponed Bermonsey exchanage fibre upgrade until end of 2013. Virgin cable has on plans to cover the area neither. The government has issued UK fast Internet plan but Rotherhithe as one of the worst areas has not been prioritised. Other areas which already have high speed are getting faster sooner than they even need, while the people of Rotherhithe are left to coupe with 20th century internet speed that inadequate for 21st century living.\r\n\r\nGovernment should prioritise to upgrade slow area such as Rotherhithe to get min 2MB first, and should not just by simply boosting higher speed for already fast speed area for news paper headline.",
