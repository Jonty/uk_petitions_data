        "additional_details": "We are looking for the support of our goveernment to support the Invisible children of Uganda Charity, the Ugadan and American forces that are set up to try to help capture Kony. We know money is tight but this has the backing of millions of people around the world including many young people. Kony is famouse for his kidnapping of children and forcing them into his regime. Kony is aware of the US tatics and and has changed his own. Myself and everyone who signs this petition would like to see the backing of HM Government and that is why this petition has only 3 months to gain 100,000 signatures.",
