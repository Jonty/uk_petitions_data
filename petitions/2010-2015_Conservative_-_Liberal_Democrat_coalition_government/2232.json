        "additional_details": "The government need to create an incentive for individuals to recycle, including vouchers for people who recycle above the average amount of recycling, introducing fees for people who produce the most rubbish to steer them away.\r\n\r\nAlso more needs to be done so people don't have to recycle so much, if we reduce how much packaging is used then we reduce the amount a household has to recycle. Therefore supermarkets should be taxed if they use more than a necessary amount of packaging on their products.\r\n\r\nAlso recyclable products should have bigger signs on them saying that they are recyclable as most people cannot be bothered to read the packaging on the product to see if it is recyclable.
