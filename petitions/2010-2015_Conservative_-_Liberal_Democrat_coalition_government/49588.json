        "additional_details": "This e-petition argues that crafting relies on the design skills and creativity of thousands of people across the UK, contributes a significant amount to the economy and should not be removed from the Government\u2019s list of creative industries.\r\nDropping crafts dismisses the incredible skills of thousands of people who, daily, design and create rather than simply manufacture items.\r\nMost crafters who sell are sole traders and are, predominantly, women; they are not represented by an organisation, union or council and their skills and the economic benefit they bring are largely overlooked.\r\nTheir makes are not mass-produced but individual pieces that, being handmade, are highly sought after by UK residents and by visitors to the country, resulting in wide-spread economic benefit to communities.\r\nAnother by-product is the re-emergence of traditional skills and creation of new ones. This has resulted in a burgeoning market for training as well as the supply of tools and raw materials.\r\n",
