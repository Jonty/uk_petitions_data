The rest is stuck in an annuity till death.\r\n\r\nI want the law changed, to allow us to withdraw the full pension to repay the mortgage.\r\n\r\nHouse prices are so high, many can only afford an interest only mortgage - which leaves the loan to be repaid.\r\n\r\nAt present, on retirement, they will be forced to buy an annuity and sell their house. If the law is changed,  the money can be used to keep the roof over their heads.",
