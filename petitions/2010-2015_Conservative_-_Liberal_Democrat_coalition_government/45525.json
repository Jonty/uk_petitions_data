Battersea Powerstation should be converted into a museum of engineering to \"inspire a generation\" of new engineers, scientists and artists. The current proposals seem to change the powerstation into some sort of luxury village which is disgusting, and also ruins it. The powerstation will also be obscured from view by passengers travelling into London by train.",
