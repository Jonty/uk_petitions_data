        "additional_details": "Julien Blanc and his group, RSD (Real Social Dynamics) are a group of sexist and racist \"pick up artists,\" who capitalise on teaching men how to violate women through physical and emotional abuse.\r\n\r\nDo not associate the UK with a man who chokes women around the world as part of his pick up game. Please help British women stand with the women of Australia, America, and more, and do not let the UK host events where men are taught how to violate and harass women.\r\n\r\nAllowing this man into the UK legitimises sexual assault and predation, and sends a message that women are playthings, objects without agency.\r\n\r\nAustralia has already revoked his visa (http://d.pr/1gRoZ). Let's show that we feel the same way.\r\n\r\nHe is doing this all around the world. A likely outcome of his seminars in the UK would be increased incidence of sexual assault, already at staggering numbers. His proposed tour dates bring him to the UK in February - don't let him in.",
