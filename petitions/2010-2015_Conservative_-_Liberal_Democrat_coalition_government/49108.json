        "additional_details": "Too many men in the UK are denying paternity of their children or simply just having no involvement in their children's lives. Leaving single mothers to bring up children alone. These men are allowed to do this.\r\nThere is no law to stop them.\r\nWith changes being made to benefits of single mothers,i feel a new law should be introduced to men who escape responsibilities as their duties as fathers.\r\nMandatory DNA tests should be part of this scheme for men who refuse paternity, as well as finding jobs for fathers who do nothing to support their children.\r\nSingle parent women have more responsibilities than just raising a child, it is not easy and it is not fair that men are ALLOWED to run away.\r\nIT IS TIME TO CHANGE!",
