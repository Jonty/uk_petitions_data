In line with common practice bbc.co.uk/religion uses BCE/CE (Before Common Era/Common Era) as a religiously neutral alternative to BC/AD.  As the BBC is committed to impartiality it is appropriate that we use terms that do not offend or alienate non-Christians.\"\r\n\r\nThe terms 'AD/BC' have been in use for 1,500 years, the BBC has been in existence for almost ninety years; why has it suddenly decided that the above terms cause offence to non-Christians?  Removing terms that are steeped in antiquity will cause great offence to Christians and others.\r\n\r\nThis Government must use all its influence to rescind the decision by the BBC to drop the terms AD/BC from its calendar and ensure that those responsible for such an outrage are severely punished.",
