Because of the stupid education system they keep changing it to what fits the government no it should be what best for the young kids. No wonder why there are kids out there young as 13 selling drugs why because they need money and if they carnet go out and work because they haven't got the best grades but if it was how it was 10 years ago England would have been #1 best country when it comes to educated young kids the more we leave this issue the more kids that will fail and fall we need to put a stop to Mr Gove aspa because that could be your kid on the street tomorrow so don't risk it vote now for a brighter future for the younger generation.",
