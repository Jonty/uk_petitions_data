Doctors told me she wouldn't live passed her 1st birthday, but is now 19 months old.\r\nUp until now, she has been fine. But recently she developed a chest infection and has became very ill.\r\nDoctors are refusing to give her life saving treatment, as they feel she has no quality of life!! (Couldn't be more wrong!!)\r\n\r\nThis petition is to request every child with SMA type 1, to be given the necessary treatment to help them survive!\r\n\r\nThanks xx",
