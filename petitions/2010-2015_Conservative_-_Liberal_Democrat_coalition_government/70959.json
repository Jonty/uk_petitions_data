        "additional_details": "The undersigned are disturbed by Lord Darzi's recent proposal that smoking be banned in London's parks and open spaces.\r\n\r\nWe believe that such a measure would lack perspective and that the risks posed by smoking in large open spaces is nowhere near great enough to justify removing smokers' liberty to smoke in these areas.\r\n\r\nWe are frustrated by the attitude that the slightest danger should be eliminated at any cost and believe that the potential health improvements of these measures do not come close to compensating for the assault on personal liberty that they would constitute.\r\n\r\nWe note that such a law would be relatively unenforceable and believe that the already stretched police service have more important issues to be dealing with than adults smoking cigarettes.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Mayor of London to reject these proposals and preserve the right of smokers to enjoy smoking in London's parks and other open spaces in a way which poses little to no risk to others.",
