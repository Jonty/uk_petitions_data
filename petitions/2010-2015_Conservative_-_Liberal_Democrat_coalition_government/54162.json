Instead, we are promoting our campaign in order to educate and raise awareness of the difficulties young people face, and their feelings towards the topic. If we can get the councils to work with local businesses and shops and form a job forum for youths to browse, then our mission will be accomplished, and the 38.1% of unemployed youth will find either a part or full time job.
