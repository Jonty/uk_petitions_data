        "additional_details": "After a pogrom of Igbos in Northern Nigeria, in May 1967 the Igbo people seceded from Nigeria and declared the establishment of the Republic of Biafra.\r\nThe British Government of the time demanded that Nigeria must stay as one country, despite huge religious, linguistic, and ethnic differences.\r\nWith British help, the Nigerian government blockaded Biafra in order to starve its population. Between 1966 and 1970 more then two million Igbo people were murdered in Biafra.\r\nDuring the Biafran war the British Government was the main suppliers of arms to the Nigerian Army.\r\nThe present day British Government must apologise for it's predecessor's complicity in causing and sustaining the Biafran War.\r\n\r\nYou can learn more at\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16vubBIx-T0",
