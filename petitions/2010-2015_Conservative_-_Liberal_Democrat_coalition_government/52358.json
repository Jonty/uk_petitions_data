Their reason? \"It doesn\u2019t fit in with current thinking on inclusion and equality and that parading children with additional support needs is inappropriate\"\r\n\r\nWe think this is a complete insult to all involved. These guys take time, and sacrifice some of their living, to take part and the kids involved love it! It is political correctness gone mad. I think NLC should seriously reconsider their position on this. Yet another reason for people to become frustrated and angry at their local council. No regard for the opinion of its townsfolk. The reason they are all in a job.\r\n",
