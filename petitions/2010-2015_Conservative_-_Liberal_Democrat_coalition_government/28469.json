        "additional_details": "Road fuel is essential to many users, both rich and poor, but the taxation of it is wholly biased, having the most detrimental effect on the poorly paid and unemployed. This is especially so in rural communities. Fuel tax should be linked to people\u2019s ability to pay through the taxation system. Bank cards could carry a \"taxation class\" code based on that person\u2019s income tax allowance, so that people on low or no earnings pay only the appropriate amount of tax at the pump. People on higher income tax brackets would pay more, which, after all, is only fair!  Isn\u2019t that how \u201ctaxation\u201d of any type IS supposed to work?",
