        "additional_details": "People in this country, particularly those who live outside London, are increasingly at risk from Islamic revenge attacks in isolated places because of unpopular government interference in Muslim countries.  Our police are not armed; we are prevented from owning weapons for self defence; our armed forces are spread across the planet, and we need to know just how long it will take for lunatic gunmen, armed to the gills (because there seems to be no restriction on the type and number of weapons available to criminals) to be stopped when they take over, for example, Middleton Grange Shopping Centre in Hartlepool or the Metro Centre in Gateshead.  Currently, we and they know that local police will do nothing to interfere with Islamic fundamentalists for fear of having their funding cut by politicians because they are deemed to be institutionally racist, so we have to rely on national police forces to be rescued from Islamists hell bent on killing us.",
