It isn't. It's rape even to an innocent animal.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, bestiality is officially illegal in 31 states.\r\n\r\n17 states make beastiality a felony. They are: Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia and Washington.\r\n\r\nFourteen states consider it a misdemeanor, those being: Arkansas, California, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah and Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nThat means the remaining 19 states, and DC, have no laws prohibiting this type of animal abuse.\r\n",
