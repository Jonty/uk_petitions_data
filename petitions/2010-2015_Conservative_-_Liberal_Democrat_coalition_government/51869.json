        "additional_details": "The DfE have given the go ahead for a free school in Sherwood in Nottingham. We would like them to reconsider this decision and stop this application for a school that the area does not need.\r\n\r\nWe are concerned that this school is a waste of taxpayers money as there already a number of good under-subscribed secondary schools in the area and funding this school is therefore a waste of taxpayers money in a time of austerity.\r\n\r\nThis school will not only be funded out of taxpayers money, but it will also take away local democratic control from education, which is of serious concern to local teachers and parents. It could also impact on the viability of local schools causing one to have to close.",
