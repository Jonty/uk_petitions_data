        "additional_details": "Interest payable upon the National Debt is becoming unmanageable. The National Debt can be eliminated by giving each person with a National Insurance Number as of 31/12/11, one (1) share in each in the companies currently being statefunded under the National Debt. The shares could be held for 5 years before being allowed to be sold on the stock market. Dividends from these shares could be paid into special individual National Savings Accounts held at the Post Office. In return, 1% extra should be placed on income tax to pay off the remainder of the National Debt. All this could be done in the March 2012 budget.",
