Completed 28 years ago, reminds us of peace, unity and love amongst a community, not a typically affluent area but one of which the community is most important.\r\nMost recently, Atlantic Records artists and local Hackney band Rudimental used the mural on their #1 Gold-selling album \u2018Home\u2019 taking this local mural worldwide and putting Dalston and Hackney on the map.\r\nDalston Peace Mural represents a neighbourhood, a home, childhood, adulthood \u2013 a constant reminder of where they came from and where they want to go. This is a landmark that is treasured by so many and deserves to be kept standing \u2013 it has a voice and a heart \u2013 this isn\u2019t some ugly and faceless graffiti \u2013 its home.\r\n\r\n",
