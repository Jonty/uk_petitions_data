Stop everyone being priced out of london\r\n3. Reduce the scope for developers, private landlords and private equity interests to profit out of exacerbating the nations housing shortage\r\n4. Give the high street and especially smaller business a better chance, rather than being pushed out to make room for more high-end rental properties.\r\n\r\nIt's not rocket science, I could run this country better with my eyes shut..\r\n\r\n:-)",
