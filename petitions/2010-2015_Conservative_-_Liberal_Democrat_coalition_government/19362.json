        "additional_details": "The order of Northern druids is dedicated to preventing further damage to the landscape setting of North Yorkshires's Thornborough Henges Complex, relics of the largest ancient ceremonial area in Britain. Only three of the original eight massive earth henges survived into modern times and they are now protected as Scheduled Ancient Monuments.\r\n\r\nHowever, all three have suffered damage and, as with Stonehenge, it is vital to save for posterity what remains of this heritage landscape in which the henges and associated relics sit. The farmland immediately around the monuments, much of which has been bought by mining company Tarmac, has already suffered grievously from perfectly legal but insensitive farming practices and open-cast quarrying",
