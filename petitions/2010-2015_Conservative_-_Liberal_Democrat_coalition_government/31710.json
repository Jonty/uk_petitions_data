        "additional_details": "Alan Turing is a national hero. His contribution to computer science, and hence to the life of the nation and the world, is incalculable. The ripple-effect of his theories on modern life continues to grow, and may never stop.\r\n\r\nThere is a petition that calls upon the Treasury to request the Bank of England to consider depicting Alan Turing when new \u00a310 banknotes are designed. However, given Turing's contributions as a computer scientist, it should be much more appropriate for him to appear on a digital currency such as bitcoins.\r\n\r\nWe therefore call upon the Bank of England to consider depicting Alan Turing on bitcoins.",
