        "additional_details": "The ability to see one and others face is an intrinsic part of the way we all communicate in person and one of the cornerstones of our civilised society. It has always been customary to show ones face in public, and it is uncustomary to hide the face to achieve anonymity. There are a variety of people who wish to challange this social normality and conceal themselves even in public spaces.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you would like face coverings to be prohibited in all public spaces.",
