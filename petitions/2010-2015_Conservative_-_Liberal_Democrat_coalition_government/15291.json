        "additional_details": "Nadine Dorries MP is leading an attempt to force women seeking a termination to receive counselling independent of the abortion providers. She has previously campaigned to have the abortion time limit reduced.\r\n\r\nDorries believes that this counselling would reduce the number of abortions and also believes that charity run abortion services have a financial conflict - essentially, she believes they want more abortions for profit. This smear is offensive & insulting not only to abortion providers but to all women.\r\n\r\nDorries decision, & that of the government, is reliant on biases, anti-choice propaganda & a deep seated misogynistic belief that women are unable to make choices for themselves. This counselling would simply add to the distress by delaying the procedure. Women need true support, not misogynistic blackmail. The government should not interfere with a woman's fundamental rights over her own body.",
