Currently the applicant pays for the initial application, but if the Authority refuses, and the applicant appeals and wins, the Authority has to cover all costs. This should stop at once. Doubtless there are cases where the Authority gives permission because they are mindful of losing on appeal if they do not. If they do not have to pay, they will give better decisions.",
