        "additional_details": "Some companies charge for children from 2 years old yet others from 5 years old.  I would like to see a standard age bracket applied so parents know if a child is free, at child rate and maybe other brackets (since an 8 year old will understand more than say a 4 year old).  This could be a charge percentage based on a full adult ticket (eg. Under 3 is free, 3-6 is 25% charge, 6-12 is 50% charge and 12-18 is 75%)",
