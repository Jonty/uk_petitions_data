        "action": "Enterprise education on the National Curriculum",
        "additional_details": "The education system does not adequately prepare young people for the working world, as is evidencd by the stubbornly high level of youth unemployment. The national curriculum is too concentrated on academic subjects. After long campaigning, personal finance is to be added to the curriculum from 2014. However despite pressure from businesses and others, enterprise education is still limited to being a rare, extra-mural activity in schools. Adopting the 'learn by doing' approach of charitiies like Young Enterprise would improve students' employability skills, and over time would improve UK competitiveness. This petition urges the Secretary of State for Education to add enterprise education to the national curriculum at the earliest opportunity.",
