        "additional_details": "While we here in Central Lancashire may apreciate the City Deal we are now starting to see, there is one gap in the network that does need to be filled. With two growing Enterprise Zones on opposite banks of the River Ribble and already congested river crossings, it is evident that a third crossing is required. A rough count has shown that 47 adults and 3 children have been injured along the stretch of the A59 in Penwortham over recent years. There are also issues that put young folk at risk due to them having to cross the A59 at peak hours. Building the bridge will ease traffic and greatly improve the air quality in the District Centre, it would allow South Ribble BC and Lancashire County Council to look into a meaningful regeneration package. In all, I/we would like to see the Government facilitate the building of a New River Ribble Crossing and greatly improve further the City Deal and the quality of life of residents who suffer the through traffic congestion.",
