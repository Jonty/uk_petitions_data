        "additional_details": "This is the UK. Non-conforming ethnic/religious architecture damages our environment and is inconsistent with our heritage and architectural landscape. Further, it drives and perpetuates separatism and racial differentiation and reflects the wide-spread determination of the Muslim population not to integrate socially or economically other than where it suits them. Our planning laws do not allow any other kind of non-conforming development...the same should be applied to all Muslim influenced architecture which has escaped this rule. This should be applied retrospectively so that the numerous Muslim-influenced architectural abominations are removed from our country. A similar law has been enacted in Switzerland with huge success.",
