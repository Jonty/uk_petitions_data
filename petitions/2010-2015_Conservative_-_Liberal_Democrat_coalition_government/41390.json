In particular those that target the age group of 16-25 year olds.\r\nI want young people to relate more to the models that are used in their advertising campaigns and online.\r\nEating disorders are becoming more and more common in this age group and I feel that using models with a  range of clothing sizes would make young people feel more comfortable in their own skin and hopefully lower the rates of eating disorders in young people.
