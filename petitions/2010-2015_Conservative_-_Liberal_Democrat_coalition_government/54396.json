        "action": "We require a Government review of the commission charged by park owners on the private sale of park homes",
        "additional_details": "Estate Agents can charge 2% to market/sell a park home. Site owners receive up to 10% commission on the selling price of the home for doing next to nothing and recent legislation changes mean that site owners will now have no involvement in the selling process.\r\n\r\nThis commission to the site owner is not just paid once, it is paid each time the home is sold.  This arrangement is outdated, inequitable and represents a significant loss of hard earned equity to the home owner. Even more unfair, the site owner benefits from improvements to the home as he/she receives commission upon the enhanced sale price, it is almost a disincentive for the home owner to invest in their home.\r\n\r\nIf Government will not abolish this unfair levy we require a Government debate to ;-\r\n\r\n1) Reduce the commission level payable to site owners to 2%\r\n\r\n2) Amend the law so that on subsequent sales the commission is levied on the difference between the last purchase price and the sale price received.\r\n",
