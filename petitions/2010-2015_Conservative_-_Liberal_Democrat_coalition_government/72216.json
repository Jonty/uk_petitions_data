        "additional_details": "The policy needs to change that if you are in a privately rented house but are experiencing financial hardship, You should still be able to qualify for affordable housing. It should be based on a case by case, showing your financial statements. Many people are now in private rentals that they cannot afford. Apparently councils will only consider you once you are actually homeless. This is a draconian system that needs to change. Less people would be in the benefits system if we were given the chance for housing.",
