In a cost saving excercise, the annual maintenance contract has recently been reduced to \u00a318,000.00 from \u00a332,000.00\r\nThis is a ridiculous waste of money when people in the real world are deciding wheather to eat or heat.\r\nThe \u00a318,000.000 annual maintenance cost should be reduced to zero by cutting the trees down and removing the liability altogether.
