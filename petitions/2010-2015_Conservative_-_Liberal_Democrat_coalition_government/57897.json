        "additional_details": "China wants to become a world leader in research into Thorium based nuclear energy. The only reason that Uranium has been used for so long is that it produces plutonium which can be weaponised. Thorium has fewer radioactive side effects. We want to create jobs and build Britain up again. This would be the perfect opportunity. Fracking, contrary to what we are being told causes terrible environmental problems, noxious gases, water contamination etc. Let's ensure that the large corporations aren't allowed to pressurise The Government into doing what makes money instead of what is good for The UK and its' people.",
