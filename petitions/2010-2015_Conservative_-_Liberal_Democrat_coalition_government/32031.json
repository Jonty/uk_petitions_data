Please make it easier for people to use these options through expanding the use of trams and through subsidising re-charging facilities for electric cars at petrol stations (instead of funding HS2).\r\n\r\nAnother idea is to fund the research of alternatives to oil at Russell Group universities. Engineers need to be working on producing new internal combustion engines reliant on renewable resources. This is a matter more urgent for universities to research than anything else. Our economy depends on this - we don't want to wait until oil really has run out!",
