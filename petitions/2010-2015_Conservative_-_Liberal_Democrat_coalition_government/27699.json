        "additional_details": "The education of our young people, the leaders of the future, is too important to be left to the ideological whims of politicians. An independent body, similar to that of the police service, led by people with experience in successfully educating young people, is required to ensure our education system has a clear and consistent focus, and once again be a true global competitor.\r\n\r\nIt is detrimental to the profession and students to exist in a system where policies and politicians change so frequently and without consultation, leaving the education system with no clear goals or long term vision, often these policies and politicians are working towards separate government agendas. We believe education ought to be independent of Government agenda and solely focused on the success of our children.",
