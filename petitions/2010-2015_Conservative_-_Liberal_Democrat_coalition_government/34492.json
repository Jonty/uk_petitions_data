        "additional_details": "I think its important to raise more awareness and support for women who suffer a homophobic attack. Homophobia is a hate crime regardless of gender, but it seems it happens to women and is slightly ignored.\r\n\r\nIn the community  we live in still hate crime happens, everyone should be able to love who ever they choose and express these emotions freely.\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting the message out there with hard hitting pictures, facebook ,posters and social networking sites,a difference can be made.This may make people think twice about their actions and reduce such incidents.Also make women aware of the threats and potential danger of certain situations.\r\n\r\nVictims of such violence and hate need support and understanding from the authorites and goverment.Such crimes not only effect the victim but also the loved ones around them.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to make a difference if we all stand united. By influencing the young and re educating, the gay community can be protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
