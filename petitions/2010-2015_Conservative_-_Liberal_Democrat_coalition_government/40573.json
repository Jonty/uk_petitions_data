        "additional_details": "Thousands of workers who commit to working with children and young people are struggling to afford to take holidays because holiday firms increase costs excessively during school holidays, of course this also impacts on parents and families who are put under increasing pressure not to take their children out of school during term dates, to take up better holiday deals. Some may argue that teachers are paid well so can afford these excessive costs but what about all the other employees who support teachers to deliver education.  Also holiday firms need to ensure start dates and flights fit around term times as again this causes difficulties with getting time off work.  Ideally we need to stop holiday companies from setting these extortionate extra costs for all.",
