        "additional_details": "The BBC is is not fit for purpose. It is a wholly dishonest institution which is sets out to mislead the public. It's fees are levied as a tax upon those who do not wish to use its service. As an institution it is outdated and out of touch. It seeks to represent our country but it only succeeds in misrepresentation through its left wing views. At its birth it had no competition or market and accordingly it required  funding by way of a licence fee. Times have long since changed and there are now many fresh and honest competitors which find their funding through commercial means. The time has come to shut it down and disperse the corrupt management.",
