The only people who sign petitions are friends and family of the person who has raised the petition (who don't really care about the matter raised, just wish to be supportive) and/or pompous optomists. Both should be ignored. If you feel compelled to complain or raise a point you should write a letter. Although it will likely be ignored your spelling and grammar will benefit.",
