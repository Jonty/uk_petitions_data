        "additional_details": "In 1943 the villagers of Tyneham and the surrounding area in Dorset were given just one month to vacate the village before it was taken over by order of Churchill and his war cabinet for Military use. The only compenstion they received was the approximate value of the food growing in their gardens They were promised that they would be able to return to their homes but that promise was never kept.\r\nThe Government owes the descendents of the village a formal apology and proper compensation befitting of the suffering these people tolerated as well as the broken promises of not only Churchill, but of every government and prime minister since.\r\n\r\nRead this note left on the church door by the villagers and feel ashamed\r\n\r\n'Please treat the church and houses with care; we have given up our homes where many of us lived for generations to help win the war to keep men free. We shall return one day and thank you for treating the village kindly.'\r\n\r\nThis is NOT about the army but about JUSTICE",
