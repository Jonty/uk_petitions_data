        "additional_details": "At the moment there are 3 rates of Corporation tax to pay for small, medium and large businesses.\r\n\r\nFor 2012 the rates for small business earning up to \u00a3300k profit is 20%. The next bracket up to \u00a31.2m is 27.5% and over \u00a31.5m is 26%.\r\n\r\nWhilst each bracket has reduced this year, I feel that the larger the business, the more percentage they should pay.\r\n\r\nThose businesses earning over 1.5m profit should increase to 1% over the middle bracket, whilst the smallest bracket currently at 20% should reduce to 19%.\r\n\r\nThis allows more chance for smaller businesses and start-ups to re-inject their cash back into their businesses, giving a higher ability for those smaller companies to one day become a larger business.\r\n\r\nFinally, no large corporations should be able to negotiate their own tax.",
