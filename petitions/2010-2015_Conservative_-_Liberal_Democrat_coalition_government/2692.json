        "additional_details": "Currently single occupants and second homes receive a discount on council tax.  However, if your old home (or deceased parents') is empty and is taking a long time to sell (maybe because you are redecorating) your council can charge you 100% council tax after a certain period - even though you are using fewer council services than a second home owner or single occupant.  This is a crippling expense at a time when income is being squeezed and the property market is stalling in some areas.",
