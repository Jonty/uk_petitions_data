It is clear that many prey on the weak, commit crime to the degree that they become serial FELONS  and along with those that Riot against the common good should have public funding withdrawn from them in all its forms for a period to be determined by the courts according to their crimes.\r\n\r\nCompassion = Yes\r\nPreying on Society = No.",
