        "additional_details": "Due to how the UK is coming along we need this problem sorted out, this problem with warning letters the council send out has gave nearly 90% of bad neighbors the chance to hide the reported problems,I for one have had this same problem for 10yrs+ and want this sorted as it's got to the point one gets the letters and sorts the reported problems out before the visit of the housing managers, after the visit this problem comes again it can be a week or upto a few months yet it happens again leaving you the one that has to move house or put up with this mess the housing manager have rights to sort out by force but do not do this as they would have to do their jobs. We in the UK having this problem need this letter removed to not give the bad people the chance to hide what they are doing wrong and to have the housing managers catch them in the act so all evidence is there. please do not ignore this petition as you have the right for a better Briton and not a mess we see today\r\n",
