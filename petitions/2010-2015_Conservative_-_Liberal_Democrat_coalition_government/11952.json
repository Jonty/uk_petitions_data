What I have a problem with is the expectation that the Taxpayer is going to fund it. There is a personal responsibility in bringing a child into this World and it is about time that some limits were placed on what people should expect from Society. There are people who work hard, but cannot afford to have loads of kids, so why is it okay for somebody who is not working to keep on having children and seeing it as a right that Taxpayers will fund it? I don't want to!",
