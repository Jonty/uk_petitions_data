        "additional_details": "When attempting to create a valid petition on the sale of flick knives and swiss army knives in local stores, I was warned that the E-Petition could take up to seven days to be checked before validated.\r\n\r\nSo here, I would like to campaign to remove the seven day check-up period and make it imperative that e-petitions are validated in the first day of check-up.\r\n\r\nI believe this would speed up the political process and remove any time wasting to ensure the politics of the country can be swiftly altered to create the most optimistic future available.",
