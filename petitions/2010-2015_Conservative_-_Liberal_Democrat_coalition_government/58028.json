        "additional_details": "Release a Siberian Husky that is held by Birmingham Dogs Home.When the dog was taken to the dogs home, the dog showed fearful signs and Birmingham Dogs Home saying that the dog will be put to sleep on Monday. We have rescues here and experienced behaviorists that have offered to take on the dog. They are happy to release the dog to the original owner, yet they will not let an experienced rescue and behaviorist work with this dog, where we can potentially get the dog home or get them prepared to be rehomed. Dogs behave differently depending on the different environments they're in, and huskies are well known for not coping well with kenneled environments. Why should he die when we have a safe place? What is the difference between relinquishing to the original owner or handing over to experienced?\r\nWe want the dog released into rescue hands for behavioral help in an experienced fosterer environment.",
