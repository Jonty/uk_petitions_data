One thing the government could do is change the Companies Act and say: you must present everybody above \u00a31m, or the top 10 of your company, to the shareholders. They would have to justify it individually and that would be very difficult indeed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat you are seeing is a self-serving coterie. The people who serve on remuneration committees of those companies and approve those numbers are in the same little set as the people who receive the money.\u201d",
