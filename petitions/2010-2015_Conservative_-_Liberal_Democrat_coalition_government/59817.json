The next part of the call would be to setup remote access so that he can install a virus on my computer and charge a ransom to remove it.\r\n\r\nI also get regular emails from people claiming to be from various couriers, banks etc.. with an attachment to open which will lock my files and charge me a ransom to unlock them.\r\n\r\nThese people are \"untracable\" and nothing is ever done about them.\r\n\r\nMy request is to bring back capital punishment (death penalty) for these people.",
