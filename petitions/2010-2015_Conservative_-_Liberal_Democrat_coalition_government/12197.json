Many lives have been unnecessarily lost and the war has cost us billions of pounds which we don't have.\r\n\r\nPull them out NOW. Let countries fight their own battles. If the UK borders are directly breached, then send our troops to fight. Until then, use their intelligence skills to monitor situations that may threaten us, and redeploy the troops to reinforce OUR borders and assist OUR police forces.\r\n\r\nLives will be saved and the money saved could buy them much needed equipment, recompense them properly in recognition of the work they do for their country, and provide proper compensation in the event of injury or death. Charities are currently being relied on to do this and the Government should be ashamed it is happening.  ",
