        "additional_details": "Robert Peston is an appalling journalist. He understands the economy about as well as anyone with a job, and talks about it less well than most. His pauses are interminable. The government should introduce a bill to force the BBC to sack him, the penalty for not doing so being the reduction of the licence fee to that paid by anyone who knows who the hell he is.",
