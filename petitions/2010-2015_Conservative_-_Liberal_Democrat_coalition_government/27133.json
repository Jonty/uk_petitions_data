Although many of their causes are valid, their focus on bloodsports directly contradicts the view of the vast majority of rural dwellers (MORI poll) therefore misrepresenting the rural community. The government should not allow an organisation focused mainly around widely condemned recreational pursuits for a minority to benefit from charitable status.",
