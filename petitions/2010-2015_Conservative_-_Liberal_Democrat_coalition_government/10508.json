As yet they have few powers. They should be given powers to deal with parking offences, anti social behaviour i.e. barking dogs, music blasting out and littering etc issuing tickets for fines and or removing annoying animal or music system. This way the public will see some value from having the PCSO\u2019s.\r\n",
