        "additional_details": "One lane of Welford Road which is one of the main routes out of Leicester has been closed as part of an \u2018experiment\u2019 by Leicester City Council, with a view to close it permanently and open a new cycle lane. The lane will be closed up to the tigers ground for the next few weeks causing and increase in congestion and disruption to those who use Welford Road as means of there commute.\r\n\r\nLeicester Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby suggests 'getting in and out of the city is a major problem' for cyclists. There is already a dedicated bus lane along the majority of the Welford Road under question. The high way code states \u2018bus lanes may be used by cyclists\u2019. So why is there the need for a second cycle \u2018lane\u2019 along this already busy part of the Leicester road network.\r\n",
