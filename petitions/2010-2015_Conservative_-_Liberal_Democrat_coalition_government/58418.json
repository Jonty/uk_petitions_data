        "additional_details": "Broxtowe Borough Council have announced plans to back the development of more than 500 homes on green belt land off Stapleford Lane in Toton.\r\n\r\nThe land had previously been put forward by the Borough Council as a 'preferred site' but after fierce opposition from local residents and environmental campaigners was dropped in 2011. After a recent 'panic' meeting by the council Toton again finds itself in line for vast housing development on green belt land.\r\n\r\nWe would like to department for communities and local government to intervene and insist that all available brownfield land within Broxtowe is used for development before proposals are put forward for the development of green belt.\r\n",
