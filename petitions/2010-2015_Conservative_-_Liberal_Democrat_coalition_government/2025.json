I feel that a punishment like public flogging for a multiple offender, done humanly in an official location would put a doubt in recidivists minds about re offending. An example could be for individuals who have three strikes, in stead of incarceration or ASBO etc they could be sentenced to ten lashes, with post punishment treatment to combat any infections or permanent injury.",
