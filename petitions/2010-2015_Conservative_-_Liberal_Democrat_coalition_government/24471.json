        "additional_details": "With the innovations of email, the web, video conferencing, mobile phones and skype, as a stimulus to business, the government should enforce any office based businesses to make 10%+ of staff work from home. This will aid business by reducing their rent / giving them the opportunity to rent out their own office space lowering overheads. This will put a substantial amount of money otherwise spent on petrol/season tickets back into the pockets of staff who can the then spend in the wider economy, generating jobs encouraging trickle-down economics, freeing up congested roads and trains, reducing impacts on the environment, lowering petrol prices for all as demand will fall - even petrol companies will benefit long term as oil reserves will last longer. Staff will also be happier and more productive. Sales staff have done this for years!",
