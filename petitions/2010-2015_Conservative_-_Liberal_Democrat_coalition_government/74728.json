They have lived together in Plymouth since they met and married in Thailand in 2008. They face a race against time to convince the Government they should not be separated. Jirapon has worked full-time since arriving in the UK, but when she applied to extend her spousal visa in 2013 she was told she had taken the wrong type of language test.\r\n\u201cThey told my wife to prepare to go home.\u201d\r\nJirapon had taken the NOCN test, which the Home Office said was not a recognised qualification.The couple launched a series of appeals in immigration tribunal courts, spending thousands of pounds on solicitors\u2019 fees and legal advice, and Jirapon took the \u2018correct\u2019 City and Guilds test in October last year.But the authorities have refused to change their original decision, telling Jirapon she must leave the UK by Friday \u2013 the day before Valentine\u2019s Day.\r\n\r\n",
