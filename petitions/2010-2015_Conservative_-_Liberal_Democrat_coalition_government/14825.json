        "additional_details": "70% of cases in the family courts cite domestic abuse as a major concern yet only 1% are refused access.\r\na review is required.\r\nSupervised access is the minimum that must be considered when an abuser scores low to moderate on the DASSH risk assessment. Supervision must be on a 1:1 basis.\r\nNo access should be given where an abuser scores high risk on the DASSH, where a MARAC hearing is held or planned, Where target hardening is carried out on a victims property or where the abused has had to move to refuge, out of their hometown away from their support network.\r\ngovernment should consult Women's Aid, The Police and the Domestic Abuse helpline in reviewing this. Family law must consider children's safety and not simply chase social ideals. A happy child with a lone parent will always make a more positive impact than an unhappy child brought up with abuse.\r\nAlso where drug use is cited as a problem rehabilitation must take place before access can be considered.",
