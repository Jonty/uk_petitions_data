However, it is generally agreed that weak UK Immigration Rules have resulted in many undeserving individuals becoming UK citizens and the route to UK citizenship is now abused on a daily basis\r\n\r\nToday, anyone can become a UK citizen after hiding from the authorities for 14 years or after studying in the UK for 10 years or having worked in the UK for 5 years.\r\n\r\nEven, the new Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 (\u201cthe Act\u201d) that received Royal Assent on 21st July does not address the issue in totality.\r\n\r\nIt is time to change the complexity in the law that makes it possible for anyone to easily become a British citizen by studying, working and hiding in the UK for 14 year.\r\n\r\nIt is time to say clearly, \"You can only becoming a British Citizen if you are born to a British Citizen\"",
