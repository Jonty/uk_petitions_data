        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition if you are also against the building of this so called super mosque . On railway street Gillingham. We want to be 100% clear this is not a racial issue ! The issue is the area  where this has planning permission to be built can not cope with a building of this size  also the extra footfall,  vehicles, will add hardship onto an already busy small part of the town . Parking is already stretched to its limits due to local schools, business, football stadium, train station, (people commuting and staff) a high street and shoppers . Already parking is a problem this will bring more cars into the area and create less space  than there is now once the building is built . I also believe when the football is on or during the school run It will make the area hazardous to the local community due to traffic in a small suburban area with no traffic control measures in place or the space for them .
