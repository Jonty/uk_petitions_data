        "additional_details": "Recently, Secretary of State of Education, Mr. Gove has proposed significant amendments to school opening hours and term times.  In it he appealed to longer hours (9a.m. \u2013 6p.m.) on the basis of Asian nations, however UK culture is grossly dissimilar to those nations.\r\n\r\nHe also appealed to the current system being a throwback to historical agricultural systems, however the petition believes that if the wheel is not broken, stop trying to fix it.\r\n\r\nIf the Secretary for Education is to have his way, school children will be forced to work hours in excess of a full time employed person of 37.5 hour week which will be unpaid.  This is tantamount to education slavery.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind I call on people to reject his proposals abandon his current unworkable, unfriendly and excessive proposals.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, please sign this petition.\r\n",
