        "additional_details": "We the signed would like an official review of the Nursing and Midwifery Council as the nurses governing body.  The NMC has once again raised fees despite the pay freezes and overwhelmingly negative response in the consultation process.  We feel that the body is not giving us accountability or value for the fees we pay on an annual basis.\r\n\r\nAs the fee paying members we would like to see accountability form our governing body.  We do not feel they are currently in touch with it members or fit for purpose as it stands and would like it properly looked into.  Nursing and Midwifery morale is already at an all time low and the NMC is in danger of pushing some of it registrants into leaving the profession altogether.",
