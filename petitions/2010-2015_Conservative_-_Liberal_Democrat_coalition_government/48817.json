Item 4 of the act states:\r\n\r\n\u201cA trader must not charge consumers, in respect of the use of a given means of payment, fees that exceed the cost borne by the trader for the use of that means.\u201d\r\n\r\nIrrespective of this British Telecom still insist on charging its customers a \u00a36 \u201cPayment Processing Fee\u201d per quarter (\u00a324 per year) for the privilege of paying their bill on time and in full by any other means than Direct Debit.\r\n\r\nI contest that \u00a36 is far in excess of the actual bank charges incurred by British Telecom and government should step in to prove that the new Consumer Rights (Payment Surcharges) Regulations actually has teeth and force this fee down to a realistic level.\r\n",
