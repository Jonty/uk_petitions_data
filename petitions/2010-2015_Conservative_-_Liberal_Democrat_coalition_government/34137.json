        "additional_details": "I would like to see a full investigation into the declaration of interests of sports journalists and specifically football writers. How much is undeclared from supposed \"journo's\" leaking stories for money from agents? For every manager taking an alleged bung, how many \"football\" journalists are paid to invent stories. Apart the potential damage to the sport, the eventual meltdown through bloated transfers and wages, how much undeclared interests do our journalist have. Do they declare and pay tax. These parasites are killing our game and I believe not paying taxes due. Stand up and vote with your voice to have a full revenue investigation of these people. Please support and save your game and taxes out of your pockets.",
