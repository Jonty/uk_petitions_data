        "additional_details": "Metrification in the UK started in 1965 and has not yet finished! We petition the government to drive throguh advertising campaigns and help the country switch over fully to metric SI measurements so we can join the rest of Asia, Europe and the Commonwealth. It is unfair on our children to have to learn one system at school and another system when they leave school.\r\n\r\nWhilst the weather is given in centigrade, thermometers are still in fareignheit. Petrol is mesured in litres, yet distance and speed are measured in miles. We learn kilograms in schools, yet recipies are in ounces. The building industry measure in centimetres, yet clothing is measured in inches. What is going on?\r\n\r\nWe can return to the old system so unless we get leadership from the government we are stuck with a partial changover. With your signitures we can lobby the governrment to finish the switchover as we have done with both out monetary system and more recently, Digital TV.",
