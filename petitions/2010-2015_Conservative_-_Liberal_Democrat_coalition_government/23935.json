        "additional_details": "Development of renewable energy and low/zero energy buildings is extremely important to avoid over reliance on dwindling supplies of fossil fuels and resource depletion avoiding the highly polluting nature of fossil fuel supplies whilst providing greater fuel security for the UK.\r\nOver the last 7 years all of my attempts to create a zero energy home running entirely on renewable energy have been consistantly blocked by the planning system and I have a large database of buildings where similar problems have been encountered.\r\nA house of commons select committee has concluded that the planning system is the greatest barrier to sustainability in the UK and this is an insurmountable obstacle to anybody doing what I am trying to do. This is unacceptable.\r\nThe planning system needs to be reformed so that it promotes rather than discourages sustainability.\r\n",
