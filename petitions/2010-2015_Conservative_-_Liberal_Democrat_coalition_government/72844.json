But a study of 5,481 children shows that this means summer-born children are far more likely to be placed in the bottom sets than their autumn-born peers.\r\n\r\nAugust-born pupils are more than twice as likely to be in the bottom set as their classmates born the previous September, researchers at London University's Institute of Education found. September-born children are almost three times as likely to be in the top stream as their August-born peers, the study shows.",
