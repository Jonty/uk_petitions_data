        "additional_details": "Tony Blair is the current MEE and instead of holding this post he should be on trial for an illegal war and the killing of civilians!\r\nU.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan stated in September 2004: \u201cFrom our point of view and the U.N. Charter point of view it [the Iraqi war] was illegal\u201d.\r\nNo peace has been achieved in the Middle East since he was appointed.\r\nWe, the undersigned, want the removal of Tony Blair as the MEE and want a democratically elected person as MEE. We do not want a biased person that has no consideration for loss of lives. He has resolved no conflict to date. Syria, Iraq and Egypt, have no stability and the Palestinian conflict has claimed too many lives in such a short time. What has the MEE been doing?\r\nWe want an end to the Palestinian crisis IMMEDIATELY, and want an Envoy sent there who works in the name of \u2018Humanity\u2019. All killings regardless of religion have to be stopped and PEACE in the region has to be first priority.",
