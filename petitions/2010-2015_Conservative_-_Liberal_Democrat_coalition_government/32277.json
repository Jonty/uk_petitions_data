NO, not an Andrew Neil mug competition.\r\n\r\nUlster Scots is a dialect which is spoken in Northern Ireland. (btw... by less than 0.2% of UK)\r\nNow asks yourselves Do I need to know this, to get my 10y vote. IS THIS FAIR?\r\n\r\nThese amongst MANY other errors in the test make it de-facto discriminatory &prevent me from my simple, hard-earned vote.\r\n\r\nPls support my application: the right 2 vote should b given 2 anyone who is a permanent resident of the UK and pays any amount of taxes. If you disagree, I challenge u 2 the test.Sof\r\nhttp://www.ukcitizenshiptest.co.uk/",
