As well as annoying the rest of us this must waste a great deal of time and money for the relevant government department.\r\n\r\nMaybe if it were pointed out to them (say by a well publicised general message) that since they are not economically active in the UK their day to day purchases bring no benefit to our society so they should not expect the same rewards, and that if they really miss \u00a3200 per year so much then perhaps they shouldn't have retired, it might persuade them to pursue some other less self-interested cause?",
