        "additional_details": "Many road users (motor, pedal and other powered) are not aware of the rules and guidance  in place for sharing the road with other users, in particular cyclists.\r\n\r\nOfficial advice is generally clear but not well known leading to hazardous road-usage, which can be fatal.\r\n\r\nThis petition requests a campaign of public-awareness to promote the current laws and guidance.\r\n\r\nThe benefits to all would be sizeable and measurable.\r\n\r\nE.g.: motor-powered road users would understand that roads are not for their exclusive use and that they have a responsibility to share safely with cyclists (and other vulnerable users).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, cyclists would understand that the Highway Code and other road/traffic laws (e.g. traffic lights) do apply to them.\r\n\r\nA simple campaign as advocated has the potential to greatly improve road safety and confer additional health benefits, along with reduced costs to the state to offset the expense of such a campaign.",
