        "additional_details": "I propose the age limit for riding mopeds/scooters be raised from 16 to a minimum of 20. Too many young teens do not fully understand the dangers of riding irresponsibly; harrassing other road users, riding above the speed limits, swerving in and out of traffic at speed with no regard for other road users, the tampering of helmets for fashion trends, the lack of proper safety clothing in favor of shorts and t-shirt.  This all points towards the complete disregard a majority of young teen riders have for riding and begs for a lifting in the moped/scooter license age. I am a fully licensed rider myself.",
