        "additional_details": "As most of you will know, insurance is a complete joke these days. They say it's because of all the accidents and what not, but the real reason is that insurance companies are greedy. As most of you will be aware, a lot of insurance companies offer a 'black box' that fits into your car and monitors your speed, acceleration, braking and pretty much everything else. I think, that if the government forced everyone to get a black box, MOST people will drive a lot more sensibly, and be rewarded with less extreme insurance premiums!\r\nThis would also help the police force not need the APNR cameras, and therefore save money.\r\nObviously, some cars (especially older ones) won't be able to have the box installed, due to connection reasons and what not, and like the road tax law, if the vehicle is over a certain age or cant have the box, they will have to be exempt.\r\nThere would be a lot less car crime, less accidents and more importantly, less deaths.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
