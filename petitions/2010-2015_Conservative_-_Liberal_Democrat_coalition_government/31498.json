        "additional_details": "The introduction of local pay setting for public sector workers should be abolished. To introduce such a scheme is against the principles of equality. .\r\n\r\nTo introduce local pay setting will discriminate against an employee doing the same job as another employee somewhere else in the country, it will also ensure that wages, house prices and investment remain low in less well off areas of the country. information that public sectors workers are on considerably higher salaries is both incorrect and flawed. The government should publically make available all of the information on how they have arrived at their assumption of disparity between public and private sector pay for comparable jobs.\r\n",
