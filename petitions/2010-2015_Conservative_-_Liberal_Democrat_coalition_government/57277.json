        "additional_details": "Please sign this e-petition to oppose this government's intention to privatise the student loan book. To attract private buyers this will involve the removal of mechanisms which currently limit the amount of interest graduates can pay. This will impact on hundreds of thousands of graduates who took these loans out in good faith on the understanding that they would not be required to pay commercial levels of interest. This underhanded move will impact unfairly and disproportionately on individuals who have had to fund their own way through education, as opposed to individuals from wealthy backgrounds who had their university education paid for. It is an attack that does much to reinforce the widely held notion that this socially exclusive government do not value social mobility, and if anything will legislate to restrict it, and in doing so undermine the fundamental principle of equality of opportunity.",
