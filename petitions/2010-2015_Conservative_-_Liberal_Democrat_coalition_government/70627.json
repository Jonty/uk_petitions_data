        "additional_details": "Lee Rigby? Murdered in his own country, in a vile and barbaric way. The person who comitted the crime is now locked away, being fed 3 times a day and kept warm through the winter nights. Would you want the person who killed your brother, father, son, sister and so on living this way? Or living at all? Not even soldiers out in the war are even being fed this much. They're reduced for two meals a day, I don't believe a soldier should be second to a criminal, a murderer.\r\nIf someone takes a life surely there's should be taken too. Bringing back the death penalty may actually reduce murder in our country and return justice for those who are 8 foot under without anything to say for themselves.\r\nLee Rigby won't be able to see his child grow up..\r\n Eye for an eye.\r\nPlease support this petition only if you believe in what I say. Help stop murder in the streets of our country by killing those who do.\r\n",
