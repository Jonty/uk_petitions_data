        "additional_details": "The businesses who produce mass waste packaging on a grand scale for fast food bear no real responsibility for the constant build up of waste on our streets and countryside.\r\n\r\nI propose that initially for all fast food packaging, a nominal returnable value for all waste packing to become a statute in law.  This will be accomplished by imposing a minimal return value of 1p be applied to each piece of packaging, wrapping that accompanies a consumers purchase.  For larger items such a tins and bottles, this may be a larger amount  5p.\r\n\r\nCompletely biodegradable packaging and wrapping will be exempt or classed with a lower return value.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility for the return and re-cycling of the waste packing will in future be borne by the originator of the wrapping and packaging.\r\n\r\nThis will take place by consumers returning their waste packaging for a discount off food purchases or direct amount\r\n",
