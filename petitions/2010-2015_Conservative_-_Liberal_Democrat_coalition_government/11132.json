        "additional_details": "Every 16 year old should be prevented from leaving the education system unless they have an identified 'next step'  such as a job, an apprenticeship, a place in further education or the armed forces. If not they could float off into society with what they feel is no place or purpose in it.  What a waste.  Educational Vocational Bridging Assocations should be set up in each local authority from which advisors work with pupils during the last 2 years of secondary school.  If together they have not identified a next step the pupil should be made to stay in under the authority of the  EVBA andnot released until they have found their 'next step'.  ",
