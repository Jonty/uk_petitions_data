Why are people allowed to mutilate children in this way? Female Circumcision(also known as Female genital mutilation) is banned so why not Male circumcision?\r\n\r\nMy Brother was circumcised for medical reasons as a baby. As long as there are clear medical reasons, there is no issue. If there are no medical reasons then it should be illegal and circumcision should be banned. ",
