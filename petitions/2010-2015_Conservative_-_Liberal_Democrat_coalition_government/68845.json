        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to take a stand regarding all the NON recyclable food containers and packaging Supermarkets produce.  It all goes to land fill and they get away with it.  They just purely think about the profit not the environment. They claim they do this and that for the environment but all they do is keep the Government and public happy eg. Plastic carrier bags, this just saves them money and people think it is them looking after the environment.  They could provide free recyclable carriers bags!\r\nACTION:  To put real pressure on these Supermarkets to make all their packaging recyclable.\r\n",
