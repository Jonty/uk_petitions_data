        "additional_details": "In the GCSE English examinations of Summer 2012 - the exam boards responsible for marking the papers have raised the marking boundaries without consultation and after the actual examination was sat.\r\n\r\nThis has had an adverse affect of the results for both the schools and the pupils, which in turn has had a detrimental effect on the pupil's application for further education.\r\n\r\nEnglish is a core subject and it is essential for many students to attain a C grade or above. By changing the marking criteria the teachers have not been allowed to review their teaching methods to enable more students to achieve this mark.\r\n\r\nAn independent inquiry needs to be opened to review this as the cost of these student re-sitting exams, appeals will both be expensive and time consuming, and potentially affect these students for the rest of their lives\r\n\r\nAny changes should be consulted and put in place at the beginning of the school year, goalposts CANNOT be moved.",
