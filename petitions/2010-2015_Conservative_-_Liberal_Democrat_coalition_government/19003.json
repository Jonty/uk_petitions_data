        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, oppose the proposal to block material considered to be pornographic unless users opt-in with their ISP to view such material. While we agree that children should be protected from potentially damaging websites, we argue that this responsibility is parental, not governmental. We object to the censorship of legal material from consenting adults and challenge the fairness in adults having to effectively ask permission to access such material. Further, we are concerned that the government does not pander to the niche morality of religious groups or charities without wider public consultation allowing for all voices to be heard.",
