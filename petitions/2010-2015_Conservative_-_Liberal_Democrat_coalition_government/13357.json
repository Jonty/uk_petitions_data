UK homes should not be acquired by overseas property speculators and those seeking a UK holiday home / bolt-hole.\r\n\r\nKnight Frank has noted that 63% of purchases in the central London new build market (2010 International Project Marketing report) were made by overseas nationals and that only 41% of central London new-build properties were purchased for owner occupation.   Investors from the Far East accounted for 28% of new-build purchases and 51 nationalities are pursuing prime residential properties in London.\r\n\r\nThis open-door policy drives up property prices, puts further pressure on the limited supply of land and forces those working in London to commute ever further distances, creating greater carbon footprints.
