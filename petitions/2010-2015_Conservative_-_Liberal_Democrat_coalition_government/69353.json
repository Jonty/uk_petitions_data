This does not limit the starting point for MPs' salaries, but once that  point is agreed, future changes would be linked to the incomes of the most vulnerable working people: increase Minimum Wage by < 1% = no pay rise for MPs\r\n- linking both conditions and limits for expenses to those typical of Local Government Employees\r\n- introducing performance related pay by publishing performance indicators for each MP direct to their constituents - with automatic right of recall if they do not meet published thresholds\r\n- make redundancy pay on loss of seat the responsibility of their party, except in case of boundary changes",
