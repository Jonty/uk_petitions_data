        "additional_details": "In order for MP's to understand how difficult life is on an average person's wage they too should have to live on an average wage. The PM should be on a higher wage as the job is running the country but it shouldn't be astonomically high in comparison to the national average. This would allow parliament to understand how difficult it is to get by and so would be able to make more informed decisions on such things as tax and duty.",
