        "additional_details": "Tony Blair knowingly deceived the nation by accusing Iraq of possessing Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD's) that he (and his cabinet) knew he did not.  This deceit has led directly to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi's, hundreds of British Servicemen, the breakdown of Syria, and led to an exponential increase in the number of muslims around the world taking up Jihad against the UK.  One could argue Blair's foreign policies led directly to the death of Leigh Rigby for instance. ",
