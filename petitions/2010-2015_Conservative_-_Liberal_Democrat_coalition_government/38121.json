        "additional_details": "The government should stand firm against the meddling by European regulators which has forced Lloyds TSB to sell 632 branches and transfer up to 4.8 million customers to the Co-operative bank.\r\n\r\nLloyds TSB customers are free to change bank if they wish and should not be forced to do so or sold off.\r\n\r\nLloyds TSB should not be permitted to disclose their customers' detailed private information to another bank.\r\n\r\nThe disruption to the businesses affected and to private individuals will be substantial.\r\n\r\nIn order to stay with Lloyds the customers are required to close their accounts and open them again at a different branch, which presumably will be less convenient to them or outside of their locality.\r\n\r\nLloyds TSB did the country a favour when it rescued HBOS.  They do not deserve this slap in the face.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to ask the Government to intervene and refuse this European directive.",
