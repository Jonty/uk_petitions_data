        "additional_details": "This is a petition to ask the government to remove the charge (currently twenty pounds) to update the photo on a driving licence photocard. Drivers are required to comply; they should not also be required to pay.\r\n\r\nIf the DVLA requires a new photograph every ten years, it should bear the cost. There is no charge for updating address or other details, so it is unfair for the DVLA to charge to update the photograph. It is also unfair that the charge only applies to drivers who have a photocard; many still have older, paper-only licences without a photograph at all.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this charge is disproportionate to the costs involved.\r\n\r\nThis charge is also likely to be counter-productive: it may actually deter people (for example, those who don't currently have a photocard licence)  from updating their other details to avoid having to pay in future, so that the DVLA database will end up being less accurate and up-to-date.\r\n\r\nPlease support this petition to scrap this unfair charge.",
