        "additional_details": "A FACT, people who don't pay for meds are likely to collect meds which they may not use or rarely use. They do not tell their pharmacist/dr that they do not require such quantities. They do this as its free! Every person exempt except for 60+ and 16- should pay a minimum charge of 50p-\u00a31 for their meds. I think that's fair as many are LIVING off the Meds. That's a little cost to truly SURVIVE, its not living \"I don't have sky etc\" this is SURVIVAL. At the most \u00a312 a year! Why relay the increase in cost to paying public. People exempt from paying easily afford \u00a312 a year on cigs, alcohol, cinema, a night out etc. and I'm not saying they don't have a right to luxuries even if the working pop are paying for it, They should contribute a \u00a31 each month!We throw away \u00a3100million of medicines a year (reality triple the figure). This system I propose will benefit every single person on this land. ",
