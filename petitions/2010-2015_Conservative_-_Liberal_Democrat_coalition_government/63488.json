Is it not time to have a public and totally independent commission to monitor and regulate MPs. Make decisions on their pay, expenses, decide what action to take if rules have been broken. This commission should be run by ordinary voters so as to be totally transparent. It should have power and teeth to act when necessary which with give it credibility and restore public confidence.",
