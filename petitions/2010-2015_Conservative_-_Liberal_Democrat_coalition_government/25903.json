        "additional_details": "Something really needs to be done about the disproportionate cost of calls made from mobile telephones to 0845/0800 numbers, compared to that of the same calls made from a landline, the charges, I feel, are extortionate and sadly, a lot of 0845 numbers are numbers to contact helplines for people who are unemployed, the sick or people of pension age. After some research, I also discovered that many telephone numbers to support groups for people who suffer with an illness are 0845. Even groups who support those who suffer with an addiction, domestic abuse, people who have been raped or abused, even the Samaritan's telephone number is an 0845 number! State benefit claim telephone numbers are 0845 too.\r\n\r\nWe urge the Government to assess and consider current charges and we propose a reduction in price of these telephone numbers from landlines and mobile phones.\r\n\r\nThank you :) ",
