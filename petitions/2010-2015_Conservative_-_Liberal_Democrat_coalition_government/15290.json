Some people may disagree  however when you consider in total you are taxed 35% to 45% of what you earn it starts to change your mind. Do you realize that around 80% of petrol is tax, its the second income tax the government never told you about, 20%VAT, \u00a31500 council tax , from \u00a3480 a week you take home \u00a3370.
