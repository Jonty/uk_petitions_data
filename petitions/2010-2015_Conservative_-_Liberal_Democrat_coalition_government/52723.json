This will allow commuters to travel to and from their workplaces safely. Commuters cant chose their work hours, and therefore have no option but to use the roads during these busy times. This will also alleviate the distress of HGV drivers when they have to share the roads with commuter traffic - HGV's have very poor visibility of their surroundings, and have so many blind spots, they would probably welcome this!\r\n\r\nLets save lives and make London roads a safer place!\r\n",
