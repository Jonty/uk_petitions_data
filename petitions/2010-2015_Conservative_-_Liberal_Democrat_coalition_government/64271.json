        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the government to take action to ban the issue of permits allowing companies to lawfully kill Seals and other Pinniped species throughout the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nWe believe any such culls to be a barbaric and unnecessary measure. We ask that their potential intelligence be taken into account and the complexities of their extended family groups.\r\n\r\nThere is little evidence to support the theory that the Seal population is damaging fish populations as these animals have lived in harmony with their environment for thousands of years.\r\n\r\nAs there are non lethal methods available to control seal populations we request that these methods be made available to firms who would usually request a licence to cull and that all firms who would normally be granted a licence be required to undertake and provide Seal Management Training Courses to employees to negate the necessity of ever killing a seal.\r\n",
