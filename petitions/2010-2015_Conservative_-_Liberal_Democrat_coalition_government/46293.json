        "additional_details": "W4B have submitted a planning application to build a 50 MW biofuel power station at Avonmouth Docks, which would burn up to 90,000 tonnes of palm oil every year. The local communtity rejected the plans but were overuled by Eric Pickles. The plant is now going ahead.\r\n\r\nWe want to see this decision over turned and a ban on further such plants in the UK.\r\n\r\nPallm Oil production sees areas of the rainforest equal to the size of North Korea burned and destroyed each year. Species including the Orangutang are injured, killed and threatened with extinction. Local inhabitants are displaced from their land. Rivers are polluted and it is the second biggest cause of carbon emissions on earth. This unethical, unsustainable form of energy production has no place in Bristol, or the UK.\r\n\r\nSee video for more information.\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=Qfd0H9gmluo\r\n",
