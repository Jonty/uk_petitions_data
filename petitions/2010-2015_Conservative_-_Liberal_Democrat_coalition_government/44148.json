        "additional_details": "Mr Bobby Kilkenny a 29yr old From Diss, Norfolk, lost his leg in 2010.\r\nBy the end of January 2013, the DLA are stopping his disability allowance despite being an amputee. As it is Mr Kilkennys right leg that is amputated he is unable to drive an normal clutch controlled car. To drive he would need a specially adapted vehicle, one of his benefits entitles him to this adapted vehicle. By stopping his benefit Mr Kilkenny is unable to drive to the hospital for check-ups, get to work, and do every day to day things that we take for granted.\r\nThis petition is to change the decision and get Mr Kilkennys motability benefit reinstated so he can have the same quality of life as others.\r\nTo those who sign, thank you it really means alot.",
