It's all very well cutting our benefits but at least encourage people to work not tar us all with the same brush 13 week courses sat on computers looking for jobs is hardly stimulating or helpful for that matter . There should at least be courses supplied for maybe any confidence issues a person has or simply general standard education I myself have tried for months to get funding to start childminding and no ones willing to help so I can look after my disabled partner and kids whilst bringing home a wage how do they expect people to work when we are made to feel worthless. It's about time to be seen and treated as an equal. Start focusing on those whom wish to work rather than have people struggle to live there daily life",
