        "additional_details": "The current system of deregulated bus services outside of London has been a conspicuous failure.  Ridership has plummeted, fares have risen exponentially, and on evenings and on Sundays, many services have their frequencies decimated, because unprofitable services such as these are not financially attractive to the commercially motivated big bus groups.  If we cannot have full resumption of public ownership of bus services, we must have some form of re-regulation, where fares, routes and frequencies are decided with the needs of the travelling public, not shareholders, foremost among the considerations.",
