        "additional_details": "150 Million seahorses are caught many of them during breading season to feed demand for traditional Chinese medicines alone. They will be lost forever if a solution cannot be found within the next five years. Captive breading and therefore farming is possible. So why is so little being done to protect the various Species and alternative solutions to be implemented. It is too late for re-education of the human population. Only global change to the laws on harvesting these creatures from our seas will save this beautiful species.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.saveourseahorses.org/home.php\r\nhttp://www.theseahorsetrust.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly a global unified Government Intervention will now prevent this. How long must we wait to see such a change? Every Government representative should be forcing legislation NOW!!! Only 8370 Days to Extinction",
