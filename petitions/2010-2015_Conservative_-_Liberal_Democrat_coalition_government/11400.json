        "additional_details": "Following a terrible week for Britain, it is clear that something needs to be done to ensure these riots are never repeated.\r\nI do not believe the riots were cause by poverty. They were not political. The violence in Britain has differed from the kind of politically charged protests seen recently in Greece and Spain in response to hard economic times. In Britain, the rage has appeared blind, apolitical and profoundly selfish. GREED!\r\n\r\nI propose a zero tolerance approach to crime . The USA have the right idea. We MUST make punishments harsher.   I believe the law should hand down a mandatory and extended period of incarceration to anyone who has been convicted of a serious criminal offense on three or more separate occasions.\r\n\r\nThree strikes and you ARE in prison \u2013 for life. Clear laws which cannot be misinterpreted.\r\n\r\nWe urge the government to follow the voice of the people and push this petition into law. 3 strikes and you are OUT!",
