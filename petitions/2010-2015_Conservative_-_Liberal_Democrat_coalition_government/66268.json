        "additional_details": "This is a formal complaint against AQA regarding the recent examinations that have taken place. There was already an enormous amount of pressure on A-Level students and by making exams linear as well, this has prevented many students from achieving their full potential. The students this year has been faced with a group of examiners who decided to put topics on the exam which have the least relevance to the specification. No consideration has been taken into account of how much work was required of us, we are humans after all, not machines.\r\n\r\nThe education system has been designed so that students achieve to the best of their ability. If you can appreciate the destruction these recent examinations by AQA have caused to young people over the UK, then please sign below.",
