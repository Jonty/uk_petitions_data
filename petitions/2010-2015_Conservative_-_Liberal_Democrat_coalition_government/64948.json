We hope this is helpful.\r\n\r\nToo many people in high places in taxpayer funded employment, including politicians, are able to manipulate the system exponentially to increase their terminal benefits, thereby placing an unbearable burden on future taxpayers.  Taxpayer funded pensions, at the higher end, need to be brought under control.  Anybody who feels he needs more than a thousand quid a week to live on in his old age can make other provision out of his HUGE taxpayer funded salary.",
