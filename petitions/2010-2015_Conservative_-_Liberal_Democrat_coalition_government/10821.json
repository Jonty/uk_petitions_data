        "additional_details": "My primary school tells me that they don't correct all my child's spelling mistakes because it's too discouraging! Surely it would encourage the child if their spelling was corrected and they became more accurate? In secondary schools no corrections are made at all.\r\n\r\nOfsted discourage teachers from correcting all spelling mistakes. I think this is wrong and a university lecturer friend told me that she immediately rejects all applications with spelling mistakes. It also explains businesses complaints about the poor standard of new recruits. The government should refocus on the basics, such as spelling, in all schools.",
