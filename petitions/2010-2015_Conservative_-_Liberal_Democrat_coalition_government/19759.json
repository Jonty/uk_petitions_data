        "additional_details": "In this era of severe and real hardship for our own people, who are finding it hard to heat their homes during regular freezing winters, pay other necessary home bills and watch their own local services,including care for the elderly and other needy groups be diminished, it is an outrage that as a nation we have no say in the amount of overseas aid that is given out of our own taxes.  The people of this country should be given a say on whether they want this overseas support to be increased as is planned by this government, or even kept to the present level.  The Public Accounts Committee has  now reported that a substantial amount of this aid will continue to be plundered and obviously,therefore, of little help to many of the world's poorer people.   We the people should now have the right of say on this matter - not politicians who have no idea about how to pay the monthly bills, let the government be brave enough to give us a referendum on this.
