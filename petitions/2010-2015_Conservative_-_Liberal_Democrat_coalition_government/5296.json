        "additional_details": "Put simply, probability theory is being able to calculate how likely something is to happen. Obviously, knowing how likely something is vital to know if it worth implementing in the first place.\r\n\r\nSadly, all too many adults have a complete lack of understanding of probability theory. Unlike other  ignorance, many high-up people are sadly lacking in understanding probability with disastrous results. Andrew Langsey over NHS reforms and Andrew Johnson of drug law reform are two pertinent examples.\r\n\r\nProbability theory may sound simple but sadly humans tend to have a blind spot (partly due to the tendency to spot patterns when they are none) when it comes to calculating it, and unless they are aware of the \"natural\" mistakes, people tend to make them repeatedly, plowing on as if totally right.\r\n\r\nIf probabilty theory was taught at schools from 8-16, adults would be aware of likelyness and so be inclined to make much better decisions - you can't have a better reason than that.",
