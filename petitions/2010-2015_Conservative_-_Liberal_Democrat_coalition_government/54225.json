We are asking you to intervene to prevent plans by the London Borough of Lewisham to force the estate's remaining residents to give up their homes and demolish them. These plans will displace the settled and harmonious community that has built up there over the last 67 years and will cause much distress to the residents, including World War II veterans, many of whom will be unable to afford new homes. Already some have had to move away from the area after their homes were compulsorily purchased by the council. The Excalibur Estate is an irreplaceable piece of social and architectural history, if the council's plans go ahead the loss would be devastating.\r\n\r\nPlease save the Excalibur Estate.\r\n",
