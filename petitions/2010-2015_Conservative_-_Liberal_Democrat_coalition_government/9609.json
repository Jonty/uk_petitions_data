        "additional_details": "With the recent levels of disorder experienced in towns and cities across England and Wales, it is plain to see that the 20% cuts to the policing budget as proposed by the coalition government are unrealistic and unsustainable.\r\n\r\nThese cuts should be significantly reduced, if not scrapped altogether. Despite claims to the contrary, a 20% budget cut will affect front-line police services. Officer morale will be decreased, along with equipment, essential police staff jobs and a significant cut to the number of police officers available to patrol or respond to calls.\r\n\r\nThe recent disorder in London only subsided when an extra 10,000 officers were sourced from other police forces. This came at a great cost. Police Officers had all leave cancelled and were told to work 12 hour shifts. This comes in the height of summer, when most people, including our Prime Minister, are planning a holiday.",
