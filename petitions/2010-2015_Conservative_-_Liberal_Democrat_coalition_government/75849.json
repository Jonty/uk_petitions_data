        "additional_details": "Calling for an embargo on the sale of all UK equipment to and purchases from Israel as well as the breaking off of all military contacts. Israel's latest military attack on Gaza is only made possible through the continued financial, military and diplomatic support Israel receives from Western states. In the West Bank, the expansion of Israeli settlements and the continued construction of the Apartheid Wall are creating an irreversible reality of permanent Occupation.\r\n\r\nAll the above actions are illegal under international law, but the British government has failed to call Israel to account for its crimes. It is up to ordinary people around the world to take action.\r\n\r\nPlease supports the call to build a global movement of boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel until it complies with international law and meets the following demands: an end to the Occupation; the right of return for Palestinian refugees; and equal rights for Palestinian citizens of Israel itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
