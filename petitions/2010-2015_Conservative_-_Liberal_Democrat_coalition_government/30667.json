        "additional_details": "This petition requests that government look into the feasibility of creating an Open Access Central Repository that will hold all publications relating to publically funded research. That can be accessed free of charge by the public and be used to promote research and development in the UK.\r\nMany institutions have experimented with the idea of Open Access e.g. The Wellcome Trust, Oxford Open Journals, etc. Yet a centralised system, electronic or hard copy, that collates all this information into one place could help provide a wealth of information for future research. As well as streamlining the way people search and find relevant publications by supplying a recognisable, single point of access.\r\nFor more information on the effects of Open Access see below:\r\nhttp://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/programmerelated/2010/openaccessmainbrochure.aspx\r\nhttp://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/briefing-papers/POST-PN-397\r\n",
