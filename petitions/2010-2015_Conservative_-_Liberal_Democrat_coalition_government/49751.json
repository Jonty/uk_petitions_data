A Google investigation uncovered that it had in fact reduced in size by 14%.  Further investigation uncovered that this trend is happening throughout the industry.  Yorkies have reduced in size by 20% over the years, despite the price of cocoa dropping 40% in that time.\r\n\r\nWe must act now!  If we don\u2019t we risk 'fun sized' chocolate bars outweighing their 'normal' sized counterparts.\r\n\r\nNo one wants that.\r\n\r\nStop the Stealth price hikes !!",
