        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, want the Government to abolish the proposed 50% increase in the cost of postage stamps this coming April 2012.  The availability of cheap stamps is essential to this country's communication network and the proposed cost will stop mail volumes which are already reduced.  We propose that the increase in April in stamp prices should not be above the current rate of inflation.  ",
