        "additional_details": "In the wake of the recent scandals relating to meat, I propose that all meat products within the UK are labelled with accurate information relating to the history of the meat.\r\n\r\nThis information would include farm of origin & method of slaughter. If the products are processed from more than one animal it would need to be stated that the meat within the product came from more than a solitary animal source. Similarly if the contents of the processed product came from more than one type of animal this also would need to be clearly stated.\r\n\r\nVegetables in supermarkets are often labelled with country of origin and this would be a more detailed extension of this principle.\r\n\r\nThe information relating to the method of production would also help shoppers to make informed ethical decisions about which product they choose to purchase.",
