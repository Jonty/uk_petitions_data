        "action": "Legalise all currently illegal drugs",
        "additional_details": "All currently illegal recreational drugs should be legalised, regulated and taxed in a similar way to alcohol and tobacco. The tax for each drug or family of drugs should be set as follows: a base rate which matches VAT, plus an amount reviewed annually which factors in costs to the public purse associated with these drugs from healthcare, policing etc. So for instance if alcohol induced violence rises, the alcohol tax would rise.\r\n\r\nIntoxication by recreational drugs would never be a defence but would continue to be an offence in some situations. For instance, driving while high or otherwise intoxicated would still be criminal.\r\n\r\nEducation on drugs should be radically simplified to present citizens with the facts, pros and cons of drugs. For instance, cannabis can make you feel relaxed and happy, but might make you feel paranoid.\r\n\r\nThe focus should be on citizens making a choice about their own lives and whether to use any drug or not.",
