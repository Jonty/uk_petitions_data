If, for example, the only benefit that the person being cared for is state pension, Carer's Allowance cannot be claimed by the carer.  What are Carer's supposed to live on?\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, carers save this country millions of pounds and are totally ignored by the government.\r\n\r\nI would like to the Government to change the rules in order to help carers.",
