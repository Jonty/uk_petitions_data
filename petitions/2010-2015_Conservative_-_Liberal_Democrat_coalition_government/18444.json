        "additional_details": "Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning kills around 50 people a year in the UK. This could be avoided by the use of CO alarms. However many UK properties including those in the rented sector do not have them. This petition is requesting a change in the law (building controls) making it mandatory for household boiler manufacturers to include an integral CO alarm within all new boilers installed in homes. These alarms would be powered by the boiler power supply (with a battery backup). Overtime as old boilers are replaced by the new boilers with integral CO alarms the % of households with CO alarms should increase and this needless death toll should fall.",
