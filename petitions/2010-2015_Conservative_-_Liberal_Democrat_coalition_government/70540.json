        "additional_details": "All carers in the private care home sector receive minimum wage. This makes them amongst the lowest paid workers in the country. They do a special job of caring for our elderly, disabled and vulnerable. A job which gets harder year on year with the increased demands of CQC and council inspections, placing a huge emphasis on paperwork instead of care. This special group of workers provide the daily dignity and basic care that is so essential to those that cannot do for themselves independently, often in very difficult circumstances tolerating verbal and physical abuse from clients. I call on the government to give this amazing group of workers a little break. 0% tax on their wages. I am a qualified registered general nurse working in the private care home sector.",
