        "additional_details": "In light of recent security breaches at some of the the well know organisations (Adobe etc..), it came to  attention that many of the users passwords and personal details were leaked. Adobe in this instance were storing passwords using a very simple method and it wasn't long before the passwords could be simply revealed. People often use the same password across sites, so this leak has the potential to cause a lot of problems.\r\n\r\nThere are well known methods to securely store passwords, so should someone hack the servers and obtain this information, they could not work out the password.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to mandate that any organisation storing personal details online behind a password, must ensure that a minimum security level is employed. Fines should be payable if they are not.",
