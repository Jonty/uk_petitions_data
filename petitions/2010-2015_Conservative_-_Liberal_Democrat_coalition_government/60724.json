        "additional_details": "Parliament is in need of \u00a31bn repair. MPs complain that it is not fit for purpose. The Palace and other government buildings could be sold for huge amounts, and fit-for-purpose buildings built in Manchester. MPs and civil servants' living costs would be much reduced. It would boost the construction business and economy in the north and ease the pressure on the scarce housing in London. The other industries associated with government would be encouraged to move north, and may also encourage other companies to save money by relocating. It would dispel the image of the government being the government of London and the South East, and of being cosy with the City. There is no need for the government to be in the same city as the financial centre. (Washington/New York). Germany moved to Berlin. The symbolism may also encourage Scotland to remain in the UK. It would also rid parliament of those who are too snobbish to live and work 'up north'",
