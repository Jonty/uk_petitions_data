        "additional_details": "The action we want the government to take is to reverse the plans for Queen Mary's hospital Sidcup and re- open all the departments.  We want to see the Accident and Emergency department, the Maternity unit and all wards to be open.  The patients and residents in and around the area need this hospital back up and running as soon as possible.  Surrounding hospitals are suffering because of an overload of patients.  Patients are DYING & SUFFERING. The medical staff are working under a huge amount of pressure. Queen Elizabeth Hospital Woolwich Accident & Emergency has a queue of ambulances waiting to be checked in and beds to be allocated for them. It has been said that patients have DIED in the ambulances waiting outside Queen Elizabeth Hospital Woolwich.\r\n Surrounding hospitals are overloaded and patients and staff are suffering.\r\nThe government must not assume they know what the patients want; they should not talk on our behalf.\r\n",
