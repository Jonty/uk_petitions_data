        "additional_details": "A change in the law in April 2013 allows councils to make empty property eligable for council tax after just 1 month. This is not enough time to sell a completed new house. The council can also DICTATE when they think the property is ready to tax. Unbelievably the property can be no where near habitable when they start charging. If the government want more dwellings built why are they hamstringing developers/builders? It is time to make a stand against blatant stealth taxation. Reinstate the 6 months exemption, at least.",
