Officers have carried a baton in one form or another for years and it cannot be denied that a strike to the head is a potentially fatal blow.\r\n\r\nWhere taser is available it is the first port of call when all reasonable tac comms and primary control skills have failed. Incapacitant sprays, batons and armed response follow in that order.\r\n\r\nWe petition the British Government to invest in the safety of those who seek to maintain peace on our own streets and keep each one of us safe, by issuing taser to all warranted Police Officers - including Special Constables who voluntarily reinforce the thin blue line.\r\n",
