Rioters are being given swift and summary justice in order to deter similar future behavior and the phone hackers, bribers, recipients of bribes and anyone found to have been covering up illegal practices must be treated as severely. If the establishment cannot get its house in order then what example does this set to the rest of the country.\r\n\r\nThese people have tarnished the image of the UK as much as, if not more than, the rioters.  An example should be set.",
