To ensure the NHS will continue to strive for excellence, a charter would be created to include, care excellence levels, research into new drugs & therapies, mandatory treatment minimums. A patient's bill of rights for health & treatments.\r\n\r\nThis new NHS would thrive, with more opportunity to inward invest, offer radical treatments, and care in new ways, and be funded directly from each & every \"shareholder\"who could raise funds to purchase useful devices & machines to make their own local surgeries more efficient, like ultrasound, xray etc. fund extra services like day beds, treat minor injuries, like simple fractures, sew up small wounds etc. ",
