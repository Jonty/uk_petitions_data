        "action": "Change the law to prevent the DVLA from releasing vehicle ownership information to private sector parking contractors",
        "additional_details": "At the moment the law allows the DVLA to release information to anyone who has 'reasonable cause' to have it. Circumstances that have been judged to meet the reasonable cause criteria include safety recalls by manufacturers, minor hit and run incidents not warranting a full police investigation, housing associations dealing with abandoned vehicles, the enforcement of parking restrictions on private property and insurance companies dealing with accidents and investigating fraud. The problem is that this flow of information has spawned an industry of ruthless parking contractors who are able to charge outrageous fees and this petition proposes that they should not be able to obtain vehicle ownership details from the DVLA.",
