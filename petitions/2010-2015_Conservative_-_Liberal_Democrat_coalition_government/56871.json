There are far more people holding British passports fighting Jihad around the World, murdering innocent people and none of these will face justice when they return to the UK.  This is asymmetrical warfare, our troops are fighting an barbaric enemy and our military is being mired in litigation by elements of the left-wing and the Islamic Community in the UK.",
