        "additional_details": "Over a million mobile homecare workers travel hundreds of miles a week calling on up to 20  clients a day. We are paid by the minute and only while we are in the clients home. Travel between clients is not paid and most only receive 20 - 25p per mile fuel allowance. We are often out and about alone in all weathers for 14-16 hours. We think we deserve a decent hourly wage plus pay for travel time.",
