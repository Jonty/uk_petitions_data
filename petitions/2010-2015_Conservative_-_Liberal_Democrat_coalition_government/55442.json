        "additional_details": "Having watch all three main party conferences, I was astounded at how little the leaders of each party actually had to say. Yes, they may have given the keynote speeches at their respective conferences, but what did they actually say about politics? The constituents deserve to know about what each party is focusing on, rather than having to listen to the endless trash that leaves Cameron's, Miliband's and Clegg's lips. This is why a televised debate would be ideal. There would be no preperation for the party leaders, the questions would be decided by an independant panel and hosted by David Dimbleby.",
