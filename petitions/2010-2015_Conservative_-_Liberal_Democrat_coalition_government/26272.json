As many as 7,004 bikers and their pillions lost their lives between 1999 and 2010 and the biker casualty rate is currently a staggering 61 times greater than that of motorists. With questions currently selected at random, there is no guarantee that a question relating to the awareness of motorcyclists will arise in the current test format and this petition is set to challenge that.
