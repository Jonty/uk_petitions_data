        "additional_details": "Dear Department for Work and Pensions,\r\nThe current youth minimum wage for a 16-17 year old is \u00a33.68. This wage is extremely bad, with many companies exploiting this, with 16-17 year olds doing the same job as an adult.\r\n\r\nWith inflation increasing, I believe an increase in the minimum wage for youth employment should be raised drastically to around the \u00a34 mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
