Taylor started raping children again until he was caught again and Jailed in 2009 for another 12 years. Will our Justice System allow this man to continue to harm and kill the innocent?\r\n\r\nThis could just be an isolated case of weak justice within our country allowing evil people back on the streets to kill, maim, abuse but the sad fact it is NOT.\r\n\r\nCapitol Punishment is maybe the only option left to stop these evil individuals and hopefully prevent the next evil person to carry out such a horrific crime as I'm sure a few years in jail fails to put the fear of god into them.\r\n\r\nIf not life should mean life for the most serious crimes, no chance of parole.",
