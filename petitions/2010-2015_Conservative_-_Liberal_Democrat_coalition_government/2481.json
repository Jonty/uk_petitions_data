        "additional_details": "As per the Liberal-Democrat party manifesto of 2010, there should not be a like-for-like replacement of the Trident nuclear system, which could cost \u00a3100 billion. We should re-consider any need for a nuclear defence system; North Korea are alleged to possess nuclear warheads, yet have decided not to use them against South Korea (who do not possess them) despite still being at war. Given that the supposed primary threat of attack against the UK is from terrorism, and terrorists come from the UK and elsewhere, nuclear weapons will not act as a deterrent. If there are nuclear threats posed by other countries, then Parliament should provide verifiable evidence of any threat, to assess whether any projected cost is commensurate in the current economic climate. The government should seek to save at least \u00a350 billion from the non-commissioning of nuclear weapons; this saving should be re-invested transparently into health, education and pensions.",
