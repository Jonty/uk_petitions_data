This means that if the digs are not rehomed by April 5th, this year, then the dogs will simply be put down.\r\n\r\nThat's right; our government would rather spend millions keeping alive child killers, paedophiles, terrorists and other serious offenders in prison, than keep alive I innocent dogs that have done nothing wrong.\r\n\r\nWhere's the justice in that?\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition!",
