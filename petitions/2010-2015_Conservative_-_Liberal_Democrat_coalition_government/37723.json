        "additional_details": "This e-petition objects to the proposed development for a power generating array of wind turbines in the Bristol Channel.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition contends that a significant number of local communities on both sides of the Bristol Channel in England & Wales will be directly affected by the detrimental effect the proposed arrays are likely to have on the tourist industry, its support services and businesses, which in turn will lead to a reduction in social mobility, increased levels of unemployment and the associated social and economic problems that become endemic in areas of social deprivation. Therefore the proposed development will directly compromise the ability of future generations to meet their own needs and is in direct conflict with the UNCED commission principles on Sustainable Development.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government is a signatory to the UNCED commission and as such it would be a breach of that commitment to permit development, the Government is therefore urged to refuse permission.",
