Each devotional government have jurisdiction on affairs in their home countries that include health, education, social services, economic development, rural affairs, culture, the environment, transport, policing, etc. It is unfair that MPs representing English constituencies is unable to vote on Scottish, Welsh & Northern Irish affairs but MPs from devotional constituencies can on English affairs.",
