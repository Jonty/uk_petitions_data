Anyone convicted under the act, should receive a minimum sentence of being fitted with headphones playing Cliff Richard mistletoe and wine on a constant loop until Dec 25th!  Furthermore, a control order known as an Xmasbo, should be awarded for life, barring the offender from, mentioning, discussing or planning for Christmas in any month other than December.
