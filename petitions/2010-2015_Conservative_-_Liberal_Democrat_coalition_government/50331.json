        "additional_details": "On the internet there are many marketing schemes for slimming/ tooth whitening/muscle building etc products. The common feature they all have is a negative billing option where the buyer pays a small postage fee, but the company enrolls them in a auto supply program which can be up to \u00a375 per month. Unforunately the general public don't realise this and the internet is littered with stories of people having to cancel credti cards to stop the payments. These products should be sold where you have to opt-in to an auto supply program.",
