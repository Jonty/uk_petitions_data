        "additional_details": "EU is a trading block between sovereign states, not requiring a constitution nor common monetary system. EU is a form of rule by dictation, as if Britain lost WW2. Britain should not be coerced to support Germany\u2019s brainchild the euro. Britain has already supported the euro when UK voluntarily gives support to Eire's euro woes. A United States of Europe, like the USSR, is doomed to failure. EU regulations (like working time directives) dictated by EU commissioners & EU Parliament impose (at times hare-brained) obligations for the UK to comply, even if against UK's own self-interests & HMG policies. Judgments (like on human rights, prisoner voting rights) by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) are precedents in UK, even in our highest court (Supreme Court). MEPs & staffing of the administration of the European Parliament are expensive & is a \u2018gravy train\u2019, as well as having to subsidise (like agriculture, fisheries) poorer EU member states.",
