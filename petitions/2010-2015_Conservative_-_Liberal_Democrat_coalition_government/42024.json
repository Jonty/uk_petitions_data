        "additional_details": "At present people who dislike their neighbours can make trouble for them by making scurrilous allegations about them to the police, the local council or the D.O.E.  Even when these allegations are proven to be false neither the police, the council nor the Environment Agency will disclose the names of the persons making the allegations.  In my honest opinion this is bad government which is a boon for Neighbours From Hell.\r\n\r\nThe law ought to be changed so that victims of such allegations could discover who is making the bullets for the authorities to fire. Possibly a small fee could be charged to discourage the frivolous time-wasters.\r\n\r\nOf course the root problem is that this country is overpopulated. ",
