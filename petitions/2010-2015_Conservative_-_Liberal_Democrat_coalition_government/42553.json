If they've travelled all the way to London if they really want to enter a museum or gallery I am sure they wouldn't object to paying a small sum when they would have to in other countries.  Even more revenue would be generated if you charge nationals too, but that does go against the ideology that our culture should be for all (of us nationals) and not just those that can afford it.  ",
