        "additional_details": "A High Court Order was passed recently to prevent access to The Pirate Bay for \"Copyright Infringement\".\r\n\r\nThe Pirate Bay does not violate any copyright laws as no copyrighted data passes through its servers. The site simply provides Magnet links, which anyone, anywhere can obtain. They no longer have a Tracker service as Seeders and Peers are found using Dynamic Hash Tables. Put simply, the censorship of The Pirate Bay will have no effect on the level of so called Piracy in the UK.\r\n\r\nCensoring The Pirate Bay for Copyright Infringement is the beginning of a slippery slope towards Internet Censorship, resulting in a UK Equivilent of the Great Firewall of China.\r\n\r\nI propose the Government overrides the High Court, rescinding the order preventing access to The Pirate Bay and amends the Digital Economy Act and/or other relevant acts to make the blocking of websites on an ISP level, illegal. The internet is a Free place, let's keep it that way.",
