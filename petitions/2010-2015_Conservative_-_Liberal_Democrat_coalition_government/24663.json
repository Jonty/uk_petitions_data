        "additional_details": "There is strong evidence from Scandinavia that when top managers earn no more than 20 times the salary of the lowest worker in the company everyone is happy. Currently many UK managers earn 150 times more than the lowest worker in the company. This is obscene. We need legislation that limits the differential to 20. If a worker earns the minimum wage, the boss should not earn more than 20 times that figure.  Bye bye ridiculously paid bankers.\r\n\r\nThis does not apply to inventors and others who deserve wealth if they have created a popular product. A thriving company which pays its workers a good wage will enable the boss to earn a lot of money - the legislation will mean that he or she cannot leave the workers behind",
