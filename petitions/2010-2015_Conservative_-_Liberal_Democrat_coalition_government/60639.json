Now is the time to change that.\r\n\r\nThe completely unjustified HS2 line must be reconsidered and some of that money reallocated to improve the transport infrastructure in the South West.\r\n\r\nThe monies being quoted for HS2 could connect Plymouth by road, rail and air.\r\n\r\nWe have sat by for too long. Not anymore.\r\n\r\n#PlymouthDeservesBetter",
