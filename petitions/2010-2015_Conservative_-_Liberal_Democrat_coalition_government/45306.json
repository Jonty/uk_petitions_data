        "additional_details": "Employers are asking for experience more and more at all levels of employment from simple cleaning jobs to general office positions. Potential employees, (usually younger candidates) are unable to gain experience from any working position nowadays as employers will not employ people without it. This is an increasing problem within the unemployment situation at the moment. I ask that the Government should discuss putting a cap on the experience required for simple jobs in the UK. Many young people are now even unable to get a job cleaning toilets or answering telephones as experience is often required. Training on the job should be offered for jobs which specific experience and qualifications are not necessary for in order to assist in employing more people in the Country.",
