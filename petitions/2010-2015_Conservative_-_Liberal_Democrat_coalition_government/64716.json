        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to instruct his department to change the music that the public are subjected to upon contacting the department by phone.\r\n\r\nWe consider the short excerpt of Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons' likely to cause aggravation due to its repetitive nature. We are confident that more varied music would make contact with the department significantly easier.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to the Secretary of State's response.",
