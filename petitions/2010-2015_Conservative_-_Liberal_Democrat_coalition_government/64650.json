The council put a life time injunction on him keeping his belongings in his garden this was illegal as part of common law says people carnt be parted of there possessions ,, Husky was told he was not allowed to repair the main building roof even tho he was willing to do this at his own cost ,, the councils reasons for wanting the building back is to repair the roof , this is a job that can be done without Husky having to move out , the council are being unreasonable expecting a poorly man to move nearly a 100 tons of heavy machinery with no where to put it after 15 years . we want his tenancy to stand .
