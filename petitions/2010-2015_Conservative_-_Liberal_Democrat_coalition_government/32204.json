        "additional_details": "There are currently two different rates of job seekers allowance (JSA) which can be claimed if you are unemployed; those for ages below 25 years old and another, higher rate for those aged 25 and over.\r\n\r\nThere are four different minimum wages, again dependent on age. The cost of bread is no cheaper whether you are 16, 18, 21 or 25, so i beg the question, why do we deserve less for our age?\r\n\r\nI am calling on the Government to abolish age related pay and benefit discrimination in order to promote an equal, fair and truly great, Great Britain.",
