MALARIA is the most preventable Worldwide killer especially when you travel from a non-endemic to an endemic region. The UK is Non-Endemic. Lack of personal immunity puts you at risk of the worst that malaria can throw at you ie Cerebral Malaria. Yet the Government/NHS makes british tourists to Endemic region like India, Africa, Indonesia, Thaiwan, Cambodia  spend high fees (\u00a315.00 for Private GP Prescription and \u00a3104.00 for a 28 day course of Malarone Tablets), hence running the risk that tourists will opt not to take protection against this DEADLY  infection.The risk is too great and Cerebral Malaria has nearly a 100% mortality. How often does this cost prevent british citizes travelling abroad from protecting themselves? The government should SCRAP THESE FEES and protect the citizens travelling abroad.",
