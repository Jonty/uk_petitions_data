It also makes it difficult to keep a record of any discussions or decisions.\r\nWeb forms to make an enquiry or complaint rarely provide the sender with a copy.\r\nThe best and simplest way is to use email which then allows the person to keep all discussion points on record until the issue has been cleared.\r\n\r\nEven Ofcom make it difficult and only provide a web page submission.\r\n\r\nAnswer:  Make it a legal requirement for all Commercial organisations, Utilities, other large organisations to provide a live email address to be able to submit questions, complaints or other communications\r\n\r\n",
