LOCOG should be urged to shelve this package because Dow owns Union Carbide, the company responsible for the Bhopal leak that killed thousands of Indians. Dow states that Union Carbide settled all claims in 1989 and that it has no responsibility for compensation or other unresolved matters.\r\n\r\nPersisting with the deal would be an insult to the Indian nation and the Bhopal victims and might precipitate a boycott of the games by India and other sympathising nations, bringing immense shame on the UK and the Olympic Games. The government should intervene to prevent the deal from proceeding.\r\n\r\nThere will doubtless be protestations from LOCOG that Dow would threaten legal action, but that is not a good enough reason for the UK to be enmeshed in such a damaging sponsorship arrangement.
