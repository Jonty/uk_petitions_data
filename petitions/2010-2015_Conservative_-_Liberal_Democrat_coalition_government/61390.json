And the problem is getting worse\r\n\r\nThis cost should be passed on to the manufactures according to their overall sales within the UK. Namely those manufactures that sell the most should bear the greater burden.\r\n\r\nThis may spur manufactures to be more environmentally aware and encourage users of their products to dispose of used gum responsibly.  Or develop products that do not pollute the streets.\r\n",
