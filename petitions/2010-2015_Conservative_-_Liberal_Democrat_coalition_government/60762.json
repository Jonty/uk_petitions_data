These methods do not reach nearly as many people, especially if an initial surge has destroyed PCs and phone lines and further warnings are necessary.\r\n    Also the new warning system requires registration and many people seemed to be unaware of it.\r\n I  speak from experience as a victim of the Boston (Lincs) flood last December.",
