        "additional_details": "I want the government to give the police more powers to crack down on anarchists like ones on who were wrecking our country in August. The police should to be allowed to use water cannon and/or other crowd dispersal techniques when rioters start attacking police, burning buildings/cars or looting shops. If we do not give them these powers, I fear this type of anarchy may happen again as we do not punish these people severley enough.",
