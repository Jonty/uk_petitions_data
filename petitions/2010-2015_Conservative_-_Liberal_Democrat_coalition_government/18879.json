        "additional_details": "Muslims Against Crusades (MAC) is an extremist Islamic group in the United Kingdom. Muslims Against Crusades believe that Muslims are not \"obliged to obey the law of the land in whatever country they reside\". In 2011, the group proposed that Muslims should set up independent emirates in select cities in the UK, operating under Sharia entirely outside British law. MAC is responsible for a number of incidents including protests outside the Royal Albert Hall and in Kensington on 11 November 2010, when two large plastic poppies were burned during the Remembrance Day silence. These were the Muslim extremists who brought shame to the memory of the dead by breaking the traditional two-minute silence with chants of \u2018British soldiers burn in hell\u2019.\r\nWe Call upon the British government to Ban Anjem Choudary and his group MAC.\r\n\r\n",
