Cats excrement is just as harmful as dogs, dog owners are responsible for cleaning it up, however I spend much of my gardening time cleaning up other peoples cat excrement. They also cause damage to property. I am having to spend money getting the scratches fixed on my car from cats climbing all over it. I also cannot leave my patio doors open in summer as other peoples cats wander into my house.  This is a quality of life issue that requires a debate in the house of commons.",
