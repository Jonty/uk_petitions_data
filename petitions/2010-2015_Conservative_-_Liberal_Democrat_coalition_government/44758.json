        "additional_details": "A Petition calling upon The Secretary of State responsible for the Animal Welfare Act 2006 to create a Regulation under Section 13 that will control and License the Dog And Cat Grooming Industry, specifically the type and conditions of use of \"Drying Cages\" and all forms of heating applied or used by commercial animal groomers.\r\n\r\nOn 30 July 2012 our 12 year old family Dog Dusty visited his usual Dog Grooming Parlour, which he had been going to for the past 9 years. After being bathed and clipped the groomer put Dusty in a \u2018metal\u2019 dog crate with an industrial dog hairdryer pointing at him, she went off to answer a phone call.  Dusty was severely burnt internally and externally and had to be put to sleep due to his injuries.\r\n\r\nThis is the 4th case in 2 years of a dog losing his life due to groomers leaving them to burn in front of a dryer!\r\n\r\nUntil this hugely popular industry is Licensed and Regulated no-one can be sure of the safety of their pet when visiting a groomers.",
