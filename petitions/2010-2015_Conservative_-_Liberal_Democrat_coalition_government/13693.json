        "additional_details": "We call upon the government to: 1) Reduce the level of cuts from 20% to 12% - the figure which independent reviewers believe can be cut without affecting frontline policing. 2) Postpone the cuts in police budgets as forces learn the lessons of the riots and prepare for the 2012 Olympics and give chief constables more time to find efficiency savings which do not affect the frontline. 3) Delay the costly introduction of Police and Crime Commissioners and use that money to support front line policing . 4) Implement the formula for the Police Grant so that it's fairly distributed across the country and doesn't lead to huge cuts in police numbers in poorer communities at the expense of richer parts of the country",
