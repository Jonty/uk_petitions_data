        "action": "Replacement of unemployment benefits with a Community Service payment",
        "additional_details": "I propose that the Government replace the current Unemployment benefits. Persons unemployed would be given tasks to carry out within the community, such as litter collection, graffiti removal, assistance to the elderly and infirm, and would be paid for these activities. This would maintain a work ethic amongst people made redundant, would encourage the long-term unemployed to return to work, and would increase the standard of living within communities by improving the area. It would also create employment in the need for supervisors for working groups.\r\n\r\nThe greatest benefit would be felt in areas of higher unemployment, and the improvement in public appearance of these areas may help encourage businesses to invest themselves. The people involved would still be allocated time to allow them to search for employment, but would benefit from a social interaction, learning new skills, and would gain a sense of accomplishment from improving their towns.",
