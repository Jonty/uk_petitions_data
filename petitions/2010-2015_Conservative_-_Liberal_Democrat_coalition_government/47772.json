        "additional_details": "Mayfair has always been a mainstay of Monopoly but now an upmarket usurper has replaced it.\r\n\r\nIn an unexpected roll of the dice in July 2011, Mayfair was voted off the board in favour of Kensington Palace Gardens. For years avoiding a heavily housed or hoteled Mayfair has been the aim of every pseudo -property tycoon.\r\n\r\nSynonymous with style, culture and heritage Mayfair has been at the luxury heart of London for centuries. And boasting some of the capitals most exclusive hotels, restaurants, shops and clubs, Mayfair deserves to be restored to the Monopoly board as London's most sought after location.\r\n\r\nYou could say that Mayfair has lost its monopoly in Monopoly. Well not any more\u2026it\u2019s time to put down our cards on the table and set the record straight.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
