        "additional_details": "We want the Government to put pressure on Care Home Owners to install CCTV in residents rooms on a 24 hour a day basis. Families should be able to also have 24 hour access, to try to eliminate the poor treatment of our elderly generation. The cost of installing the equipment should be met by the care home owners, this will also benefit them as well, by being able to see how their nursing staff are behaving.",
