        "additional_details": "At the end of last month (January 2015), First Greater Manchester withdrew a number of weekend night buses which provided an affordable (or even 'free' ride home with a season ticket) at the end of a night out in Manchester, after TFGM withdrew subsidies for them. Now these services have been withdrawn, many people can no longer afford to go out at the weekend. Late night establishments will lose a lot of money as people chose to stay at home or within their suburbs. The city centre's night time economy, which has already suffered heavily throughout the economic crisis, will suffer further.\r\n\r\nWe need to demand that TFGM reinstate the subsidies removed from bus operators which were used to provide night time services. For many years, these services have been an essential and safe transport link for many people in the Greater Manchester area. Now they've been quietly taken away with no warning or consultation.\r\n\r\nPublic transport should serve the needs of the public!",
