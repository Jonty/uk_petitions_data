        "additional_details": "Labeling baby food as \u201csuitable from 4 months old\u201d misleads parents to believe that they should be introducing solid food at this age. This encourages the introduction of solid food before the vast majority of babies are developmentally ready to eat regular food. Evidence suggests that babies should be weaned after 6 months as this gives the baby\u2019s digestive system time to develop so that they can cope fully with solid foods. Early weaning also contributes to the rising levels of childhood obesity.\r\n",
