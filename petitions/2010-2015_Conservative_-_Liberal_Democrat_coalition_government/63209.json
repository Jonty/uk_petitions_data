        "additional_details": "Nike are producing the England national football shirt and have today released the World Cup shirts at incredibly inflated prices between \u00a360-90\r\n\r\nIn this age of austerity fans should not be isolated from supporting their nation and everyone resident in the country should have the opportunity to buy a shirt and wear it to support the nation!\r\n\r\nAlthough the shirt is produced by a corporate business, it is the FA that decide who to award the contract to. I feel more should have been done in stipulating what price the shirts should be sold at! It has been done not with the fans in mind but with money, and disregards the feelings of the common supporter!\r\n\r\nI feel it should be the department of sport that steps in and regulates a fair price for any item of clothing that represents the national badge!\r\n\r\nMy petition is to make it fair and affordable, with regulations, for nationals to be able to afford and proudly wear the national shirt of the country that gave us the beautiful game!",
