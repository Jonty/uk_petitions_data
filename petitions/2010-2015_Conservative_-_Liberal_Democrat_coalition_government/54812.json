        "additional_details": "a humble suggestion for the reinvestment of the HS2 money to provide reliable, regulated and cost effective access to the moon and other resource rich orbital bodies for the purposes of (responsible and regulated) mineral extraction and exploitation.\r\nThe focus of the proposal is the creation and establishment of a UK space transport infrastructure that facilitates the mechanism from which individuals, businesses and companies can use to transport cargo, develop associated technology and provide manpower at a cost that makes commercial activity in space realistic and achievable.\r\nThis is not a proposal to develop a more substantial space industry, it is a proposal to provide a tool (like a rail network) that the commercial world can use to create one without initial transportation costs for accessing the environment.",
