Face it\r\n\r\nShould people who have never smoked in there entire lives have to put up with people smoking on the streets of Britain?\r\n\r\nI think no. Why should our lives be put at risk because of someone else's decision to smoke?\r\n\r\nWe shouldn't!\r\n\r\nThis petition is designed to bring smoking on the streets and other public areas to a final halt!\r\n\r\nI am not saying that we should ban smoking.\r\n\r\nPeople are aloud to smoke but only in a private home (inc. Council Housing and Rented Accommodation)\r\n\r\n100 000 signatures to get debated in Parliament!\r\n\r\nPlease sign if you agree with me\r\n\r\nThank you for your time",
