        "additional_details": "Obesity and its associated co-morbidities, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease (heart attacks, stroke), are responsible for a huge proportion (>\u00a31bn) of NHS spending, and account for billions more in our economy in terms of absenteeism, 'presenteeism', planning requirements/adadptations etc.\r\n\r\nThe relatively recent introduction of cheap, palatable, energy-dense foods has coincided with the explosion in obesity prevalence.  To date, government has maintained a 'soft touch' on regulating the food industry to avoid damaging business interests.  This is at the cost of the nation's health.\r\n\r\nIntroducing a tax on unhealthy foods may make people think twice before purchasing these goods, or encourage moderation of intake.  The revenues gained from this levy should be used to ensure that healthier options (including fresh fruit and veg) are cost-subsidised and made more accessible to those on a low budget.",
