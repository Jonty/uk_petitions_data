The NHS is a must have service and we will all benefit at some stage from its continuous development, but funds are short.\r\nI would like to suggest that all of us who care about the NHS and want to see it grow should be able to make voluntary contributions to the service in its time of need.\r\nThis could be done through personal taxation, giving all tax payers a choice. A 1% increase in personal tax to those who volunteer could be used to help the NHS Funding and raise substantial amounts of money.\r\nIt must be made clear that this is a voluntary action allowing people to 'opt' in on an annual basis and not imposed.\r\nHowever, funds raised in this way should be 'Ring Fenced' purely for NHS Funding and not used for any other cause at any time.\r\nFunds raised should be published yearly for all to see.\r\n",
