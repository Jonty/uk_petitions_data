        "additional_details": "\"Shooting\" as a sport is worth \u00a374bn to the UK economy. This is a completely legal passtime in the UK, however the businesses who provide the sporting guns, accessories and other related activities are regularly precluded from operating as a successful business due to limited access to bank accounts and other financial services. If a business within this sector (firearms are regulaed by 34 different acts of parliament) provides sufficient proof that they are operating within the law and are financially viable - An FCA regulated body must NOT be permited to preclude said organisation because of the nature of the business.",
