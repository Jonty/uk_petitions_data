        "action": "Listed buildings used by charities should not pay VAT on alterations",
        "additional_details": "Many charities operate from listed buildings. This is especially true of the Church of England. Forcing charities to pay VAT on alteration works could seriously compromise the ability of those charities to function through the adaptation of sometimes user-unfriendly buildings. Many charities struggle to maintain highly listed buildings (often grade I or II*) and being made to pay an extra 20% for VAT could force some vital works to be postponed or cancelled altogether. Whilst we are sympathetic to the need for HM Government to decrease the budget the removal of zero-rated VAT on alterations to listed buildings owned by charities is a retrograde step. Not only will it bring in relatively small amounts to HM Treasury but it could force some charities to either seriously compromise their ability to serve the community or bring them a step closer to closure. We  urge HM Government to rescind this measure. ",
