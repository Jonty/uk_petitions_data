        "additional_details": "As we come up to the Election - force politicians to declare where all our taxes have gone. For example, the NHS costs have doubled in 10 years. Billions of pounds and yet there are only 200,000 beds. Welfare has grown excessively and yet the Armed forces arte being cut at a time of Russia flexing its muscle and IS growing on power.\r\n\r\nWe are taxed hugely when you include National Insurance, VAT, council tax etc. The Scots council taxd includes water rates so water is an additional tax.\r\n\r\nYet the money has been squandered. Before the election - demand that an independent study looks into where all the money has gone. Exactly how much is squandered. ",
