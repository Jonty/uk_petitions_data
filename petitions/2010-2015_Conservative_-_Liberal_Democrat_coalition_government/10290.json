Eoin or Owen? Ivan or Iwan etc.\r\nThe airline industry has sensibly removed the confusion over double barreled & hyphenated surnames by simply treating them as a single word - parkerbowles etc.\r\nThis petition seeks to require the department of transport department to encourage the transport industry to take a similarly sensible stance, and use a standardised set of spellings for first names. Let there be no more Bryan's or Eoins please!",
