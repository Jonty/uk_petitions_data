        "additional_details": "Tractors and agricultural machinery to be banned from all main roads during peak times.\r\n\r\nResponsible department: Department for Transport\r\n\r\nPeak times to be defined through consultation, and all Tractors and agricultural vehicles banned from using any main routes during these times. Moving machinery between farms and fields is essential for farming. However, agricultural traffic in certain areas seems to peak at rush hour. This frequently leads to commuter tail backs of up to a mile long. Causing lengthy delays, on a daily basis, for many people. The presence of these vehicles on the roads, which is currently heightened at rush hours, is unfair to many commuters. This petition seeks the common sense solution of forcing by law, the absence of agricultural machinery during rush hours/peak traffic times, as it seems impossible to enforce laws to make them pull over at regular intervals to clear backlogged traffic.",
