        "additional_details": "This is a petition to have David Gill removed from the FA's board as it is a DEFINITE conflict of interest for him to belong to Manchester United's and the FA's board simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Alan Gill (born 5 August 1957) is British football executive, currently Chief Executive of Manchester United F.C. and a board member of the Football Association.\r\n\r\nThis is unaccepatable!!\r\nAll we want in the EPL is a level playing field which cannot occur until Gill is removed from the FA's board with immediate effect.\r\n\r\nQuestions were raised by Liverpool manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez about a potential conflict of interest between Gill's roles with Manchester United and the FA. However, Gill dismissed the Spaniard's concerns, saying that he had been elected by the other Premier League chief executives.\r\n\r\nRemove Gill immediately!!!",
