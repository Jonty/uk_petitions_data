        "additional_details": "Disability Hate Crime is on the increase and prejudice and discrimination towards disabled people is still perfectly acceptable in today's society. Racism and Homophobia are now discussed in schools as part of the PHSE and Citizenship Curriculum. Disability affects everyone at some point in life; as 20% of the population are disabled in some way. Therefore, I believe that the study of the history of disability, the Disability Rights Movement, celebration of Disabled People  and Disability Awareness should be taught in Schools in the UK. I also believe that examples of the prejudice and discrimination that Disabled people face on a daily basis should be explored; along with their effects on the individual and society as a whole.",
