        "additional_details": "The majority of Care Assistants working in care homes and the community are being paid minimum wage. We are caring for the most vulnerable people with a range of needs, many suffering with Dementia, mental health issues, behavioural issues and so on and I feel we are not valued. It is a very demanding, often stressful role but nevertheless rewarding when it comes to helping others, but not rewarding in the fact that we are being paid minimum wage and something must be done. Please sign this e-petition so this issue can be recognised and hopefully rectified. ",
