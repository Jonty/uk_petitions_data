        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the government to stop the planned regulation of investigatory organisations on any one of the following grounds:\r\n\r\n1. There already exist adequate laws to deal with abuses by private eyes and other investigators and the creation of yet another regulatory quango would be a waste of money.\r\n\r\n2. The headline making crimes that brought about the politicised call for the regulation of investigators have been commissioned and paid for by the media and law firms which would be exempt from the proposed out-of-date legislation anyway (cf The Private Security Industry Act 2001).\r\n\r\n3. Since June 2013 the media (cf USA NSA revelations) have revealed the government is involved in the illegal and/or questionable access of UK citizens\u2019 personal data; rather than regulate private eyes it should legislate that any data relating to UK citizens no matter how obtained (including by governmental organisations such as GCHQ) be only obtained and accessed lawfully.
