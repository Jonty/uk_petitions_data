        "additional_details": "We call on the Secretary of State for Education to deny consent, under section 77 of the School Standards and Frameworks Act, to the London Borough of Wandsworth to sell off nearly 60% of the grounds of Elliott Secondary School in Putney.\r\n\r\nWandsworth Council has failed to demonstrate that the sell-off of these grounds is the only way to fund urgently needed repairs to the school and pre-empted its own consultation by setting up a website for prospective developers, submitting a planning application (to itself) and actively urging residents to support its plans.\r\n\r\nSelling off school playing fields is wrong in principle and practice and the sell-off, for luxury housing, will blight the school - a listed building described by English Heritage as \"Perhaps the finest of the large comprehensive schools\".\r\n\r\nThe money exists to repair Elliott. It's just the political will that is lacking.",
