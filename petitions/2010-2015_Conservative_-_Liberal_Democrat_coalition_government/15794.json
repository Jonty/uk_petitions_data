        "additional_details": "We did NOT have a referendum on the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, now renamed Constitution Treaty. Lisbon Treaty gave effect to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Article 2 of the Charter provides that \u201ceveryone has the right to life\u201d. The abolition of the death penalty is a key objective for the European Union\u2019s human rights policy. Why should there be a constitution for Europe, if EU is merely a trading bloc? Integration into a United States of Europe will be impossible.  Before Parliament considers legislating to reintroduce the death penalty & more effectively deporting failed asylum seekers, UK should have a referendum on replacing EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees by a British Bill of Rights",
