        "additional_details": "Hi,\r\n   At present if a train is unduly delayed, the single journey ticket holders get their money back but the season ticket holders do not get any benefit. Infact the season ticket holders are the ones who guarantee regular income for the train companies.\r\n   Also the increase in fares every new year puts travellers in discomfort. Even after all the increase in fares over the years that were to guarantee better service, the trains still run late and passengers miss their connections and appointments often.\r\n    My suggestion would be to pay back the season ticket holders and other travellers a particular portion of their payment for every minute the service runs late.\r\n    This suggestion if implemented will be useful as more people will buy season tickets and will prefer to travel through trains and also it will ensure that the train companies run their trains on time.\r\nThanks\r\nAnand",
