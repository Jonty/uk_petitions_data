Putting these events down to criminality alone is an insufficient explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe all want to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again, and so we need to understand why this happened.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe want a genuinely independent inquiry into the causes, free from party politics or ideology; an opportunity for local peoples\u2019 voices and perspectives to be heard, so we can build a better future for everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe the results of this inquiry should be presented in a format that is accessible to all: young and old; rich and poor alike. We call on the government to show a real commitment to act on the results of the inquiry.",
