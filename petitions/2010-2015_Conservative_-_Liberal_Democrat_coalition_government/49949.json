        "additional_details": "Altaf Hussain leader of a Militant Political Party was granted UK Citizenship and he resides in London\r\n In his speech on 12 May, 2013 that was delivered when a rival party was peacefully protesting against rigging in the recent electoral polls in Karachi, he openly threatened them with a massacre and bloodbath. This was again done through his telephonic address that was relayed live to various areas in Karachi.  Confrontations have already been witnessed since.\r\nThe video of his speech is available on media websites.\r\n\r\nWe strongly ask the UK government and the Home Office in particular to urgently take away his citizenship, carryout a trial and deport him to Pakistan. He is using London as a \u201csafe haven\u201d to carry out his heinous activities and dispensing orders of state level terrorism. Unfortunately any inaction by the UK government would render the situation worse which is already bordering on calamitous.\r\n\r\nPlease please take urgent action!\r\nCitizens of Karachi\r\n\r\n",
