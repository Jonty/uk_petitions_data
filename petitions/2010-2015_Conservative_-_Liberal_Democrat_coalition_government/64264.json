        "additional_details": "Stephen Sutton is dying from Cancer.  On hearing the news he created a list of things he wanted to do, a bucket list, and one of them was to raise \u00a31million pounds for Teenage Cancer Trust.\r\nHe's achieved that, looks like he'll get \u00a32million.  He's told us all his story on the way.\r\nThis man is brave, an absolute hero a word often over used.\r\nHe deserves recognition and recognition before that awful day comes when he is no longer with those who he loves and love him.\r\nDON'T do this posthumously - he deserves to know his country thank him for his work before he leaves us.
