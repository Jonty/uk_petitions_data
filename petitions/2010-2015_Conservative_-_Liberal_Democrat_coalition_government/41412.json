Her mouth was too sore to wipe with wet swabs\r\nHer hands were so swollen that we had to remove her wedding ring\r\n\r\nHow can this be care?\r\n\r\nEven the fittest human being would only last 8-14 days without any food or water - If my mum were an animal people would be prosecuted\r\n\r\nThe Government must put a stop to this barbaric cost cutting exercise.",
