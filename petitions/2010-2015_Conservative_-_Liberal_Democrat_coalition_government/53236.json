        "additional_details": "By charging upfront fees for harassment and abuse claims, the government is making it easier for employers to get away with the most appalling behaviour. Seeking redress for unfair dismissal and discrimination and other injustices in the workplace is a fundamental human right \u2013 but now ministers are putting up insurmountable financial hurdles for working people in pursuit of justice\r\nThis sends a very dangerous message to employers who will be less inclined to abide by their legal obligations as the risk of being challenged will be much reduced. These fees will disproportionately hit those suffering discrimination because of their age, race, disability and gender, with women returning from maternity leave particularly hard hit as they'll be judged on their salary when they left rather than their statutory maternity pay.",
