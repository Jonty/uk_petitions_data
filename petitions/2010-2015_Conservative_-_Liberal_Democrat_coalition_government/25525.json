        "additional_details": "The Chancellor pledged to increse benefits by 5.2% in April due to the skewed formula of linking it to October's CPI.  On the election rostrum 18 months ago Cameron promised a \"fair\"society where work would be rewarded and those workers going off in the morning would not have to feel resentment to those still lying in bed on their benefit matresses.\r\n\r\nIn the same breath the Chancellor limited civil servants to a 1% pay rise after a 2 year pay freeze.  Private sector workers are getting little or no pay rises.\r\n\r\nWe are all suffering and taking a cut in our income.  It is inconceivable that people on benefits should be proteceted.\r\n\r\nVote to say no to this unfair rise in benefits.",
