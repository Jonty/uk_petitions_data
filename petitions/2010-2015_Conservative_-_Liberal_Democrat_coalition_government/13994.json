        "additional_details": "The UK\u2019s position as a global video games\r\ndevelopment hub is under threat.\r\n\r\nThere are increasing concerns about its decline. Mounting competition from countries with generous\r\npublic subsidies, such as Canada and France,  together with cheaper studios in Eastern Europe and the Far East mean that the UK has fallen in the global development rankings.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Canada officially overtook the UK to become\r\nthe third development territory in the world in terms of\r\nworkforce \u2013 according to industry insiders, the UK\r\ncould have already dropped down to the 6th position\r\nglobally, behind South Korea and China. A recent\r\nstudy by TIGA reports that the UK video games\r\nindustry has shed 900 jobs since 2008.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for tax credits and incentives for video games production similar to those already available in Canada and France, and restore Britain's place as the world leader in videogame development.",
