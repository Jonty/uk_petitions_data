        "additional_details": "On Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays the London Underground rail network should operate for 24 hours, ceasing at 00:00/early Monday mornings. This would greatly facillitate London's nightlife, making journeys home and travels between exciting night time locations cheaper and more convenient - in some cases safer with less people falling victim to illegitimate cab drivers. Such legislation is enforced in Berlin for example to great effect. It would mean more people (tourists included) would use the tube, increasing its revenue, and could only encourage more people to go out at night and spend money which struggling pubs (or even London's economy in general) would surely welcome. It could also create more jobs for night time train drivers.\r\n",
