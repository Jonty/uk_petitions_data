        "additional_details": "GPs are not necessarily the best managers, judges of value for money and quality of care for patients, as well as ensuring an integrated skillful comprehensive NHS service. Advice in which advisers/counsellors have financial interests about the need for a proposed medical treatment should be objective and free from conflicts of interests be they from private abortion providers, GP budget holders or dentists. Private profit making companies may give bias advice about the need, importance, relevance, effectiveness & quality of the services they propose to provide. Take an analogy of a private company being given an open cheque to repair a car. If not properly supervised by the customer, this may result in creative accounting by the private company for performing unnecessary expensive work. ",
