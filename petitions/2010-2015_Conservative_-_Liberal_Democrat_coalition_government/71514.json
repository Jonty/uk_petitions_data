        "additional_details": "Enough is enough! Cyberbullying is just getting worse despite the legislations that 'cover serious issues' of cyberbullying.\r\n\r\nI want the government to make a stand against bullying by having its OWN, LEGAL definition legislation i.e. The CyberBullying Act 2014/Digital Harassment Act 2014 (just some examples!)\r\n\r\nI want this legislation to put cyberbullies in JAIL for ruining young, vulnerable youths and negatively encouraging them to take their lives at such a young age!!! This issue needs to be dealt with effectively! For example, putting cyberbullies behind bars for a certain amount of time, tracking down their computer/mobile IP address so we know EXACTLY who is causing the problems behind a computer/mobile screen. Think about it. Cyber bullying is basically murder, except its done with words and behind a screen.\r\nPlease do sign this petition and let's make changes to the local community!",
