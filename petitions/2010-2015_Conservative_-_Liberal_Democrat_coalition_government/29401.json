So stop game machines and dvd players etc Box games only .To give such luxuries as gyms and time out for good behaviour is obviously not working so lets go back to the good old days of just bread and water and hard labour . It will cost you and I alot less and will be a deterrent for people wishing to commit crime.\r\n\r\n",
