So that the percentage of CO2 emissions can be reduced by at least 25%.\r\nMeasures such as making sure that every household has 270mm of Loft Insulation installed, can save the UK approx. \u00a3500 million and 2.7 million tonnes of CO2 each year (equivalent to taking approx. 100,000 cars off the road).\r\nYears ago, We and Britain lead the Industrial Revolution all over the world, so now, why can't we lead and inspire the world to take part in a Green Revolution?\r\n",
