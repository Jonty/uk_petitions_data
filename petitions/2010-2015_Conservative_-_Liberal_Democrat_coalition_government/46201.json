        "additional_details": "We the people demand access to our \"credit reports\" and \"credit scores\" is free of charge. We feel that by charging a fee to obtain the information upon which financial organisations base their decisions to provide credit is inherently unfair when the a fore said institutions can access this data free of charge. With personal debts at record levels we feel it is unfair that we are unable to assess our financial obligations in the way our creditors are permitted to without paying a fee to do so. We demand that the government either provides, or forces lenders to provide, a fully accurate description of an individuals \"credit report\" and \"credit score\" and how this relates to an applicants ability to obtain credit from the specific creditor they have applied to. It should be a legal requirement for businesses to provide customers with entirely accurate information on their eligibility for credit based the facts in each individual enquiry before a formal application has been submitted.",
