        "additional_details": "Labelling of packaged food for retail distribution should include (on the front of the packet) the actual calorific value of the entire packet/box/can, not just the recommended portion.\r\n\r\ne.g. A 140g bag of chocolate 'Revels' display on the front bottom left corner - '168kcal, 8%'. Above this 'per portion' is displayed, and below both these 'A portion = 35g standard bag' is displayed.\r\n'Per portion' and '35 standard bag' are displayed in smaller text, and outside the device with the calorie content and RDA%.\r\nThe truth of the entire example unit as-sold is '672kcal, 32% RDA in this bag', and should be displayed as such.\r\n\r\nCorrect, coherent labelling on the front of packaging will promote informed dietary choices, and potentially have a positive effect on the health of the population. This is particularly important with regard to high-calory products such as the above example.\r\nMake such labelling compulsory.\r\n",
