Michael \"Eddie the Eagle\" Edwards was for a long time our only high profile Winter Olympic personality - and only ski-jumper.  It's not just about success & winning, it's also about sacrifice, bravery, competitive spirit and taking part.\r\n\r\nHonour the spirit of this plucky Briton by showing UK's support of his efforts & endeavours (even though the IOC did not support him).\r\n\r\nRestore lost elements of the Olympic ideal and have Eddie the Eagle light the Olympic Flame!",
