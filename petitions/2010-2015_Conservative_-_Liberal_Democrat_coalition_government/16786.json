A full assessment should be made on each and every individual and they should be means tested to allow them only the basics in life.\r\nPeople claiming benefits should also be made to do charity work or to assist in keeping the areas where they live tidy and clean. It should not be a free for all society. If they want the money, then they should have to earn it like everybody else.\r\nDisability claiments should be re assessed. Yes, people are claiming that are disabled and need assistance but if there is work they could be doing, then they should be assisted into that line of work.\r\nTax payers should have a right to say where there money goes and not watch it being poured down the drain as it is now.\r\nIf you want help, we'll give you help but they should be made to work for it regardless.
