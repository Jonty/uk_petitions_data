        "additional_details": "Social, public and 'council' houses are offered for rent at below market rate. This happens as social housing stock is subsidised through taxation. Those who may never live in social housing pay for it along with their own accommodation.\r\n\r\nEnd subsidised housing. All groups holding housing stock should be forced to charge rents that mean that group is a viable business without subsidies. With the money saved, this can be given as tax relief to those who have mortgages. This relief should be given to only to those who are paying a mortgage on the property in which they live.\r\n\r\nThis would encourage responsibility in that people would have to pay the true value for rented accommodation, create a level playing field for businesses which rent property privately and encourage and reward those who wish to invest in buying their own home.
