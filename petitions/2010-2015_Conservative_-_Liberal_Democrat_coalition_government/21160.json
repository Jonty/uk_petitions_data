Is this a ploy to make the population turn on more EXPENSIVE gas and electricity to feather the government's pockets through taxes?\r\n\r\n It almost appears that this is a deliberate attempt to scupper a system that isn't yet inside the grip of governmental control. I want a full debate about this issue and the question of   \"WHY: do you want to stop cheaper power to the population when we need it the most\" to be asked.",
