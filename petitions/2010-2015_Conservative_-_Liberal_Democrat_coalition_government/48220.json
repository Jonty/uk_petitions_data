Thus summer BSWD might perhaps be 0900 - 1700 and winter BSWD might be 1000 - 1800.\r\n\t\u2022\tWork contracts etc. could be for the BSWD (e.g. 0900 - 1700) or for BSWD + 1 (e.g. 1000 - 1800) etc. and the standard School Day would be determined as starting so as to fit daylight hours, perhaps varying seasonally and regionally, so as to provide best safety for children on journeys to and from school.",
