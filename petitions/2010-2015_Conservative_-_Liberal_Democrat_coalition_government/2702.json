        "additional_details": "The fact a statue of a politically inflammatory figure still stands outside of our parliament is a disgrace. In the near east and throughout the Muslim world 'good' King Richard is remembered as a religious zealot - both a leading figure in the tragedy that was the Crusades and the man responsible for the cold blooded slaughterer of 3000 outside of the walls of Acre. This is coupled with the fact he is a French 'hero' famously spending a mere 6 months as king in the UK during which he spent his time selling off our nation\u2019s assets. He should be removed from such a fragrantly political setting as his presence only encourages the arrogant jingoism that surrounds popular history in the UK. ",
