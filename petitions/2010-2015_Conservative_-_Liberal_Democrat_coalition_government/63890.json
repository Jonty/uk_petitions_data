        "additional_details": "Wycombe District Council published the Local Plan in February 2014. In it they identify an opportunity to create a further Junction on the M40.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence our local riding stables and Livery Yard - Cobbles Farm is threatened by CPO and the possibility of demolition.\r\n\r\nTo view the proposals go to www.wycombe.gov.uk and type in 7403 into the search box. It's the M40 Junction 3a preliminary environmental assessment report.\r\n\r\nCobbles Farm is a valued local business: providing a home for many horses - a lot of whom have been re-homed at Cobbles after very difficult episodes in their lives; teaching a lot of local children to ride and to take responsibility, plus inspiring them in future career choices.\r\n\r\nPlus we believe that the preservation of the countryside is important, providing a green barrier between High Wycombe and Flackwell Heath.\r\n\r\nPlease support us by signing this petition to object to these proposals.",
