        "additional_details": "UK airlines must fall in line with the rest of Europe allowing small pets to travel with their owner in the cabin rather than as cargo, thereby cutting the high costs of air travel for cats and dogs.\r\nCurrently, there are *no* UK airlines that allow small dogs to travel in the cabin of the plane, which is something most other European countries\u00b4 airlines do allow. This is an affordable way to transport your pet compared to the astronomical cost of UK airlines and \"pet reception\" services.\r\nWHY do most other European airlines that operate in, for example, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Spain etc., allow small pets to travel inside the cabin, paid for as extra hand luggage, but UK airlines do not? Since there is no more quarantine these days and the PETS Scheme applies to the UK and Ireland as well, this is obviously not because of health and safety issues, but surely comes down only to money and greed and not the welfare of our pets.\r\nWe ask for these prices to be cut to an European level",
