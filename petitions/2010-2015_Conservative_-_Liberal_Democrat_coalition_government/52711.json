        "additional_details": "All new roads (excluding dead-end roads or roads that will have a low-speed enforced (i.e. in a housing estate)) should have cycle paths built alongside the road to encourage cycling on a more frequent basis and help to move more people away from cars. Cycle space should not be shared with buses as many parents would still worry about children using the cycle-ways. Exclusions could be made for roads that would have an obviously low cycle usage (i.e. roads with steep inclines or roads in low-populous areas). ",
