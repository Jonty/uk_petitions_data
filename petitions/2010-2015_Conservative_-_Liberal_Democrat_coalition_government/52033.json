        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister attended the Bilderberg meeting this year at the Grove Hotel in Watford, England. He met with heads of big business, heads of government, media officials and many more. He refused to take civil servants with him to this meeting.\r\n\r\nTo many who protested this event, this organisation stinks of corrupt lobbying. This is not helped by the fact that other members of the group admit that policies and plans are agreed to at the annual Bilderberg conference.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Prime Minister to make a full, thorough and honest statement to Parliament and the British people about what he discussed at Bilderberg. This includes any policies or plans he agreed to implement.\r\n\r\nIn the interests of transparency, the Prime Minister cannot attend off the record secret meetings and then not tell the British people what he did there.\r\n\r\nIt is time to give us all the facts.",
