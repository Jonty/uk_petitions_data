        "additional_details": "From the published LCP information it is stated that withholding hydration (water) is not precluded as part of the LCP yet it also states that the LCP neither hastens nor postpones life.  Clearly withholding water causes death so clearly this is a lie.  The LCP can kill.\r\n\r\nNowhere in any of the LCP protocol is the requirement that those who decide that the patient should die in this way have no personal motive (money, lifestyle, corporate gain...) and this applies to family, carers as well as the 'Multidisciplinary Team' who may be leant-on by others.\r\n\r\nNowhere is there a requirement for the patient to undergo a professional psychiatric assessment if his wishes are supporting his being placed on this \"pathway\"\r\n\r\nWe believe that this \"pathway\" is illegal and should cease until a judicial review has taken place.",
