At least they employ a few 1000 people in the UK The Government may say it is against EU rules but other governments manage to support their countries jobs why cannot the UK. It is alway the UK who keeps to the rules whilst France and Germany prosper by ignoring those they do not like or finding a reason to award to a contract to their own companies.\r\n",
