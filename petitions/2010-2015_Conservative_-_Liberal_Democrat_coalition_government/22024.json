        "additional_details": "In the light of further blunders by our home secretary and the recent surveys which showed an overwhelming support for a reduced migrant policy and the publics view the country is getting two full, the UK should introduce a point based system for all migrants whether they are european or International. Immigration is needed within this country but it needs to be regulated better than it currently is. Skilled workers will always be needed but when unemployment is so high and so many people rely on state handouts, unskilled & skilled jobs should be given to UK nationals who are unemployed or on benifits and not migrants.",
