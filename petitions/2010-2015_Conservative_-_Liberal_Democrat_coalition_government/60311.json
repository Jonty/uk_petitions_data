        "additional_details": "Canvey island has been earmarked for 1400 new homes. As i type most of canvey is suffering from flooded roads, especially badly affected is eastern esplanade where 600 of these new homes are to be located. Unsurprisingly on land owned by a multi millionaire who lives elsewhere. There is no spare road space at peak times. Doctors appointments are few and far between, and school places are minimal. The island is regularly gridlocked by simple things such as a faulty traffic light and has no permanent fire station despite having one of the biggest gas storage installations in the country. This decision has been made by councillors looking aftet their own interests, no doubt helped by the usual council lubricant of \u00a3s in pockets. Why else would a bus route be changed to serve the road where the new houses are to be built, when there has never been buses before, to the detriment of many and the benefit of few. inquiry now.",
