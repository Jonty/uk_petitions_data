        "additional_details": "That there be created for the People of the British Isles as a whole a day on which to commemorate the final reconciliation between all the people of the islands that was part of the Agreement reached in Ireland in 1998. This should occur every year on the third Friday in April as this would represent the nearest Friday in the year to the day in 1916 when the Irish in Dublin rose against the Authority of the English in Ireland.  The first of these days should occur in 2016 as 2016 will mark the 100th Anniversary of the Rising in Dublin.  For the Irish it will mark the reunification of their country and their reconciliation with Britishness. For the British of the other countries in the islands it will mark their Transition from Monarchy to Republic.\r\n\r\n",
