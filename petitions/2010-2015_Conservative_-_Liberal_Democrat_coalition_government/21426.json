For the deaf-blind it starts to get a little more tricky.\r\n\r\nE-book readers and e-nooks are classed as a luxury for those with good vision and rightly so, the person with good vision has the choice of how to read a certain piece of literature however to the deaf-blind and visually impaired e-books are one of the most fantastic inventions and should not be classed as a luxury - they are an essential part of everyday living as it is not just books that can be purchased but also newspapers and magazines.\r\n\r\nThese should be zero rated for VAT for these people.",
