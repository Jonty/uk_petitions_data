New pensioners from the same date will have the same personal allowance they had the week before. Get over it!\r\n\r\nMedia distortion of the budget measures on allowances for over-65's must be counterbalanced: there is only so much money to go round. I am sick of pensioners being interviewed on the golf course, complaining of having had \u00a380 taken from them and how they are now desperate (about where their next membership fee is coming from, presumably)!",
