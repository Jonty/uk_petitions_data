        "additional_details": "The OTTER is quickly spreading across the country and as they travel, they are killing coarse fish. many of these are large carp costing thousands of pounds, that many anglers look forward to having the chance to catch. Many fisheries are suffering huge losses due to the Otter. After killing the fish,they eat the area around the organs then leave the rest of the fish. Then move on to the next fish.Anglers pay yearly to be allowed to fish to the E.A. as well as putting a lot of money into the economy.  We want the Government to address this problem and allow fisheries to cull Otters",
