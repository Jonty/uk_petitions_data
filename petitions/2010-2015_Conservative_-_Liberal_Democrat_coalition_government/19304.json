        "additional_details": "We the undersigned would like to ask The Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP (The Secretary of State for Transport) to support the people of Market Drayton, Shropshire, in reinstating our rail service, axed by Dr Beeching in the 1960s. We would like to ask the commons to work along side our own committee so it is easier for us to generate the income needed to rebuild our station and part of the line. We would like to ask for a meeting with The Secretary of State for Transport and also our MP, to discuss the viability and timescale for us to complete this immense project and the possibility of government funding which we may be granted.",
