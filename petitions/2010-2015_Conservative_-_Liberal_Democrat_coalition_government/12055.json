        "additional_details": "Fees for University Students should be on a tier basis for the degrees that the student chooses. If a student chooses Teaching, business, languages, sciences and the like fees should be on a reduced basis say \u00a36,000 first year and depending on results reduced over the period of the course. If a student chooses Media Studies, Sport Studies, music and the like then that student should pay full fees. The latter group is not of benefit to the country as a whole and can be luxury/easily attained degrees. A student with a teaching degree will benefit the country and so deserves less fees. A student with Media Studies will look to join the private sector in the TV/Radio industry with no benefit to the country as a whole. Fees should be higher for such students and stay high throughout their tenure at University.",
