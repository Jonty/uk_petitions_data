Ion exchange resin is prescribed for patients with high potassium levels in there blood to be taken orally. As per the study by Department of Paediatrics, St. Radboud University Hospital, Nijmegen, The Netherlands undertaken in 1993, suggesting there is a benefit in pre-treating Milk, Apple Juice and Orange Juice with potassium to calcium ion exchange resin (potassium ions replaced by calcium ions).  Ion exchange resins are widely used by food manufacturers and in the home in water softeners and jug water filters, in the latter calcium ion's are replaced by sodium ions.\r\nRequest Department of health :-\r\na) Validate study undertaken by University Hospital Nijmegen and publish report.\r\nb) Support initiative to produce ion exchange beads for mineral removal from liquid foods ",
