        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call upon the British Government to abrogate all international agreements whereby a part of British Court continues its role as the highest court of appeal for Brunei.\r\n\r\nThe recent developments in Brunei where the Sultan is introducing a harsh Islamic judicial code  has caused protests world-wide.\r\n\r\nLittle known by the general public, the highest Court of Brunei court is part of the UK judiciary and sits in London. Originating our Imperial past, the jurisdiction of the  the Privy Council to hear appeals from Brunei has been continuous and are now heard in the name of the Sultan.\r\n\r\nThe death penalty is inappropriate in all circumstances. A sentence of death for being gay or for adultery is disproportionate in the ultimate.\r\n",
