        "additional_details": "There is no duty on the Environment Agency to maintain or improve the conveyance capacity of designated main rivers that are their responsibility. Maintenance budgets have been cut and the development process accelerates.  Global warming and climate change is the subject of current debate. We have no control over precipitation in terms of timing, quantity or geographical distribution but we do have the option to maintain and/or improve the land drainage infrastructure in order to reduce the probability of flooding.  I believe that the drainage infrastructure (and in particular main rivers) has been neglected thus exacerbating flooding.  We should establish a Royal Commission on Land Drainage (last one was in 1927) to take evidence and determine whether the capability of existing catchment drainage systems meets both current and future needs.\r\n.\r\n\r\n",
