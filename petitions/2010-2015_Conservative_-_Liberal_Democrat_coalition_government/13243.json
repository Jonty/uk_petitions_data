        "additional_details": "When will 'society' accept that the main reason for our youth being out of control is the lack of discipline in the home, in school and on the streets? Allow parents to discipline their children, schoolteachers to punish those behaving badly and police officers to detain those who are behaving in an unacceptable manner. When these things are reinstated our children will begin ro respect us once more and realise there are consequences for their behaviour and that they do no control society. Give control back to 'the grown ups'!",
