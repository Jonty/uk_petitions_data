This is despite the fact that many people driving vehicles use bicycles on the road. The suggestion here is to include a session of using a cycle on public roads as part of the standard driving lesson to give potential drivers an appreciation of the experience from the cyclists viewpoint, and the consideration required for vulnerable road users when driving a vehicle.",
