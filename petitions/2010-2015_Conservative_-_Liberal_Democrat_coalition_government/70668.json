        "additional_details": "Due to the pictures circulating online questioning Prince Harry's parentage and in particular to the comparisons of his likeness to James Hewitt It should be noted that historical affairs were not able to be proved, as such and in light of modern DNA members of the Royal family may now be proven with DNA testing to not be in fact Royal lineage. My petition is that DNA testing should be carried out to prove whether Prince Harry is in fact Royal or whether he was born as a result of an affair with a non Royal and that would be a removal of his Royal title",
