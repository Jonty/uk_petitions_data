        "additional_details": "Include 3rd party car insurance within the cost of car tax.\r\n\r\nCar insurance is becoming impossibly expensive for some and there is also an increasingly (large) number of people that choose to drive without car insurance.\r\n\r\nThis initiative would mean that all citizens with a taxed vehicle are already insured (third-party) in case they have an accident.  It would also mean that the Police know instantly whether a car is both taxed AND insured (without relying on third-party databases).\r\n\r\nFinally, it should not affect the commercial activities of the big insurance companies as fire, theft and fully comprehensive insurance would still be handled by them independently and they could / would also underwrite the government's car tax scheme.\r\n\r\nOf course car tax would be much more expensive in this model, but ALL citizens require third-party insurance anyway so it would offset this by massively reducing their insurance costs.",
