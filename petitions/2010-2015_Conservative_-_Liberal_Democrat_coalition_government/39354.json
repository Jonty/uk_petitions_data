        "additional_details": "The undersigned wish to change the taking of Year Six SATs Papers to Year 6 CATs Papers. This has been taken up due to the fact that:\r\n\r\n          - CATs are a very good way to see which pupils have more potential in different areas and test methods of learning.\r\n\r\n          - SATs, if the pupil has under achieved in the tests, can seriously undermine their self-confidence even though they may have been able to achieve higher grades through different test methods in CATs.",
