Scratch cards appeal to children with games such as Connect 4 and naughts and crosses. It's often difficult to tell which teenagers are 16 as they can appear older than their age and visa versa, risking an under age sale. Despite Challege 21 and Challege 25, it is often difficult to apply this for an product which has an age restriction of only 16. Many people get offended often thinking this policy is only for alcohol, cigarettes and other 18 rated products. The age for tobacco was raised from 16 to 18, let's make it the same for Lottery inline with the rest of gambling and make retailers lives easier in applying Think 21 / 25",
