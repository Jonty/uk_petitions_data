By teaching a sugar coated view of pregnancy many women and couples may decide to put off childbirth and find in later life that it is a much harder act than had initially been expected.\r\n\r\nWe have a duty to reach our young people the facts of life - be they miraculous or devastating - and the ignorance and stigma of such a common issue when discussing human reproduction should not be allowed to continue.
