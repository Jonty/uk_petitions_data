        "additional_details": "The Continuous Insurance Enforcement scheme should be abolished. We all want uninsured drivers off our roads, however, this scheme does little to deter uninsured drivers whilst at the same time inconveniencing the genuinely law abiding vehicle owners. The people who chose to drive uninsured vehicles will simply SORN their vehicles continue to do so. The scheme is uneccessary as the ANPR cameras will pick up uninsured vehicles being driven on our roads. The key word in the above sentance is DRIVEN. How can it be an offence for something that an individual COULD or MIGHT do? Just because I have a taxed but uninsured vehicle in my possession, doesn't mean that I WILL drive it on the road. The offence should be DRIVING an uninsured vehicle on the road, not owning one.",
