        "additional_details": "Many of the trade unions appear to deal with problems in a manner which today seems out dated and a thing of the past. Many of the strikes called by unions in recent years have been unpopular with the public. Even the trade union members are split in the issues of striking. Union officials still force through a strike. 'Strike' appears to be the only word in their vocabulary.\r\n\r\nWe propose that Unions are still valid however their powers should be reduced. For every member of a union who is eligible to vote for a strike, their should be the same number of ordinary members of the public picked at random who would also be given the right to vote for or against strike action. This would give a balanced vote. Not biased towards the idea of 'what can I get out of it as a member of the union', but biased towards 'is it a valid strike?'\r\n",
