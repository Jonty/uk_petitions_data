Similarly, creating more \u201caffordable\u201d (cheap and nasty) housing is more stupid, self-defeating short-termism from politicians who lack the genuine political will to deal with the over-population crisis at its very roots so cynically seek to merely manage the symptoms instead by giving a \u201cpresumption\u201d in favour of unnecessary development.\r\n",
