Head Lice are just as infectious and cause just as much distress to our children. This can be done discreetly, nobody has to know.\r\n\r\nIt is not a violation of anybody's human rights, if anything it would protect the children of us who are diligent and care, and subsequently spending \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3s to treat our children to no avail!",
