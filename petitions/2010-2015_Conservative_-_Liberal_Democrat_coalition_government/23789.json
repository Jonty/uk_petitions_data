        "additional_details": "David Cameron and his Government have consistently ignored the wishes of the people, whether by e-petitions or direct request. Mr Cameron seems to have forgotten it was us the general electorate that put him in power. We put him in power to run the country on our behalf and not for the benefit of those in Brussels. He has continued to ignore the will of the British people. Because of this a motion of no confidence in him and his Government must be put forward.",
