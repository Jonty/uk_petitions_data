        "additional_details": "The youth of today see events such as war, protest and famine everyday on the news. However they do not understand what they are seeing so they simply ignore it.\r\n\r\nBy 'Current Affairs lessons' I mean lessons in which the current political, social and economic issues are discussed and explained (such events and issues as 9/11 and Libya/Gaddafi). The aim of these lessons would be to give a precise and to the point overview of important worldwide matters. The lessons would include where the event/issue is taking place, who it involves, why it has happened and what will/could happen because of it (what does it mean for the world?).\r\n\r\nI think we need to make these 'Current Affairs' lessons mandatory for all UK high schools. These should take place every week for at least one timetabled period (usually an hour or 50 minutes in most UK schools) for all age groups (years 7 to 11).\r\n\r\nKeep the UK smart.",
