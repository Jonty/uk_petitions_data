In many ways we are already restricted by many laws that are put there to guide us but by not letting us be heard in the house of commons deters us from achieving rational things that the youth of today are concerned passionate about.\r\nI propose a Youth Governmental. This allows youth reps to go to their local communities to find out what teenagers want changed the most as in all it will be them living in the future world.\r\nTo be a YGR (Youth Governmental Representative) will allow young people to empower themselves in a positive way, is that not what this nation wants?\r\nTo be able to change the YGR's would be able to meet, discuss matters from other communities and possibly be able to voice the opinion of their communities in Parliment.
