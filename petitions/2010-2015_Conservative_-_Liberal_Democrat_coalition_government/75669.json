        "additional_details": "I have been astounded by the continual lack of efficiency within HM Revenue and Customs. Some examples are:\r\nsending demand letters for dissolved companies;\r\nsending multiple letters on the same day which have the same information;\r\nmaking it difficult for clients to obtain refunds; and\r\nthat despite being one organisation it seems there is no communication between departments.\r\n\r\nAnd there's are a small number of the issues I deal with daily.\r\n\r\nHM Revenue and Customs expect all individuals and businesses to keep their affairs in order and can issue penalties for not keeping proper records, but it seems they do not have to comply themselves.\r\n\r\nIf businesses acted in the same way they would soon go out of business due to over spending and inefficiencies.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to take action by looking at the systems, processes and procedures within the organisation make the necessary changes to make them more efficient.",
