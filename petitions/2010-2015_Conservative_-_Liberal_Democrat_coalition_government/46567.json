        "additional_details": "I think that First-Aid should be put onto the National Curriculum because it is vital that student's from an early age know the necessary basic skills on how to prevent incident's and accedent's and to give basic treatment to someone who has already been involved in an accedent or incident. As well as this First Aid will also give these student's a better insight into different illnesses and how to deal with them such as Asthma, High Blood Pressure, Epilepsy and many more. If First Aid is taught in High School's and college's I also think that as well as all the above that it would also give them a higher chance of employment. I think this because since mine and my friend's interview numbers have significantly risen since we compleated our First Aid Courses.",
