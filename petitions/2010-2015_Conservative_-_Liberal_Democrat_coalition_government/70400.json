        "additional_details": "With breakthroughs in alternative energy technologies energy companies should have to start investing in alternative energy. It should be made mandatory for energy companies to invest a minimum value into these energies. Especially with CO2 emissions reaching alarmingly high levels. Recent studies show that our atmosphere has reached the highest concentration of CO2 ever recorded. One of the only real ways of stopping this is by decreasing our fossil fuel consumption by changing our fuel sources to more sustainable ones.",
