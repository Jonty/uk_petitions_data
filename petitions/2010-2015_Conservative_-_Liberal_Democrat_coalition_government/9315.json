During the course of the evening the wanton destruction of property occurred and perpetrators fled from the police.  There is anecdotal evidence of many incidents of violent disorder committed by members of this club.  The police force should investigate all incidence of such riotous disorder and press charges where applicable, regardless of the perpetrators' attempts to cover the costs of their damage.",
