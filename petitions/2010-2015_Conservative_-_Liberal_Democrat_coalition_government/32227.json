        "additional_details": "BMW Motorcycles are a special case, virtually all BMW motorcycles take up as much space as a car on the roads. Every single BMW motorcycle rider I have had the unfortunate luck to be riding behind greedily takes up the filtering space between cars without being able to fit through. If this travesty to the london biking community was not enough, they also take up 3 spaces in any bike parking zone. These zones are in desperately short supply and should be prioritised for people who are more considerate towards their fellow road users.  BMW Motorcycles are also so heavy that they do as much damage to the roads as a car and therefore should be forced to pay the higher rate of road tax and full congestion charge fee. (Exceptions can be made for newer sportier BMW models that are much more like normal motorbikes).",
