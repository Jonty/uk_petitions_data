        "additional_details": "The Government should bring in legislation that would be used to cap the rents that private Landlords charge their residential tenants, to more reasonable levels closer to the rent that Local Authorities and Housing Associations charge. This would allow people to save money, enabling them to buy a house. Private rents are spiraling out of control. Many people find it very hard to meet the rent charges, and the shortfall is caught by the Housing Benefit system, costing the country a huge amount of money, and making private Landlords rich at the expense of the Tax-Payer.",
