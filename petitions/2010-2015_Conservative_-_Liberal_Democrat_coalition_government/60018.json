There are approximately 40000 Oromo prisoners who have been suffering in Ethiopian custody without any trial. Most of the prisoners are Farmers, Students, Teachers and Other professionals.\r\n\r\nI urge anyone who believe in Democracy and Justice to support the Oromo struggle for Freedom.\r\n\r\nI understand that the UK donates Millons of pounds each year to Ethiopia. I urge the UK government to stop supporting the brutal Ethiopian regime who has been commiting countless atrocities in Oromia. ",
