        "additional_details": "Laser treatments used to be regulated under the Care Quality Commission since 1991.  Government decided to deregulate them. As a result we are now seeing a very sad surge in patients coming to us for help having been either badly burned, scarred, disfigured, traumatised or just plain upset by unprofessional, untrained personnel being allowed loose on their skin with a Class IV laser which in the wrong hands is dangerous. This is wrong.  We cannot allow it continue as someone will be blinded or disfigured before it is too late.  Laser Safety is critical -  All such procedures should be regulated again.  Would we abolish driving licences and allow anyone drive?  Would we allow an untrained, unregulated person perform dentistry?!  Why is our SKIN less important?  The public need protection from these cavalier unprofessional outfits before it is too late. We want CQC Registration and Regulation enforced for ALL CLASS IV laser clinics. ",
