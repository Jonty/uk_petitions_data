        "action": "Abolish homeopathy, acupuncture and other non-evidence-based treatment in the NHS",
        "additional_details": "Homeopathy is a school of thought which advocates the use of highly diluted substances as treatment. As a department, \u00a34 million is spent a year on running costs and another \u00a340 million on treatments. There have been repeated scientific trials to determine the efficacy of homeopathy, with a systematic review published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology in 2002 finding that \"there is no condition for which homeopathy is convincingly effective\". In such an economically difficult time as this, it is proposed that the offering of homeopathic treatment through the NHS must end in order to save money and reduce the risk of ineffective treatment being offered to patients, and that any doctors currently practising homeopathy or other non-evidence-based treatments be regulated so that they do not put the health of their patients at risk by further encouraging the use of this ineffective medicine.",
