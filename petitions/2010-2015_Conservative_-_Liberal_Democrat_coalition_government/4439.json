        "additional_details": "For some reason sentencing in this country has become very soft. Frankly nowadays it is just not a deterrent to many in our society. Lack of prison space should not be a factor in how many and how long we send people to jail for. Life should be life and other sentences should reflect the pain, anxiety and anguish the crime causes the victim. Rehabilitation is important but so is punishment- if you make someone suffer surely you should too.",
