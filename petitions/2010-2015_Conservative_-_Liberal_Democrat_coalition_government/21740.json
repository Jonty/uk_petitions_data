        "additional_details": "I believe that all fireworks should not be allowed to be sold to the publc, as I fear that in the wrong hands, the fireworks could be used as dangerous weapons.  Also the fireworks can affect animals in the vicinity of the area where the fireworks are set off, and would cause distress.  They may also cause further pressure on the fire service - especially if they are set off in bad weather.  The fireworks in my view should only be used in a public park, and only if the local authourity advertises the display.",
