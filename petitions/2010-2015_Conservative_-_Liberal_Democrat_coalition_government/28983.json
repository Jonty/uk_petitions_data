You ask too  many  taxes , too many bills for very little money and invisible reasons!\r\nThe salaries have gone way too low to be able to pay all that you demand, its quite impossible.. Life outside has risen. For example, food, gas and electric - these are necesitties its cruel and discasting that we must pay so much money for gas and still not enouph .. Its possible to pay all the bills and taxes but then you would remain with a few quid for the rest of the month, you cant leave like that! in order to survive in these high demanding bills and taxes you either raise our salaries or lower the taxes. Please come to some senses we are hating our lives at the moment.",
