Different hospitals have different uniforms for different grades.\r\nAs with the police and firefighters, the public have the right to know who they are speaking to. A Health Care Assistant in one hospital may have the same uniform as a Nurse Practitioner in another. Make uniforms \"UNIFORM\" and have an NHS standard uniform throughout the country for all grades, the same as Police, Army, And Fire Service. Surely this is common sense? And easier to understand.",
