        "additional_details": "Currently in Haverhill the street lights are turned off at midnight every night of the week, until 5am. I think this is dangerous and unnecessary. If saving energy is so important I suggest turning every other street light off so that people can still see where they are walking. I recently had an evening out in Haverhill and walked home, it was a very frightening experience. I couldnt see where I was placing my feet, whether I was about to step on anything or was near a curb. It is only a matter of time before something happens to someone because they cannot see where they are walking. Also it is extremely dangerous for anyone on their own. If you agree with my views, please sign below to get our lights turned back on.",
