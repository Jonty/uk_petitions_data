Currently the law allows abusers to live next door to their victim once they have served their sentence.\r\nAnyone who is a victim of sexual abuse, especially children, are victims for life, this will never leave them. Yet, as soon as the offender has served their sentence, they can live next door.\r\nThis will be a constant reminder of the pain caused and the victim could never move on.\r\nLet's get this changed, give the human rights back to victims!
