        "additional_details": "Recently there has been a story in the press about punishing parents for their children's attendance and behaviour.  It would be better to incentivise parents by giving tax breaks to parents whose children have a good attendance record and make progress in-line with expectations.  Expectations could be agreed between the school and parents on an annual basis and tracked via the school reporting mechanism.  This removes any problems with non-payment of fines and should pay for itself with a more educated work force in the future.",
