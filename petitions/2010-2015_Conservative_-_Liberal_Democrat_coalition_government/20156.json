        "additional_details": "This is a petition to abandon our current strategic nuclear weapons strategy and switch to a smaller far cheaper and far more flexible tactical scale deterrent. (to be developed through research or purchase from the USA or elsewhere)\r\nThe old Strategic approach is based on ideas that have simply become obsolete. - Huge scale attack intended to completely destroy massive military (nuclear) defences and to inflict maximum civilian casualties in a strategy of total war dating back to the early 20th century.  For various obsolete technical reasons these weapons are also extremely expensive.\r\nA small tactical type deterrent can be used by any service, be man portable, be based on aircraft or small missiles or UAV\u2018s, or even deployable on small orbital platforms.  The benefits include an approximate 90% reduction in costs and a new safer, post cold war era nuclear deterrent, plus this sets a precedent for other nuclear powers doing the same thing making for a far safer future world.",
