        "action": "London taxis - remove free market restrictions now.",
        "additional_details": "London is the only major taxi licensing authority that adopts a regulation stating that licenced taxis have a turning circle of 8m. Only the LTI TX4 and a converted Mercedes Vito comply. With LTI in administration, this means there is only one new vehicle available to London drivers. Every other major city's licensing authority has agreed that a reduced turning circle has no safety benefit and removed the regulation from their conditions of fitness. London continues to persist with this outdated regulation & London drivers are forced to purchase a single new model for no logical reason.\r\nI petition that regulation 181 of the London Condition of Fitness be removed, allowing access to vehicles that fully comply with all other aspect of the CoF. This will result in freedom of choice for all drivers, as enjoyed by the licensed taxi operators in other UK authority areas.\r\nPlease sign this petition if you want freedom of choice for London.\r\nThanks for your support.",
