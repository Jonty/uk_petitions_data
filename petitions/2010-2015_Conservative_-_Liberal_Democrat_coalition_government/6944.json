        "additional_details": "At present, people who suffer miscarriages of justice and have convictions quashed, do not necessarily receive any compensation for time spent in prison. If convictions are quashed as 'unsafe', that means they should not have been convicted in the first place, and therefore are NOT GUILTY. Anyone suffering the torment of being imprisoned unfairly, often for many years, should always receive FULL compensation, with no excuses for not paying, and no deductions for board and lodgings as is proposed - prisoners already pay for their imprisonment but this is kept from public knowlege - prisoners are paid as little as 75p per shift for working inside prisons, which is nothing less than politician labour! They then have to pay for everything they need out of this paltry sum! Let them keep ALL compensation awarded with NO deductions.",
