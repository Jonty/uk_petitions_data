Inflation and increased pension contributions have caused a real time decrease in salaries. In essence, the British taxpayer would have to pay for this by not being paid adequately in the first place. This can be avoided by Mr Osborne giving us a pay increase that would offset the \"gains in the British economy\" so as to  reduce the contributions to the EU. ",
