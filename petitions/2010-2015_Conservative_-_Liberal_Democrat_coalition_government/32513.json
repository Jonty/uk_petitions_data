        "additional_details": "Distorted evidence is put before practical common sense to appease climate change lobbyists. Wind farms run at very low levels of energy efficiency and for every unsightly wind farm there has to be conventional power generation for the days when there is no wind or the winds are too strong. We are duplicating energy production and using vast resources to justify this situation.\r\nWind farms are inefficient and we will be blighted with unaffordable energy prices. Get rid of these idiotic policies and apply common sense. We need affordable energy and consistent energy production.",
