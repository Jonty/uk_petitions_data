Television can provide a valuable resource for students for research as well as being vital for those studying towards media, broadcasting and journalism degrees.\r\n\r\nTherefore TV licences should be free (or offered at a severely reduced rate) to under and post graduates who are studying at university away from home and are not covered by their parent's TV licence.",
