        "action": "Stage Inquiry Into Increased Use of Food Banks",
        "additional_details": "We believe that the growing food poverty crisis in Britain needs to be addressed. Ministers from a cross party committee have published a report which highlights that despite the increased reliance on food banks, no clear or robust data has been collected, or analysis into the root cause of why this is happening. We are of the opinion that until this situation has been investigated, the government and other political parties cannot offer adequate solutions to alleviate the problem. We would like ministers to respond to the Food Security report and our petition with a dedication to an inquiry within the first four months of the next term of government.",
