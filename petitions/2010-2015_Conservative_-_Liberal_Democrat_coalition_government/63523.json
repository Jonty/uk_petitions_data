        "additional_details": "The fees charged by Solicitors for Divorce work are unbelievable. They charge \u00a3130 per hour for work, \u00a330 per letter and \u00a324 per email. A 30 minute hearing at Court works out around \u00a33000.\r\n\r\nSolicitors practices and fees should be investigated and the basis of the advice and the fees explained. These solicitors are not experts and a layman can do the same forms and find the same advice from the web.\r\nThe present divorce laws are a licence for solicitors to make money out of ordinary working people. The self regulating system of the Law Society is a closed shop and benefits the solicitors by suppressing claims from people who have no contract with them but have to deal with them. This petition states that the UK Justice system and the fees the public have to pay needs an urgent review.\r\n",
