        "additional_details": "The amount of money a night out at the pub costs is growing all the time due to the price hike of these two items. Cheapest 10 cigarettes are \u00a33.12 and the average price of a pint is now over \u00a33, this is extortionate and will drive people to buy illegal imports of these items. Going to the pub is socialising and socialising makes people happier, which means they will have a better feeling about there life. The price hike is making people stay at home due to having to pick one or the other and the pubs are loosing out on business and we are at risk of loosing our local pubs.",
