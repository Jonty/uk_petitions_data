The public has no faith in directors and managers in the NHS.\r\n\r\nAction required:\r\n\r\nA school of hospital management needs to be established in the UK (perhaps Leeds) which establishes best international practice in hospital management.\r\n\r\nThere should be an age and experience consideration in entry into the school of hospital management.\r\n\r\nThereby the training of future hospital managers and directors means that Britain creates the best hospital management through which it moves up the developed world league table.\r\n\r\nIn time it should be a requirement that hospital managers and directors must hold a qualification from the school of hospital management to be a manager or a director in a hospital.
