        "additional_details": "UK to withdraw from the European Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)\r\n\r\nThe British fishing industry is governed by the CFP, it is overwhelmed with bureaucracy and laws that achieve nothing for conservation. After recent CFP reforms, we hoped it would become more professional, this has proven not be the case.\r\n\r\nMs Maria Damanaki now runs the CFP, neither she nor any predecessor or adviser, have ever been educated in fisheries management or conservation.\r\nThe CFP use science to asses EU fish stocks, this is done by marine biologists who have no knowledge of finding or catching the fish to be assessed, so stock assessments always show very poor stocks, on that information, the CFP set quotas very low, meanwhile our fishing boats are filling up with fish in all UK waters, because the stocks are so healthy, end result, discards.\r\n\r\nNo UK fishermen supports the CFP.\r\n\r\nPlease support the UK fishing industry and our fish stocks, against the insanity of the CFP.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",
