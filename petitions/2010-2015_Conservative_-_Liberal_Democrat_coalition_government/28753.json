        "additional_details": "Nearly all cancer patients suffer some loss of income or increased living costs as a direct result of their cancer diagnosis. Many are forced to give up work as their treatment begins. Plus, there may be increased expenses for new clothes to cope with weight loss or gain, or increased heating bills and a whole host of other reasons that are not taken into account. And some very vulnerable people are being refused DLA at a vital time when they need it most.\r\nThe system needs to be changed, and the help that is needed should be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
