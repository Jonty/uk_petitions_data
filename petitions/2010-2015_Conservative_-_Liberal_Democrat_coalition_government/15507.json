Whether such a Flag should retain the present symbolism in some way or adopt symbolism more secular in nature would be a matter for debate. The Nature of the State for which such a Flag is intended may be found in other Petitions that have been published on the Cabinet Office's Pages of the Web-Site. The Reference Numbers for these Petitions are 760, 5627 and 9721.",
