None seem to tackle the basic issue.\r\nThe word 'marriage' has always been defined as a union between a man and a woman, therefore, homosexuals and lesbians cannot truly 'marry'.\r\nNew words are being created all the time, therefore, rather than try to change the long standing meaning of the word marriage, a new word should be created that would mean a union between those of the same gender.",
