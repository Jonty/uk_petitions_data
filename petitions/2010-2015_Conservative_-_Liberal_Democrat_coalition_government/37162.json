        "additional_details": "As the sadly high % of young people are not in employment education or training (Neet). The problem seems to be; an 'inherent part of our modern advanced capitalist system', and should be recognised as such by government. With this humility, and in the recognition of the repetitive failures, by all types of governments: tough action should be taken. We need more oppurtunity for young people to develop skills, employment and this is not happening at present. Young people who are highly skilled, forward thinking are being over looked because the jobs are not there, training is unavailable through funding. I call on the Government to re-look at Youth Training and Unemployment for all those under 26 years of age, and to bring new ideas to guarantee funding for training for all young NEET people, to do courses related to gaining employment, and this should be a pot of at least \u00a31500 per NEET.",
