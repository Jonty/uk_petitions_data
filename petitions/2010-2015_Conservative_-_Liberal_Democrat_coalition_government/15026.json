With the cost of petrol increasing and the hounding of the motorist a daily matter, making full use of the current rail network and developing it as a high speed network is the way ahead.\r\nThere is considerable capacity on the existing network to be able to increase speeds to 180 mph. In many places tracks were reduced from 4 to 2 to save money. On the East Coast mainline 140 mph running has been possible in many places for some years. If the money from HS2 was used to upgrade these lines then HS2 would not be necessary. ",
