        "additional_details": "Many children born in July or August struggle throughout their academic career.  They are behind their classmates in academic and social development, impacting on their self confidence and motivation. They are less successful academically and more likely to need extra support for educational, psychological and behavioural problems.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to: (i) allow parents/carers of July/August-born children to choose when to enter their child to full time education so that these children can start Key Stage 1 when they are ready and as late as the September after their 6th birthday; (ii) allow schools to easily move struggling July/August born children down a school year.\r\n\r\nLocal authority schools admissions policies would need to change. School funding and league tables would need to be based on the number of children in a year group, not on their age.",
