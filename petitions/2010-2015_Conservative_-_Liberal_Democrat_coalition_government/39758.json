        "additional_details": "In this petition, I aim to stop hens being kept in small cages. Over 2,000,000 chickens die in their cages each year from diseases caused by improper control of faeces clearing. Hens spend 72 weeks in these small cages before they are slaughtered. They suffer from brittle bones caused by standing on the wire bottoms of the cages.\r\n I dont think it's very fair that these hens are kept in small cages while other hens are outside and have all the space they need. All hens should be treated like this ! The governemt arrest people for animal abuse and this is what animal abuse is. I dont know why the government is allowing this. You wouldn't leave a dog in a tiny cage where it can't move, so hens shouldnt be treated like this either. Some people don't realise where their eggs are coming from and they need to. Please help me in changing the government's opinion on this issue. I need 100,000 signatures. Thanks.",
