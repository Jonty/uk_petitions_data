However, all other TV channels are at least partly funded through advertising and it only seems logical and fair in times of austerity that the BBC should do the same.\r\n\r\nThe cost of running the channel should come from businesses and advertising rather than the tax payer\u2019s pocket.\r\n\r\nNot every TV license holder watches the BBC and therefore should not have to pay for a service they do not wish to use.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that everyone has access to a valuable channel without having to pay for the privilege.\r\n",
