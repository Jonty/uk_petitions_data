        "additional_details": "This busy motorway junction suffers from lots of congestion on a daily basis and during peak hours it can take upto 30 mins to navigate this small area. The main reason is the roundabout was not built to cope with the ever growing demand of traffic and causes more bottlenecks due to having traffic lights which are out of sync.\r\nA good proposal would be for any traffic heading eastbound to the junction to turn onto the m60 towards middleton a two lane link bridge should be built which would go over the top of this junction, over the m62 and down onto the m60 to allow traffic to flow and continue on.\r\nThis would then reduce congestion for the junction at preswitch which is heavily congested on a daily basis also as if you are entering the motorway eastbound there you can be queueing upto 30 minutes on the slip road to get onto the main motorway as in theory you can have upto 6 lanes of traffic trying to get into 2 lanes.",
