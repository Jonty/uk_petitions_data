        "additional_details": "The RSPCA unlike the Dogs Trust DO put healthy animals down. They decide that animals are not rehome-able if they are sick, injured or have behavioural problems and they are then ethanised due to lack of space. There are no measures in place for their procedures, these behavioural problems or injuries could be very mild.\r\n\r\nInstead of using the funds people donate to kill animals the RSPCA could utilise these funds better to look after the animals over a longer period of time. It costs them more to kill an animal than it does to feed it.  How can one organisation measure what any one person is looking for when going to adopt an animal?!\r\n\r\nIt only takes 100,000 signatures to start a debate in parliament which could help stop unjust euthanasia of innocent animals who have no rights and cannot speak for themselves. Please take a few minutes and sign this petition, every signature counts.\r\n",
