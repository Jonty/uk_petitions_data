        "additional_details": "Care workers in the community should have more support as they're very vulnerable and usually work for very low pay. Too often the media only portrays only bad care and doesn't tell about the thousands of good care workers who do excellent care every day. They work unsocial hours for no extra pay and often have to put up with abuse from their clients. Most are on zero hours contracts.",
