        "additional_details": "Thousands of students, many from deprived backgrounds, discovered on results day that the C grade they had hoped for had not happened.\r\n\r\nHowever it was NO FAULT OF THEIRS but a HUGELY UNFAIR change in how marks were awarded.\r\n\r\nIn January of this year, students entering for their GCSE early could have scored a whole 9 marks more than those entering in June!  This penalises those students fighting on the C/D borderline in particular who entered in June, who are pushing to improve themselves, and trying to get into colleges across the country.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be right that a child's future is determined not on their performance, but on when they sat their exam.\r\n\r\nWe need fairness, or what is the point in exams as a performance indicator at all?  We need equality between January and June entrants as a matter of urgency.",
