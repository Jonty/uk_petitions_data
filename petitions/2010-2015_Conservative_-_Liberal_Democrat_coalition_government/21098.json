        "additional_details": "This is to try and get a ban on the general sale of fireworks to the public. They cause untold stress to animals and people and a lot of damage and injury. We have to put up with fireworks now from early October to into the New Year. Old people are scared stiff, many who have served in the war and the bangs take them back to the battle field all over again. People who think it's fun to attatch fireworks to animals, killing and maming them. Thousands of animals are stressed to the point of having to be sedated due to fireworks. If they were kept to public display purpose only, all of the above could be eliminated.",
