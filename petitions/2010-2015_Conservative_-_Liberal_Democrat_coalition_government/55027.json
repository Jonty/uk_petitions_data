        "additional_details": "The Isle of Wight is slowly being held to ransom by the two ferry operators Red Funnel and Wightlink. With services being cut, and prices continuing to rise, very soon tourists will stop coming to the Island. This will impact on the Islands economy, and even stop business expansion. Therefore, it is vital that other transport options are considered. An airport will also create jobs for Islanders.",
