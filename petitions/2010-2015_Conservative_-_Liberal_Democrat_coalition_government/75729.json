        "additional_details": "Many TV channels have restricted viewing times for anyone who can only access Freeview in SD. Many channels can be viewed in HD 24 hours but for only three to four hours in SD.\r\n\r\nOthers only have a HD channel meaning that anyone who does not have HD services, weather it's freeview, sky or cable, can not view these channels.\r\n\r\nIf a channel is going to be made available on any service they should be available for the full available broadcast time. If it is available 24/7 in HD it should also be made available for the same time in SD.\r\n\r\nAlso if a channel is available in HD it should also be available in standard so to be available to everyone equally and without discrimination.",
