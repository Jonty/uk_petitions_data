        "additional_details": "\r\n\r\nIt has been observed by nursery staff and parents that the existing speed limit on Gwendolen Avenue of 20mph is hardly ever observed by speeding drivers and poses a risk to families and staff who need to cross the road at drop-off and collection times.\r\nThere has been an instance where a parent was placing their child in the car when a speeding vehicle went past, hitting and damaging the open door.\r\nWe would like speed bumps to be introduced outside the nursery as a more effective traffic calming measure, which will promote safety for everyone on Gwendolen Avenue and at the nursery.\r\n",
