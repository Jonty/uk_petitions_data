        "additional_details": "Hillside primary school opened in 1906, and served numerous generations of people living in Blaenavon. The building is also situated within a World Heritage Site and could be adapted for new uses such as flats. Torfaen council wants to demolish this building to build yet more houses and Melin homes wants to build 52 of them. There is more than enough empty land in Blaenavon for houses. Let's stop Torfaen council destroying yet another historical building like they have done many times over the years. ",
