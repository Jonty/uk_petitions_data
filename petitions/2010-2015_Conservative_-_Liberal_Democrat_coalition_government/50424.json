It is argued that swearing, drinking and sexual activity damage younger viewers, but | would argue that promoting war to younger viewers in many ways is far worse.It would be unreasonable to ask for army adverts to be removed off tv, but having them shown at a later time puts younger viewers in less of a vulnerable situation.
