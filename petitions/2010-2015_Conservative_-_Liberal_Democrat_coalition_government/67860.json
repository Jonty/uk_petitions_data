        "additional_details": "We have been informed that Bury Council (in Greater Manchester) are planning to reduce non-recyclable waste collection to every third week due to a reduction in funding from central government.  Per capita, Bury receives far less funding than neighbouring councils.\r\n\r\nResidents are deeply concerned as we are generally recycling to the best of our abilities now and fortnightly collection is already causing problems of maggots, mice and other pests.  We are concerned that if this situation continues, the entire borough will become a public health hazard.  Elderly residents are in tears over this proposal and there has been a great deal of objection, but councillors are insistent that there is not going to be the money for it anymore.\r\n\r\nWe call on central government to increase funding so that our bins can continue to be collected on a reasonable schedule.",
