We propose that the Proof Of God campaign which is non-profit & free to view at www.ProofOfGod.co.uk be shown to inmates wanting to watch it under their chaplains supervision. There is no cost to the Government to do this and could save millions of pounds of tax payers money in re-offending prevention.",
