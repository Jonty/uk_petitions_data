        "additional_details": "Move the Late Spring Bank Holiday to either the first or second Monday in June, to be know as the June Bank Holiday.\r\n\r\nBy placing this holiday permenantly in June it gives a breathing space between it and the May Day holiday.\r\n\r\nIt should also fall on the week end of the Queen's Official Birthday and the Trooping of the Colours ceremony at Horseguards Parade. It's been done twice already recently to celebrate the Queen's Golden and Diamond Jubilee.\r\n\r\nBetter weather should bring out the crowds more in June than unpredictable May,\r\n\r\nIt could develop into a celebration of the Queen's many years of service and other things British, but I feel the name of the Bank Holiday should be left fairly neutral",
