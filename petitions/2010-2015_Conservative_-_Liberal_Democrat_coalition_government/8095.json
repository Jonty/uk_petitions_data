        "additional_details": "As we can clearly see, our youth are disaffected, unruly, yobbish and in dire need of discipline. They have no concept of their place in the wider world. Plus at the same time cuts are forcing our proud armed forces into reduced numbers. Well, quite simply, why not kill two birds with one stone and bring back National Service? With it we can return a sense of pride and purpose to our lost and disgruntled youth, and at the same time, provide a cost efficient resource for our armed forces in the future. Let's be pro-active and do something positive about our situation!",
