There has been no response as to the impact on the arts (such as \"Seduced, sex from antiquity to now\" in The Barbican 2009 which had works from the likes of Mapelthorpe in its exhibition) and no comment that the large body of evidence that the REA studied actually supports the role of pornography in our society, but that question was not asked of it.\r\n\r\nThe law is not fit to be on our books as its purpose was not inteligently defined from the outset and the arguments behind it have been from emotional standpoints that did not provide solid facts to back up their claims. even the REA complained about the lack of time it had to generate its report.",
