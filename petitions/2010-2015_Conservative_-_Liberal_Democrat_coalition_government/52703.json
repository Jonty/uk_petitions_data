        "additional_details": "No political party has a divine right to exist and new parties and movements can and should be allowed to emerge. We do not want a rotten market in political parties, so any new method of funding should allow for change.\r\nSo we the undersigned say that parties should be funded by:\r\n- A maximum of \u00a33 per uk resident citizen per year by nomination by that citizen.\r\n- Concealed payments and indirect support (Free or subsidized resources or services) will be a specific criminal offence\r\n- Any increase in this rates should be tied to the inflation rate used for tax allowances and pensions.\r\nThis proposed system leaves plenty of available cash for political parties that can truly connect with voters, and limit the funding for a disconnected political elite who are gradually eroding our political system with apathy.\r\n---please share this vote and get as much support as possible---",
