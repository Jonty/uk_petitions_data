        "additional_details": "Petro-chemicals, and other harmful synthetic compounds are being used in cosmetics and other everyday products.\r\n\r\nPerfumes use highly volatile toxic chemicals that can affect other people apart from those who wear them.  I have termed this \u2018passive toxicity\u2019, Smoking was banned for that reason. Many chemicals used in perfumes can enter other people\u2019s blood streams via the nose and mouth.\r\n\r\nThey are causing allergic reactions and may have long-term, serious health implications for humans.\r\n\r\nThe industry is self-regulated = unregulated.\r\n\r\nExtensive research should be carried out with each individual chemical.\r\n\r\nOnly products that have been independently tested and certified safe for human and environmental use should be used.\r\n\r\nCertified synthetic chemicals should be heavily taxed to discourage their use in favour of natural alternatives.",
