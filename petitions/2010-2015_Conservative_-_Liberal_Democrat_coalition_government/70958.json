True, some may be unable to work to due the nature of their disability, but the vast majority are able to contribute in an efficient and positive manner - but yet Freud would have them earning not even half the minimum wage just because they look or sound different.\r\n\r\nThis is disgusting - we are meant to look up to our politicians as bastions of society, yet politicians like Freud leave us unable to do so.\r\n\r\nPleas sign this and send a message to Cameron that Freud needs to be sacked.",
