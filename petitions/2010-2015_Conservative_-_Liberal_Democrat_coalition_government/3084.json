        "additional_details": "The decision to remove child benefit to higher rate tax payers is grossly unfair. The current proposal will result in cases where a family with one working parent earning \u00a346000 will receive no Child Benefit whereas another with two working parents each earning \u00a340000 will continue to receive Child Benefit. This is not right.",
