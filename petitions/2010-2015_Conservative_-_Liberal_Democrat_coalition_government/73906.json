        "additional_details": "Citylink demise gave publicity to employees losing jobs - redundancy payments are backed by the government.  90% of drivers were self-employed, leasing or buying vans in Citylink colours.  We were the public face. We were not paid as Citylink said the payment fell on a Bank Holiday.  We were promised payment on 30 Dec 14.  What a blow! No money before Christmas! On Christmas Day, the media reported Citylink\u2019s collapse.  Thousands arrived to see the Administrator and told they are unsecured creditors.  Better Capital, the owners, will. We were the face of Citylink. There has been no publicity; no monies owed will be paid; no redundancy payments - drivers in lease agreements; drivers unable to utilise vans due to the colour; no government help. We have bills. We have families. We paid for Christmas presents; we would not if we had known our fate. No money for bills and we found out on Christmas Day. 'How does this happen in this day and age?' Thank you for our Christmas present. ",
