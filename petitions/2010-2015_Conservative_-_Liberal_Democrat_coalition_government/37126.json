        "additional_details": "At Manchester Magistrates Court on 09/08/12, H.M.C.S. & the L.S.C. announced that a pilot scheme is to start on 01/09/12. The Court will now open for all matters on Saturdays & Sundays. There has been no real local consultation. It is the view of many that this extra time is not required. Remand Courts are well established on Saturday a.m. but those are restricted to the issue of bail for detainees charged by the Police overnight. There will be a huge impact upon the private and family lives of all involved. The Courts sat long hours to deal with the exceptional circs of the 'riots' but that does not mean such resources are required every weekend. Most areas of U.K. society are encouraged to create an appropriate work/life balance, yet Solicitors are now expected to offer their services in Police Stations, and now Courts, 7 days a week. IF YOU OPPOSE THE SCHEME, & THIS FURTHER EROSION OF 'THE WEEKEND', PLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION. Where will it end??\r\n\r\n",
