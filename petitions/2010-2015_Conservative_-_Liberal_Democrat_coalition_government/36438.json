The majority of inventions are made by individuals or small companies who have to stretch themselves to lodge a patent only to find that major companies steal the ideas and have the resources to make it impossible for the patent holder to defend their territory. I want the patent office to automatically include   insurance to enable the patent holder to fight a clear breach of the patented idea at minimal cost.",
