This to be regardless of their family circumstances.\r\nIt is not equitable that the British  tax payer, who has probably been the victim of the offence, should also have to fund the rehabilitation and support of these individuals who have abused their hospitality. A recent example is a 34 year sentence for the murder of  two pensioners.",
