The cost of a Sky HD subscription is over \u00a3600 per year for new customers. The F1 teams have been committed to free-to-air broadcast of the sport for some time, indeed FOTA chairman and McLaren principal Martin Whitmarsh has stated, \u201cIt\u2019s crucial to the commercial model of Formula 1 that TV coverage should remain free-to-air, and therefore universally accessible, and therefore widely consumed and enjoyed by large numbers of viewers \u2013 and the BBC delivers that in the UK... all of the FOTA teams believe in free-to-air television.\u201d F1 fans are also committed to the BBC\u2019s coverage of the sport, which is professional, balanced, and of superb quality. The BBC should continue to air all Formula One races, qualifying, and practice sessions under the existing format and not \u201cshare\u201d the rights to do so with an expensive, pay-per-view alternative.",
