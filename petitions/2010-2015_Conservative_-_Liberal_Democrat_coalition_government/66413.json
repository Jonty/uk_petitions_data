This is the killing of children. Who could morally approve of euthanasia to young children?\r\n\r\nNo-one wants children to suffer unnessarily, parents and society should be able to give the love and care to their children with the use of medication to prolong their young life rather than end it.\r\n\r\nTheir are too many politicians and groups ready to make decisions on behalf of the population.  This opens the doors to the many laws that the uk population does not have a say.\r\n\r\nThis law must not be passed.  Please give your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
