        "action": "Stop universities discriminating against British students",
        "additional_details": "For several years, universities have been making it difficult for British students to gain places on university courses. In addition to the higher university fees - now \u00a39,000 a year - universities have begun turning away British students in favour of students from abroad.\r\n\r\nIn an age when experience and qualifications are vital to employment, this scheme does nothing except harm our country's attempts to build a strong and motivated workforce. This petition calls on the government to overturn this unfair policy and to give British students a chance to prove their worth.",
