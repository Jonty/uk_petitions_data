        "additional_details": "As a nation we are currently at risk of losing all our sporting teams to imports from abroad. This is largely down to the lack of competitive sport taking place in our schools. Nations such as New Zealand, South Africa and others maintain a program of compulsory competitive sport and reap the rewards internationally. This also gives our children more chance of leading healthy, active lifestyles and having greater social skills as a result.\r\n\r\nWhat harm can it do?",
