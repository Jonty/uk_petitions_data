        "additional_details": "With current growth figures of just 0.2%, we can see the current Governments economic plan isn't working. We need investment in this country to create jobs and the construction industry needs support now. Those industry workers who haven't already lost their jobs are suffering from low wages and longer hours. The Government has already scrapped construction projects such as 'Building Schools for the Future', but we need investment now. We call on the Government to support and invest in major construction programmes, to create jobs and create growth in the economy.",
