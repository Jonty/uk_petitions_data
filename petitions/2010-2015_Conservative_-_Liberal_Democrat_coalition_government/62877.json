This is being done despite being advised that this approach is divisive; likely to achieve the opposite to community cohesion; does not address equality of outcomes; and, is a retrograde step.\r\nTREC helps everyone who has been treated unlawfully, regardless of their race, colour or ethnic origin.\r\n\r\nSign the petition to make sure the Council does not discriminate against any individual and continues to support us for the benefit of all the City\u2019s residents.\r\n",
