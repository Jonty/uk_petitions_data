        "additional_details": "We the undersigned wish for a ban on the sale and trade of foiegras within Britain.This means that restaurants and stores will not be allowed to sell foiegras within the boundaries of the UK. This ban will not go against any EU law regarding importation of a produce or interfere with any international trade agreement.\r\nThe practise of producing foie gras is illegal in the UK, on animal-cruelty grounds, yet the import of foie gras products to the UK is legal due to trade laws. In practise, the UK is condoning and financing a practise it has itself banned which is hypocritical. I implore the UK government to illegalise the importing of foie gras products in the UK.GIVE THE BRITISH PEOPLE A VOICE!",
