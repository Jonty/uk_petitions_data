So the need to have a number on one's car that vaguely resembles one's name must surely be the definition of excess in the western world.\r\n\r\nSo, on the basis that those that can afford to do this clearly have significant disposable income, let\u2019s tax them 100% on the cost of the plate (backdated for those that are already in possession of one) and ring fence this money to be given to children\u2019s charities.\r\n\r\nThis is an inherently fair tax as those who can only afford a pretty rubbish number plate (the ones that use a 3 for an E or a 7 for a T for example) that might cost \u00a3500 only have to pay \u00a3500 in tax. Those that are prepared to pay \u00a310,000 for their initials in black and yellow can clearly afford to pay the same again in tax. People that have no need or desire for such frippery immediately exempt themselves.\r\n\r\n",
