        "additional_details": "Northern Kurdistan Region of Iraq has made great strides to develop itself as a semi-autonomous democratic inclusive region improving the lives of it\u2019s people. But it has long suffered   disadvantage/sectarian/constitutional prejudice at the hands of Iraqi governments and continues today most notably by cutting off/delaying it\u2019s 17% share of Iraq\u2019s budget causing grave hardships for Kurds. The recent troubles caused by ISIS has added further weight causing the regional army (Peshmerga) be drawn into a conflict (it pre-warned) to defend it\u2019s people & refugees against a dangerous element.  The Kurds of Iraq now call for independence.  We, as ordinary people, UK citizens/residents, with either Kurdish heritage or compassionate & supportive to the cause of the Iraqi Kurds wish for this request be debated within the house of commons and support be given, by the British government to fulfil the wish of the majority and help pave way for independence.",
