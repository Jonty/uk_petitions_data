        "additional_details": " I call upon the Government, in the event of a hung parliament, to call another general election; the 3 main parties keep their original manifestos, assuming that they will get a majority, Labour and the LibDems draw up a manifesto on the mandate that they'd legislate on if they'd went into coalition, and the Conservatives and LibDems also draw up a manifesto on the mandate that they would legislate on if they went into coalition.  That way then the current manifesto would be one that the majority of the electorate had voted for.  I think that this would be a much fairer way of conducting a coalition.",
