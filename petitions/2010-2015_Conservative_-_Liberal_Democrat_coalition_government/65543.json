What is even more ridiculous is the amount of persecution, bullying, and prejudice there is against people of trans and nonbinary genders along with people who are bisexual/homosexual/pansexual/asexual/etc.\r\n\r\nIf people were educated about these things in childhood, they could grow up to be more accepting people.\r\n\r\nThis would greatly lower the amount of ignorance on these subjects in Britain.",
