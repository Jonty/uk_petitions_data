        "additional_details": "Britain has a proud tradition of religious tolerance and allowing everyone to freely practice their beliefs. Freedom of expression is the hallmark of a healthy society, by proposing to ban the niqab/burqa we will be acting contrary to these principles.\r\n\r\nSuch a ban will intensify feelings among the muslim community that they are being marginalised and being specifically targeted by those in government.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore imperative the government should take sound action through solid statement against any such attempts to ban the niqab/burqa.",
