The large scale unselective destruction they cause means they should have been banned along with chemical weapons. Added benefits are savings of at least 25billion for renewal and potential to develop west coast of scotlands oil reserves. Any loss of clout on the world level at the Nato table (only 5 members of nucleur club so wouldnt alienate many) would be compensated at the UN table (where disarmament is part of the charter) where we could be a world leader for once.",
