        "additional_details": "Set up a UK civil protection force populated with volunteers to help with any emergency situations that occur. For the UK this would primarily deal with pre-emptive help in areas that were forecast to be hit with severe flooding. Teams of volunteers could be bussed into affected areas before the floods to help people protect their homes with sandbags and relocate their furniture upstairs if possible.\r\n\r\nEmployment law could be changed so that the volunteers could be given paid time off from work in these situations. Limits could be set on the amount of time off to protect businesses \u2013 for example a maximum of 2 days per year for small business and 5 for larger organisations.\r\n\r\nThe insurance industry could be encouraged to provide funds to support this organisation as they would have much reduced liability in any areas helped by the volunteers.\r\n",
