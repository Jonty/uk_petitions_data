        "additional_details": "This e petition is proposing a bill to be introduced for a UK national maximum wage.A wage celling would help tackle income inequality by decreasing the gap between the rich and the poor.\r\n\r\nI propose that no British citizen be allowed to earn more than 10 times the minimum wage salary per annum. This is to include all bonuses and contributions. Any earnings above the wage ceiling should be redistributed through the system, to allow for better healthcare, medical research, schooling, community support and a long list of services that require updating and improving.this ratio should remain unchanged if introduced as an act of parliament.\r\n\r\nFor too long have the working class of this country seen only a small percentage of profits from their work, it is about time the rich suffer the same fate. This is not a direct attack upon the rich, but on a system that favours the wealthy.\r\n\r\nTHE GREED OF A FEW HAS LED TO THE SUFFERING OF MANY!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
