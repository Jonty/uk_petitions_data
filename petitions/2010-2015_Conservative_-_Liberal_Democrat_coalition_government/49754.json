I'm still waiting for David Cameron to listen to me when I tell him I want out of the EU and I want an opportunity to vote so in a legally binding IN or OUT referendum, which he promised me 3 years ago, to get me to vote for him which, like the lemming I am, I believed him (may I rot in hell for doing so) and did so but rest assured - HE WILL NEVER BE BELIEVED AGAIN, this side of his death.",
