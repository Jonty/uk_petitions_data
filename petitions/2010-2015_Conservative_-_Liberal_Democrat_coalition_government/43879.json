        "additional_details": "I believe that a new rule should be put in place. Anybody in the UK may have 1 child and receive child benefits for being unemployed. If these parents have another child they should receive no more benefits. This will force the parents to get a job and stop living their lives off the back of all working tax payers. They will be made to do this if they want to provide for their offspring or potentially lose their child to social services for not being able to provide.",
