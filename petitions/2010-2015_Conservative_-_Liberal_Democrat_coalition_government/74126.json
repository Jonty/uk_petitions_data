        "additional_details": "Do the general public know that the UK Ambulance Service is not an emergency service? Actually it is classed as an 'essential service'.This means it is in the same catagory as the gas, electricity and water boards yet they still retain the 999 status and drive under blue light conditions. Calls for an ambulance are going up but the amount of ambulances on the road are going down due to cuts in funding. It is about time the government classed the service as an emergency service and gave them the same funding as the fire and police! The Ambulance Service has been underfunded for to long now and this needs addressing! A modern day Ambulance Service needs more highly trained Paramedics along with more ambulances and less cars! Ambulance staff have to deal with a vast range of emergencies from medical emergencies to trauma. These professionals are there for people at their most vulnerable! The current system isn't working and hasn't for sometime! Patients should come first!",
