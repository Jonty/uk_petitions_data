This should be a national law, anyone caught parking in a space without a badge should be found guilty of breaking the law. Misuse of these spaces is not fair on disabled people who have no choice where they park. There needs to be harsher measures brought in, like fines, to stop people misusing these spaces, as currently there is no reason not to. ",
