It is about time that Britain and the EU stopped funding Israel's aggressive campaign against the Palestinian people. I have no racial or religious influences in setting this petition up, but believe such actions are morally wrong, and if something happend of a simillar situation in Europe, the UN, EU and Nato would be over it like a rash.",
