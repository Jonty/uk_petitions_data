        "additional_details": "Bristol is currently suffering heavy congestion in the city centre due to a large influx of commuters and tourists.\r\nWe propose a tram line that loops around the city centre providing quick and easy transportation between the cities main attractions. It would be streamlined with bus services to the suburbs and satellite towns or Bristol. The tram would be electric, meaning there will be less pollution in the city centre and would be green as it will use sustainable energy sources.\r\nThis would drastically lower congestion in Bristol and would also provide jobs to boost the economy.
