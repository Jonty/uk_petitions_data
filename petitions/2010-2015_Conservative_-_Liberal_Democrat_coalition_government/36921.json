However, research proves that cannabis is not physically addictive (even less addictive that caffeine) and has plenty of health benefits associated with it. There have been no recorded deaths from its use, and it is still illegal. While tobacco and alcohol are perfectly legal, and are responsible for thousands of deaths every year in the UK.\r\n\r\nAlso, hemp is very sustainable, would reduce environmental damage and cut down on rapid deforestation.\r\n\r\n",
