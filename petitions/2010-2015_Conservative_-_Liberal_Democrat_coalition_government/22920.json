        "additional_details": "There are too many dogs being bred for money,beaten and used for fighting,  i see it everyday. Owners should have a licence to own a dog and the fee should be raised, this way it might stop people breeding dogs just for the sake of it. They're no longer family pets, for some its their income, breeding their dog helps pay their bills. There are hundreds of dogs a day being put to sleep as a cause of this, owners shold be vetted to see if they have a history of violence  drugs etc. just like you would be checked if you wer to adopt a child. A dog is for life not just for Christmas.  I would like the government to raise the dog licence fee & to start a system of vetting potential dog owners.",
