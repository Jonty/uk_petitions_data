        "additional_details": "Everyday, food hygiene inspections go on in restaurants/takeaways/supermarkets in England. Depending on how clean they are, they receive a rating that goes from 0 (urgent improvement necessary) to 5 (very good). But, in England, the owner of the premises has the right to display the score they got or not (in Wales, the display is compulsory).\r\n\r\nYou can find out the ratings on the Food Standards Agency website, but wouldn't it be much easier if you didn't have to go and have a look online everytime you want to eat out?\r\n\r\nWe would like the display of the food hygiene ratings to be made compulsory for every food business in England.",
