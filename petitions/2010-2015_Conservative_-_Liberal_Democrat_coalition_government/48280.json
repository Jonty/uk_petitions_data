        "additional_details": "On 12 December, 2011, Dame Sally Coates, along with a review panel, put forward the proposal to scrap the current Post-threshold, Excellent Teacher and Advanced Skills Teacher statuses and replace them with a single standard, known as 'Master Teacher'.\r\n\r\nWhile the title 'Master Teacher' can have connotations of 'masterly' skill and someone capable of offering a 'masterclass', the term, arguably, has more immediate overtones of a less favourable nature, namely, those of power, patriarchy and antiquity.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, why not change \u2018Master Teacher\u2019 to another, more appropriate title, such as:\r\n\r\n\u2018Consultant Teacher\u2019\r\n\u2018Lead Teacher/Practitioner\u2019 or\r\n\u2018Director of Learning\u2019\r\n\r\nEach of these titles reflects a high sense of aspiration, leadership and creative direction, which, surely, is more apposite for an exceptional and effective twenty-first century teacher, competing with some of the world\u2019s best?\r\n\r\nPlease show your support by signing the petition. Kindest thanks.",
