        "additional_details": "While Nick Clegg is the Deputy Prime Minister he is still the leader of the Liberal Democrats and they were allowed to speak with their own voice in the House of Commons before entering the coalition, they should still have the right to be heard now instead of being in the back seat of a Labour and Conservative argument. A Labour supporter would be happy at having a better chance at discrediting the Liberal Democrats, a Liberal Democrat supporter would be happy about their leader being able to speak when it mattered and a Conservative Supporter would be happy about some of the pressure leaving David Cameron, everyone's happy.",
