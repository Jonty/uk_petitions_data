This will hopefully:\r\n1) Increase voter turnout;\r\n2) Ensure voters know what they are voting for; and\r\n3) Make educated public opinions heard.\r\n\r\nParliament doesn't take advantage and target younger people, who will be voting in under six years.\r\n\r\nTo increase political knowledge would be to change the direction of politics in this country altogether. Be part of that change, and sign the petition!",
