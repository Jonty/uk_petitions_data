Looking Into this word and the origins of this word it is basically An invitation for someone to Vomit over another person based on there personal Looks.\r\nIn This modern day I don`t believe it is acceptable to Vomit over another Human being Because the one individual that uses this word Does not like the look of another person. Many other people May Love the Look of this person. I feel this word is offensive and Highly outdated. If this word stays in the dictionary many people will continue to use this word In a Nasty image obsessed society this needs to be removed from the english dictionary times have moved on from the medieval times.",
