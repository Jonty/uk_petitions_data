A requirement that any false story is printed with the same space parameters of the original - i.e. a front page for a front page\r\nb. The power of forced closure for a period of time, or penalties amounting to take proportions of the media's income, when the media has undertaken some grievous wrong (i.e. hacking; serious libel)\r\nc. An independent body should be created for the storing of sources, which should be legally required to exist but is only to be seen under court order by a judge in a respective case.\r\n\r\nThe government must ensure that the Media take responsibility for that they write in the above ways, plus:\r\ni) establishing an inquiry to understand the effect of the media on the populace; &\r\nii) establishing an inquiry to agree an appropriate percentage that a single person (legal or actual) can own in the UK (esp to ensure a free, competitive, independent media).",
