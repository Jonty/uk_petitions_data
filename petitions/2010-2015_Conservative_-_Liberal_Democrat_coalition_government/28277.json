Children take in smoke when walking around in Town, they choose not to smoke quite clearly yet they can't help breathing it in when they just want to buy something.\r\n\r\nThe only place you should be allowed to smoke is in smoking shelters which should be near telephone boxes, and you can also smoke in your own home or garden.",
