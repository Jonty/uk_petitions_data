We change and make beds, perform personal care to patients, take observations such as blood pressure and temperature as well as respiration rates. Assist with mobility and feeding, try and make patients time in hospital happier and comfortable. Doctors and nurses wouldn't know changes in patients if it wasn't for HCA's. I think we deserve more than \u00a37 an hour!",
