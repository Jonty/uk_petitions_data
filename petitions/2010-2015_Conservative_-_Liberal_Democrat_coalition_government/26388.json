People of the UK fought long to make our NHS the best in the World they targeted a need and did something about it something sadly lacking in today's society. The need was identified in the laboratory of life and has been developed in that same laboratory. Now government want to tear it down to provide special healthcare for the rich, the poor will inherit what that remains. Another lie by the government \"your national health service is safe in our hands\" Nothing is safe in their hands. Lying to get elected is a thing that should be illegal election under false pretences should not be the norm.\r\nI beg all right thinking people to vote for this petition.\r\n",
