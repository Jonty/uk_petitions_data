So who pays for pelican, zebra, toucan and puffin crossings, for cycle lanes and for the upkeep of pavements? - again it's the motorist...why should the motorist be burdened with those costs when the pedestrians or cyclists that actually use them pay nothing at all towards their upkeep.\r\nMy proposal is to charge a tax to all users of the road/pavement and not just a select few.",
