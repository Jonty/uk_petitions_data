        "additional_details": "The current legal requirement for schools to provide daily collective worship makes assumptions on a child's religious views and the existence of such. Religion is, like political affiliation and musical taste, a matter of personal choice, as such influence on this personal matter has no place in state schools, where there is no absolute uniformity in religious views. Matters of religion should remain the responsibility of the parents and no one else.",
