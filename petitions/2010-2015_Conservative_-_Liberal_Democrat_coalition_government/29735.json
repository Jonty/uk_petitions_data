        "additional_details": "The cardiac charity SADS UK insists that Government brings forward a strategy to ensure schools have AEDs and training in place to save lives if cardiac arrest occurs. In an emergency the immediate delivery of a therapeutic shock to a pupil, teacher or visitor to the school will give them the best possible chance of survival. It is likely that children with undiagnosed heart conditions exist within the school population. As many as 1 in 500 hundred children may suffer from cardiomyopathy, also conditions such as Long QT, Brugada, CPVT and Wolf Parkinson White Syndromes. The first sign of one of these conditions can be sudden cardiac arrest. Sports activities can exacerbate cardiac problems. Blunt blows to the chest, such as that of a football or rugby ball can cause Commotio cordis, resulting in cardiac arrest. Other factors besides heart disease and heart attack can cause cardiac arrest; they include:- Respiratory arrest, Electrocution, Choking, Trauma",
