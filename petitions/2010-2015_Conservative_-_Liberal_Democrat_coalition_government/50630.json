If a dog bites a human they get put down, if a Human harms another they get bed and breakfast for free. The reformation technique is not working, we want these prisoners in shackles on the streets cleaning up the country to be allowed their meals. Human rights should be lost when they act inhumane! Teach our younger generations that if they break the law they must fear prison, and that they will be punished!",
