        "additional_details": "The Orange Order has for years created segregation throughout the UK, particularly in Northern Ireland. They claim to celebrate religious liberty, but exclude those who do not belong to a Protestant denomination. They celebrate a victorious battle that was won by both Catholics and Protestants, yet they exclude Catholics and see that Victory as a Victory over Catholicism. In today's democratic age, it seems absurd that such an institution is allowed to march freely and to promote it's sectarianism and bigotry. Either ban this institution, or introduce an open door policy, open to anyone regardless of religion to truly represent religious liberty and let it be open to all who wish to celebrate the Victory of the Battle of the Boyne and support the Union. Only if one of these actions is taken will there truly be Religious liberty and unity in this country.",
