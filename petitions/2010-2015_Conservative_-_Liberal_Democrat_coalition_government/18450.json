        "additional_details": "The purpose of this e-petition is to request that annual rail travel card loans from employers are tax free.\r\n\r\nThe cost of train travel in Britain has grown disproportionately and will continue to grow above the rate of inflation for at least the next three years. At this point many commuters spend 20-25% of their income on travelling to their place of work. To be able to purchase annual travel cards tax free would be a great relief to many commuters.\r\n\r\nMany companies also limit the loans to 1 month of the employee's gross salary. This limit is clearly out-dated and needs to be increased.\r\n\r\nThe government's popular cycle to work scheme has allowed people who commute by bike to purchase bicycles tax free through their employer train commuters deserve the same opportunity.",
