        "additional_details": "This petition is being made to help those dog owners who have had there innocent dogs taken by police. There has been thousands of dogs being seized who haven't harmed any person or animal this is unfair on not only the dog the owners too. There has been a lot of talk about police seizing dangerous dogs not all of these dogs are dangerous, they are just pre-judging dogs and there owners and these are just normal people who walk away with thousands of pounds fines for nothing when they and there dogs are innocent. So many dogs have been killed when they haven't been given the chance of the life they deserve please help support this petition as I hope to make the authorities see how wrong there choices are about 'dangerous dogs' and hope something can be done to stop these dogs been taken, Thankyou",
