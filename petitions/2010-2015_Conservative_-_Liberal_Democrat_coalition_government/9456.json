Allow offenders to contribute to society whilst having privileges removed. These could include stopping use of social media sites and mobile phone communication and internet access, along with being able to buy alcohol, drive, etcetera.\r\n\r\nRe-install privelege for those who toe the line for others as well as themselves. Make life better for those intent on keeping things peaceful and constructive for their communities and the wider public as a whole. ",
