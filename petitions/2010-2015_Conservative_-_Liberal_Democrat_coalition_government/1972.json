Surveys regularly show the vast majority of supporters back the choice to stand or sit. The FSF\u2019s National Supporters\u2019 Survey showed that 90% of fans back the choice to stand or sit.The FSF\u2019s Safe Standing Campaign is not just about those who prefer to stand. By giving supporters the choice, everyone benefits. Those who wish to stand can do so, while those who prefer to sit no longer have to worry about having their view blocked.\r\n",
