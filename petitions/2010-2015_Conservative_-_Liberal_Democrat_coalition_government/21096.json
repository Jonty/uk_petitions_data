        "additional_details": "Not all second home owners are rich! They may be normal working people trying to provide for retirement ( thus not relying on the state ) whilst also providing a service.\r\nThe reality is that the thriving seaside towns are reliant on tourism and simply die without second home owners who let out their properties for the use of the tourists.  Ask the local businesses who provides the work, who pays the wages of the local tradespeople.Ask the local who owns the pub the reality of the situation. Lucky enough to own a second home...luck didn't come into it! We want the government to ensure that discounts for second home owners are kept and not increased to an unacceptable level.\r\n ",
