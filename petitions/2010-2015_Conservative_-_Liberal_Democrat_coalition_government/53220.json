        "additional_details": "We believe there are two important problems with the government's plans to filter the Internet:\r\n\r\n- Censorship by default:\r\n\r\nThe main role of these filters is to block web pages that are judged as being inappropriate even though their content may be perfectly legal. The filters would be activated by default which means that by default the UK's Internet would be censored.\r\n\r\nThose who would like to use filters for their Internet already have many possibilities today, free and/or non free. We do not need government legislation to decide what is appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Population profiling:\r\n\r\nSubscribers who wish to not use the government's filtering system will need to contact their ISPs. This implies a record of citizens who may be potential \"extreme pornography\" consumers. We oppose a government database that would hold the names of those who wish to have the possibility of viewing legal content that may be categorised as \"inappropriate\".",
