        "additional_details": "This petition asks that persons receiving benefits for more than one year must then (to receive the same cash value of benefit) work on schemes within the local community that benefit the community for at least minimum wage  e.g. \u00a370 normal benefit payment would require 10 hours work if \u00a37 p/hour was deemed the wage. This will remove the current observation that \u201cits not worth working as I lose my benefits\u201d and encourage the search for \u2018real\u2019 work. It enables the person to contribute whilst still having time to find a job and get a reference for future employer, it reduces the need to find employees from other countries to do work that British people do not want to do, thus less immigration.  With more people looking for real employment it reduces the burden on benefits and thus enables people who truly cannot gain employment to get an enhanced payment of benefit and better standard of life.",
