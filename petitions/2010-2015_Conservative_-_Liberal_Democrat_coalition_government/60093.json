        "additional_details": "We would like all health authorities to offer basic first aid and infant resuscitation training as part of the antenatal classes. This seems to be offered currently only when your child is on the CONI or CONI plus scheme meaning that either you have already lost a child or had a life threatening event. The techniques are simple but very different to that of adult CPR and all parents should be made aware of these techniques so as to feel able to sustain the infant in case of emergency before having had a 'near miss'",
