        "additional_details": "Students are currently having a tough time raising funds and preparing themselves for the financial difficulties that universities and modern consumerism brings. This is why it is important that students are able to have part time work outside of their studies. However the current conditions of work, especially applying for part time jobs are incredibly unfair. The greatest trouble is businesses not accepting or even reading applications for those who do not have experience in the career. However, a student cannot gain experience if they are not accepted, which results in a vicious cycle that severely affects the wellbeing of the person. Worse still, a business rarely responds to an appication by stating that they have not obtained the job. This is the benefit of modern business. I would wish for Parliament to discuss legislation to provide part time students with fairer conditions for applying for jobs.",
