        "additional_details": "This is a petition to abolish VAT on ebooks. An increasing number of people are reading books in digital format, but with VAT adding a significant extra cost, the books are often little or no cheaper than their print equivalents. The EU has removed barriers to equalising VAT on ebooks but the government doesn't seem to be making any moves towards adopting this. Books should be considered a necessity, not a luxury and an opportunity for extra tax revenue.\r\n\r\nThere should be a consistent approach to tax on all formats of the written word\r\n",
