        "additional_details": "Company National Insurance (NI) contributions at 13.8% are having a direct effect on reducing employment especially for small buisnesses. Fierce competition in the service industries forces some to operate on cash payment basis. Companies that comply with legislation are less competitive in the market place and the Goverment loses out twice - firstly for the non payment of NI and secondly by paying unemployment benefit to those working for cash. I would like the Government to review this by introducing a sliding scale of NI contributions based on salary.",
