The electorates feelings on which could be better gauged by talking directly to them. The e-petitions website only stands as a firm reminder why we have educated elected representatives, so we can avoid such base drivel as spewed here.\r\n\r\nThe money saved by closing the site, could be better spent on something more important, like water pollution or regional development.",
