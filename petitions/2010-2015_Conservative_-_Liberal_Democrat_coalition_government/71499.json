The workers are held as virtual slaves, with their passports taken from them\r\n3 the process in which Qatar 'won the right' to host the tournament in 2010 is seriously suspect.\r\n\r\n2022 is eight years away but if pressure is out in now FIFA will have to appoint another venue, perhaps England, who should have won the bid in the first place\r\n",
