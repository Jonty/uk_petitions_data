        "additional_details": "Many non residential parents get away with not paying child support because they are in receipt of benefit and have the child for an over-night stay. It is then assessed as the nil rate, which means the parent with care receives nothing. Students are also given the nil rate.\r\n     I believe unless both parents share care 50/50 the non residential parent should support their children, because the parent who has the majority of care clearly has more expenses to pay.\r\n     I think non residential parents should not be allowed contact with their children if they do not provide for them. And if they are in receipt of benefits they should be given a 3 month period in order to find work to provide for there children.\r\n     With the exception of: parents under 18,  in prison or care, or parents with a net weekly income of \u00a35 or less.\r\n",
