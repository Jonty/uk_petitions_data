Example: High-visibility jackets.\r\n\r\nIt is simply unacceptable that non-uniformed traffic wardens (sometimes those who aren't even on duty) are allowed to write tickets for drivers, especially if the wardens are simply wasting their own time to try meet a local 'quota' for their employer/local council office.",
