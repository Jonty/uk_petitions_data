        "additional_details": "As a non-smoker in an office environment, I find that smokers receive far more breaks than non-smokers, for which they are getting paid.\r\nOn average, each smoker in our office spends between 5-10 minutes,  5-6 times a day, out of the office on smoking breaks.  This means on some days I can be at my desk for almost an hour more than a smoker.\r\nWhen you have a boss who smoke, bringing this up is a pointless exercise, as they would always side with the smokers.\r\nI believe legislation that allows non-smokers the same rights as smokers, whilst reducing the amount of smoking breaks they can take, would increase productivity, and allow staff to get on better as everyone would get a fair deal.",
