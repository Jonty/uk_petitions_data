        "action": "Regulate Mangingn Agents of Residential Property",
        "additional_details": "Unregulated property managing agents neglect too many leaseholders (1.6 million in England) whilst charging them exorbitant fees. Although BBC\u00b4s \u201cWatchdog\u201d exposed the problems in April 2009, no remedy is forthcoming from Parliament.\r\n    Whilst each unregulated managing agent deploys \u00a3-millions of service charge monies extracted from leaseholders, too many leaseholders are dissatisfied and angry with blighted lives. The elderly, infirm and vulnerable are afraid to protest or vote openly at AGM for the fear of drawing their wrath. Individual leaseholders are unable to afford lawyers or conduct complicated legal action at Lease Valuation Tribunal.\r\n    I therefore petition my Member of Parliament to have the housing law adjusted to require all managing agents of residential property to be (a) licenced and (b) be regulated by a suitable regulator (or professional body e.g. RICS) to observe prescribed minimum service standards and be subject to disciplinary proceedings for misconduct.",
