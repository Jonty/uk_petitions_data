From \u00a350 up to \u00a3243 and that amount goes straight onto a pre-paid debit card for you to spend just after payday.\r\n\r\nThe great thing is the amount you saved is Tax & NI free - saving a 20% taxpayer up to \u00a3933 per year.\r\n\r\nPlus participation stores also offer a 10% discount giving savers \u00a31224 Of Free shopping each year!\r\n\r\nOver 90% of tax payers can benefit from this. High Street's can be thriving again and 1000's of new jobs created.\r\n\r\nPlease help us help you!  Sign today and tell your friends to sign too.\r\n\r\nTogether we can make it happen!\r\n",
