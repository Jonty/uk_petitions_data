        "additional_details": "The government must address the ongoing debate on punishment and rehabilitation of prisoners. We must build a new style of prisons that are properly equipped with educational and vocational training facilities, and with their own workplaces sufficient to accommodate all prisoners.  Prisoners will then not be idle, can learn new skills and a work ethic that will help them on release.\r\n\r\nThis would satisfy the vast majority of the public who demand that criminals should face severe punishments, reduce the threat to the public from criminal behaviour, and provide a good environment to rehabilitate criminals and properly prepare them for release.\r\n\r\nThis would be far cheaper than the current costly and ineffective system\r\n",
