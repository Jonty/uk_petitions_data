A simple urine dip test is quick and non invasive and will weed out Drug takers.\r\n\r\nI do not want OUR Tax to fund a Drug habit.\r\n\r\nThere are honest people out there that need Job seekers to get to interviews or buy clothes for interview.  But there are some that abuse the system for their own illegal practices.\r\n\r\nDo not get hung up on Ethics. Its a urine test. It would take 30 seconds and would not demean or affect any persons rights.\r\n\r\nThere are no down sides to this argument.  You fail the test, you don't get FREE money!",
