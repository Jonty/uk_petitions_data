        "additional_details": "There's been no global warming for over a decade. The actual forecast for the global climate over the next decade is severe global cooling. This is based on observed solar activity & the correlation between solar activity & global climate. The carbon tax is hurting the economy ten times as much as global warming would hurt the economy if it was actually happening, but it isn't. Abolish the hidden carbon taxes on fuel, on electricity, on gas, & abolish it altogether. ",
