        "additional_details": "It is about time that Teaching Assistants and Learning Support Assistants pay reflected the valueable job they do in our schools. The pay they receive is pro -rata and the hours kept to a minium in order to keep their contracts to part-time. This reflects on their pensions. Schools exploit them and know that they will not get paid outside their contracted hours but expect them to do so willingly.\r\nThey are highly qualified but are on low incomes Many having recently received a pay cut because of the very unfair job evaluation / harmonisation process that each local authority under took. Even this was an unfair exercise as each council still pays under their own pay scale\r\nTheir job is not an easy one.\r\nSo I propose that the government\r\nIncrease their pay ( annual salary)\r\nInprove their working conditions\r\nPay should be all year round not Term Time only. and employed 35 hours a week.\r\n",
