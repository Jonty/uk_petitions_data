Cease providing the \u2018Teen Mover\u2019 pass for half fares on all bus services, which will save \u00a3119,000.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis pass is currently vital to young people who are already being targeted by cuts of EMA and child benefit. It gives young people a lifeline to social inclusion, and is a critical factor in being able to attend education, training and work-based learning, as well as allowing affordable travel to work experience and interviews, whether this be for jobs or universities.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the government to retain the half-fare travel card in its' current form for 16-18 year olds in the Middlesbrough area.\r\n",
