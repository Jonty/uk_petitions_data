        "additional_details": "Yet another summer school holiday goes by and the traffic increases due to the school run, public buses are full with school children and parents decide to play dodgems parking around school entrances.  Surely despite  the fact the government will lose millions in fuel duty whilst everyone sits in traffic, the benefits of job creation and reduced congestion will benefit business and combat the fuel duty losses. Oh yeah also all the millions of tons of reduced carbon emissions should add additional weight to the argument for the introduction of public purse funded school buses.",
