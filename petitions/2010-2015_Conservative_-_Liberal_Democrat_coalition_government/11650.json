        "additional_details": "LOWER CAR INSURANCE - Stop the illegal sale of personal data for referral fees by police & other public bodies to reduce insurance costs.\r\nThe cost of annual insurance for driving has risen beyond all reasonable amounts and is driven by the fees paid to police & other bodies who profit from accidents and other transport events by selling the private details of those involved in order to gain financially, thus raising the cost of insurance for those seeking to insure their vehicles. Young drivers are being asked to pay amounts averaging \u00a34,000 per annum. This must stop. The selling of personal data is illegal as it breaks data protection laws but prices normal people out of the private transport market. This penalizes rural inhabitants, young people and those on the bottom end of the social scale who have no access to reliable transport - stopping them gaining jobs & improving their prospects. The illegal practice of selling private data for personal gain has to stop.\r\n",
