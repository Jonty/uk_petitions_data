I'm a single parent working full time and due to rent, council tax etc I'm \u00a34 a week better off than those sitting doing nothing! Where is the incentive to work? Unless you are brought up working there is none. I believe for the first year workers should not have to pay any rent or council tax as others get that for free long term. That gives people the chance to save for the future and mortgages. The best solution is to cut benefits to all not working and stop the layabout and free handout crisis we are in! Why am I penalised for working???",
