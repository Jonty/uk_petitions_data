Today there is the story about employees being paid millions for being made redundant when they had already been told they will be taken back on in their old jobs at enhanced rates of pay, without being asked to pay back the redundancy payment.  We also hear about the BBC supporting a DJ who falsely accused a lawyer running a charity of misappropriating donations to that charity WITHOUT A SHRED OF EVIDENCE.  Can you say if there is anything that the BBC is involved in that is probitive, honest and being conducted with integrity.  Reminds us of the Kray organisation in the early 1900s - but of course this organisation used taxpayer pounds to conduct its criminal activity, where, at least, the Krays had to steal their money - but then the licence tax is theft, isn't it?",
