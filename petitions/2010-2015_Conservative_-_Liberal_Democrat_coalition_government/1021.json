        "additional_details": "Completely remove the TV licence fee, and increase council tax, using this money to fund the BBC to the existing levels.\r\n\r\nThis will produce a saving to the taxpayer of all the costs to adminster and enforce TV licences (staff costs, office space costs, IT costs, etc), as well savings in the justice system as well.  This change will remove the possibility for TV licence evasion, and also make the fee fairer and more progressive, rather than the current flat rate.",
