        "additional_details": "This petition calls for any plans to privatise any part of the Court Service to be dropped, and for any privatisation that has already taken place to be reversed.\r\nThe results of privatisation that has already taken place have been poor. There is no part of the justice system that cannot be provided in-house, and it should be kept in-house to ensure impartiality, data security and access to a good level of service. It is not believed that privatisation will achieve that.\r\nThe only thing achievable is to save money for the government, who are already driving down the cost of justice to prepare for privatisation. Why not simply improve the system but retain it's public service status?\r\nPlease recognise that the public deserve better than a profit-seeking justice system.",
