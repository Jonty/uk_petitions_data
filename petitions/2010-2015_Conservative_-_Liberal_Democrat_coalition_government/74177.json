        "additional_details": "This petition is to record a vote of no confidence in Councillor John Tucker the leader of South Hams District Council.  The council has achieved many great things under his leadership but unfortunately completely failed in the area of renewable energy planning. Under Cllr Tuckers stewardship the proliferation of industrial solar farms and large scale wind turbines has led to the destruction of the areas natural beauty leading to one of the highest concentrations of industrial installations in the UK.  Please sign now, before 30 March, to make our elected leader review this reckless policy.",
