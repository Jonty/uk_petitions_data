        "additional_details": "It is an accepted fact that all schools suffer with poor parking by school run parents to the point of being a danger to other road users. Schools that have large playing fields close to the main buildings should convert part of the playing field to a car park purely for school run cars and staff, a lot of schools do not get full use of the playing fields by pupils, sometimes the only people seen on the field are workmen mowing the grass.",
