        "additional_details": "Almost a third of care home residents in the UK have to pay all of their care costs because they have savings/assets above the government threshold (currently \u00a323,250) which denies them access to  any financial help.\r\n\r\nThe situation for many such residents in England is even worse. Some self-funders are being charged substantially more than local authority funded residents in the same home and for exactly the same care package.  I believe this amounts to an insidious profiteering by those care homes involved. I consider it morally wrong and an exploitation of vulnerable people, particularly as many self- funders will have no idea they are going to pay a higher price at the time of contracting with a home. Why are local authorities dismissing this form of abuse?\r\n\r\nI would like the Government to regulate this despicable practice and require local authorities to use  existing adult safeguarding powers to call offenders to account.
