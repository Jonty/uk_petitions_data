        "additional_details": "Kibworth academy in Market Harborough plans to change from a middle school to a school that accepts pupils who are 11-16. However they are not expanding and have decided to not include pupils form St Cuthberts, Foxton and Billsden primary schools in their catchment area anymore. This means that these pupils will have no catchment school to go to. This is going to have a knock on effect on these communities, as well as splitting up friendship groups, affecting their education and emotional health. We would like Kibworth to remain as a middle school or to work to find somewhere else where these children can be educated together. ",
