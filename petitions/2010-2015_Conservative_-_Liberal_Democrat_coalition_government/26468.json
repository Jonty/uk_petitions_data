The United Kingdom took in nearly 10,000 predominantly Jewish children from Nazi Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and the Free City of Danzig.\r\n\r\nTwo memorial statues were built.  One stands outside Liverpool Street Station in London, another on the station concourse to commemorate this  event.  Sadly Both memorials are being used as unofficial bins and seats by the public.\r\n\r\nWe are asking that someone take responsibility for the memorials and ensure that they are respected appropriately.
