        "additional_details": "I do not agree with the age being 25 for the smear test! both my sisters and my niece have had Cervical cancer from between 17-25 and only had it picked up at 25, and had lost the chance to have children. there was no link to the cervical cancer in the family which is why they weren't eligible. I'd like the smear test to be 18, because that's the age we are legally classed as an adult and it'd pick up precancerous cells before its too late. I'd like 12 months to get signatures to lower the age.",
