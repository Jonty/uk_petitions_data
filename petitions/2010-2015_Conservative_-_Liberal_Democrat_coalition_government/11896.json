        "additional_details": "The government must seize a unique opportunity to drive the desired change in the banks behaviour by using the \u2018nationalised banks\u2019.\r\nLloyds TSB, RBS and Northern Rock should be split up into a number of smaller banks whose charter would be to focus on current accounts, savings, mortgages and loans to creditworthy consumers and business customers. Bank charges and interest rates on savings and loans should be reasonable and fair to savers and borrowers.  Funds to regenerate the economy could be channelled through these banks instead of bank bailouts. They should be banned from \u2018casino banking\u2019 or any activity which they can not properly risk assess.\r\nThe directors and senior managers must be paid performance related but not excessive salaries, pensions, incentives, perks, allowances, expenses and bonuses.\r\nThere would be thousands of competent managers queuing up for these jobs.\r\nThe competition and surge of customers changing to the new banks would force the other banks into line.\r\n",
