        "additional_details": "We have all seen Syria's government shelling and gunning down its own innocent and unarmed adults and children. I'm asking for \"IMMEDIATE ACTION\" by the UK government and armed forces to stop the massacre. Let the UK do what it does best and act as peacekeepers and mediators. First by imposing a no fly zone and if necessary by using force to clear the streets of tanks. There has been too much death already and this is for IMMEDIATE ACTION - note to admin there is no other petition that asks for this!",
