We believe that issues around respect in relationships should be taught in schools and are pressing for Labour's Clause 20 amendment for mandatory sex and relationship education to be passed. We have launched a campaign, Talk & Walk, to highlight that any woman being abused must Talk about it: to people she trusts, to friends and family and to get the conversation around abuse started in schools, and Walk: towards support, advice and help.\r\nWe need to educate our children about what is right and wrong within relationships.",
