        "additional_details": "There is 4 times the amount of money from road tax and tolls going into the treasury than is spent on roads repair and building new,once again its poor government administration. A simple cost effective fair way to charge vehicle owners is to do away with the road fund licence or road tax and shift the cost onto fuel,an extra duty on fuel of around 2 pence a litre would fund the road network,owners who dont use their vehicles much or own small cars pay less, owners who use their vehicles more or own larger cars pay more and vehicles coming to the UK from abroad also contribute, the licence disc would be replaced by an MOT disc applied for in the same way as the tax disc, the mot disc would be displayed on the vehicle windscreen, this will cut down the amount of vehicles on our roads without an mot, vehicles exempt from an mot would apply in the same way and receive an mot exempt disc. How easy and fair is that ??",
