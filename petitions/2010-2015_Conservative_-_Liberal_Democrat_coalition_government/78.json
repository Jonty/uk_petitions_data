        "additional_details": "That England be given within the framework of devolution the same national political institutions as Scotland, including the creation of a Parliament, the office of First Minister, of a Government and a dedicated civil service for all of a united England.\r\n\r\nAt present, England has no purely English national political institutions and thereby suffers from unfair treatment within the UK.\r\n\r\nThe creation or revival of a English Parliament will answer the question 'Who speaks for England?' and should ensure that the interests of all the people of England are given higher priority and greater care.\r\n\r\nAs John Bright famously said: 'England is the Mother of all Parliaments'.  It is well time that England regained her own Parliament.",
