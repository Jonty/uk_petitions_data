        "additional_details": "The 4 November M5 Taunton fireball upon impact of 34 vehicles including 7 articulated lorries, causing death at the scene of at least 7 people + 51 injured is a clear indication distraction (example firework display) is a major risk of inadequate braking potential, more so than tiredness of journey-time.  Any idea of increasing motorway speed limit to 80mph is therefore proven ill advised as this would decrease braking time, increasing loss of life and  maiming of victims.  Furthermore increased fuel consumption (c. 20%) for higher speeds leads to extra pollution, resulting in worsening of asthma and heart conditions. 60 miles per hour should become the speed limit on all British roads including motorways, in tandem with improving public transport such as trains and buses.",
