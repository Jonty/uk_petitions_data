        "additional_details": "A request for nationally recognised, local government issued and regulated parking permits for mobile care workers to allow them to park their vehicles in restricted areas to enable them to go about their work unencumbered; similar to, and subject to the same regulation as those currently issued under the blue badge scheme for disabled people; currently mobile care workers are subject to fines and clamping of their vehicles whilst going about their work: clamping can have serious consequences to their clients, Fines are expensive, and for a person on minimum wage; one fine can cost an entire week's wage or more. Care workers do not choose their clients, and can often find themselves struggling to access their clients' homes acceptably to fit in with their work schedule: The permits would be easily policed, since the DWP would have the employment details of permit holders, and any permit holder who ceases to work as a carer would no longer be entitled to a permit.
