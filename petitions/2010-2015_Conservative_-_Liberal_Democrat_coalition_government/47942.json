The next interviewee was Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who was defending the changes. The interviewer then asked him if he could  could live on this amount. He replied: \"If I had to, I would.\"\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on Iain Duncan Smith to live on this budget for at least one year.
