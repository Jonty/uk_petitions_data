        "additional_details": "We wish that the local council in Harrow would put in place more road safety measures on Harrow-on-the-Hill particularly on Roxeth Hill and London Rd as the roads are very busy with cars travelling at very fast speeds. There is a college located on the hill, which is not signposted and so drivers may not know that it is there. There is one 'crossing' which is an island but it is located on a bend and so it is nearly impossible to see approaching cars. Action should be taken before a serious accident occurs.",
