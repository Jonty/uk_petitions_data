As such the HMRC acts as both judge and jury without providing all relevant evidence against which responses can be made. This is the equivalent to a third world kangaroo court.\r\nWe ask that article 6 of the human rights act be extended to taxation disputes in order that a fair hearing, complete with production of all evidence, can be had by anyone who has a dispute with the HMRC - as would be expected in a civilised society",
