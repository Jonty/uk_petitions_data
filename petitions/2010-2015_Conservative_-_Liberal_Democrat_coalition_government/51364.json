If David Cameron is to attend the Bilderberg Conference in his role as Prime Minister, he should reveal exactly what was discussed and what he said.\r\n\r\nClearly some meetings that the Prime Minister has mus remain confidential for reasons of national security.  However, if there is nothing underhand going on then David Cameron should reveal what was discussed.  This is a meeting with billionaires where national security is not an issue.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, David Cameron stated as one of his key objectives to improve the transparency and accountability of government.  Clearly his attendance of, and silence on, the conference flies in the face of this promise.",
