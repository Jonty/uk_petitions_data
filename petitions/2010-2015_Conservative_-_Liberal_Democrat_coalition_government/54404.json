        "additional_details": "Parliament voted against the possibility of military intervention in Syria on the 29th August.  I believe  this vote is premature and does not represent the will of the British people.  Official confirmation form the UN weapon inspectors that chemical weapons were used has not even been release!  No single set of information will be able to prove the whole truth, but if compelling evidence from Israel, US and UK intelligence along with the UN finding show that the Syrian government did use chemical weapons then I believe the British public would wish for intervention by the UK (in conjunction with middle eastern and western allies).  Maybe not troops on the ground, but some show of force to show the Syrian government that the use of chemical weapons is not and will not ever be tolerated.  I felt strongly enough about this that I visited this petition site for the first time, if you agree then please sign !",
