However it is one of the few sports that isn't played professionally worldwide. If we can make it easier and more accessible for people to watch and understand the game, we may be able to further plans to create an NFL franchise and possibly even one day expand to having a professional league in this country, and one day possibly even make American Football, a game not just for the states.
