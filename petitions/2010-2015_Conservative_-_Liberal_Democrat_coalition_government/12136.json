        "additional_details": "It is proven that the public take a dim view on criminality, and the people who engage in its actions. The following statement:\r\n\"Things got a bit out of hand & we'd had a few drinks. We smashed the place up and Boris set fire to the toilets\" David Cameron,Oxford,1986\r\nShould mean that David Cameron loses all state benefits including all houses funded by us the tax payer, and indeed his job. All people who can be proven to have also engaged in this activity should receive the same punishments. I feel this is only fitting in the eye for an eye generation that evicts innocent people from their homes on the basis of guilty by association. ",
