        "additional_details": "A full planning application has been submitted to Forest Heath DC by 'Water's Family' Suffolk County Council and Pigeon Investment for 131 dwellings located on land East of Beeches Road. This will also include over 40 affordable houses. There will be four new access roads to the development. This is just the first stage of the planned 500+ homes for the village. This village does not have the infrastructure to support this increase of residents. The pre and primary school are already unable to offer spaces to those in the village without increasing the village capacity. The roads are in poor state of repair with the current traffic volumes. Agricultural land should stay as that to maintain our rural Suffolk village life. We ask the government to take action and stop this proposal going any further. ",
