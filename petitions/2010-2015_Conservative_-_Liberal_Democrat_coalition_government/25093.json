        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, believe that proposals to \"open up\" patient health  and medical records to business, private health care providers, pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies, governments and others would be a breach of UK and international law.\r\n\r\nIf allowed to go ahead, this would enable such organisations and companies to prevent free movement, to discriminate in financial services, family life, and in employment.\r\n\r\nThey would be able to do this, because there are currently no safeguards in place that would enable the redaction, or anonymization of patient data, such as the postcode area in which they live that would ultimately allow them to be back-traced by such companies.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the potential for profiteering would result in exclusion and discrimination, which is far more important than any other issue.",
