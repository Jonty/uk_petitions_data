        "additional_details": "Imran Niazi, 18,  has been resident in the UK for four years. During that time he has become a much loved pupil at his secondary school in Queens Park and wants to complete his education at sixth form. He now faces deportation to Afghanistan where he believes his life will be at risk as it was when he was forced to flee. We believe the UK is his home and he has earned the right to stay here.",
