        "additional_details": "On Thursday 7th November 2013, my mother and dog Poppy were brutally and unexpectedly attacked by three dogs. They pulled my mother to the ground as she tried to protect our beloved pet. They then tore her away from her arms and mauled her.\r\n\r\nHer throat was ripped open. She was bitten more than 20 times. Her voice box was pierced. The vets say it is a miracle she survived.\r\n\r\nThe owners of the dogs fled the scene, only to own up hours later after a Facebook campaign.\r\n\r\nThe Police aren't interested and the dog warden will not take action because these dogs have never offended before.\r\n\r\nTHIS MUST CHANGE. We want assurance that these particular dogs will ALWAYS be MUZZLED when on public property in future.\r\n\r\nDoes an innocent animal, child or person have to die or be left with LIFE-CHANGING injuries like Poppy's before these dogs will be reprimanded?\r\n\r\nIf you want these dogs muzzled then please sign.\r\n\r\n ",
