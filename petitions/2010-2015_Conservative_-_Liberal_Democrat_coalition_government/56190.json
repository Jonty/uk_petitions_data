There is already a bed shortage in Kent for acute mental health patients  KMPT  have spent so far this year since April on out of area/private beds \u00a32.3 million twice that of last year and they still trying to reduce beds. Last year they had public consultations, which they stated they only required 150 beds in the whole of Kent, the data they used to establish this figure was flawed,they had to admit  at the scrutiny committee that they had made a catastrophic mistake and the figure should be 174.Even with 174 they will still have to go out of area/private beds two days out of ten, there is clearly  still be not enough beds and the closure of Medway block(35beds) will be a big mistake.\r\n, ",
