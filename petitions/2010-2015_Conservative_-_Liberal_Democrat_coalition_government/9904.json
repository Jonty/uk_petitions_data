On \"Today\" this morning, an incident was referred to where a mother demanded her boy go to school. The boy punched his mother in the face, and threatened her not to retaliate or he would make accusations to Social Workers and get her jailed.\r\nIn the context of a mushrooming gang culture, and rioting, we must hope that whatever discipline can be instilled within the home is freely administered and not inhibited. Nothing can be done until this peverse situation is reversed. Destructive and as we now see, dangerous energy must be confronted and nipped in the bud.",
