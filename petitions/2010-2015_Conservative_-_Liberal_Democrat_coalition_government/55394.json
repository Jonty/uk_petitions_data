As you move up the scale, organisers are obliged to provide greater prize money and the race and its stages attract more UCI points. All of that makes the event more attractive to top riders.\r\n\r\nNext year\u2019s race runs from September 7 to 14, and the organisers SweetSpot had requested the UCI increase its status from 2.1 to 2.HC, which would have given it equal status to the Tours of Turkey, Austria and Luxembourg.\r\nCan't we get some support to get a very good reason from the UCI as to why 'The Tour of Britain' is not a suitable candidate for an upgrade.",
