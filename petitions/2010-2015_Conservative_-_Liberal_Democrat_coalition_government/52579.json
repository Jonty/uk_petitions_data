        "additional_details": "Change the law in which electric bicycles are allowed on our roads. no restriction on speed, no restriction on power/watts, no tax disc to be displayed on electric bicycles of any wattage.A helmet to be only worn on roads, not on cycle paths or anywhere else pedal bikes are allowed, but must travel at a safe speed and manner when riding in these areas.\r\n\r\nOur transport needs are changing and the people and government need to change too, travel by car is becoming too expensive and a drain on the worlds natural resources.I believe a change in legislation to allow electric bicycles to travel at greater speeds and have less legislation to restrict use will make it more appealing for people to use them as a viable alternative to a car.\r\n\r\nIn safety aspects is similar too riding a non-electric powered bicycle, most cars can travel at a top speeds over 100mph, most of the time they travel at 30mph and below in town/city. ride to suit the road that you travel on.",
