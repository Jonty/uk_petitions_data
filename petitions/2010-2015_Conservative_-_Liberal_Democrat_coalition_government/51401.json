        "additional_details": "We petition for HM Government to introduce legislation for a Guaranteed Interview Scheme for all ex soldiers, sailors and airmen/women who have performed active service for their country such that for 6 months before discharge and for 12 months after discharge employers would be obliged to short list them for interview (or progress them to the second stage of selection).  This should be supported with a voluntary scheme promoted by the Government with all UK employers until the legislative framework can be implemented.",
