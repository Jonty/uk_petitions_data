        "additional_details": "This is a petition to make teaching at least one additional foreign language compulsory for primary school children in Britain. Britons have gained a reputation abroad as being lazy and ignorant when it comes to learning languages, whilst many residents in other European countries have at least a basic grasp of the English language. Languages not only assist young people in achieving high profile jobs, they are also vital to our communication skills and in learning about, and respecting, other cultures. It is essential that children begin learning an additional language from an early age as languages become increasingly difficult to learn later in life. Our 2012 Olympic athletes have shown that with hard work, we can achieve anything. Let's extend that determination to languages and further the reputation of excellence the Olympics brought to Britain.",
