        "additional_details": "Too often care workers are criticised and accused when things go wrong in care home and domiciliary settings when the problems are a result of exploitative cultural practises within the profession. Many care workers, who have the responsibility for human lives, are paid just above minimum wage - sometimes less than shop assistants and refuse collectors - and work very long hours with ever-diminishing resources as companies pare down staffing levels to maximise profits. In this environment low morale, poor performance and mistakes are inevitable. The Government should consider ways of changing this, beginning with a full and honest investigation into current practises in care.",
