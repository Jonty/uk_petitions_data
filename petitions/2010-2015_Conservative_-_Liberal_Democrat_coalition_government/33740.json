        "additional_details": "These days it is so hard to get an job thats why more and more people are causing crimes and try living on job seekers allowance or child benifits etc. We need more job offers out there and not make it so hard to get an job. This will stop people from causing bad things to happen and will work to earn the money they need. Me my self am a 16 year old student at college and it is very hard for my parents to send me to college. So i try being independent and getting an job my self but i can't and its the same exuses, ethier its am too young or don't have training or enough qualifications. This isn't fair on me and all the other people that are eager to work and earn. So i hope you can help me and everyone else and make UK an better place. Thank you.",
