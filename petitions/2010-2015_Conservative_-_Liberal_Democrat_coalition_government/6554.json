Any profit secured from production in her majesty's prisons be used in compensation schemes for victims of crime. Make it known to the criminal world that a prison sentence will only benefit victims. Sentence times to be increased for those refusing to work so that crime really does not pay...make it clear to society that the victims will benefit first before the personal interests of the criminal. In the interests of the criminal the balance of justice and redemption will be better served and a debt paid providing a better chance at reducing the desire to return to crime.",
