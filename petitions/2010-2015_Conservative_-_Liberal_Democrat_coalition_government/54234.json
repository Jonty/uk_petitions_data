No further British supplying, arming or funding of rebel groups in Syria.\r\n\r\nThe British government -and William Hague in particular- seems desparate to suck us into another bloody and costly war which Britain has no interest in and no desire to engage in.  William Hague is making many unfounded claims about who carried out the alleged chemical attack in Damuscus when no facts are available on what happened or who was involved and is dragging us towards military involvement.  If other nations wish to get involved in the Syrian war that is an issue for them, we do not want Britons dying or British funds used on this.\r\n\r\n",
