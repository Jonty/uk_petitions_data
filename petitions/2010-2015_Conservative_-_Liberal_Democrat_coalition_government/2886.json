There is sufficient evidence that violence, drug abuse, racial hatred and other criminal acts are commonplace among their ranks during rallies across the UK. There is also evidence of members encouraging acts of arson and assault to Muslim people and property. Lastly, the EDL was referenced by the perpetrator of the recent terror attacks in Norway.\r\n\r\nUnder the Terrorism Act 2000 - a group can be banned if it \"commits or participates in acts of terrorism, prepares for, promotes or encourages terrorism or is otherwise concerned in terrorism\".",
