        "additional_details": "I drive to work and I'm peturbed by the number of road users who misuse their lights when one of their headlight bulbs has expired. In 5 days of (January 2015) I have encountered at least 40 of these drivers. I believe these drivers if caught more than once should be punished. Many of them drive expensive cars, so surely cost is not an issue.\r\n\r\nI quote from the highway code Rule 114:- \"You MUST NOT\r\nuse any lights in a way which would dazzle or cause discomfort to other road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders\r\nuse front or rear fog lights unless visibility is seriously reduced. You MUST switch them off when visibility improves to avoid dazzling other road users\r\nLaw RVLR reg 27\"\r\n\r\nIf you agree that these selfish drivers, if caught more than once, should be punished in line with other similar offences, feel that these people may cause an accident and ultimately are sick of being dazzled, please sign this e-petition.",
