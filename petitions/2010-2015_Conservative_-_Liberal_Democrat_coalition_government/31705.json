IBM have successfully lobbied the DVLA for sensitive information - including addresses, dates of birth, registration plate numbers, and credit card details - to be off shored as part of the company's contract to run the London congestion charge for Transport for London.  Leaving the very sensitive data open to unscrupulous people and losing valuable UK jobs.\r\nThe Government should stop any off shoring sensitive information by companies who are running Government computer facilities.\r\n",
