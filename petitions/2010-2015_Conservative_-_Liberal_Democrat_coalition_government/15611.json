        "action": "Remove the \"bulk rubbish\" fee in central London",
        "additional_details": "Westminster has introduced few years ago the charge for \"bulk rubbish\" transforming our streets into dumping grounds as people try to avoid the \u00a320 fee.  An increasing numbers of fridges, TVs, washing machines, mattresses and wardrobes (including mirrors and glass shelving) is being dumped in the streets making them undecent and unsafe. Especially for kids or at night.  This petition asks to revert to the previous collection service allowing three collections a year per household. ______________________________________________________ MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD by signing this petition......................
