The events of the last few days in Tottenham and elsewhere have been anything but. There is no underlying desire for change behind these riots, it is pure opportunism to cause chaos and violence. It is time for the silk glove to come off and the iron fist to come down hard and fast on those responsible.\r\n\r\nI propose, changing whatever laws necessary to ensure that anyone found guilty of any riot related offence from the last few days serve a long prison sentence and that the police in future should be faster to act on such events and have the freedom to use different riot control equipment (water cannons, tear gas etc.)",
