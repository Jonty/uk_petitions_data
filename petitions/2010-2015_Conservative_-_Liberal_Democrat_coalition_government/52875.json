        "additional_details": "Hammersmith & Fulham Council is consulting local residents and schools on proposals to amalgamate two primary schools in Fulham to create a new combined school with better facilities on a single site.\r\nIf the amalgamation were to go ahead, it would also free up a site that we propose to make available to a new secondary free school, in line with the council's Schools of Choice agenda.\r\nWe would like local people, and everyone at the schools affected, to have their say at the earliest opportunity. Your views are crucial to developing these proposals and we welcome any questions or suggestions you have.\r\n\r\nReasons for the primary school amalgamation\r\nBoth New King's and Sulivan schools are small compared with some other primary schools in the borough. New King's primary has 30 places per year and Sulivan has 45 places per year. The combined school would have 60 places per year (two forms of entry).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
