        "additional_details": "We are horrified that the publicly-owned banks (RBS, Lloyds, Nat West) are to be permitted to stop basic bank account holders from using their ATMs unless they are customers. Basic account holders often live in rural areas with one ATM, are on the breadline, have a poor credit history and/or other problems that stop them from choosing a different kind of account. We want the banks to be forced to withdraw this move.",
