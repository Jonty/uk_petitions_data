        "additional_details": "\u00a3250,000 is far too low for the 3% stamp duty to start at.  Average house prices in the South East are around \u00a3200,000 so the 3% stamp duty hits the lower wage earners.  The threshold for the 1% to increase to 3% should be raised to \u00a3500,000.  I would like the Government to fix the rate at a more realistic level of 1% right across the board as this rate would then encourage house purchases, help the building trade, DIY stores, furniture stores etc.",
