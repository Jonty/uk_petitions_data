        "additional_details": "Brighton & Hove Council are apparently sympathetic to a planning application from Soho House to build a private members club on Brighton seafront at the end (inter alia) of Camelford Street.  The proposed building will rise for a whole storey above the historic seafront and railings completely destroying the seaview so valued by residents and visitors alike.  Please sign the petition to say that you are against this proposal being permitted.  It must not be allowed to rise above the level of the road (A259).  Thank you",
