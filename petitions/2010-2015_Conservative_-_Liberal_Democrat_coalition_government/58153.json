Why is it acceptable for our representatives to behave so appaulingly when sitting in the House of Commons. Everyone in the chamber has been democratically voted in and should therefore be heard without having to shout above the childish noises that are made by other MP's. Imagine a presentation in a board room and a Director starting to boo at the presenter; it wouldnt happen and if it did questions about the individuals mental health would be raised.\r\n\r\nMP's grow up, listen to the person speaking, answer the question or state you dont know the answer then sit down and shut up",
