        "additional_details": "With the current economic climate anything that generates money for the country has GOT to be a good thing. There is no reason why old registration plates on vehicles that have been scrapped for more than 20 years, or plates that have NEVER been issued should not be re-issued.\r\nI propose that ANY old plate should be made available for the public to buy.\r\nThis would generate literally MILLIONS for the treasury and would also help spin-off businesses.",
