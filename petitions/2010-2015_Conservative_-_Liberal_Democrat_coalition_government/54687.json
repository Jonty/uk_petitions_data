        "additional_details": "DEFRA's functionality includes animal welfare and science.Both have been denied,within ministerial knowledge, to achieve the badger cull.The resources to insure monitoring and humaneness are so low as to be insignificant as is the level of inspection of corpses which amounts to 3% of bodies (selected by cullers).In failing to undertake autopsies on ANY carcasses to assess TB infection and strains of TB DEFRA are also denying the science required to undertake more culls.DEFRA risk local extinction of badgers by basing the 70% requirement on such loose population figures that 5000 deaths(on piece work)could illiminate populations in contravention of international law thus bringing the UK into disrepute.We ask that Parliament debates the above matters which bring DEFRA and the UK into disrepute.",
