        "action": "Wind turbines should be exempt from VAT",
        "additional_details": "Our country is the windiest country in Europe, we receive 40% of all the wind in Europe. It is baffling with those statistics that the Government isn't doing much in the way of helping people and communities purchase wind turbines. One big problem is that wind turbines attract VAT. This pushes prices up for small scale wind turbines by a significant degree.\r\n\r\nIf wind turbines became exempt from VAT then it would make them more affordable to the mass market, meaning that more people would be likely to buy them. Thus reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and making energy bills far cheaper. ",
