They have their pension. Medals earned and experiences no civilian could imagine.\r\nThe cost of the medal is not warranted and simply is not required.\r\nWe all volunteered for military, with a few being made to do national service. However they left when their time was up.\r\nStop this waste of money medal, and wear what you deserve. We're British. Unlike many counties we wear what we've earned. Not just having racks for the sake of it. ",
