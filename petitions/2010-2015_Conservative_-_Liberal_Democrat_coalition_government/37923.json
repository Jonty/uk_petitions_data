        "additional_details": "The US-based National Snow and Ice Data Center announced this week that the Arctic sea ice has hit its lowest extent ever recorded.  Set against this is a political debate around airport expansion and construction in this country that is being framed almost exclusively in economic terms with scant regard to environmental implications.  In the drive to reenergise the economy, the urgent need to act on climate change has been pushed to the fringes of the mainstream political debate.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, have regard to the clear need to act to revitalise the UK economy and support environmentally sound and sustainable means of achieving this.  We, the undersigned, also urge the Government to invest more widely in technology and infrastructure that will help individuals and business reduce their carbon footprint and act as an exemplar to other countries in reducing their carbon footprint in order to tackle what will be the most significant challenge to our continued survival.",
