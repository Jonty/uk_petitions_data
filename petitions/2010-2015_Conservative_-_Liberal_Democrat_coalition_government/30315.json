        "additional_details": "I believe that those on long term benefits who are capable of work should have their benefits ( or the majority of their benefits)paid in vouchers. I believe this would encourage the \"work-shy\" to look that bit harder for work of they require\"cold hard cash\". The vouchers would be used to pay for supermarket shopping, paying utility bills, etc. The vouchers could only be cashed when presenting a form of ID that would need to be created in order to use the vouchers. The cost of ID recognition software would be met by those who would benefit from the use of these vouchers. ie; Supermarkets, utility bill companies,etc.\r\nPeople seem to be \"better off \" on benefits, so I feel that the voucher scheme would encourage people to apply for more positions in order to acquire cash to spend.\r\nObviously this would need to be made fraud proof, but once again that cost would be met by the big companies who will gain from the use of the vouchers.",
