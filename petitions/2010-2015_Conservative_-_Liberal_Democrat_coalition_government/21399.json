        "additional_details": "We have a lot of foreign visitors to the UK who rely on our NHS when needing treatment not just hospital but also dentist or doctors treatment which the UK taxpayer has paid for all their working lives so that we have treatment when required.\r\nThe resources are being drained by foreign visitors who use our NHS at our cost!  Should we go outside the UK we all need health insurance or we have to pay the bill, no other country is as generous as the UK ie you couldn\u2019t take a holiday to Australia or the USA while being in the last stages of pregnancy and have your baby at their cost, but you can in the UK and save money.\r\nDemand health insurance of any foreign visitor before they enter the UK to pay for their own treatment.  The NHS belongs to the people of the UK not foreign visitors.\r\n",
