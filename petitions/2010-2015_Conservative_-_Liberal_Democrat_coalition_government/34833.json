Please sign this petition if you agree the media should tell the truth and that; 1. The only photos used in such stories should be of the offending dog. 2  Only the correct breed of dog should be named. 3  If it\u2019s a cross breed or coming from an unknown background then the word \u2018mongrel\u2019 should be used to describe the offending dog. 4 For the media not to use the word \u2018type\u2019 as it is only an opinion and is very often used incorrectly in its description of the dog. 5  When reporting/describing a Kennel Club registered breed as the offending dog (ie Rottweiler, Staffordshire Bull Terrier ect) the media should have proof of its breed with legitimate registration papers.  If the dog is not registered with the correct KC documentation then it is a \u2018mongrel\u2019 and that is the correct word that should be used by the media to describe the dog.",
