        "additional_details": "Dear Minister,\r\nI live in the town of Cranbrook, Kent, which has a 7,000 inhabitants and which is  covered by Tunbridge Wells Borough Council. The council never listens to Cranbrook residents except when it feels that it absolutely has to, never spends Cranbrook residents' council tax on things that Cranbrook needs, such as a community centre,(claiming that this is unaffordable) and does not care. Yet a \u00a350000 Christmas lunch apparently is affordable. AND WE ARE NOT ALONE. Towns, villages and small communities across the country are being ignored by borough councils who have absolutely nothing to do with them and who  JUST DON'T CARE. I urge you give the Government powers to step in if they think a community is being neglected and punish the local council responsible. I am fed up of my town and others like it being neglected and uncared about by borough councils, and I urge the Government to do something about it.",
