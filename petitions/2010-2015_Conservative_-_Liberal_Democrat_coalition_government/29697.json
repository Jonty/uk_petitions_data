        "additional_details": "I'd like to readdress the balance of nudity on TV. Today, women are hugely exploited, with bare breasts being practically obligatory and total nudity being common in adult drama. Conversely, equivalent amounts of male nudity are rare, assuming you accept that the bare male chest is NOT the sexual equivalent of the female bare chest, and therefore deeming bare male genitals as being the only fair equivalent of any bare female sexual organs (breasts being included). Why should female actresses have to face regular demands for nudity and male actors hardly at all? I don't call for a ban of female nudity, simply and increase in the demands on male nudity to redress the balance.",
