There has been a significant number of deaths and injuries along this road.(Between 99-2010 15 deaths, 16 injuries, BBC Accident Map and further details are on www.crashmap.co.uk) Because of the increased volume and now GPS speed limited lorries people are taking more risks when over taking. There are more and more vehicles using this route, it needs to be dual carriagway, the ENTIRE length. Our roads quite simply need more capacity.\r\nThere is obviously a green issue that will be raised, but as oil vanishes, the green car will appear and we will still need the capacity. ",
