        "additional_details": "When a private sector housing tenant encounters a defect(s) with their property, the landlord is obligated to ensure that repairs are carried out, principally under section 11, Landlord and Tenant Act 1985.\r\n\r\nIf a landlord fails to carry out obligatory repairs, a tenant can submit a referral form to their local council Housing Regeneration Team to request an assessment of the defect(s).\r\n\r\nThanet District Council\u2019s Housing Regeneration Team is in place to ensure that any necessary repairs are carried out to the property.  The department would rather serve a Hazard Awareness Notice instead of an Improvement Notice as the council is financially liable to pursue a landlord through the County Court should he/she fail to carry out essential repairs after an Improvement Notice has been served.\r\n\r\nIt is asked of the Government to assess Thanet District Council's Housing Regeneration Team and whether it is fit for purpose.",
