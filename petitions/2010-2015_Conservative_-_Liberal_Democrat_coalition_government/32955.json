        "additional_details": "For too long, the cruelty of the race has been blithely ignored by the horse-racing authorities and the race-going public.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn\u2019t be like this. Sport, after all, is meant to be an uplifting activity, reflecting the quest for excellence and heroism in competition. But there is nothing remotely inspirational or heroic about forcing horses to gallop round a dangerous course at high speed and risk sustaining painful, even fatal falls.\r\n\r\nIn the Grand National alone, ten horses have been killed since 2000. And last month, the Cheltenham race meeting was overshadowed by the death of five horses.\r\n\r\nWe would not tolerate this callous approach towards human competitors.\r\n\r\nThe Grand National and the horse racing world in general needs a complete overhaul.\r\nPLEASE either reform The Grand National ASAP or it should be BANNED completely!\r\n\r\nAs this is Legalised Animal Abuse!",
