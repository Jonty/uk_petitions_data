        "action": "Repeal the mandatory minimum sentence of five years for firearm possession",
        "additional_details": "Someone simply possessing a firearm in their own home does not make them a threat to society, needing jail time on par with a violent criminal. Seeing as how there is no victim involved, the current sentencing rules on unlicenced firearm possession are disproportionate, hidiously draconian and make a mockery of the role of judges in sentencing.\r\n\r\nThis has produced many notable injustices including the lengthy imprisonment of many otherwise law-abiding people who have come into possession or simply retained firearms as wall hangers and antique relics after the various recent amendments restricting them. Although in some cases judges have been able to use the 'exceptional circumstances' exemption, this only applies in very rare cases and still usually reflects the otherwise mandatory sentence, remaing highly disproportionate (eg, four years instead of five).\r\n\r\nPart. 5 of The Criminal Justice Act 2003 should be repealed immediately.",
