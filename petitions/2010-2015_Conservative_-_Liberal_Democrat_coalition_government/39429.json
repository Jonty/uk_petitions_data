        "additional_details": "I want HMG to have an independent, public, Judicial Enquiry into the on-street grooming and sexual abuse of white girls by Asian men in the North of England between 1990 and 2012. The Enquiry would have the power to compel witnesses to attend and all witnesses would give evidence under oath.\r\nThis is NOT the same as a similar petition as the petitioner wishes to confine it to South Yorkshire and relates to all child sexual abuse instead of on-street grooming. He also fails to ensure it covers areas outwith of South Yorkshire and does not give any time periods over which the abuse has occurred.",
