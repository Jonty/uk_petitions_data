        "additional_details": "Parking fines need to be proportional to the costs. A lamppost bulb is the same price regardless of the city or town and parking should also reflect that, it is unfair that one city charges \u00a32 for a day and another city charges \u00a32 per hour. Street signs need to be easy to understand. I have seen several parking signs that have confused me. A parking attendant informed me that a sign basically meant 20 min only. Instead of having 1 sign saying 20 min parking only there were 2 signs with different days and different times of operation. Changes to street parking need to be provided to the public in advance to insure they are aware of what is changing and when. It is bad customer service and shows incompetence of the council to simply make changes and then issue fines, stating that there was a sign in place on a lamppost that was so far above head level you never saw it when parking up.",
