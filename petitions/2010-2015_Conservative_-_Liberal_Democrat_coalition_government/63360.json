        "additional_details": "I am proposing a ban on smoking outside any major train stations in London.\r\n     I am a fifteen year old school girl who travels to and from school via London Victoria five days a week and I find myself coughing quite painfully as the smoke attacks my lungs and the disgusting smell remains in my nose throughout the day. I see many students of a similar age, some of whom I know  feel the same as myself, having to walk past the dozens of smokers and it upsets me to know what the habits of others is doing to our health. About 100,000 people a year die in the UK due to smoking and it can cause cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart disease. As the adults of the future, should we not strive to keep us as healthy as possible and set the example to make our world a better place?\r\n     All I ask is that you think about the impact of smoke on our health and society, and get signing today.
