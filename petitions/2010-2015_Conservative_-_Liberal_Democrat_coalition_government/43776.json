This is because the risks are considered to be too great. Make it a criminal offence not to pay rent and improve the eviction process for none payers and this will attract further investment into the sector, particularly the need for shared accommodation for single under 35's claiming benefits. Without these changes the housing crisis will get worse as much needed specialist developments for this type of accommodation will not be considered to be viable. The Government say they need support from the PRS. This needs to be reciprocated if it is to work. Further discussion and details here >>> http://www.property118.com/?p=34928",
