        "additional_details": "Nystagmus is characterised by an involuntary movement of the eyes, which often seriously reduces vision. In the UK many people with nystagmus can register as sight impaired; few can drive a car; most encounter some difficulties in everyday life - both practical and social - and some lose out on education and employment opportunities.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is no funding for nystagmus research, even though more and more people are being diagnosed.\r\nI have got nystagmus and typing this has taken me alot of time and has caused me a big headache\r\n\r\nWe want the government to provide funding for reaserch\r\n",
