        "additional_details": "Chancellor George Osborne plans to give HMRC new powers to recover HMRC debts.The new powers would allow HMRC to seize money it is owed directly from individuals/companies bank accounts, building society accounts, and Individual Savings Accounts (ISA's) without a court order or trial.\r\n\r\nSuch powers would effectively make HMRC judge and jury which is in direct contravention of Articles 3, 5, 6 and 7 of the Human Rights Act.\r\n\r\nThose who sign this petition oppose powers being given to HM Revenue & Customs to seize money it is owed directly from bank accounts without a fair trial in a court of law.",
