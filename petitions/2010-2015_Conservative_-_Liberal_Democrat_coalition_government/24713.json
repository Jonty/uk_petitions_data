WHY can't we have a realistic National Insurance Contribution which is sufficient, without the need for 'top-up' benefits and so deliver a reasonable and comfortable retirement to everyone who pays into it?.  Yes, it would be more expensive but it would be viable and equitable, regardless of whether a person is privately, publicly or self-employed.  Those who wish, can still make extra private and personal arrangements.\r\n",
