If not a \u00a3200 fine will be given.\r\n\r\nThis will stop fraud of dogs being sold on with micro chip, calling the police to claiming back the dog they sold.\r\n\r\nIf you need to re-home your animal you will also need to inform the office of Name and Address of new home. A mark will then go on your name to inform them you have re-homed for this reason\r\n(Housing, Loss of job etc)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
