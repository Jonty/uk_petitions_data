These crimes can be anything from assaults and threats to acts of criminal damage.\r\nIt is proposed that, where it can be proven that the offender was motivated in committing the crime by hate, solely on the victim's role as a Public employee, that the crime should be classified as Hate Related and the offender charged and sentenced as such.\r\nThe proposal is to treat the victim's role as a Public employee the same as where that victim a victim of homophobic, racist, sexist, religiously aggravated or disability targeted crime.\r\nThis legislation would offer protection to staff both on and off duty and offer support in the pursuit of their work.\r\n\r\nThis expands on the current petition on Crimes against the Police\r\n",
