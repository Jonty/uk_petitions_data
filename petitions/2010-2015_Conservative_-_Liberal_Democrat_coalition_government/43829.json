        "additional_details": "Children, especially those under the age of 7, create intolerable noise pollution, at extremely loud volumes and unpredictable frequencies. Other patrons of restaurants, bars and cafes have often had pleasant sessions ruined by such noise. Everyone pays the same amount of service, but many people's enjoyment's of the establishment are marred by other people's children's noise. This is obviously unfair. I propose that children younger than age 7 are vetoed by cafes and bars at all times.",
