Let's give magistrates the power to tax offenders by magistrates being able to adjust individuals tax codes or reduce state benefits.  If magistrates have powers to effectively tax offenders using their tax code or state benefits, they won't have disposable income to drink - we also might be able as a country to repay our debts or reduce taxes for law abiding citizens.",
