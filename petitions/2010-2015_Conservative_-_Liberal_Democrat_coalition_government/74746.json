The school is expanding and in the light of the accident on 9/2/15 which devastatingly  claimed several lives something must be done on such a busy road, speed bumps or chicanes will not be sufficient.\r\nMany parents cross town to deliver and collect children, and Lansdown Lane is a popular rat run from upper Lansdown Road into Weston village, which has two primary schools, Weston All Saints and Saint Mary's catholic primary school.\r\nThere are also a number of nurseries and pre-prep schools in the area.\r\nParents use the narrow hilly lane to take children from Weston to schools in Lansdown, including Saint Stephens primary school, Kingswood and the Royal High School, thereby avoiding the city traffic during rush hour.\r\nWe the undersigned want action to be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
