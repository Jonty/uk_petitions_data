The head is but a small (abeit crucial) part of the human body.\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce motorcycle fatalities and serious injury, the wearing of full, protective clothing should be mandatory on all combustion engine bikes.\r\n\r\nFailure to wear full armour should result in the same penalty as not wearing a helmet.
