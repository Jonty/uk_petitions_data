Further beliefs such as Fundamentalist creationism will be dominant and as such we should not respect their ability to make reasoned decision concerning extradition and foreign policy where this affects UK citizens. Diplomatic ties should be loosened to allow the UK the freedom to act as an intelligent nation free from the dictates of a foreign church",
