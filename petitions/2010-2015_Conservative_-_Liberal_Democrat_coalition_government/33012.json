        "additional_details": "Alan Turing was one of the greatest minds of the last century. Without him the Digital Age may not have ocurred, or would have been very different. He was pivotal in our wartime success due to his Enigma code breaking work at Bletchley Park. Founder of Computer Science, which society not depends on.\r\n\r\nHe is not well known however. Such an important figure should be known to the young. As such, I propose that he be integrated into school history syllabus's when students are studying wartime activities.",
