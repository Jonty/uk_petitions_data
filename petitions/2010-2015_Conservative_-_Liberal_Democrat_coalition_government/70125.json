This continued reference suggests legitimate geography and statehood and further slurs the Islamic faith by association.\r\n\r\nThis petition requests that henceforth the British Government will adopt alternate language when referencing this group such that the Britain is clear and unequivocal in expressing no acceptance of them; either as state or by affiliation to Islam.",
