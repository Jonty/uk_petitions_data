        "additional_details": "With the increase of transport on the Motorways and the reduction of Police on the motorways, employ CCTV cameras to identify and convict middle lane hoggers.  Driving without due care and attention is an offence.  The middle lane is for overtaking and to cruise this lane at anything less than 70mph allowing undertaking to occur or forcing other drivers to cross to the outside lane from the inside lane just to overtake a slow driver in the middle lane creates frustration and worse still congestion.",
