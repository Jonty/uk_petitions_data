        "additional_details": "Transport companies, such as airlines suffer the disadvantage of not having the same possibilities of purchase abroad as foreign companies do at home. Recently 49% of Virgin Altantic was sold to Delta Airlines. When Virgin America was set up Virgin Group was specifically prohibited from having 25% of the new company nor having any management role whatsoever.\r\n\r\nWe demand the British Government applies a strict policy of reciprocity in the purchase of any British infrasructure company by outside interests even if these are are stricter than European regulations in force. Thus Delta Airlines will be limited to 25% of Virgin Atlantic with immediate effect.",
