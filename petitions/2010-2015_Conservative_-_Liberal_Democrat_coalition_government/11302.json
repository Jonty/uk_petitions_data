        "additional_details": "It is time for teachers to be allowed to discipline unruly pupils without fear of reprisal.\r\n\r\nThe lawlessness on the streets this last week have shown that we need greater discipline.  Children spend most of their time at school and in the absence of parents teachers should be allowed to discipline the children.\r\n\r\nDuring holiday time schools should be open with council run holiday camps allowing the kids to have somewhere to go and not have them on the streets.\r\n\r\nItems such as IPODS, IPADS, mobile phones should be banned from school, in cases of emergency there is the school office.\r\n\r\nFor everyday your child is truant let's deduct a day of that child's benefit payment.\r\n\r\nI want the government to protect our teachers and allow them to teach and discipline children.  Let's increase discipline in schools and create a strong foundation upon which to base society.\r\n\r\nFor everyday your child is truant let's deduct a day of that child's benefit payment.\r\n",
