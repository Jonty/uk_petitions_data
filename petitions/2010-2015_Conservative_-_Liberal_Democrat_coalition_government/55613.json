        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, object to the planning application number PA/13/02108 (London Borough of Tower Hamlets) on the grounds that if the original retail units are adapted to residential homes. The result,\r\n\r\nPalmers Road is already very densely populated under the approved plans. This variation will increase this density even further causing a strain on already stretched services like rubbish disposal (http://www.flickr.com/photos/99266062@N06/).\r\n\r\nAt the start of Palmers Rd there are several work & living unit/studio from galleries to photo studio. Previous planning permission was allowed for Suttons Wharf North retail unit, which were converted to homes, has caused problems - please refer to the first link. Thanks.",
