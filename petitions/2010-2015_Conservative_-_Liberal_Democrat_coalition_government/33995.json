The provisional IRA have been controlling the flow of drugs for years in northern Ireland and the shooting, maiming and murder being carried out by this group is not about stopping drug use or its supply it is about maintaining their market and their control of it.  This is a direct result of current Government policies that foster miss trust and fear of drugs and promote hatred based on lies and governmental misinformation that allows people to use the drug harm lies to promote hatred.  The group 'Republicans against drugs'. have been operating for around four years with out any real attempt to find its members or jail them over the murders, maiming and punishment shootings they are carrying out.  It is time the state acted against them and made it clear their actions are unexeptable in a civilised society/country.",
