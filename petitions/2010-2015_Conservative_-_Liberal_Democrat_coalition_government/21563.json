It is a disgrace that a public body such as the BBC wastes resources promoting private companies in this way and they should be required to stop doing so.\r\nAside from the occasional 'special interest' broadcast the BBC should stop promoting these companies during news and current affairs broadcasts.\r\nThe BBC should encourage amateur and 'grass-roots' sports engagement not act as the advertising and marketing arm for an elitist and multi-billion pound industry.",
