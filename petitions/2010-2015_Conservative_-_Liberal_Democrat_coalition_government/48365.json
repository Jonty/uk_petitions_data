        "additional_details": "MPs should take part in 2 weeks grassroots work experience every year.\r\n\r\nMPs would be placed in voluntary and public sector organisations that work directly with the most vulnerable members of our society. MPs would work at the ground level to experience the reality of their policy making. This would give our representatives a greater insight into what it is like to live in poverty, in fear of violence, with mental health issues etc.\r\n\r\nAnnual grassroots experience would improve policy making, enable people who are socially excluded to have a voice and increase our MPs accountability.\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition to make this proposal a reality.
