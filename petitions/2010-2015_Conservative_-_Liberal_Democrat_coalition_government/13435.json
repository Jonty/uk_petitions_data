        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the implementation of a comprehensive nationwide policy that enables young people with eating disorders, to access appropriate treatment, services and education within their community. Eating disorders are not diets, they are complex illnesses which develop as coping mechanisms for serious underlying issues, many of which are sourced from negative life experiences. Neither are they socially constrictive - boys as young as five have been diagnosed with bulimia. Young people nationwide are not being able to access important resources due to their geographical location, some cross counties to access appropriate services. A comprehensive policy linking residential treatment, GP services, outreach services, appropriately trained care staff, nutrition/body-image/self-esteem lessons in schools, support for eating disorder survivors and awareness campaigns of the severe consequences, would provide for a healthier future for so many young people and children.\r\n",
