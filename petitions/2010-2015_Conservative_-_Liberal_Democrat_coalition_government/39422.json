You should not need to fight the benefit agency also.\r\nUnfortunately I was diagnosed in March 2011 I knew had a battle on my hands. On turning to the benefits agency for financial support to who I have contributed to all my working life I had another fight on my hands and one I did not want or need. I was just looking for financial support for my family to help pay bills and survive; only to find my dealings with the benefit agency was more stressful and emotional draining than cancer itself. At least with cancer you have plan a knowing of what to expect!!!!!\r\n\r\nPlease help support cancer patients and take away the financial burden the fight is hard enough.\r\n",
