Many cannot see properly and will drive through red lights and over crossings when people are crossing the road. A law should be bought in, that every driver should take a driving test at 70 and every two years there after, this should be compulsory. If they fail the test, the licence should be taken away. The roads need to be safer for all drivers and pedestrian",
