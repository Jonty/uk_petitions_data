        "additional_details": "Looking for a Ban on Rental Guarantor & Fees for people on low income, and make private renting more accessible.\r\nA lot of letting agents are asking people on a low income or who get LHA to have a Guarantor for a property that they want to rent as well as paying 1 Months deposit & 1 Months\u2019 Rent in advance & and expect the Guarantor to have 3 x the rental amount set aside every month just in case the rent is not paid. Not everyone can get a Guarantor as some people are not so fortunate to have the help off any one.\r\nLetting agents need to be advising landlords on this and be more open to LHA as there are a lot more people that get LHA from all walks of life. HB is not what it used to be with all the cuts and savings that are happening in the UK.\r\n",
