This is nonsense and should be treated as such.  The problem is that too often we concentrate on human rights without thinking about our responsibilities as citizens of a democracy.  I propose instead that the Government EXPANDS the Human Rights Act to include responsibilities as well as rights.  These should include:\r\nthe responsibility to look out for one's neighbours;\r\nthe responsibility to vote;\r\nthe responsibility to educate oneself as well as possible;\r\nthe responsibility to try to support oneself through one's own work;\r\nthe responsibility to do nothing to make one's neighbours lives worse; and\r\nthe responsibility to make no attempt to avoid paying one's proper taxes even if the methods used are not otherwise illegal.",
