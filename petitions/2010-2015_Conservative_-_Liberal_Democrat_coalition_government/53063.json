        "additional_details": "I propose a new law which would bring back the dog licence. Also this law would include all dogs and puppies to be added to a national database. This would help enable for dogs and their owners to be acccountable and a census of all breeds and population of them to be accessible. .\r\n\r\nI suggest that the licence would NOT be transferable from owner to owner. If the dog is sold on then the next owner would have to licence it also or a penalty incurred. Puppies should also be microchipped before leaving the breeder and a form of ownership be filled in. I believe this would help cut down back street breeding, dog baiting and dogs been passed around in general.\r\n\r\nI think if this law was managed properly, the funding went back into animal welfare where people could see the good that it could, do the public would support it and it would be effective.\r\n.",
