Fair enough, Public Sector Pensions may need looking at, but all current members, who decided on whether or not to join the scheme offered, should retain their pensions on what was offered, and what they signed up for.\r\n\r\nPoints which must be retained are:\r\n1) Their pensions must be paid out on the dates/members ages that they currently do.\r\n2) Their contributions must remain at the current level, and if higher levels are offered, then they must be reflected in the value of the pensions received\r\n3) Should Public Sector Pensions be altered, they must be for new members only. Current members must not have their terms altered.",
