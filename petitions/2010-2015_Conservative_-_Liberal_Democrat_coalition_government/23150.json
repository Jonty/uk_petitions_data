The current level of business throughout the UK will see businesses fail at an alarming rate in the New Year if nothing is done. A reduction in the rate of VAT will help stimulate growth across all sectors. The result for the Treasury will be increased revenue (a smaller per percentage, but of a much larger Pot!). The UK Economy will grow faster, Businesses will be saved, and Jobs created. It needs to be done, and it needs to be done now!",
