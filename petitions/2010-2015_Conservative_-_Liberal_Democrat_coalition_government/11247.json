        "additional_details": "The technology available to the nation at this very point allows us to gain greater democratic freedom. The very technology which allows this very e-petition to exist. Thee power of the internet could be harnessed by designing a e-voting system, which will enable the nation easy and affordable access to voting on any decisions. This would mean referendums would be more financially viable, and in turn give people a greater voice and ability to run their own country. Greater political voice to each individual would bring this country closer to being a true democracy, much like the one demonstrated upon the acropolis in ancient athens. This petition would put power to run the country back in the peoples hands and out of the politicians, while maintaining a democratic state. It would avoid too much power being with one person, and avoid mistakes from individuals, and take into account the majority consensus of the nation on controversial debates.    ",
