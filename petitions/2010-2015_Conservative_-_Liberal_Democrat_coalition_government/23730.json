        "additional_details": "It is apparent that the retail price of petrol varies from area to area, sometimes within the same city, but all retailers in that area charge more or less the same price. THERE IS LITTLE, IF ANY, COMPETITION. Even different branches of the same supermarket charge different prices for petrol at different outlets, depending on the going price for that locality. This must be unique to petrol. So why is it allowed? It cannot be that the unit cost of petrol to the retailer varies significantly from one place to another, except in the remotest areas. If all retailers in one district can set the price by agreement, it is anti-competitive, and is at the local consumer's expense. You're not going to drive miles to find cheaper fuel. If supermarkets are forced to set their prices nationally, it must be easier to ensure there is true competition.   ",
