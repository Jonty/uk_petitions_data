        "additional_details": "Every person who works within the NHS , regardless of race ,  should have to follow all rules and regulations , regarding hygiene and dress code . You can't have rules for one religion and not another , when it's people health and lives that are at stake . Those rules are there to protect and save lives of patients . It's disgusting that Muslims are going to be allowed to wear bangles and long sleeve clothing when it's obviously a health risk , will they disinfect there bangles regularly through out the day , I seriously doubt it , long sleeves will get in the way of doing certain jobs , and collect germs . It will undoubtedly put people's lives at risk . This should not be allowed under any circumstances ! ",
