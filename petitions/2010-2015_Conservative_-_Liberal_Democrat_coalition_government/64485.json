        "additional_details": "Everton FC are looking to build a new stadium. While it's important for the club, fans and the city of Liverpool the suggested space is the wonderful green parkland of Walton Hall Park\r\n\r\nWalton hall park is a lovely clean well kept green space. There is a play ground which has newly been refurbished.  There is a sports hall which has also newly been refurbished. There are new 3G pitches for football as well larger pitches on the green space. There is lovely open areas for children and pets to play along with well established trees and two lakes which contribute to the wildlife within the park\r\n\r\nWalton Hall Park contributes to the local community and it would be of great detriment to all if it was lost to the building of a new football stadium\r\n\r\nPlease sign to support the local community and park ",
