        "additional_details": "Our Government's decision on Russia means British dairy farmers are about to face a catastrophic collapse in milk prices.\r\n\r\nStocks of cheese and butter have dramatically increased.\r\n\r\nFarmers For Action www.farmersforaction.org suggest the Government should distribute the product to the needy through food banks.\r\nLogistically this could be done; all it needs is a 'can do' attitude by those in a position to help.\r\n\r\nWith winter around the corner, we are sure that those less fortunate than ourselves would appreciate a plentiful supply of cheese and milk throughout the coming winter months to help feed themselves and their families.\r\n\r\nNutritionally, milk has been defined as the most nearly perfect food and provides more essential nutrients in significant amounts than any other single food.  Why leave it in storage when it could make so many lives that little bit more bearable, and help the British dairy industry through this difficult time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
