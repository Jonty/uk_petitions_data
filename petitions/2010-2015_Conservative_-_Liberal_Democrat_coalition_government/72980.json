        "additional_details": "This petition advocates the end to the prohibition of Illegal Drugs, the legalisation and regulation of soft drugs such as Cannabis, and the decriminalisation of all other drugs listed under the \"Misuse of Drugs Act 1971\".\r\n\r\nWe would have the end of charges for possession and use of illicit substances, and the advocation of treatment for drug addicts rather than punishment.\r\n\r\nWe would also have Cannabis legalised and regulated, (Such as the actions taken in Colorado) which will not only see an increase in Revenues through taxation but also a decrease in crime. It could also see the Government reduce the deficit by \u00a31.25 billion.\r\n\r\nFor information regarding the legalisation of Cannabis and decriminalisation of other illicit substances visit: http://www.clear-uk.org/\r\nhttp://norml-uk.org/\r\nAnd watch the documentaries: \"The Culture High\" and \"The Union: The Business Behind Getting High\".",
