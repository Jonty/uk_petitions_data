        "additional_details": "Create Wildlife River Buffer Zones. These zones would be left to nature and run alongside rivers. The zone size would be open to debate but should be sized to help protect the river from agricultural pollution and create a usable corridor for wildlife. The use of insecticides, herbicides, fertilizers and other chemicals within the zone which would be harmful to the river or wildlife would be banned. Wildlife River Buffer zones would encourage recreational use of rivers. Compensation would be paid to farmers to cover the cost of the land lost to production.",
