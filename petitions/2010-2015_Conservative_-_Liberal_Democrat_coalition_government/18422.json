Germany is determined to take control of Europe. Why should we be governed by the laws made by unelected cretins making a gravytrain for themselves? Scrap the EU Human Rights acts and make our own. Close our borders to the other EU countries and get ourselves out of this this mess dropped on us. Let us have our GREAT back, and be proud of our nation again. Deport ALL criminals found guilty back to their origins, even if they have been granted UK citizenship! Withhold all benefits to imigrants, economic or other illegal. Send all to camps until proof of entitlement is proven. Unproven to be removed within 24 hours. Clear the backlogs within 6 months. NO APPEALS. ",
