        "action": "Remove the EU flag from British number plates",
        "additional_details": "We are puzzled as to why the left hand side of most new EU (and hence British) number plates there is a blue background with the EU's Flag with the enitials of the nation state (GB) below. How and why did it get there? We call for this to be changed, as this flag was in fact dropped from the Constitution of Europe when it was rebranded as the Lisbon Treaty. Therefore whether Britain remains an EU state or not is irrelevant, the point is that flag should not be on our numberplates. We suggest that if anything a British Flag with UK written beneath it would be more appropriate as the Union Jack actually has constitutional significance and the United Kingdom is the official name of this nation state, not Great Britain.",
