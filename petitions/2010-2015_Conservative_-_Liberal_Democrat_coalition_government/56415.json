        "additional_details": "Blind people cannot access the majority of TV broadcasts, cinema presentations or DVD/Blu-ray products because they cannot understand what is happening when there is no speech or noise.\r\n\r\nAudio description is a process where a voice over is dubbed onto the soundtrack. It describes relevant parts of what is being seen on screen. This is vital for blind/visually impaired people to be able to comprehend what is going on. The voice over can be selected on or off as required. Audio description is currently used, but on very few products.\r\n\r\nWithout audio description blind/visually impaired people cannot access visual media.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to legislate that all broadcast media, cinema shows and DVD/Blu-ray products are audio described without exception.",
