        "additional_details": "I find that wonder bras and enhancement bras and other ehancement products are false advertising.  For example if one product came or saying I'm bigger or better than another product that wouldnt be allowed, so why should lingerie and underwear manufacturers be able to say my bra is better than the other company??  When what they are all doing is actually making a product that doesn't actually exist its all false advertsing",
