        "additional_details": "To include a box that states \"none of the above\" on ballot papers. Unlike spoiled papers this will count as an official vote. It allows the electorate a greater choice. If a none of the above vote is higher than any candidates, then a re-election with candidates who the electors feel able to vote for will have to be selected. If a candidate does achieve the highest proportion of the vote, it still allows the electorate to express their dissatisfaction. After all it is an abstaining vote and they are always counted. That is true democracy. Plus it costs almost nothing to put one more box on.",
