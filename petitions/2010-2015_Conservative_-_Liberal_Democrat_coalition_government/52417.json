        "action": "No public holiday in Margaret Thatcher's name",
        "additional_details": "Whatever one's views of Margaret Thatcher, there can be no doubt that she was an extremely controversial and divisive prime minister, as shown by the spontaneous celebrations that occurred all over the country when she died. A public holiday in her name would perpetuate both the controversy and the celebrations of her demise that caused so much dismay to her supporters.\r\n\r\nAs a society we need to move on from the divisions of the past, and we should leave the judgement of Margaret Thatcher to historians. This petition therefore calls upon the Government to resist calls for a bank or public holiday in her name.",
