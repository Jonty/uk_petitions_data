        "additional_details": "In the early hours of 4th April 2012, my husband, Phil, was the victim of an attack at a corporate event in London. He was stabbed in the left side of the neck with a bottle severing the 2 main arteries. He lost 5 pints of blood. Despite the Royal London Hospital team's best efforts, Phil died 4 days later. His death is devastating. I can not - and will not - let this happen to another family. I am calling for a ban on glass bottles from late night city centre venues to prevent this from ever happening again.",
