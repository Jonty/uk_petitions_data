        "additional_details": "The government needs to implement a law which improves the way dogs are bred and owned. This cradle to grave control over dogs will reduce dogs being bred through puppy farms and subsequently reduce unwanted dogs and therefore reduce the number of dogs being killed. It should consider compulsory micro chipping of all dogs, licenses for people to own dogs (thus reducing dogs being owned for fighting or other illegal activities). Every owner would need to take a practical and written test before being allowed to own a dog. Overall control of dogs and owners will reduce the cost of holding dogs in pounds or at police stations where their owners cannot be traced, reduce cost of kenneling and legal court cases.",
