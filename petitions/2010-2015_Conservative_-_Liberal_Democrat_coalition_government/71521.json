        "additional_details": "In order to prevent anyone taking up the dangerous habit of smoking Tobacco,and to end the huge fake and duty free trade, I beleive the sale of Tobacco in shops should end,with current smokers registering with there GP as a drug addict,Tobacco should only be available at Chemist shops on prescription.The cost /amount could be lowered significantly if only on prescription,which in turn would destroy the growing fake Tobacco trade that is slowly poisoning the many who buy fake.\r\nAlso the registering with your GP as an addict would further more make smoking Tobacco an even more an anti social thing.Tobbaco is a dangerous substance that needs more control ,it should not be freely available to anyone of age,its an addictive killer and its about time it was controled with a veiw of eradication once the many now smokers have gone.",
