        "additional_details": "Security Officers should be able to protect themselfs and the public from harm by offenders as most of the time security officers deal with offenders before the police arrive leading to fewer police officers which could be dealing with more serious cases and incidents but it also makes the security officer more prone to being injured or etting stabbed as they dont have any form of protection (Stab vest) or anything to defend themselfs with like a Baton or spray, and if security officers can be able to use handcuffs when making a Citizens arrest then it can free up alot of police officers who can deal with serious incidents first before arriving to deal with the offender who the security officer has detained.",
