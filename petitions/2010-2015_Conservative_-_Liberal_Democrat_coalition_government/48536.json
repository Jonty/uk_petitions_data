Dont let these people suffer because the system is wrong. In all my time on benefit approximately 7 years, the department of work and pensions who deal with my claims have if never or rarely spoken to my doctor about my disability. This shows you how easy it is to claim benefits without proper medical evidence.\r\nDont let these people suffer.  There needs to be proper medically trained people assessing these people. ",
