Some have even suggested no 'up-front' payment, providing bank details are given! This is an easy introduction for criminals.\r\nPity the elderly, busy mothers or those who don't possess a strong enough character to send them away.\r\n\r\nI propose a nationwide ban on doorstep selling and make it an offence to do so, punishable by a heavy fine.
