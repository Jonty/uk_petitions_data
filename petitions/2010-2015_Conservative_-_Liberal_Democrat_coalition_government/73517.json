        "additional_details": "I believe that all eBooks should be available in a free and easy format to those who are taking the subject. It should not be dependent upon the library of the Student and their eBook provider as to what information they can access and what books are available. An encompassing catalouge available to all would be of great benefit to those in secondary education. Currently the system works in such a way that if a book is taken out of the library it is tough luck to that student. However a catalogue of eBooks available to all students would be of great help and make university less stressful and expensive to students than it already is.",
