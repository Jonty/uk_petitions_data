My suggestion is that the queen demotes London from it's 'city' status and re-establishes it as a hamlet. This would be very banterous and as such people would flock from near and far to visit the worlds biggest hamlet. This spectacle could be coined a 'banter-fest' and added to the 7 wonders of the world. ",
