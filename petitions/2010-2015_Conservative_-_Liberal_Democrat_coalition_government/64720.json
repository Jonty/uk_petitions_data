        "additional_details": "As of April 1 2014 each prescribed item will cost \u00a38.05 in England.\r\n\r\nFor asthmatics, medications are a matter of life and death. Inhalers and other asthma medications keep asthmatics alive by allowing them to breathe. Asthma medications are not cheap, and it's not always easy for asthmatics to pay for the drugs that they so heavily rely on. When faced with financial difficulties, many asthmatics will have to decide if they can do without their medications in order to save money.\r\nNo-one should be put in the position to make these kinds of life affecting decisions.\r\n\r\nThe fees for asthma related medications have already been abolished in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this petition is to urge the government to abolish all fees for asthma related medication in England.
