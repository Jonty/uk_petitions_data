Personally I don't think its taken as seriously as some other criminal offenses, and too me, this is a subject I take on very strongly as no one deserves this to happen to them.\r\n\r\nMany people are suffering from domestic violence and there seems to be no one there to help them out as they won't understand what's happening because it may not of happened to them.\r\n\r\nI also think that people should help publicise the domestic violence charities and helplines as this would make it easier for people to contact them without their 'partner' seeing their internet history and so it doesn't give them another reason to be abused.\r\n\r\nSo, I need everyone reading this to sign it - to show you care about this subject and together, we will change domestic violence and help as many people out as possible.",
