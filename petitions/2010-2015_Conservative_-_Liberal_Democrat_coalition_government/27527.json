        "additional_details": "The Government rightly, across the board in all departments, reduced costs by reducing unnecessary and excessive staff.\r\n\r\nTime the Government took the medicine itself. There is absolutely no need for 600 plus MPs for a small country with relatively small population like the United Kingdom with devolved parliaments for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nReduce\r\nHouse of Commons to 300 MPs\r\nand\r\nHouse of Lords to 100\r\n\r\nOfcourse it is not in favour of majority of the sitting MPs as over 50% will lose. So clearly they cannot be allowed to vote on it themselves. The public sector workers did not get the opportunity to vote themselves redundant so WHY should MPs?\r\n\r\nEveryone is urged to sign the petition in millions to force the issue.\r\n\r\nThe Government is supposed to be for the people NOT for the MPs own benefit.",
