        "action": "Provisions re use of UK taxpayers money as aid",
        "additional_details": "This petition calls on the UK Government to continue with the target of 0.7% Gross National Income for overseas developmental aid and, when possible, exceed it. The provision of Aid however should be targeted at countries where all human rights regarding gender, ethnicity, sexuality, disability and belief are respected by the recipients. Aid money should also never be used for the provision of weapons (other than for strictly controlled defensive purposes) or internal repression. HMG should bi-annually audit all aid to ensure compliance with these standards and publish the findings.",
