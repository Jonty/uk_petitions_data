        "additional_details": "The majority of the people from Hong Kong do not like the mainland Chinese and the Chinese call the protestors in Hong Kong extremists. Hong Kong has a very vibrant economy and would be a key asset to the UK if it was to return to British rule. The mainlanders and the people of Hong Kong have very different ways of life and the Chinese are breaking the rules made up in the handover treaty. It is unfair to leave the people of Hong Kong to put up with a rule which the majority of them do not like. They would much rather have the British Back!",
