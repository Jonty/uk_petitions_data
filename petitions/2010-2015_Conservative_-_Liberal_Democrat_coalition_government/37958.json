        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, oppose the proposed selective licensing scheme for landlords in Langworthy, and Weaste & Seedley.\r\n\r\nSalford City Council's consultation process has been heavy on rhetoric and light on evidence. No attempt has been made in the consultation process to provide landlords, residents, and businesses with a thorough explanation of the proposal, nor provide evidence of the success of the previous scheme which lapsed on the 25th May 2012 - thereby raising questions about the legalities of Salford's new proposals.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we urge the Government to intervene in this matter, to investigate Salford's consultation process and reject its proposed selective licensing scheme - in order to provide the best outcome for residents, landlords, and local businesses.",
