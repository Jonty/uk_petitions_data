        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to include an amendment to the Modern Slavery Bill so as to ensure it legislates on slavery within the supply chains of businesses.\r\n\r\nOver two hundred years after William Wilberforce\u2019s success in abolishing the slave trade, the British Parliament has a second opportunity to abolish slavery entirely. This minor alteration to the Modern Slavery Bill would have a huge impact. It would convert a good piece of legislation into a world leader.\r\n\r\nOnce again Britain has the opportunity to lead the global fight against slavery internationally so I urge the Government not to miss this opportunity and to support an amendment to the Modern Slavery Bill so as to ensure it legislates on supply chains.\r\n",
