        "additional_details": "Currently the UK Government continues to refuse to decrease UK fuel duty. This is affecting every organisation, motorist and driving up food costs within Great Britain and Northern Island.\r\nThis petition is to have the UK fuel prices rise and fall with the price of Oil on the Stock Markets. I believe that this would ease the out going costs of industries, companies, businesses and motorists, and still give the Government a percentage. From 2007 (where the average price per litre was 88p) the UK tax payer has continuously paid through the nose for fuel (now at an average of \u00a31.35p per Ltr), with very little in the way of a price reduction seen or offered, and no doubt more increases in the future.\r\nThis system is not new and is used in many other countries, why not the UK?\r\n",
