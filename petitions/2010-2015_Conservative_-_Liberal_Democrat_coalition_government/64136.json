        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition to ban men over the age of 40 from wearing spandex or tight fitting cycling clothes unless taking part in an organised athletic event. With the Tour de France fast approaching along with long summer days, it won't be long until our roads are awash with fat middle aged men who need to escape the spouse and decide that dressing like a overweight gymnast and riding a child's toy is the way forward. These sights are a danger to the public and traffic, no one wants to see or get caught behind that, it's enough to cause a person to turn to drink , thereby increasing our already growing numbers of alcohol addicted adults and further heaping more stress on the NHS. We need to act now. Think of the children! Do you really want them growing up in a world where it's totally acceptable for Mike from accounts to parade in his adult diaper with his camel toe on show?
