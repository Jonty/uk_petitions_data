        "additional_details": "When a close relative is very ill or had a major accident, employers can allow their employees to have unpaid compassionate leave. It should be paid as the employees are under a lot of stress and having to pay out for more things than normal. Things such as taxis, car park fees, equipment to make the sick ones' lives more comfortable.\r\n\r\nThen why the ill relative dies, the employer only gives employees just one week's bereavement leave. This isn't enough as for starters, the gap between death and funeral can be 2.5 weeks. I have seen it for myself colleagues going back to work a few days before the funeral and they couldn't cope.\r\n\r\nFor some people, their relative lived in social housing and need to clear out the possessions within 2-4 weeks of death.\r\n\r\nPeople should not be getting a sick note for having extra time off work to do with the death, funeral and estate of a late relative.
