        "additional_details": "Protestant, Unionist and Loyalist People (PUL) have no trust or confidence in Matt Baggott, PSNI Chief. Handling of the PUL flag protests has been, oppressive, overbearing, heavy handed, brutal and disproportionate. PSNI conspired to arrest PUL on trumped-up charges and unreasonably objected to bail whilst republicans walked from court unimpeded, some without bail conditions.\r\nOver 200 PUL people arrested/bailed with suggestions of another 500 to face this tyranny, differing from more serious Republican riots.\r\nFlag protests cost in excess of \u00a320 million, an abuse of his position in trying to suppress legitimate right to peaceful protest by misuse of public funds. He failed to effectively liaise with local community reps, causing groups to walk away from meetings with police.\r\nHe failed our community whilst allowing republican terrorists to walk free from gaol and harsh bail conditions which exist for our community.\r\nFrom day one he caused confusion with PSNI and protestors alike.",
