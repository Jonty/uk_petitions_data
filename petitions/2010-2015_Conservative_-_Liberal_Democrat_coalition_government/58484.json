They would then have to fund the purchase themselves.\r\n\r\nThis should free up housing for purchase and also help reduce the current high house prices.\r\n\r\nI suggest all landlords receive 12 months advance notice, before this is brought into law so any landlord who could not afford the mortgage repayments would have time to sell the property.\r\n\r\n",
