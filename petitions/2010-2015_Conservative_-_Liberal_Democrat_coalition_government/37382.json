There are certain elements of the game that has been destroying many people's Games Consoles and people have paid \u00a340.00, \u00a350.00 maybe \u00a360.00 for a game that doesn't work. The certain error that occurs when people try to play on any element of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a message that says \"Disk Read Error\". This cannot be a disk read error as hundreds of thousand of people have got this error and many people's systems have been destroyed due to the lack of effort that has been processed into the game. We demand that Activision fix the issues that they have made with this outrageous game and apologise for all the inconveniences.  ",
