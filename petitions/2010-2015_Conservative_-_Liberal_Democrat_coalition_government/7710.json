        "additional_details": "The modern world is very dynamic and constantly changing. It is no longer appropriate for parliament to have a summer recess and let the county fall into an ungoverned state unable to react to any developments.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to end the tradition of the summer recess. Instead they should take the example set by the other institutions, in both the private and public sector, where individuals book time off and go on holiday when convenient to do so.\r\n\r\nPlease sign below to urge the government and MPs to remain in control of the country throughout the year.",
