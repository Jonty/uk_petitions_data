        "additional_details": "According to national statistics mobile phone theft has steadily been on the increase since 2003 from 29% of theft from a person back then to 40% in 2012/2013.  This 11% raise in mobile phone theft over ten years has occurred from our desire to invest in the latest smart phone and switch from analogue to digital devices.  Since every device has a registered IMEI number which is documented with the retailer and every sim card has an identity number which can inform the mobile phone operator of which make and model of handset it is in, this should deter the thieve.\r\nThis is not the case so it is about time that Ofcom in partnership with the police and mobile phone operators set up a data base that logs all stolen handsets in order to tighten the net to deter people from purchasing and using stolen handsets especially in the pay as you go market.   .\r\n  ",
