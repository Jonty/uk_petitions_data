        "additional_details": "Cooperatives and employee owned businesses should be incentivised. Cooperatives and employee owned businesses are good for everyone. When employees at all levels have a say in the way a business is run, and can reap the financial rewards of a successful business, workers are likely to invest more effort into the business. It means that everyone is motivated to succeed. It also means that business decisions can be democratised so that ethical considerations are not second to the profit imperative.  Businesses will be more likely to take an active role in improving their communities and adding real value rather than just financial value to the lives of employees and customers.",
