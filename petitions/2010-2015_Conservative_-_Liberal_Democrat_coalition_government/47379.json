Self determination does not just give Scotts the right to decide but also conveys that right to the rest of the UK population.\r\n\r\nThe Westminster government should allow all of its citizens a vote on independence not just those living inside Scotland, at the same time as the Scottish vote in the Autumn of 2014.",
