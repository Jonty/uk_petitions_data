        "additional_details": "We want Camberley to be a top 100 town and have a greatly improved and well utilised rail service.\r\n\r\nWe want to reduce the journey time by rail from Camberley to London from the current 1 hour 15 minutes to 50 minutes. We want government investment to restore the direct rail link from Camberley to Woking. In the short term we want South West Trains to improve the connections from Camberley via Ascot and Ash Vale, reduce the connection waiting times and increase the number of direct trains via Ascot. We also want to greatly improve the rolling stock on the Ascot to Aldershot line.",
