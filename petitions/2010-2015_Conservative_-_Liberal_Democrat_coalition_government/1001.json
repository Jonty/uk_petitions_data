Members of the House of Lords who are not elected and do not need to account to anyone for life! This means that anyone can be nominated by the PM to the House of Lords (for life) and can become a senior or junior Government Minister. How about a reformed House of Lords having reduced members (say fixed at 400), third of whom are elected by electors, a third nominated by political leaders and the other third by nominated by a panel for their specific expertise and experience. The reformed House of Lords should still be able to suggest amendments to a Bill (i.e. before receiving the Royal Accent to become an Act of Parliament). The Parliament Act should still apply to a reformed House of Lords. Under the Parliament Act, the House of Lords got eventually (after the second reading) give in to the will of the House of Commons.",
