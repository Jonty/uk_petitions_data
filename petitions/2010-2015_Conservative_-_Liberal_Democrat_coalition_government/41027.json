        "additional_details": "South London Healthcare Trust, QE, PRUH and QMS hospitals are in administration and have run up debts of \u00a3150 million. Matthew Kershaw has recommended that the nearby Lewisham Healthcare closes it's A+E to help compensate for their failures and their scandalous overspend. By closing Lewisham A+E doors, revenue will be made by the SLHT trusts as there will be no other choice but for patients with life-threatening illnesses to go there. Lewisham Healthcare is a successful trust, which is not overspent, reaches it's targets and is well managed and has recently been refurbished. Why should they be penalised for others failures? Please support us in keeping Lewisham A+E open ; it's closure would be catastrophic for the local community. ",
