The Euro elections campaign has been dominated by myths about immigration with mainstream parties conceding to an agenda set by UKIP. This is a cynical attempt to blame immigrants for the cost of living crisis facing the majority of the population rather than those responsible for the economy. This is whipping up racism and is creating a climate that breeds hatred and violent racist attacks on Britain\u2019s streets.",
