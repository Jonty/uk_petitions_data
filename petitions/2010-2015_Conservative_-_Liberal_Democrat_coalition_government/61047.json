        "additional_details": "The Witham to Maldon railway line should be re-opened as since its closure in 1964 Maldon has grown in size and its visitor attractions have increased. By re-opening the railway it would take commuter traffic to the railway stations at Chelmsford and Witham off the roads thereby cutting pollution and provide easier access to London from Maldon and to Maldon from the rest of the country.
