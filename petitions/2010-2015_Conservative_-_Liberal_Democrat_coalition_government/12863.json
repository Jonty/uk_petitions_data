        "additional_details": "William J Bratton has served as the chief of police of the Los Angeles Police Department, New York City Police Commissioner, and Boston Police Commissioner.  He has dramatically reduced violent crime in these three very different American cities.  The Prime Minister has now appointed him as an advisor, but the Home Secretary has blocked the Prime Minister's anticipated move to appoint him as head of the Metropolitan Police.  Bratton would be a great asset to the police, bringing a wealth or experience and a new persepctive, and we call on the government to appoint him to the role of Commissioner.",
