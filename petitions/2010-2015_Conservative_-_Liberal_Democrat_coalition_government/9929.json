        "additional_details": "Presently, BBC's coverage of music is woeful.  200,000 people attend Glastonbury and yet coverage (on BBC3) commences at 7pm - a good 8 hours after the music started!!  Even then, it's interrupted by a re-run of Doctor Who!!\r\n\r\nYet tennis coverage and snooker dominate the TV screens in Summer.  There's football, rugby and cricket aplenty but a criminal lack of music on our screens.\r\n\r\nBBC is a publicly-funded station and I would urge the balance to be reset.  For every 1 hour of sport, I would like to see 1 hour of music coverage.  And at a decent time please - I'm fed up of seeing music marginalised to very late at night or the early hours of the morning.",
