        "additional_details": "Instead of adding an extra bank holiday- why not allow people to have a day off on their birthday. Would not mean mass shut down, but would have a feel good factor. If the birthday is at the weekend then you lose that year ( unless you work weekends!) if your birthday is a fixed holiday i.e. Christmas, boxing day or Jan 1st you can have a day off before or after- unless it is a weekend (then you lose out like everyone else does)! Simple easy and not overly costly to an individual, firm or the country! So let's have an extra day off for our birthday!!",
