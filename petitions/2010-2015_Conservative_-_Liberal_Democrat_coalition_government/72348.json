        "additional_details": "We have serious concerns that Neil Parish, an MP who supports the badger cull, has been appointed as the chair of  APGAW.\r\n\r\nWe want you raise to this issue with Mr Parish, and insist that he must withdraw his support from this policy or to step down as chair of this group.\r\n\r\nBadgers are one of the most persecuted species in the UK and evidence strongly suggests culling them will do nothing to help curb the spread of TB. This evidence is compiled into the Independent Scientific Group (ISG) report on bovine TB.\r\n\r\nSince this programme of government-led persecution was implemented, there has been a sharp rise in reporting of wildlife crime relating to badgers. Setts have been set on fire, filled with poisons and animals have been left to die agonizing deaths, because they have been demonised by this government.\r\n\r\nIf the government is to be seen to take animal welfare issues seriously, then they must put a stop to the badger cull and it is important that APGAW does not support it.",
