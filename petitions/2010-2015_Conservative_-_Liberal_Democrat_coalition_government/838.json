        "additional_details": "The Government should close the divide of opinion on overseas aid by:\r\na) Ensuring that the bulk of aid consists of goods manufactured by, and services and skills provided by British companies (at highly competitive prices) and a lot more volunteering options to avoid/reduce opportunities for corruption.\r\nb) Focus on basics such as clean drinking water, nutritional food rations, medicines, basic housing, schools and clinics, transport, polytunnels and other agricultural equipment & know-how for local food production & job creation, training for police and army personnel.\r\nc) Having a much more transparent mechanism for allocation of aid budget.\r\nd) More rigorous auditing of aid projects and withholding of further funds from projects / countries that fail audits or where corruption is endemic.\r\ne) A formal Annual Report to the Nation spelling out what the money has been spent on and independent assessment of outcomes.\r\n",
