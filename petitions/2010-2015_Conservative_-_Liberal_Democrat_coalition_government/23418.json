        "additional_details": "Former Chancellor Brown devasted the private sector pensions industry when he cancelled this tax credit several years ago. The current government is now boosting its pensions offer to public sector workers by several billion pounds per year (detailed figures not available). This petition asks Parliament to debate the proposal to reinstate the Dividend Tax Credit for private sector pensions by taking a first slice of funding from the new proposal for public sector pensions, especially if the public sector workers and unions continue their proposed strike action.",
