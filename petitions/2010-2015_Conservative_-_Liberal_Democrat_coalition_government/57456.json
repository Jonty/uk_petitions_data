After a stab in the back already from Nick Clegg over the \u00a39k fees debacle, how are students of our country supposed to finish their degrees if they're too busy worrying and getting stressed over financial issues and screwing up their mental health in the process?\r\n\r\nConverting grants to loans will only put off poorer families, much in the same way that we saw a fall off of applications even though the \u00a39k wasn't to be paid upfront (http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/421152.article).\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned urge the Government to stop these plans in their tracks and keep Higher Education  funding secure.",
