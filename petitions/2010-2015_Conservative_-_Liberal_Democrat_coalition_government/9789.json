By reintroducing National Service it will teach young adults structure and purpose and even a trade. It should be an 18 month service from which thes young adults will at least learn something! Discipline, respect, structure, a trade, hope, purpose. It works brilliantly in other countries and set up these young adults for their life ahead.",
