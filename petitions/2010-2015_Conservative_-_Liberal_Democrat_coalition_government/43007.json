        "additional_details": "It seems unbelievable that no individual or individuals were responsible for the banking crisis of 2008. The money used to support the banking, approximately 70 billion pounds, has placed a burden on this country that will take many years to repay. The banks that we own may need more money in the future placing even more burden to the countries appalling debt. The individuals who ran the banks are still working as directors or chairman of other companies. How can this be?\r\n\r\nI am calling for a Judicial review of who was responsible for the banking crisis of 2008.\r\n\r\n",
