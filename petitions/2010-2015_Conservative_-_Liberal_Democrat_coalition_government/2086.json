        "action": "Abolish collective worship",
        "additional_details": "As it stands, the law requires all schools to hold an act of collective worship every day. Even in schools that aren\u2019t \u2018faith\u2019 schools, this must be \u2018broadly Christian\u2019 in character. In a society which is increasingly diverse, this is an affront to the rights of young people to express their beliefs freely. Although there is the opportunity to opt out, this is reliant on parental permission and is not respected by all schools.\r\n\r\nThe law is extremely unpopular, with opinion polls showing teachers don\u2019t want it, parents don\u2019t want it, and children don\u2019t want it. As such, it is long past time for the daily act of collective worship to be replaced with inclusive assemblies that add to cohesion and  a sense of community within the school. We petition the Government to repeal the requirement for compulsory collective worship in schools and to encourage schools to hold educational assemblies that will include all children, regardless of religion or non-religious belief.",
