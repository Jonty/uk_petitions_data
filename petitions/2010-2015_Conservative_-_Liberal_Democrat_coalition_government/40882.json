This has awful effects throughout the whole country. People having the choose between Food of heating. People freezing to death, children going to bed cold... And shareholders becoming more and more richer!\r\n\r\nI believe that before energy suppliers decide they want to rip us off even more then they should have to take any proposed price increase to the Government for them to review and if they believe a price rise is needed (ie for rising costs in the market etc) then they can approve it.\r\n\r\nThis will end cold hearted profiteering whenever the shareholders demand so!
