I do a lot of overtime and every time I look at my payslip it feels like  I'm actually giving all my overtime pay to the Goverment.\r\n\r\nThe gov should understand that is not appealing for workers to do overtime due to the fact we would get taxed a lot if the Goverment put the tax low on overtime the Goverment would get more income and so would the tax payer as so many people would be interested in doing overtime, We should be treated fair nowadays we are getting a lot of cuts in benefits and other sorts of benefits.\r\n\r\nThe goverment should be fair. This may also stop people from being evicted, in debt, black listed, thefts and more.",
