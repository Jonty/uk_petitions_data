        "additional_details": "I am not saying to abolish this law, just to change it.\r\nBoth DDA 1991 and Breed specific legislation tackle the wrong end of the leash. Any dog can attack or bite. You cant judge on what they look like.\r\n\r\nThe action to take- Legalize pitbulls. However, if you are to own one the dog must be licensed. All owners must under go check to see if they can be responsible. If you are wanting to breed you must have a secondary licence. Look at the individual person instead of deeming every dog of a certain breed dangerous. Its a form of intense prejudice.\r\n\r\nI know this would be a lot of work and dedication but surely all dogs deserve a long and happy life? The pitbull is the worlds most misunderstood breed of dog. I personally would give my whole life and soul to this breed and so would many others!!\r\n\r\nTHE BREED SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED BY LOOKS AND ITS NAME BUT BY THE CONTENT OF THEIR CHARACTER...\r\n",
