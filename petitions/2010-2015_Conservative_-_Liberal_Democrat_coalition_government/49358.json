Many businesses are open every day of the week including Bank Holidays and many people have their weekends on other days of the week. Then, there are those who work shifts also to be considered.\r\n\r\nToo many people these days seem to be inconsiderate of others and as this is affecting the day to day living of the immediate neighbours and those living nearby, I would like this to be added to the Anti-Social Behaviour Act, 2003 so as to enable the police to take immediate action.\r\n\r\n",
