        "additional_details": "We can learn alot of things about shifting cultivation. What shifting cultivation does is they chop down an area of trees and then live there for 10 years and then pack up and leave then they chop down another area and so on so when they get back to the original area the trees have grown back and the wildlife has gone back. I think that businesses can learn alot from things like this well paper companies so the paper companies can chop down an area of trees and then they can focus on that area so and plant stuff and even after they leave they can still focus on the area and ,try encourage the wildlife to come back aswell as moving onto the next area this is very sustainable. So what do you guys think leave your comments in the section below.\r\n\r\nLets get paper companies to do this.",
