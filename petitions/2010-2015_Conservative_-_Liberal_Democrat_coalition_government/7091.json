        "additional_details": "I would be in trouble if I implied a person was a failure or inadequate based on the colour of their skin, but it seems ok for the government and media to deliberately generalise that the unemployed are scroungers and workshy.  I have known more than one person to hold this attitude when they are working, then suddenly lose their job and six months later they find unemployment isn't quite how they imagined and they are now singing a kinder tune; especially after being confronted with some distasteful jobcentre advisor is trying to meet targets by forcing (under threat of sanctions) them to apply for any old job, no matter how awful. Would the government stop using these negative descriptions to falsley blame the unemployed for the state of the economy and lack of industry and proper jobs\r\n.",
