        "additional_details": "I live in a small country village in somerset and I am over 4 miles away from the nearest bus stop, however I do not drive as I cant afford it and so I have to rely on my family to take me to and fro daily as I go to college 5 days a week and work on the weekend.\r\n\r\nIt is simply not a case of walking as A) walking over 4 miles at 7am in the morning to get a bus is not practical! And B) the country lanes around me are too dangerous to walk on (11 times more people are killed on rural roads as opposed to towns, cities and motorways).\r\n\r\nAll my friends and I find this so unfair that if we would like to get places quicker or at all we have to start driving, although the insurance, learning to drive and the car cost too much at any rate! I would like a frequent bus service that is walking distance from me/my village and fits in with normal work/college times (9-5) for me and everyone else in my area.\r\n\r\nThankyou",
