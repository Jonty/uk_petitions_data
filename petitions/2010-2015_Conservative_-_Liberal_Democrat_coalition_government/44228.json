        "additional_details": "Recently we all saw on the news the devastating affect of illegal ivory tusk trafficking to China.  The brutal way the herd of elephant's were killed and solely for their tusks to feed the rich Chinese people.\r\n\r\nElephants are on the endangered species list and all form of life in the world has the right to live without the fear of being killed for medicine, ornaments or delicacy purposes.\r\n\r\nIts about time the world all stood together and put a stop to this illegal trade to save the future of all endangered species which majority are killed for Chinese medicine,  delicacy or ornaments.\r\n\r\nThis is not the first and certainly will not be the last time for this type of incident to occur but its our duty to say FULL STOP to this brutality. It's part of the human race responsibility to speak up and try and save these beautiful animals so generations after us can appreciate the beauty of this world.",
