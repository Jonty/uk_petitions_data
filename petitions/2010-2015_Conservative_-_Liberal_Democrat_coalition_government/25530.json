Why not deport this type of immigrnt back to their home country where they can be looked after there were they may truly have something to complain about in terms of living conditions and government handouts which they seem so adamant in complaining about in the UK. Lets close the UK borders on unskilled immigration and only let in those who are willing to work for a living like the rest of the UK public.",
