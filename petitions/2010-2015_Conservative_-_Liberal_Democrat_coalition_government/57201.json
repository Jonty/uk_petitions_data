All food is required to have the calorie count (and traffic lights) on them.  Why aren't companies required to declare their UK corporation tax payment (from the previous year).\r\n\r\nThis will allow the consumer to make an informed choice about their supplier; in the same way a consumer can choose ethically sourced goods or food.\r\n\r\nThe data, from publicly traded companies, is already available but publishing the data on every receipt or invoice will help to inform the consumer.\r\n\r\nThe result should be expressed as a % of the value of their sales from UK consumers (note: this may not be the same as their declared UK sales as some companies run their UK sales through other low tax countries).  This 'sales to UK consumers' figure should be declared in their annual results.\r\n\r\n",
