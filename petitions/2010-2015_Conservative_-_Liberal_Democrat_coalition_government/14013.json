The number of voting age adults and youths alike who do not understand, for example, different voting systems, or the ideologies of the different parties, is astounding and upsetting. Often students of politics A Level find themselves explaining our political system to adults who have been voting for 30 or more years. We need an education system that explains in an unbiased way the different viewpoints and aspects of our system in order for democracy to function correctly.",
