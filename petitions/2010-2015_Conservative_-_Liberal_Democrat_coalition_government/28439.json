        "additional_details": "I think the government should bring back the fair rent act or something like it. There has been a lot of talk about benefit capping mainly because of the cost of Housing Benefit. Introducing new controls on the upper limits of rentals would bring down these bill and stop the tax payers from subsidising investors in the buy to let market, where it is common for investors to expect tenants payments to cover their mortgage costs and so buy the property for them. Also it would give tenants more disposable income reducing pressure on wages etc.",
