        "additional_details": "Deterioration of UK roads over many years has lead to our roads becoming potholed tracks. This is a result of many factors, lack of investment, councils not investing the full amount given by government, increased traffic volumes and bad winters. Essential works needed on our roads is estimated at \u00a310s billions.\r\n\r\nThe public are fed up with the state of roads. Research suggests badly maintained roads cost the UK economy \u00a34.1 billion a year, spending on the road network for maintenance and repairs is less than 10% of what road users pay in fuel tax and Road Fund Licence.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned request the following:\r\n\r\nGovernment invest more in the current road infrastructure;\r\n\r\nThe Department for Transport ring fence funding on roads for councils, ensuring it is used for this purpose;\r\n\r\nExpenditure on road maintenance is increased to a level appropriate for an asset worth approx \u00a3750 billion, saving money in the long run rather than the \u201cpatch and mend\u201d mentality.\r\n",
