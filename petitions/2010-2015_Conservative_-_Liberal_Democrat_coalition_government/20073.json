Following a pensions consultation last year, changes were adopted to ensure that this was sustainable.  2 billion more goes into the treasurey than is paid out and Ministers, although they are public servants get a higher pension linked to RPI rather than CPI.\r\n\r\nI would like for this Govenment to withdraw their attack on public pension and bring their own pension in line with ours",
