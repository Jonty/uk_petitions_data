I have seen very little reductions with regard to the costs, numbers and wages of members of parliament or there staff. We have seen and heard of wages and pensions going up though.\r\n I therefore propose that there should be a 40% reduction in the number of MP\u2019s serving in government together with a 50% reduction in the numbers in the House of Lords. This would not only have an effect of a reducing the numbers of members of government it would also reduce the numbers of staff employees e.g. family members also taking tax payers money.\r\n",
