        "additional_details": "The Minister for Natural Environment and Fisheries is called upon to bring forward an immediate change to the licensing law by including the Cormorant on the 'General Licence thereby, allowing the legal control of Cormorant numbers where they pose a direct threat to the sustainability of fish populations. The consequence would be to establish bird population levels that prevent an adverse impact within the food chain protecting not only our important  freshwater fish species, but also  other vitally important, but increasingly uncommon bird species.\r\nFor drought affected areas this change to  licensing laws should be introduced post-haste as the level of cormorant fish predation is likley to increase as water levels reduce in rivers and still-waters.",
