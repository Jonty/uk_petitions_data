        "additional_details": "Bradford council have continually failed in the regeneration of the city.  Over 10 years ago the council tore down half the city to build a new shopping centre which never happened. Despite promises we are Now in 2013 and there is still a huge hole and no replacement buildings or enterprise.  Surrounding areas, business and shops have suffered greatly and Bradford now looks a shadow of its former self.  The council members should be held wholly accountable and make significant and swift steps to rectify this.",
