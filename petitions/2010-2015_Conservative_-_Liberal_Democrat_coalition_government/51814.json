If a family or couple book flights they should be allocated seating together automatically.\r\n The airlines appear to be allocating seats apart and then charging a premium to get seats together. This appears to be nothing more than a scam. The customer can do nothing about this other than pay up or sit apart.\r\n\r\nAirlines should be forced to allocate seating together for families and small groups traveling together under the same booking.",
