        "additional_details": "Stephen Passey hit 19yr old Jamie Slesser last November.\r\n\r\nHe drove with Jamie on the bonnet until he slipped beneath the car becoming attached.  He accelerated trying to detach Jamie to no avail.  Jamie was dragged for around 200 metres before Passey decided to pull into a bus stop, reverse off the body and flee the scene in excess of 80mph and well over the legal drink drive limit.\r\n\r\nJamie suffered multiple injuries including a major head injury causing permanent brain damage.  He spent 2 weeks in intensive care and family were told to expect his death.  He then spent a further 6 months in hospital undergoing operations including further brain surgery, skin grafts and rehab.\r\n\r\nFor full story see http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/drink-driver-stephen-passey-jailed-5739523",
