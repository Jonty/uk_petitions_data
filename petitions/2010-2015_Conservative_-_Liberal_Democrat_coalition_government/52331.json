        "additional_details": "Faredalehill has been approved by local council to ground works for future residential development. In 2009 the past application for residence was rejected. Now an application for 550 dwelling has been approved. On the particular piece of land inhabits a number of land mines from past mining work. A large body of water has formed over years and through this time its become a home, resting place and a feeding ground for many species of birds and amphibian life. Hedgerows surround this land and young trees. I for one is saddened by the possible loss. Once this haven has been demolished thats it, no going back. Local residents will also be affected. Please help me help the wildlife as this sort of arrangement is devestating and getting more common. ",
