The British public needs to know exactly where austerity measures are coming from and what they are for with a wealth of information in one document.  This needs to be delivered in plain english and needs sensible statistical analysis explaining who in society is being affected, and how much by.  It needs to show how the finances of different areas such as education, the banking sector, the military, local council, pension funds etc are being eaten into in order to pay back the deficit, again with sensible statistics that are not twisted to hide the extent of the cuts.  Finally a clear and finalised timeline for how long it will take to be clear of these debts with things as they currently stand and how ideas such as the 'Robin Hood Tax' would help / or undermine the recovery.
