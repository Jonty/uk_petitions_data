        "additional_details": "Dennis Canavan, chairman of Yes Scotland, said \"If Scots vote to become independent a second referendum will be held to decide the head of state. As to the possibility of another King George, I'm not going to let that happen, but it is important to remember that true democracy is based on the sovereignty of the people rather than the sovereignty of any monarch. In the Republic of Scotland, the People of Scotland should therefore be given an early opportunity to decide whether they want to retain the useless monarchy or choose an elected head of state. Personally, I favour the latter option, because a hereditary head of state is an affront to democracy and a complete anachronism in a modern 21st century democracy. I'm certain that the people of Scotland will vote for independence.\"\r\n\r\nDennis Canavan should be charged with treason, for violating Treason Felony Act 1848.",
