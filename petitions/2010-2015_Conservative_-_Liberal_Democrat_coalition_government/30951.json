        "additional_details": "This is a means of all of us trying to make a difference to many. Too long has Joseph Kony and the Lord's Resistance Army caused unbridled terror within Central Africa.\r\n\r\nThe LRA commits human rights violations, including murder, abduction, mutilation, sexual enslavement of women and children and forcing children to participate in hostilities. Many would agree that intervention would be needed.\r\n\r\n I propose that HM Government, like US, sends aides to Central Africa as a means of helping local forces train and develop means to find and arrest Kony.\r\nKony has used false peace talks as means of re-arming and reassembling his forces. His mockery of justice and mindless violence must be brought to an end.",
