        "additional_details": "In response to the known concern of the sexualisation of children (lad's mags displayed at eye level, internet porn, 'sexting', sexual pop videos, inappropriate children's clothing and merchandise etc.), the problem of schoolgirls wearing unnecessarily short skirts to school should be tackled at a Government level.\r\nAlarmingly, in addition to skirts being sold that are too short for the ages they are meant for, schoolgirls are actually manipulating the waistbands of their skirts in order to shorten them.\r\nA trousers only policy may be sensible, although it may not be desirable for everyone, but at the very least, a minimum skirt length policy should be enforced at every school in the country in order to further combat the horror of the increasing sexualisation of our nation's children.",
