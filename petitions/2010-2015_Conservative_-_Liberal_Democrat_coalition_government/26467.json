        "additional_details": "The cost to the UK of rabies or other new diseases becoming established in UK wildlife could be huge. Our dogs, cats, and children would be under constant threat. Losing the UK's disease-free status for these diseases would affect trade and travel with other countries. The new 21 day quarantine, without blood test, is unlikely to be effective. The government should immediately take advice from vets, scientists, and others with relevant expert experience (excluding those with financial incentives) and review the potential diseases that pet quarantine protects against. Incorporate that advice as soon as possible, and set the quarantine time to protect against rabies (typically 35 days incubation) and other diseases that may take longer to show. Re-introduce the blood test. The precautionary principle should prevail. The recently-used 6-month period was well established and has been effective, and should be considered as a default period if there is any doubt or disagreement.",
