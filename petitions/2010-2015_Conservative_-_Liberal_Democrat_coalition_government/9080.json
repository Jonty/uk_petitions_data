        "additional_details": "Simply the system should be changed to stop Members of Parliament owning more than one house at the expense of the Tax Payer. MP's should have the right to one house within their constituency. If they live with commuting distance of London then they can have their travel expenses paid for. Those who do not live close enough should be accommodated within a government controlled hotel, whilst they are staying in London. A hotel, which could be used to provide jobs for people and revenue for the government. The system has been abused for too long and should not continue.",
