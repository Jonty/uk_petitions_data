This can then hugely disrupt this person life, it can prevent this person buying a home, car, or even a mobile phone.\r\n\r\nNo private company should legally hold a person personal financial information without their consent.\r\n\r\nWhilst I recognise the need for a credit history, the current system needs to be fairer, and should be government run.\r\n\r\nEvery person also should have the right to freely view their credit score and dispute any of that information.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, you can only view your OWN credit score by paying a subscription to experian.",
