        "action": "Introduce a National Living Wage",
        "additional_details": "This petition urges the Government to introduce a National Living Wage which ensures that no person ever earns less than they require to provide for themselves and their families. As Ed Miliband rightly states, the Living Wage can 'make Britain both a fairer and more prosperous place'.\r\n\r\nThis petition urges the Government to begin to pay all its workers a Living Wage, and to insist that any organisation doing business with the Government also pays a Living Wage. Over time, we urge Parliament to pass a Bill which will make the Living Wage statutory across the UK and in so doing ensure that everyone earns a fair wage for a fair days work.",
