        "additional_details": "Former RAF Driffield is under threat of being demolished in way of 500 new homes being built by Strawsons property. The importance of the heritage of the former base is large for the local town of driffield and local communities and there have been several attempts to save it. RAF Driffield in its present state is derelict but if there were refurbishement to be done, even if it were by volunteers (myself included) it could open up many oppourtunities to the community. i would like the government to stop the demolition and commence refurbishment.",
