This addresses instances where individuals rely on a human right to undermine other human rights (for example where an individual issues a death threat).\r\n\r\nSo lets change the passport and status system to have Nationals, Citizens and Others.\r\nNationals & Citizens get benefits only, all others can have a family life here but we wont pay for it.\r\nNationals are those whose family can be traced in this country for 4 generations or greater than 150 years and they get all benefits.\r\nCitizens only get benefits if they do not break and serious laws. Foreigners can only get citizenship if they sign an agreement to that effect. And they get deported if they break any serious laws along with their families.",
