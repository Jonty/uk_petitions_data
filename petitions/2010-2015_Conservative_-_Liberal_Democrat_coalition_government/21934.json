        "additional_details": "For too long MP's that the British public vote into the house of commons to represent us go against us and do their own thing. No one can say that we would have failed to get 200,000 signatures for a referendum on the European union. 80% of British people wanted a referendum yet the MP's we voted in think they have more right than we (the people) do. It is time that we take back powers that we deserve. Of course some petitions with 200,000 signatures aren't acceptable but the government should have no right to discard petitions that meet the criteria. So the ones that meet the criteria like a referendum on the European Union should result in an automatic referendum because we are the public and we should have the say. Member's of Parliament are supposed to represent us not over power us. It is time we had our say. ",
