Then the British taxpayers can decide when to sell their shareholding and at what price.\r\n\r\nThe distribution could be equally across all tax payers or pro-rata,based on tax payed over the period of ownership.\r\nThe important thing is that it is the British tax payers, not the city stock brokers, who will have the opportunity to profit from the risk.",
