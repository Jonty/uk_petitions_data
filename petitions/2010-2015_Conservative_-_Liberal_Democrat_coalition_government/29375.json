        "additional_details": "End housing associations use of Ground 8 when seeking possession for rent arrears\r\nSome housing associations are continuing to choose to seek possession for rent arrears using the mandatory Ground 8 under the 1988 Housing Act. This prevents judges from using their discretionary powers to take into account any mitigating factors such as outstanding housing benefit problems.  It also prevents advisers from negotiating alternative solutions which might avoid outright possession, homelessness and unnecessary hardship for vulnerable people.\r\nCase Law Court of Appeal ruling (North British Housing Association v Matthews (2004) EWCA Civ1736) has demonstrated that housing associations do not necessarily have measures in place to ensure Ground 8 is only used as a\r\nlast resort as required by the Housing Corporation.\r\n\r\n",
