        "additional_details": "I call upon the Government to appoint a minister to look after the interests of people in the work place who have a disability.  People with disabilities are often discriminated against in society in general and particularly in the workplace.  Particularly if their disability is of an invisible nature, like a mental health issue or a neurological condition.  If people with these conditions are doing their best to hold down jobs and are making an effort to contribute to society to the best of their ability then it's only fair that they are taken care of.  So please support me in calling upon the Government to appoint a minister to take care of the most vulnerable workers and others who have been medically certified as unable to work; it's only fair.",
