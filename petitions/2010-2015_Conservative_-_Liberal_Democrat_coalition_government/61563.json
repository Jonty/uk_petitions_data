        "additional_details": "This is a petition to remove David Moyes from his position as Manchester United. Since replacing Sir Alex Ferguson in July 2013, Manchester United have endured their worst season for over 50 years and he has also managed to upset some of the clubs star players like Robin van Persie to the point where they want to leave. Manchester United is extremely important to the UK economy as the clubs generate over \u00a3300 million in revenue every year through tourism, ticket sales, sponsorships and merchandise sales among other things, more than any other sports team in the UK. Manchester United are currently sixth in the Barclays Premier League and would now need a miracle to qualify for the UEFA Champions League next season. This will not just affect Manchester United and their fans but also the UK economy. Should Manchester United fail to qualify, they will also fail to attract the best players to England, which in turn will cause current world class players to leave.",
