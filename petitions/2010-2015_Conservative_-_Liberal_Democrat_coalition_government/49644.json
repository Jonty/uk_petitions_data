That means growth, immigration and welfare reform.\"\r\n\r\nDon't let the Conservative\u2019s panic over UKIP damage the fight against cancer.\r\nThis petition can help demonstrate that plain packaging IS a voter priority.\r\nThe Government MUST include measures to implement plain packaging for cigarette packs in the forthcoming Queens Speech.",
