At least until now this has been offset by an automatic entitlement to a freedom pass.  Imagine my feelings, when seeing the new application, all 14 pages.  The one piece of help that disabled people can quickly get is now being effectively  withdrawn from all but, those with a law degree.  This complex application should be simplified and speeded up at once.  So that the disabled avoid house arrest.",
