        "action": "Amend THE WILDLIFE & COUNTRYSIDE ACT of 1981 - Bats in the Belfry",
        "additional_details": "All Bats, in the UK, are protected under the above Act to preserve the species, which is understandable, but there does not seem to be a solution to the following true situation - Bats have taken to nesting in the eaves of St Hilda church in Ryedale, N Yorkshire, their droppings, which are acidic, are ruining the interior of the church & dispite cleaning operations, the church will have to be closed . It was hoped that a common sense approach would be found, but there are no guide lines .It is propossed that the Government amend the Act, to resolve these impasses for Bats & other protected species, so swift action can be taken before situations develope . It would also give the public caught up with simular situations (Bats in house lofts), a lawful procedure to take . Your support for this petition will be greatly appreciated . Thank you.",
