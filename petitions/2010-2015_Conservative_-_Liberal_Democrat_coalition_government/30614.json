        "additional_details": "The reason I am asking for support with this petition is simple; I feel as though the economy would be better off if cannabis was legalised, but still controlled. Opposers say it is bad for mental health, if cannabis was legal, the government can control strains and gain tax from cannabis sold. Tourism would improve, people would come world wide to share the experience of getting stoned in the UK. I estimate that today in 2012 that around 70% of people between the age of 16-30 have either smoke or are still using cannabis. I want the government to atleast consider the money saved from police raids, arrests, fines and court proceedings if cannabis was legalised. Please join my cause if you feel as strong as I do. ",
