They are currently no regulation on the dry houses, anyone can open one, in any area with no notice.\r\nOften people staying in dry houses relapse effecting the crime in the local areas.\r\nThese places should be regulated to ensure the people in need are getting the support they need, and also not getting fleeced by greedy landlords who pack these places with vulnerable people.",
