        "additional_details": "Not having the option to pay Road Tax by monthly direct debit forces people into criminal activity..... some people cannot afford to lay out a lump sum of money every 6 months or every 12 months.... spreading the cost across the year would help citizens to stay legal and generate a stable consistent income for the government and may possibly prompt more people to stay legal. All other taxes are payable by monthly direct debit so why can Road Tax not be? I would like the government to force the DVLA to offer the option and encourage citizens and residents to be legal with an easier option.",
