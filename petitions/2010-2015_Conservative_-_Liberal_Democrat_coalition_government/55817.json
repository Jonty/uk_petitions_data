        "additional_details": "This petition is for help on behalf of the unemployed and low-paid citizens of this country. We are hungry and we are cold. We ask David Cameron to realise that his citizens, the citizens under HIS care, are starving and freezing this winter. We are BEGGING our leader, David Cameron, for help. We want David Cameron PM to understand that HIS citizens, the people HE is responsible for, are in need of help. We urge him to STOP turning his back on his people. We would ask him to realise that the spare room subsidy is pushing people into private housing where the rent is 30% MORE than that of housing associations. We are starving. If the subsidy is not to be scrapped then I petition David Cameron to help those on benefits who have to pay this. This government has also taken away cold weather payments from those who genuinely need it. We ask David Cameron to ensure that EVERY person under HIS care has enough money to eat and stay warm this winter.",
