        "additional_details": "Angus Council have removed the children Chute in the Play Area near Winter Place in Carnoustie on the grounds that it is condemned.  They are not going to be replacing it due to lack of funds despite money being available for various tarting up and marketing initiatives in Angus leading up to any major golfing tournaments.  We want a replacement chute for the kids.  Opinion about this is very strong on the OurCarnoustie facebook page www.facebook.com/ourcarnoustie so if you feel our kids are getting a raw deal then please sign this e-petition.",
