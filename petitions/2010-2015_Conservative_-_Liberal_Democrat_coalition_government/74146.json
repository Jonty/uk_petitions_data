        "additional_details": "The current - and historical - tax situation is Central Government collects the major taxes and then distributes accordingly.\r\n\r\nMy petition is about truly devolving powers to the regions by making local authorities responsible for collecting all taxes and then transferring a per head percentage to Central Government whereby they can fund national interest only such as: Defence, Foreign Affairs, Monarchy, State Pension and others  (depending what is classed as national by voting). This would be the only situation that could be classed as True Regional Devolvement.\r\n\r\nPlease vote and please tell others, even if it is only discussed.",
