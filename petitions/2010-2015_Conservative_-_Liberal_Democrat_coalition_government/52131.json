        "additional_details": "I'm sure there are so many young people that find car insurance a bit too pricey. I know the government has already done something about it, But I feel it isn't enough. My average quote is about \u00a34,000 and I'm not trying to insure stupid cars, things like ford capri, or a VW beetle or a vauxhall corsa. I'm almost 21 and I don't have a licence yet, but seeing all these stupid prices is putting me off leaning to drive. I for one want it lowered alot more and I am sure you all do too.\r\n\r\nPlease help my cause and sigh this petition, if we get enough people to sign the government will have to do something eventually, so please help.",
