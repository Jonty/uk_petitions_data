        "additional_details": "Issue:\r\nCurrently companies such as Huntingdon Life Sciences are performing barbaric experiments on over 70000 animals per year. This includes cats, dogs, and primates. All of these species are highly intelligent and are capable of forming strong emotional bonds with humans.\r\n\r\nWhile I can see a need for certain testing, such as for testing effectiveness of life saving drugs, this should NOT include vivisection of animals which would usually be seen as well loved pets. If a woman can be arrested for throwing a cat in a bin, then torturing and murdering thousands of kittens for science is clearly even worse.\r\n\r\nSuggested action:\r\nAt the least, restrict animal experimentation on cats, dogs, and primates to vital drug effectiveness studies only.\r\n\r\nPreferably ban all experimentation on these species.\r\n\r\nBan all lethal procedures on these species entirely, whether they are killed either during or after the experiments. (i.e. Animals should not be euthanized when no longer required).",
