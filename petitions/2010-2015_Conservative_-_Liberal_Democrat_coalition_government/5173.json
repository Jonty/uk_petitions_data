        "additional_details": "This petition for debate concerns whether there is a need for the Government to supply funding for the continued operation of Paddle Steamer Waverley . 3 failed summers and an increase in the fuel costs by 60% have severley depleated the cash reserves of the charity that runs the Waverley. It is part of Scotlands National Heritage offering pleasure to many thousands of people around the uk coastline. I would like the government to ensure the continued operation of the Waverley through whatever funding is necessary or available",
