        "additional_details": "Calls to the Crisis Team are not currently recorded, even though the service users contacting them are doing so to gain support for urgent and emergency mental health needs, and service users are often spoken to in a degrading and mocking manner.\r\n\r\nA mental health emergency should be treated the same way as a physical health emergency. Calls to 999 are recorded, it would be unthinkable for the case to be any otherwise. Calls to the Crisis Team regarding a mental health emergency also should be recorded.\r\n\r\nThis has serious implications, the caller may experience bullying or verbal abuse which can further traumatise them, and potentially cause the caller to do something dangerous. There needs to be evidence kept of those calling in distress to avoid needless suicides, and needless abuse and bullying from Crisis Team staff.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you agree.",
