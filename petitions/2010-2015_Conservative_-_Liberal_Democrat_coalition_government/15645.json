More and more men and women are finding themselves unable to purchase shoes in-store and have to face higher prices and limited choice online. Shoe shops may be saving themselves money by not stocking sizes above 12 and 9  for men and women respectively, but I believe the government should take action and negotiate with footwear retailers.
