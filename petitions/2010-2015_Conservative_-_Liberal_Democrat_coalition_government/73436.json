        "additional_details": "On Friday 2nd January, Channel 4 aired \"Jamie and Jimmy's Friday Night Feast\" during which there was an article on reducing food waste. The video interviewed a farmer who supplies supermarkets with vegetables.  40% of his crop ends up as animal feed or  more alarmingly, landfill, purely because the vegetable is not aesthetically pleasing.\r\n\r\nWith half a million people using food banks in the UK, this obscene waste has to stop.\r\n\r\nThe Government need to intervene to put pressure on all supermarkets to take ALL vegetables from farmers that are edible and not just those that are aesthetically pleasing.\r\n\r\n",
