The current ruling - if the deposit is not protected within 30 days of receipt the landlord could be forced to pay a penalty to the tenant of a greater value of the deposit. Which will result is tenant believing they have the chance of a win-fall. And making a claim through the small claims courts.\r\n\r\nIf the payment was made to the local council / government, no bogus claims will be made.",
