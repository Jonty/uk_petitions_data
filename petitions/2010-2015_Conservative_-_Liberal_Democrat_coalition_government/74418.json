        "additional_details": "We need to get as many people as possible to sign, the more awareness the better. It is a main road joining Emsworth to Rowland's castle.It has a very dangerous blind bend which has been part of many fatalities, including the most recent Joe Butland, who sadly died at the scene on September 28th 2014. My aim is to try and get extra road safety measures implemented to discourage drivers of all kinds speeding, to which will dramatically reduce the risk of accidents in the area and potentially save lives. i would love the governments backing and changes to be implemented on similar roads in our country.\r\nPlease show you support and sign this petition.\r\n\r\nThank You",
