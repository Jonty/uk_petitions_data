        "action": "Ban canines (dogs) except guide dogs for the blind on Buses in the UK",
        "additional_details": "There are many people who travel on the transportation provided by the government who bring their dogs on the buses. These people sometimes intimidate those on the transportation with the canine which is a form of harassment to the general public. They allow their canines to sit on the seats that are provided for the public which many canines leave their hair that has shed from their bodies on the seats.  Canines have legs to go for walks they do not need to sit on transportation for the public. Guides dogs are an exception they are needed for the blind to get around the city for their daily activities. Many children and many adults have a genuine fear for them and some have religious beliefs that forbid them from being near them. Therefore any canine that is not a guide dog should not be allowed on the UK transportation. Please sign this petition if you agree that this should be banned.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
