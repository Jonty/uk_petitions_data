        "additional_details": "At the moment companies don't have to pay any paternity leave if they don't want to. That basically means that if you choose to spend 2 weeks helping your partner you will only get \u00a3136 pounds a week. So over the course of 2 weeks you will only be entitled to \u00a3272 if you earn for example \u00a314000 a year you will lose \u00a3309 pounds!!! For someone earning that amount \u00a3309 is an unthinkable amount of money to lose. What if your partner has a cesarean section how can you leave them straight away!!! We all deserve 2 weeks to spend with our child we work hard enough all year long!!! This will not cost the tax payer any more as the companies who employ the parent will! My suggestion is the company pays the difference this will help a lot more fathers help there partners adjust to having a child or having more than the children they have already. Thousands of fathers didn't take there paternity leave last year and this needs to be addressed!",
