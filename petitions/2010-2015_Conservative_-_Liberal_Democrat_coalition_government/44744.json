        "additional_details": "ECOLOGICAL IMPACT... There have been many recent studies about the carbon footprint of one pet being equally as damaging to the environment as a motor vehicle with conclusions being that pet owners should pay considerably for this consequence. This would certainly help reduce the UK\u2019s national debt crisis. There are some 13 million UK households with pets. If they each payed \u00a3200 annual pet fee (similar to the cost of an average vehicle road licence fee) would bring \u00a32600 million into the treasury every year, hypothetically. ",
