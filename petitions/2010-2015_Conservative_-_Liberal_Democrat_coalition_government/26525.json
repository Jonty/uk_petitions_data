        "additional_details": "An increasing number of restaurants and \"gastropubs\" are automatically adding tips, or a service charge, to their bill, regardless of the quality of service. This leads to people paying an additional 10 or even 15 percent on top of their bill or being forced into an awkward confrontation.\r\n\r\nIn many circumstances this encourages lazy service as the tip is usually paid anyway, either because the customer either doesn't notice it, or would rather avoid the hassle.\r\n\r\nRestaurants should be forbidden from automatically adding this charge, so that tips become entirely discretionary, based quality of service, as always used to be the case.\r\n\r\nPlease join me in stamping out this arrogant attitude being adopted by more and more pubs and restaurants.\r\n",
