Expansion of Pinewood Studios will consolidate that excellence and provide thousands of jobs in the creative field, one of the few in which the UK still excels. Surely, the \"character of the area\" cannot be allowed to be the over-riding concern.The country desperately needs investment and jobs. If the DCMS has any real backbone, it will do something to overturn the South Bucks short-sighted and NIMBY-based decision. The British film industry needs your support. Please do something!",
