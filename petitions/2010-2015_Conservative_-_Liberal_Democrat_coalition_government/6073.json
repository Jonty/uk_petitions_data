        "additional_details": "Current tax legislation should be amended to the effect that Tax relief is allowed in respect of the Rental Cost of alternative accommodation against the Rental income from a single Property let due to relocation of the owner taking up employment in another location.\r\n\r\nThis would enable a more flexible employment market where employees are more able to relocate to where suitable employment exists and maintain a similar life style to that formally held.\r\n\r\nCurrently if an employee needed to relocate for work away from his own residence and sought to let his existing home and rent a property where he was able to find work he is disadvantaged by  between 20 and 40 % of the rental income.\r\n\r\ni.e. If Rental income of a 3 or 4  Bed property is \u00a31,000 less Management Fee of 10% = \u00a3900\r\nThen tax at say 30% leaves \u00a3630 which might secure a 2 Bed flat!\r\n\r\nThis obviously discourages mobility of the work force, not at all helping with the unemployment figures?\r\n",
