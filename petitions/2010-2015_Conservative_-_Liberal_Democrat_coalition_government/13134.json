Employers have their part to play in solving this by investing in the next generation of British workers. Government can help employers by redirecting job seekers benefits to enable businesses to create a fund for the delivery of training and retraining programmes for their employees - giving new and existing employees the chance to enhance their skills and job prospects and develop a long-term stake in society. Trade Unions can also play their part by working with Government to monitor these business-led programs.",
