        "additional_details": "Civil servants are always overlooked when decorations are awarded to commemorate events like The Queens Diamond Jubilee. Serving Forces personnel including Reserve Forces will receive a Decoration, in many cases, after a very short career and i am OK with this.\r\n\r\nBut Civil Servants, even after serving Her Majesty for many years, and i mean 25 years plus in a lot of cases, are ignored.\r\n\r\nI would like people to sign this petition, requesting that Civil Servants be treated with the same respect as forces personnel and be given the honour of receiving the same Decoration.",
