        "additional_details": "The fuel duty is one of the worst things to happen to this country for private motorists & businesses crippling many UK citizens.\r\n\r\nFrom:\r\nhttp://www.petrolprices.com/the-price-of-fuel.html\r\n\r\nAt 132.9p/Ltr, the duty is 57.95p/Ltr and VAT is 22.15p/Ltr; a total tax of 80.10p/Ltr. The cost of the fuel before tax is 47.8, so the tax rate is given by 80.1 / 47.8 X 100 = 167.57%\r\n\r\nAnd to make matters worse, we pay VAT on top of the fuel & on top of fuel duty so paying a tax on tax!\r\n\r\nOn the above example, if standard VAT (20%) was applied:\r\n\r\nThe vat is 20% so 0.10p/Ltr (rounded up). The cost of the fuel before tax is 47.8, bring the cost to the customer down from 132.9 down to 52.90p/Ltr.\r\n\r\nThis in turn will prevent many forecourt drive-offs, new businesses can then prosper and thousands of new jobs will be created, helping Britain's infrastructure & easing the benefits system. Can even scrap the road tax fee, and putting an extra 10p on top of the fuel price to pay for this.",
