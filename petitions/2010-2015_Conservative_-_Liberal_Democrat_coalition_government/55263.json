In Nairobi the muslim terrorists asked each person to recite the Koran and if they couldn't they were killed! Are we all burying our heads in the sand like we did with Hitler, we only realized that he was a madman until it was too late! Are we going to leave our children and grandchildren with the real possibility of being ruled by Sharia law, that's if we are not killed first for not believing in Islam! The muslim population is expanding and their aim is to eventually outnumber the rest of us. Are our elected Members of Parliament aware of the situation or are they living on a different planet to us! \"",
