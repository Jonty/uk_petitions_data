Not only do convicted persons cheat decent, hard working people in the first instance through acts of criminality but they then cheat them again by having their prison stay fully funded by tax payers.\r\n\r\nThis should not be a \u2018free\u2019 service and whilst it is acknowledged that they do lose their liberty, this still leaves tax payers out of pocket and this cost should be reimbursed.\r\n",
