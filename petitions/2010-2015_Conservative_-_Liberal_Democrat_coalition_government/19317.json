        "additional_details": "There are many in the UK who 'automatically' have Child Allowance foisted on them, but who do not need this allowance as they are financially buoyant.  They would not, through choice, request this payment, but do not know how to stop payments, or never get around to putting a stop to the payments.  I propose that an 'OPT IN' scheme be put in place, so that ONLY those in need would 'opt in'.  It is ludicrous that everyone, regardless of how wealthy they are, should automatically be paid this money.  Most wealthy, philanthropic people would not choose to have this money paid directly to them, but would rather such funding went to those who would best benefit.",
