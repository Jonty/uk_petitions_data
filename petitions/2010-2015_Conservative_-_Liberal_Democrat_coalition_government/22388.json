        "additional_details": "On behalf of the British people I request a debate in the house of commons which will hopefully lead to legislation to ban or prohibit AUTOMATED, PRE-RECORDED COMMERCIAL SALES TELEPHONE CALLS. When received in private, not only are these calls incredibly annoying, disruptive and presumptive, they are also invasive to privacy. In the workplace,  such calls are disruptive and hurt productivity.\r\n\r\nPlease lend your support to this petition.",
