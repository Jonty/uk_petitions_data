        "additional_details": "All children to have the same reading book relevant to their year ( Dick and Dora / Tom and Nora) starting from reception. All children learn a sentence a day and have to learn to spell a word from that sentence each day. ( Tom and nora have got a dog. So we would start with Tom then and then Nora etc.)  The child learns to spell and read. Tom on day one and Nora on day two etc. Teach children the alphabet before trying to teach then to read. It has worked for millions including me in the 1970s. Some families have one child some have seven. We need our children to learn the basics of reading and writing which is why we send them to school, some parents do not have the ability or time. Make education basics the same for all.",
