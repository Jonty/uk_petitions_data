The Paralympics has 1, Channel 4, (2 if you count Channel 4 HD). Paralympians have to train twice as hard due to their disabilities but the television coverage is minimal. It wont help this year but for following Olympic years we want as much television coverage of the Paralympics as the main event receives.",
