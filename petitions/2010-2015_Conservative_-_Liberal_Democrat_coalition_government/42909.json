With the increase in popularity of handmade and craft products, many people are selling to the public without registering as self employed, putting those who are registered and do pay their taxes at a disadvantage. This card would also allow members of the public to check that any trader they use to undertake 'oddjobs' or work on the home is trading legally too.",
