Those who are contracted less than 20 working hours are not entitled to SSP and lose their money if the get an illness that prevents them from working over a certain period of time. The government has not taken into consideration that those eho work less than 20 hours a week may need SSP when illness occurs such as the disabled, students and part time parents. This is unfair on those who are already on a low income. ",
