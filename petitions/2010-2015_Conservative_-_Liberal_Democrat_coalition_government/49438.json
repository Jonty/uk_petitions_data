        "additional_details": "Anyone who rings the DWP with a query has to listen to Vivaldi's \"Spring\" on repeat for 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nIf being unemployed or disabled was a choice, people would get jobs just so that they don't have to listen to it. You don't need Atos or workfare; this is bad enough!\r\n\r\nWe demand the government do one of two things:\r\n\r\n1) Create jobs so that people do not have to be unemployed. Give disabled workers support instead of closing Remploy. Give people who can't work the support they need instead of harassing them with Atos assessments. That way less people need to ring the DWP and we won't be kept on hold for as long.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n2) Scrap the Vivaldi hold music",
