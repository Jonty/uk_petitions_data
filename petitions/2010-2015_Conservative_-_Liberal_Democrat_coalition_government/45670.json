Credit card companies currently extend credit with little in the way of checks,  and are extending credit to customers who are addicted to online gambling and are already in debt because of it.\r\n\r\nTo some people online gambling becomes a strong addiction, that ends up ruining their lives.  Its morally wrong that banks and credit card companies are allowed to profit by extending credit to these people.  This extra credit only helps to fuel their addiction, and leaves them more in debt.\r\n",
