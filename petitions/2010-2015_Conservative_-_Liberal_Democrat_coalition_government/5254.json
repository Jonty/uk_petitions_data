        "additional_details": "Within the UK some public services are provided free to residents in some areas, whilst in other areas residents have to pay for the same services.  Typical examples are university education, car parking whilst in or visiting a hospital, prescriptions for medicine and care of the elderly.\r\n\r\nIt is wrong in principle that different pricing conditions should apply to residents within a united country, and this petetion calls upon the government to consider how this unfairness might best be remedied.",
