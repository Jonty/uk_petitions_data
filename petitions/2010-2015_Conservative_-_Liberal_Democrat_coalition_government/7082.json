        "additional_details": "I call on the government to enact legistlation or review regulations governing the use of class 3 mobility scooters with a view to making it lawful for everyone to use them.\r\n\r\nCars are choking our towns and cities. They are dirty, smelly, noisy and expensive to run. There are about 3000 fatalities per year due to motor vehicles.\r\n\r\nClass 3 scooters are virtually cost free to use and cause no pollution at the time of use. They are easy to park in towns and can carry a good amount of shopping or other medium sized items. They travel at 8/10 mph. They are the ideal urban runabout.",
