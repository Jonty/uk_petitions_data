        "additional_details": "Our prison sentences are much much too soft and don't have sufficient deterrent effect.  A rapist (who might be looking at an 8 year sentence) if he pleads early can get 1/3 off, and if he behaves in jail will be released after 1/2 his sentence has been served.  This means he will end up serving just over 2 and 1/2 years - for rape! So when a newspaper reports an 8 year sentence for murder it is not true.  Instead of halving the sentence for good behaviour and allowing criminals out on licence (they come back to jail and complete their sentence if they break the conditions of the licence) it would be better for criminals to serve the full sentence and then STILL be released on licence.  If they misbehave within a certain period they automatically get extra time in prison.  ",
