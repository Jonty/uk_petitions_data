        "additional_details": "The UK justice system is a joke, criminals who muder or rape could get as little as ten years in jail. What a brilliant way to advertise to criminals worldwide that they can commit thier vile crimes over here and get as little as ten years while somewhere else they could get a death sentence. Another problem is that criminals can easily get thier sentences lowered for simply confessing or stating they were affected by mental issues. Simply reform this joke of a justice system and punish judges who give such disgusting people such low sentences without reason. ",
