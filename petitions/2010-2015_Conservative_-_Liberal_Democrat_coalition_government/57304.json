        "additional_details": "A Public Inquiry is required, to give the families of the six Military Policemen the truth behind why they were sent out and brutally murdered that fateful day on the 24th June 2003 in Iraq. Sent out with very limited ammo and no communications, after they had been begging for the equipment. They were totally unaware of a Standing Order in place that no one was to be deployed in that area without the correct level of ammo & comms, which would have saved their lives. New evidence has come to light that the MoD knew of the planned ambush on them.",
