        "additional_details": "Since the beginning of the school year, the school (London Nautical School) has failed to find a Science teacher capable enough of handling demanding classes such as teaching GCSE Triple science. Since September, numerous supply teachers have come and gone, only giving work from textbooks. Marking has been a rareity in the whole school, making it more difficult for students to recieve feedback from teachers on how to improve their work. Other classes who have teachers are also dissapointed with the poor quality of teaching throughout the science curriculum. The whole acdemic year has been a shambles, and as the GCSE summer comes along, all of us feel left out of the loop.",
