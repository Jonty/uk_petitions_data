Children are being attacked in broad daylight on their way home from school and mugged and women sexually attacked or having their handbags snatched from them.\r\n\r\nThe only reason they say crime is down is because they are not being caught because there are not enough police to fulfill their role. Government cuts have meant an high increase in crime in our county. We want more police on the streets and we want our police stations back open 24 hours.",
