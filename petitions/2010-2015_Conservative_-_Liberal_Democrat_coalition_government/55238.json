        "additional_details": "We would like the government to encourage or enforce manufacturers and producers to ensure all labels on bottles, jars and the like are made of readily recyclable materials and do not leave non-removable adhesives on the surface. This will then allow the greatly increasing numbers of people who homebrew, make jams, chutneys etc. to readily re-use these containers. This will greatly assist in reducing waste and encourage the re-use and recycling of materials, thus reducing costs of landfill etc. It will positively impact in a number of key areas by reducing waste and be greatly welcomed by countless households",
