        "additional_details": "Do you or your partner have children at home and pay maintenance for a non resident child? The Csa take your children's child tax to pay towards the non resident child knowing full well that the  non resident child already receives child tax. Child tax is paid for us to support our children not to support another child that already receives child tax. Not only do the Csa do this but recently its come to light that if your child has a disability element that increases your child tax, the CSA will take that too! What a disgrace! This is discrimination against our children! Why should a disabled childs money benefit a non disabled child when the non resident child already takes either yours or your partners wages when we are given this money to support our children because as a family unit we can not support them on the monthly income.Sign our petition and help make a change!!",
