        "additional_details": "Under Sepp Blatter's stewardship FIFA has practised corruption ensuring the maintenance of vested interests. He has failed the football community at large.\r\nOn 16 November 2011 in interviews conducted by CNN & Al-Jazerra he stated that unacceptable racist behaviour can be excused by the shaking of hands.\r\nFootball & society must not tolerate such archaic & abhorrent views.\r\nThis petition requires the Govt to debate whether Sepp Blatter's position is now tenable & to call upon his immediate resignation.\r\nThe UK Government must now take the moral high ground and state its position in the strongest terms & thereby making it politically uncomfortable for UK companies to continue to support, by sponsorship or other commercial relationships, Sepp Blatter & FIFA in its current form.",
