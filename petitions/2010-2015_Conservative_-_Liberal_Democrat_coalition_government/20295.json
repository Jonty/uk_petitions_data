        "additional_details": "Many people find self testing of blood glucose levels is a vital tool to allow those Type 2 Diabetic's manage the condition better. This helps  reduce the need for medication, the risk of complications and helps improve quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe signatories agree with and support the following statement :\r\n\r\n\"Access to blood glucose testing should be offered to every person who has Type 2 diabetes, who wishes to test as part of the structured education that the present NICE guidelines recommend.\r\n\r\nThis should be an ongoing process to enable people with Type 2 Diabetes to manage their health on a permanent basis. There should be no 'blanket ban' on blood testing for Type 2 Diabetic's on 'diet only' or any other regime.\r\n\r\nThe provision of blood glucose testing equipment (meter's and test strips) should be the Patient's choice in order to better control their own condition and save the NHS the increasing costs due to uncontrolled Diabetes.\"\r\n",
