        "additional_details": "We are asking for your help to save Queens Park School. Queens Park School is a school for PMLD (profound and multiple learning difficulties) children. it is based on South Park Road, Lincoln. A proposal has been put in place for the closure of Queens Park School. We are campaigning to stop this happening as this school is an ofsted 'outstanding' school and a lifeline, family and community to our children. it is also the only PMLD in the county. Without this school, the children would lose their 'family and community' they would lose the magnificent ETHOS that comes with the school, and due to the childrens disabilities, it would be hugely detremental. Please show your support by signing this petition. many thanks. ",
