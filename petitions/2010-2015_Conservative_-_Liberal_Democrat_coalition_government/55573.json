We the signatories of this e-petition request the current coalition government to debate the above act and amend to allow trade union members to allocate the political levy portion of their trade union subscription to ANY political party they choose to nominate by their own choice in addition to their right to withdraw from contributing any political levy at all. Members subscription rates should be reduced in the later option.\r\nEmployment Tribunal representation is a big selling point for trade union membership. Most Home Insurance usually provides the same representation in their policy etc. Why do you want to pay twice?\r\nTrue democracy is choice, the current act steers the trade union member in only two directions! No real choice if they cannot choose WHICH Political Party they can contribute their 'Political Levy' to?",
