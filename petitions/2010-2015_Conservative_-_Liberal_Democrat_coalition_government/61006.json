        "additional_details": "Housing law allows landlords to evict tenants without having to have ANY VALID REASON whatsoever (grounds) - which could mean a good tenant being made homeless after only 2 months notice! Landlords also have the means to evict tenants where there are valid reasons - non payment of rent etc.\r\nI am calling for the removal of section 21 of Housing Act 1988 (which allows eviction without grounds) from statute and modification of section 8 (eviction with grounds). Modification of section 8 to be such as to make it easier for landlords who do have a really good reason to evict tenants, to do so without too much difficulty.\r\nSection 21 undermines all private rented tenancies. It makes it unattractive and unacceptable as a housing option for all people. It allows landlords to evict tenants as a retaliatory action if they complain about their housing conditions or simply because they do not like the tenant's hairstyle. It gives landlords the means to destroy a child's happiness on a whim. ",
