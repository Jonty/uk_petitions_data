        "additional_details": "We the undersigned urge the government not to reconsider the decision to award the West Coast Mainline franchise to First Group.\r\n\r\nFirst Group have committed to longer trains and additional seating which will mean 35% more seats on the line in five years. Promised a 15% reduction in standard anytime fares over the next two years, a pledge that would see the price of a \u00a3148 single from London to Manchester drop by around \u00a322.\r\n\r\nFirstGroup said it would add around 12,000 seats, with 11 extra trains, and new direct services from the capital to stations including Blackpool, Shrewsbury and Bolton\r\n\r\nI urge the government not to reconsider this decision.",
