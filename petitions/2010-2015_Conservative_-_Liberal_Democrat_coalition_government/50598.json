When they are well enough they will be tried and sent to the joke that is the UK jail. I purpose that UK national terrorists who commit crimes against the state should be tried for the death penalty. These people are not worthy of our prisons to keep spreading their sick messages of hate.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition so these sick individuals get what they deserve.",
