We ask that the government takes proper consultation outside the 'heat' of the current climate.\r\n\r\nWe feel that attempting to impose measures outside of the criminal justice system such as the removal of benefits will further disaffect a segment of society that is already disenchanted and cause more harm than good to social cohesion.",
