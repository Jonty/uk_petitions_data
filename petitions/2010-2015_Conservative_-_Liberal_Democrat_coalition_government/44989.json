        "additional_details": "There are at present  649 MP's each taking a salary of \u00a365,738 pa. This equates to \u00a342,663.962 per year (excluding their expenses) I have heard so many times from MP's, that they entered politics to serve the public! Therefore, I propose that all MP's should be paid the average national wage (currently \u00a326,500) and only rising thereafter, in line with inflation. I believe this will show the British public that the MP's ARE in politics for us the public, and NOT simply to line their own pockets. They should also be made to pay into a private pension, and not rely on a final salary pension. They MIGHT then UNDERSTAND what REAL people are going through. Thank you.",
