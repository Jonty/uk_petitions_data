        "additional_details": "This was proposed in the series Yes Minister in the 1970s. Unfortuinately it is not permissable to give the dialogue but it was, correctly, portrayed as a very desirable innovation. Quarter of a century later Parliament should at least get the opportunity to say why not --------- every  official responsible for a new project would have to list the criteria for failure before he's given the go ahead --- it's what's called the \"scientific method\". This means that you first establish a method of measuring the success or failure of an experiment. A proposal would have to say: \"The scheme will be a failure if it takes longer than this\" or \"costs more than that\" or \"employs more staff than these\" or \"fails to meet those pre-set performance standards.\r\n\r\n",
