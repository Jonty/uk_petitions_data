        "additional_details": "The rail track industry in Wales needs well developed and competent staff. It is therefore vital that the education industry plays its part in their continuous professional development and succession planning. The Sector Skills Council for the rail industry, Go Skills, has not yet approved an Apprenticeship Framework in Wales, although there is an approved Framework in England. Therefore, the Welsh Government is unwilling to fund rail track training because of the procrastination in ensuring the appropriate framework (and individual qualifications) is approved under the Specifications of the Apprenticeship Standards in Wales (SASW).  We need the government to act now, and to put pressure on the Welsh Government and hence the Sector Skills Councils to ensure these qualifications are included in the funding databases so that these rail workers can be appropriately trained and hence ensure the safety of the public, and individual workers.",
