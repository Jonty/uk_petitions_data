        "additional_details": "The Government is failing to meet the wishes of the electorate. The Government frequently decides on policy which the public strongly disagree with and public outcry has no effect.\r\n\r\nThe current Government is not a truly elected Government as the Coalition consists of the joint-first and third place parties. If any Coalition was to be created in the best interests of the nation it should have been between the two joint-first place parties- the Conservatives and Labour (this would ensure that the majority of the electorate was properly reflected). If this were not possible a General Election should have been called.\r\n\r\nThe Coalition has also gone as far as introducing primary legislation and policy not described in either party's Manifesto or the Coalition Agreement and in effect is making law outside of its powers and against the wishes of the electorate.",
