        "additional_details": "The government seems determined to push through HS2 at any cost, without any thought to the people affected by the route. My home is  outside the very narrow  band  ( 60 metres ) each side of the line and very close to the infrastructure  maintenance depot  at Steeple Claydon. The government insists that HS2 is vital to bring prosperity and wealth to this country.\r\nWhy should people such as myself pay the price for this folly . I ask the government for a fair compensation package to make up the shortfall in value lost due to HS2\r\n",
