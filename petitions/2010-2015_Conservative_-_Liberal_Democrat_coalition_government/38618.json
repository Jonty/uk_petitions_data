        "additional_details": "Unless you live in a country with a reciprocal agreement, pensions are frozen at the rate payable when you leave the UK. Why do some countries qualify for pension increases and others not? Both the State pension and any private pension remain liable for UK tax and yet by living outside the UK you are no longer a burden on the welfare state!! This is both unfair and hypocritical - it should be one rule for all and the fact that you may well have paid national insurance contributions all of your working life makes it a mockery.",
