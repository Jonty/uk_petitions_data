        "additional_details": "A hedge fund manager has recently avoided a criminal prosecution for exploiting a flaw in the oyster card system to avoid paying tens of thousands of pounds in rail fares for his commute to work. He avoided a criminal prosecution because he was wealthy enough to pay his way out of trouble.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned ask that the same level of justice be applied to this man as would any normal person unable to pay the out of court settlement, and that the CPS bring a criminal prosecution against this person; wealth should not be a means to subvert the rule of law, and as such he should be subject to the same criminal penalties as any other person. A fare evasion  amounting to tens of thousands of pounds should face a full criminal investigation, public exposure and if found guilty, a custodial sentence, just as a benefit cheat would face for misappropriating a fraction of the same amount of money,",
