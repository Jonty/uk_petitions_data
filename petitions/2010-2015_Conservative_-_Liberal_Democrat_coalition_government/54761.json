After all they have paid into the system.\r\n\r\nAnd as part of the deficit-reduction strategy, instead of coming up with solution to hit the needy, why don't you stop giving handouts to EU migrants such as slovakian gypsies, who seem to thrive on handouts, and are not interested in paying into the system. Just look into Firth Park/Page Hall Sheffield.\r\n\r\nFact, their is more money wasted in benefit handouts than saving on bedroom tax in the PageHall/FirthPark area of Sheffield.",
