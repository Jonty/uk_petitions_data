        "additional_details": "The government's 'Big Society' calls for more people to volunteer in their communities, and yet the salary of one member of parliament could pay at least six people's wages. What if politician was a voluntary position? I want the government to consider giving up their salaries, not everything else that goes alongside (pensions, reasonable expenses etc). Lets get 100,000 signatures to at least bring this idea into the public forum so it can be realistically considered.",
