        "additional_details": "I want a change to the Sale of Goods Act that would force retailers to display a copy on the act. The reason for this is that most people who work in retail are not aware of the ACT, or they try to dupe customers, when customers complain. If all retailers had to display the ' Sale of Goods Act 1979' then customers could draw retailers to attention to their rights under the ACT. I believe this would sort alot of problems out at source.",
