        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to force local council's to offer more support and facilities for grass-roots amateur sports clubs. There are hundreds of thousands of fantastic amateur clubs all over the UK promoting healthy living, integrating communities and giving children and adults a focus in their free time. However the quality and quantity of facilities available for clubs to use is not sufficient and people are missing out on opportunities to play sport. I am urging the Government to use influence or legislation to force local councils to make more of an effort to make sports facilites available to the community, and maintain those facilities to an appropriate standard.",
