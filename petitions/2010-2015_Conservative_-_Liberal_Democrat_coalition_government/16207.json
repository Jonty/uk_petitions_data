        "additional_details": "Given the public uproar after Bombardier lost a Public Sector contract to build trains we the undersigned believe it is time to reverse the UK's commitment to international competition and EU competition laws and make it a legal requirement that when awarding public sector contracts British people and British buisness' are considered more preferrably than non-British. The net effect of awarding public sector contracts to overseas competitors should not be understated nor underestimated. The effects include; increased levels of unemployment in the UK, increased number of people dependant on the benefits system, a reduced number of buisness' and a reduced manufacturing sector resulting in less tax being collected, and the extention of the trade deficite that threatens the whole economy. This is not about international discrimination or a step towards hollistic nationalism this is a sensible step that can only be benefitial to Britain and all who live in Britain.",
