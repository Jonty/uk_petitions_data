        "additional_details": "As we get older, our reactions and senses are not able to respond with the quickness we used to have. After many years of driving, we can pick up bad habits, or just not be familiar with the latest highway code.\r\n\r\nI propose introducing a compulsory driving test to be repeated every 10 years, in order to make sure the driver is familiar with any changes to the highway code, as well as making sure they are fit to drive. Those who do not pass will lose the privilege of driving, but will not be penalised for repeating the test until they pass. The test will be the same as the regular driving test or shorter and the cost the same or less.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to help retrain drivers, or to remove those who are a danger to themselves and others.",
