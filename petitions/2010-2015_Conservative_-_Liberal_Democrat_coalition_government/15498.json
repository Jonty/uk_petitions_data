        "additional_details": "It seems absurd and is somewhat confusing that the name used for the city by an overwhelming majority (within the city and worldwide) isn't the official name of the city.  The city's Royal Charter of 10 April 1662 states the official name is Londonderry. A High Court decision in January 2007 reaffirmed this after Derry City Council had considered initiating a name change. Several dubious equality impact assessment (EQIA) reports and consultative forums later and it was proposed that the majority opposed a name change. Time to revisit the debate and confirm or reveal the truth?",
