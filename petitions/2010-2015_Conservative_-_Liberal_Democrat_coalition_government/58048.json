        "additional_details": "With today's news that IPSA is to order an 11% increase in MPs salaries (without the agreement of Parliament), at a time when lots of families in Britain are struggling, we call on the House of Commons to establish a charitable foundation allowing MPs to donate any money that they wish. With an \u00a38000 annual increase in salary, if just 500 MPs chose to get involved, the foundation could raise around \u00a34million a year, which could be divided between charities that apply for grants. We are not calling for the salaries to be frozen, but for MPs that claim to be against such a rise, to donate if they wish and help others- actions speak louder than words. ",
