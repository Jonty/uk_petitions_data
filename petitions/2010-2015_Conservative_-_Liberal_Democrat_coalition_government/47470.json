Government to set up a new Public Inquiry into the tragedy that took place in Dunblane Primary School on March 13 1996 with particular emphasis on:-\r\n\r\n(A)  All the events relating to the tragedy of that day and into the associates of Thomas Hamilton.\r\n\r\n(B) The blatant cover-up, presided over by the Lord Cullen, in his mishandling of the enquiry as set up under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921.\r\n\r\n(C) The reasons why calls for a proper enquiry were rejected 10 years after the tragedy, by M.S.P.s,on the grounds of 'not working in the best interests of those affected' bearing in mind that it is long understood that 'victims of crime must not influence public policy or crime sentencing'.\r\n\r\n(E) The reason why Hamilton, who was not qualified to supervise children was allowed to take a dozen or more 5-11 year old children away to a remote island where they would have no contact with their parents for days or weeks at a time.\r\n\r\n",
