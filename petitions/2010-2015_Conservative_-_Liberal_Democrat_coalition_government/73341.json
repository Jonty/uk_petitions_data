        "action": "Improve Citizenship Education Provision in Schools",
        "additional_details": "I am currently a student and Head Boy in an Inner City School and am quite outraged at the sheer lack of Citizenship taught in schools across the country. Citizenship has been a compulsory part of education for a number of years BUT it certainly doesn't play enough of a role in helping young people to understand themselves, their purpose in society and society itself.\r\n\r\nHeads and other Senior Leaders in a large majority of schools either don't have suitable measures in place or just don't value Citizenship in schools - as a student who has appeared on national radio to discuss the issue and a teenager who's questioned John Bercow on his view on the vote at 16 for the BBC - I ask you to help this country that is currently failing its young people when it comes to Citizenship Education.\r\n\r\n Please sign this petition so we can get Nicky Morgan to do something worthwhile. It's my generations future that's at risk, don't let our young people down!",
