        "additional_details": "We have seen that cigarettes and liquor attract high tax because they are not good for health and society.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the 2011 UK riots have shown that the Rap music which glorifies drugs, sex and violence is also destroying the very fabric of this society. This kind of music has been a major factor for kids and impressionable youth to come on street and indulge in looting and violence.\r\n\r\nAs it cannot be stopped from production, we want the Govt. to introduce Bap-Rap tax to make it prohibitively expensive for people to buy it and thus reduce its circulation in the vulnerable sections of the society.\r\n ",
