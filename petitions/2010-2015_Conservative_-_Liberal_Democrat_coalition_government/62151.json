Turning licence fee evasion into a civil matter will increase evasion, it will make enforcement less effective (and more expensive) and the only result will be that those who do pay will get loss for their money, as more will be wasted in enforcement costs.\r\n\r\nThe UK is one of the few countries with a broadly balanced public broadcaster that is not subject to undue influence from the political or business class. Decriminalising TV licence evasion would be the first step of a slippery slope towards a US style media system where the media agenda is controlled by the big media corporations and their wealthy owners.\r\n\r\nA public service funded by the TV licence belongs to all of us, rather than a few privileged tycoons, and we should keep it that way.",
