        "additional_details": "In March 2012, the telecoms regulator Ofcom announced it had given mobile phone companies six months to come up with plans to introduce caps on customers\u2019 monthly bills. However, the companies, through a series of challenges, managed to avoid the request.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) announced that bill caps would be in place by the spring of 2014.\r\n\r\nEvery week you can read in the media that there are  cases of \"Bill Shock\" evident due to usually excessive data or roaming charges. The victims usually unaware that these charges are being accumulated until several weeks have passed when they finally receive their bill.\r\n\r\nThe Government need to take action once and for all. This problem has gone on far to long and in some cases seriously placing the consumer into a financial nightmare.\r\n\r\nThe proposed \"cap\" needs to be implemented soon.\r\n",
