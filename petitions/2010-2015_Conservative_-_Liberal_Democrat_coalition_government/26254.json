        "additional_details": "Lucentis is a prescription medicine which is used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration. Basically it can stop a diabetic person losing their sight. I want the government to make Lucentis free and available to any diabetic who needs it.  Lucentis has been shown to produce rapid and sustained improvements in vision for those receiving the treatment. NICE has recommended that NHS doctors do not prescribe the drug, which is injected into the eye, because of cost.",
