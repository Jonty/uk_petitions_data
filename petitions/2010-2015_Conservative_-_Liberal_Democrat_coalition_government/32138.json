We believe that this government is working against these interests and has increased the gap between rich and poor and has subsequently increased the number of people who are disadvantaged in this country by reducing job opportunities, reducing the level of security and by reducing health and social care for all.\r\n\r\nWe want Parliament to deliver a motion of no-confidence in the coalition government and believe that this should be discussed at the earliest opportunity.",
