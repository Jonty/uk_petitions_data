        "additional_details": "There are simply not enough police in Britain to deal with the atrocities of the riots and lootings since the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan. As much as they have tried their absolute best to stop the riots, they are outnumbered at every borough concerned, and are not providing the country with the sufficient protection that it deserves. Innocent people\u2019s houses are being set alight, family businesses are being destroyed within seconds, and innocent bystanders have been subjected to mindless, brutal attacks. On behalf of the public, we would feel much safer if the British Army were called in to deal with the riots, with a more heavy handed approach, whilst keeping injuries to an absolute minimum if possible. We think that it is time that the Police are given more power and authority, teamed with the British Army to fight against the appalling crimes witnessed in Britain recently.",
