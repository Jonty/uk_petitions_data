        "additional_details": "Currently there are 10 million people in the UK with some form of Hearing loss or, put another way, 1 in 6 of us has a hearing loss.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are many DVD titles available, many of these for leading Television shows, that do not have any form of subtitles in their content at all. This is unacceptable when many of these shows had subtitles at the time of broadcast.\r\n\r\nThis petition would like to see OFCOM required to enforce the inclusion of Subtitles within DVD/Blu-Ray media and publishers penalised for non-conformity.\r\n\r\nThis will help bring enjoyment to many people who currently are missing out and would be very welcome.",
