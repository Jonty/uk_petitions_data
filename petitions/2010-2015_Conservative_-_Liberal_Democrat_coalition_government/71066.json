        "additional_details": "As part of recommendations from the European Commission (EC), BSkyB was stripped of exclusive rights to Premier League (EPL) football and a proportion of rights were awarded to alternative providers.\r\n\r\nThe EPL are satisfied as they still sell packages on an exclusivity basis meaning customers who previously had access to all football matches now pay twice for the same level of service. Instead of breaking up one monopoly, the EPL have been allowed to create two by interpreting 'product' as being the EPL rather than the individual packages that they actually sell.\r\n\r\nThis is wrong and I would like DCMS to review whether UK football TV rights has remained a monopoly, and to force the EPL to sell each of its packages to at least two providers to ensure competition for viewing each televised football match.\r\n\r\nPrevious interventions by EC competition commissioner and Gordon Brown demonstrate this is a political issue and should not be left to the business model of the EPL.\r\n\r\n",
