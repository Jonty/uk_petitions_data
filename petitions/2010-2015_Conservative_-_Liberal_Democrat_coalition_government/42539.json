        "additional_details": "We the undersigned welcome the recommendations of the Leveson Report, and call for ALL of the recommendations to be implemented IN FULL. We note that the report is the result of several months of work and millions of pounds of taxpayers' money; it is therefore, illogical in these economically austere times and with all that effort, not to implement the recommendations. We also note, that the print media is not above the law, and indeed the Leveson Report calls for any statutory underpinning to include a clause to impose a duty on Government to protect the freedom of the press, this should provide strong protection against dangerous political interference in the print media from an independent regulator with statutory underpinning. A free press is vital for a healthy democracy however; the media violation of privacy and destruction of reputation is also the antithesis of freedom, which civil law proceedings such as defamation provide inadequate redress due to their expense.",
