This can only occur if assessment is done and a diagnosis made as soon as possible. It appears there is a 'postcode lottery' that determines waiting times for diagnosis with some families waiting over 4 years for a diagnosis.\r\n\r\n\"The Department of Health should implement a national legal framework where no family should have to wait more than 12 months for assessment and diagnosis.\"",
