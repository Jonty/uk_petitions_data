Mr Cameron must listen to the people that his Secretary of State affects the most and shouldn't allow Mr Gove to continue on his freight train approach towards education. Mr Cameron should make his views clear, taking into account how many teachers disagree with all of the rapid, and sometimes unnecessary, reforms.",
