        "action": "Make Mixed Oxide Nuclear Power the main sourse of UK generation within thirty years.",
        "additional_details": "Within twenty years North Sea gas will have run out and the UK will be dependent upon gas imported from the Middle East or Russia.   Renewable energy sources are never, realistically, going to make up more that 15% of our needs.   Carbon Capture is a theoretical concept that will probably never work on a large scale and will still make the UK dependent upon imported  coal and oil.    This petition urges the government to commit the UK to building enough nuclear power stations to provide at least 80% of its mains power within the next couple of decades.     To do this effectively the stations must use Mixed Oxide fuel so that all the Uranium can be utilised, not just 5%.",
