        "additional_details": "Black Friday sales of 2014 have brought out the absolute worst out of the people in this country . Fighting , pushing and confrontations all seem to be par for the course . The strain this event puts on local police forces is unnecessary and I feel that the likes of tesco and Asda have put their profits ahead of the safety of the public. I would like to see the government review how retailers are conducting themselves in the run up to this event and all other similar sales to ensure we are not reading about a fatality at what should be an enjoyable time of year",
