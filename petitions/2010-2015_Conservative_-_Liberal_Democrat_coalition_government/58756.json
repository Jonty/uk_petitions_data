This is when the application has approved, and the problems single parents face if the surname is different when they go on holiday.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to consider, in cases of a child under 18, putting both parents names in their passport.\r\n\r\nThis is due to single/separated/divorced parent's, who have a different surname from their children (often marital name or Father's name), being stopped going on holiday.\r\n\r\nBoth parent's can be named, and then should either one take the child on holiday, upon presentation of a passport we would not have this problem.\r\n\r\nYou should not have to take a child's birth certificate, or your divorce papers on holiday, to prove you are related to the child!\r\n\r\nPlease consider this. It is only 2 lines, but it would make a huge difference, the details are included on the form anyway, It can't be that difficult to print them.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading. ",
