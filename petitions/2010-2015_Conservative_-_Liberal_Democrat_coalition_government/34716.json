        "additional_details": "The government should withdraw funding from any sport that, without justifiable reason, refuses to include in their olympic team athletes best placed to win medals.  For example GB Taekwondo refuse to include the world No1 in their olympic squad, replacing him with the World No59.  The public fund smaller sports upon the expectation that they win medals at major events or if not that, that their athletes show improvements towards that goal.",
