        "additional_details": "Mr. Jahan's powerful and dignified appeal for calm following the death of his son and two other young men most likely prevented an escalation of violence within the West Midlands area. He demonstrated the civic mindedness that many of us witnessing the recent civil unrest see to be lacking in many young people. Let's hold Mr. Jahan in the highest esteem and show British children how highly we value his courage and sense of citizenship.",
