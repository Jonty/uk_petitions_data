I strongly believe that this should be banned, no one should be allowed to go on public transport, to local shops and generally going about their daily business blatantly wearing items of bed wear. What would happen if David Cameron and Nick Clegg suddenly started running the country wearing their paisley jimjams in the cabinet office. ",
