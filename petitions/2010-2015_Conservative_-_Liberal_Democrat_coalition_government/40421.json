        "additional_details": "In 2011/2012, the NHS litigation bill rose to a staggering \u00a31.33 Billion, of which \u00a3230 million went on lawyers' fees.\r\n\r\nBy any measure, that is a huge amount of money not being spent on treating the sick and needy.\r\n\r\nThe remainder benefits a few unfortunate victims but in a staggeringly inefficient manner - an award of millions will result in hundreds of patients losing out on life saving treatments for the sake of one person's care.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the fear of litigation is creating a culture where staff cannot openly admit mistakes and learn from them, and where patients' families cannot receive an honest apology - because doing so may open them up to liability and compensation claims.\r\n\r\nImmunity from litigation would keep all of the money in the system and help create an open culture where mistakes can be admitted and learned from - fixing problems quickly and saving lives.\r\n\r\nIt will also create a system where treatment is based on need, not blame.",
