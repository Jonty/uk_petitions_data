One exception is the benefits to be stopped by those who are convicted of Rioting. This is exceptional as it was advertised in the media and over the internet.\r\nAlso it is clear there are many e petitions that are similar if not the same, I have has my ideas rejected because of this it must be some ideas are not checked and get through.\r\nI feel all e petitions should be considered if they get 100 votes in support this is an achievable number to be considered many good ideas which would help this country are being over looked due to bad administration and impossible high number to go to MPs.\r\n",
