We support a blurring of this sharp distinction with consent being able to be given by people within 2 years of age of each other for intercourse and other sexual activity regardless of age, in order to decriminalise these children. Also a full review should be made of what the age of consent should be and the sex and relationship education we are giving our children; perhaps using examples from the rest of western Europe where both the age of consent (13-18) and sex and relationship education vary widely.",
