        "additional_details": "The London's growth in the last decade has resulted in housing spilling over the green belt into areas not protected.  This development has not been centrally managed and resulted in poor transport, infrastructure, and lack of homes.\r\n\r\nA review of the green belt land would allow the more appropriate designation and prevent the current system of simply failing which will result in Green Belt being removed.\r\n\r\nThe plan for revision should include;\r\n\r\nThe Green Belt to be increased to 12 miles wide (currently 6-10 mile wide).\r\n\r\nA corridor two mile wide should be created in the middle of the green belt to allow development of homes and infrastructure.  The two mile will allow development villages, and required infrastructure (road, rail).  This expansion should also happen as the current on existing green belt to allow minimal disruption to commutes just beyond the existing green belt.  A existing infrastructure be left as it stands on the newly designated Green Belt.",
