        "additional_details": "This petition is set up on behalf of small business owners but I also believe this would help the employment prospects for women.  Today holiday is accrued while on Maternity Leave. Whilst this sounds reasonable the practicalities for small business owners are far from this.\r\n\r\nWhen someone is absent from the business for 6 months and are then able to immediately take 3 weeks holiday it is not fair on their colleagues or the employers who find it difficult enough to resource plan around maternity in the first place. This is just another 'subconscious' reason why small business owners are reluctant to employ women.\r\n\r\nI would like to see the law amended so holiday is not accrued during maternity leave.",
