        "additional_details": "ITV has the rights to show the current RWC and the next one in England in 2015. Their coverage so far has been universally dull, flat and uninvovling, it's almost as if ITV look upon Rugby Union as a minority interest! It goes to show that when the rights to the RWC are up for grabs all that matters is how much money can be had from the broadcasters and not the quality of their broadcasts.The BBC's coverage of rugby is an order of magnitude better than anything ITV can offer. With current concerns about the health of the nation we should be encouraging youngsters to take up playing the game, with the BBC covering the RWC this would be far more likely to happen; they would capture the drama and excitement of a game which, at it's best, can be epic. As the Rugby World Cup is a major international sporting event I believe the Government should make every effort to ensure that our national broadcaster, the BBC is able to show all RWC games live.",
