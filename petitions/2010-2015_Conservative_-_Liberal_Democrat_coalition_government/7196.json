        "additional_details": "We, the under signed, call for the government to restore power to the police force allowing them to tackle offenders by all means necessary without fear of repercussions or investigations (within reason).  The undersigned agree that strong, robust action is essential to quell the unrest and anti social behavior that is swamping local communities across the country.  No more talking about it, emergency action is required to restore order and respect.  Currently the police force of the UK are unable to police in a way that is effective against criminals. A good example of recent trends is criminals posing as protesters.  We propose new laws that allow the use of force to detain and arrest anyone that is suspected of or involved in any form of criminal activity.  Bring back proactive policing, rubber bullets, water cannons etc.  Cut back on police paperwork, award tough sentences and give our police the power to punish those committing crimes.",
