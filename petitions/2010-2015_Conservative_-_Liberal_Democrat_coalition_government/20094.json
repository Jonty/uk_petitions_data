        "additional_details": "Utility contracts are those providing utilities to domestic properties and include gas electricity oil telephone water sewerage etc.\r\n\r\nIncreasingly suppliers use attractive initial prices to tie customers in to long term contracts typically 12 or more months.\r\n\r\nThese contracts inhibit customers from freely switching to the best available prices at any time.  They are against free competition and transparency in the domestic utilities market contrary to stated government policy.\r\n\r\nThe proposal to counter this is to make any fixed term conditions contained in contracts for domestic utility supplies unenforcible.",
