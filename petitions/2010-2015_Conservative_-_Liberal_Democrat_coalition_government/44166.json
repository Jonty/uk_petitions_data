The consumer already pays for line rental, connection charges and phone calls made, why does the consumer have to pay again when trying to do business with these companies.\r\n\r\nI want to see the use of premium rate numbers banned for public companies. If an individual wishes to pay premium rates for calling pornographic sites that is their choice, however why should the general public pay twice to carry on essential normal day to day business.\r\n",
