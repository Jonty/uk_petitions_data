None of them should be allowed to claim any benefits until they have paid into the system for at least ten years and they must meet the following criteria: -\r\n\r\n\u2022Full medical insurance for themselves and family which should be maintained for the full ten years.\r\n\r\n\u2022Unemployment insurance also to be maintained for the full ten years.\r\n\r\n\u2022A job.\r\n\r\n\u2022Somewhere to live.\r\n\r\nThey should also be expected to learn English and, until they do, be able to pay for any translation that they require and to integrate fully into our society.\r\nImmigrants who break the law should be deported along with their family if it is believed that they would become a burden on the state.\r\n",
