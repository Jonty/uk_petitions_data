These thugs have ruined the lives of countless innocent people, destroyed their homes, places of work and communities. I urge that anyone convicted of rioting and looting be given the strongest possible sentence for their crime and given no hope of early release, They should also be made to work  to restore the communities they have destroyed until the damage has been completely repaired.",
