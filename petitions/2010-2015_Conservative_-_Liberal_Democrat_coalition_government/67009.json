        "additional_details": "Earlier this year the Co-op supermarket won, on appeal, their planning application to build a crematorium on farmland right next to Stoneygate primary school, Great Glen, Leicestershire.\r\nThrough extensive lobbying and overwhelming local opposition Harborough Council refused the initial planning application.\r\nTwo separate applications for crematoriums have also been submitted within a six mile radius of Great Glen.  Both the Great Glen and Countesthorpe applications were refused but  have now been granted approval through the appeal system. We are now in the ridiculous position of potentially having three crematoriums constructed within six miles.\r\nThat aside, it is simply not a suitable or appropriate location in proposing a crematorium next to a school. Please sign this application and ask your friends to support our school and the village community of Great Glen. ",
