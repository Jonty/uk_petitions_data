        "additional_details": "There has been a recent alteration in the succession to throne law in the UK. Originally the first boy born would inherit the crown.The recent change states that that the first born child be it boy or girl would become monarch. To me a 1000 year tradition should be kept alive and if it was not for this rule we would have a completely different monarch on the throne today. It should not be altered now.",
