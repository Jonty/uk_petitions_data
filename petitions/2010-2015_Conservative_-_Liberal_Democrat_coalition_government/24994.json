It should be compulsory for all MPs to hold surgery at least once a month so that the constituents they represent can make them aware of any issues they consider important. MPs who are genuinely too busy to do this (such as Cabinet Ministers) should be exempted but must regularly send delegates to meet their constituents on their behalf.",
