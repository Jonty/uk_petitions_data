        "additional_details": "After a campaign of murder and persecution against the Igbo people in Nigeria, the state of Biafra attempted to secede from Nigeria. The Government of the United Kingdom provided diplomatic support and was the largest supplier of arms to the Nigerian Government during the Biafran war. Over a million people, mainly Igbos, died during this terrible and unnecessary war. The present day British Government should apologise to the Igbo people for their complicity in the deaths of so many innocent people.",
