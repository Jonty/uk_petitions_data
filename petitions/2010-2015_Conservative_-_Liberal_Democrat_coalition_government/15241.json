This country can no longer afford this and it is causing unrest and anger for the tax payers who have to fund it.  Renegotiate with EU to reduce amounts and increase time they have to live in this country before receiving benefits.  For non EU citizens no benefits until they have built up rights by paying income tax for say 5 years and no free housing.",
