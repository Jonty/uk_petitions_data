        "additional_details": "Football highlights are hard to find. They are taken down from sites like Youtube and programs like Match of the Day aren't allowed to stay on the BBC iPlayer website. Fans have to look to third party sites for highlights and made to feel dirty for it.\r\n\r\nThis is unacceptable, as it often leaves the fan who missed a game (and the highlights aired) unable to see his or her team's highlights. As the nation's favourite sport, it's understandable that live games should be premium, but football highlights should be free to view for all. ",
