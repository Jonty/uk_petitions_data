        "additional_details": "Excluding input towards European Space Agency, the United Kingdom does not invest in a space programme.\r\nThis has to change despite other more apparent matters Parliament faces.\r\nI strongly believe along with many others that Britain having a space program would bring great prosperity and extended pride across the Nation and the Commonwealth.\r\nAs a student of 16, I am wanting to voice my opinion on this because - along with many other Britons - believe Britain should embrace the space age if we are to remain a strong and influential country as we always have been.\r\nBy starting even a small United Kingdom space agency, a large amount of jobs will be created within the nation that can utilise many people who are currently looking for a job.\r\nI believe I speak for the youth in this matter as many of us are intellectually curious astronomically and it saddens us to see such a great country like ours sit on the sidelines as oppose to Canada; United States; Belgium and so forth. Thank You.",
