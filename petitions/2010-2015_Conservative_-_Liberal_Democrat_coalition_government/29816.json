It is in the utility companies' interests to maintain credit balances; this is to the detriment of the account holder who loses the benefit of the money thus taken.\r\n\r\nWe would therefore ask the UK Government to require Utility Companies (Telecom, Gas, Electricity and Water) to pay a commercial rate of interest on any Security Deposits required and on all Credit Balances over \u00a320.00 to the Account Holder.",
