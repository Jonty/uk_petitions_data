Ofqual is conducting a review of the awarding of GCSEs in English, following the concerns expressed by many schools, parents and pupils about the setting of grade boundaries in these GCSEs in January and June this year.\r\n\r\nOfqual published an initial report of its findings on 31 August which is available at http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/news-and-announcements/130-news-and-announcements-press-releases/972-ofqual-report-on-gcse-english-results-finds-january-assessments-were-graded-generously.\r\n\r\nThe report found that examiners had acted properly and set the grade boundaries using their best professional judgment, taking into account all the evidence available to them.  The June grade boundaries were properly set and candidates\u2019 work properly graded.\r\n\r\nOfqual is now looking at why some schools, but not others, got the results they expected, and will produce a final report in October.\r\n\r\nThe Education Select Committee heard evidence on this matter from head teacher representatives, Ofqual and the Secretary of State on 11-12 September, and has asked further detailed questions of Ofqual.  The Government has no plans to set up a full enquiry, given the on-going investigation by the independent regulator and the Select Committee\u2019s interest.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.",
