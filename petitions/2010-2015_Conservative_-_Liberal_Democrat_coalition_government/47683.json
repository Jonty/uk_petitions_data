When a critical portion of a community is immunized against a contagious disease, most members of the community are protected against that disease because there is little opportunity for an outbreak. Even those who are not eligible for certain vaccines\u2014such as infants, pregnant women, or immunocompromised individuals\u2014get some protection because the spread of contagious disease is contained.\r\nVaccination against measles should be made mandatory.\r\n\r\nFailure to vaccinate children should result in them not being allowed to attend nurseries, schools or areas where they interact with other children or pregnant/ nursing Mothers.\r\n\r\nVaccines can prevent outbreaks of disease and save lives. If you\u2019re not part of the herd, you\u2019re part of the problem.\r\n",
