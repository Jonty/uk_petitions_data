        "action": "Keep the extended Olympic train/tube operating hours in London",
        "additional_details": "London's claim to be a true International Capital is held back by the relatively early closing times of its major public transport hubs. In some parts a last tube or train departs the capital for the suburbs before 1am (in others well before midnight) and this puts people off spending an evening in the city for worry about getting home. Unfortunately night buses are very slow and black taxis expensive over the distances involved, so this invariably leads to an increased use of unlicensed taxis. I therefore urge the government to keep in place the current Olympic / Paralympic operating times. This gives a large number of people the opportunity to get home quickly and safely on trains or the tube an hour or so later than usual. I appreciate this might be a further burden on our transport workers and they should be suitably rewarded for any permanent change, but this small amendment would enhance London.",
