        "additional_details": "This is a petition to ask the UK Government to use its power to:\r\n\r\n1. assist with the clean-up and repair at Fukushima as much as possible\r\n\r\n2. ask other world governments to do the same\r\n\r\n3. Put pressure on Japan to properly spend the funds raised for the Fukushima cause, instead of directing the money into other unrelated projects including whaling. (If this worrying misdirection of funds is properly addressed we may see an increase in the money raised internationally to help avoid global disaster)\r\n\r\nJapan is a proud nation and will probably not ask for help until it is too late. Now is not a time to cut deals over who in the world is going to pay for the clean-up or who is to blame for the disaster. Now is a time for all governments (UK included) to take action to avoid great damage to the entire planet.\r\n\r\nWe all breathe the same air and drink the same water. Sign now; help put pressure on our government to do the right thing. We cannot put a price on our environmental future!",
