The system of bsl in place at the moment clearly isn't working and is not beneficial to either the owners of dogs, the dogs themselves or the government, it hasn't stopped or even lessened the number of dog related injury or fatality and more and more innocent owners are having their family members taken and killed for their dogs appearance, it needs to stop, please take note and sign to help save any more animals being killed for how they look ",
