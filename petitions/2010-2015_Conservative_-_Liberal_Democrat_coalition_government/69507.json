        "additional_details": "The Government's current target for the percentage of people going to university is at a ridiculous 50%. This is not sustainable and in recent years, tutition fees have been tripled to \u00a39,000 which is clearly far too much. The Conservative Universities Minister, David Willetts, has not ruled out raising tuition fees. Now, students only begin to pay off their student loans when they are earning at least \u00a321,000 and so many who got to university and do not work hard get tuition free but those who work hard don't.\r\nBy signing this e-petition, you agree that tuition fees in England are too high and should be reduced and then scrapped and that we should introduce and endorse more apprenticeships.",
