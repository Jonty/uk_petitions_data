This war has already laster longer than the second world war and, history tells us, it was doomed from the start. The Afghan government is totally corrupt and the their President has indicated we are not wanted there. We are now part of the problem - not the solution. The decision has already been made to withdraw in 2 years time - there is now no reason to delay. There are already enough Afghan troops and police to let them train up the remainder.",
