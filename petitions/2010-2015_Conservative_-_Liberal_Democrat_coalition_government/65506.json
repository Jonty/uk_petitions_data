        "additional_details": "Leaseholders across England & Wales are being persecuted by greedy commercial landlords and their legal teams together with managing agents that these commercial landlords either own or control, mainly in blocks of apartments.\r\nMany of these apartment blocks are sold on long leases typically of 250 years from councils across the country to commercial investors who buy them just to monetise these sites. They then hound leaseholders, including poor elderly and vulnerable leaseholders (some,  to death) to earn as much money out of them before selling on to another monetising money grabbing set of hoodlums.\r\nWhy are our councils selling these sites to commercial outfits on long leases who then typically resell with only a 125 year lease?\r\nIf you have had enough of being fleeced please sign now. Share and ask fellow leaseholders to sign also.",
