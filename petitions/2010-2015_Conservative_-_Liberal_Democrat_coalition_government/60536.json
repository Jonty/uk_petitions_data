Army sources said a rescue was 'unlikely' as it would risk soldiers' lives. Instead the PDSA said they might give DaGarwal an honorary medal.\r\nIf animals are being used I in war, then treat them as soldiers in their own right and get out there and rescue it. And after that, stop using animals and then abandoning or putting them down. ",
