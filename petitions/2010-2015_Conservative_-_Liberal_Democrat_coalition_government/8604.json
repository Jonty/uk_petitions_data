        "additional_details": "This proposal is to re-instate a modernised version of National Service to provide a solution to the reform of young offenders.\r\n\r\nThe Forces are a no-nonsense environment that would teach much needed discipline and morality with the goal of turning young offenders into contributing, law abiding members of society.  This scheme would enable them to learn new skills across a wide spectrum of trades giving a sense of purpose.\r\n\r\nWorking closely with our education system, a program could be created where 16 to 21 year olds who have committed criminal offences or are a public nuisance are enrolled.\r\n\r\nNational Service could also be a voluntary option for those who do not have the qualifications to continue in standard education (i.e. College and University) or are unemployed and want to have the opportunity to learn a trade they can use in life.\r\n",
