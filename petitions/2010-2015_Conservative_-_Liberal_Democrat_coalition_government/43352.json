Although this may seem enough, take in to account if the student has a Detention or is kept behind or the class is delayed. There is also usually a warning bell taking off about 10 minutes off lunchtime. Really, at least 60 minutes is needed.\r\n\r\nThis also gives the teachers time to eat their lunch and then go out to do their playground duties.",
