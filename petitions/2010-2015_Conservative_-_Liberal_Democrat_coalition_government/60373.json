        "additional_details": "While the success of the funding for elite level sport cannot be denied, certain sports cannot function without money, the no compromise approach is a draconian way to look at things, success should not just be about medals but about progression also, particularly for team sports where it is much harder to pick up medals, what I am suggesting is a minimum level of funding for all sports, just so they have enough to keep going, better results relate to a higher increase in funds, without money these sports have no hope of achieving greatness surely a much fairer way to approach things and won't kill of those sports that need it. Thank you ",
