In exceptional circumstances an alternative representative could be sent , but only if unavoidable, eg parent ill in hospital etc. The magistrates/judge should be entitled to at least interview the parents informally to ascertain whether their role in parenting the child is a matter which needs to be addressed alongside any penalty for the child.",
