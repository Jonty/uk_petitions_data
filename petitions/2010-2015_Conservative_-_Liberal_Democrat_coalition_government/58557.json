        "additional_details": "Puppy farms are a type of animal cruelty and should be stopped.\r\n\r\nEvery single one in the UK should be closed down and never re opened. It should be made illegal to keep puppies in dirty, dark, smelly pens with minimal food and water. Enough food and water to keep them alive, just, but not enough food and water to keep their bodies healthy and their organs functioning properly. They sit, sleep and walk around in their own faeces and urine spreading bacteria to other puppies and are prone to bone cancers, arthritis, hip dysplasia and general health problems.\r\nThey don't see day light, run or play. They suffer from day 1.\r\n\r\nTHEY ARE LIVING CREATURES.\r\n\r\nWe need to stop the parents of the puppies having their bodies abused, litter after litter after litter until their womb is destroyed and they cannot physically cope any more. They are then euthanised or dumped in local fields to die.\r\n\r\nStop this cruelty, stop puppy farms.",
