        "additional_details": "This e-petition calls on the UK Government to address the concerns of young people about expensive bus fares, following the British Youth Council campaign and the UK Youth Parliament\u2019s debate in the House of Commons Chamber based on a ballot of 65,000 young people across the UK.\r\n\r\nYoung people across the UK currently face a postcode lottery of expensive bus fares \u2013 many don't receive concessionary fares and get child fares until they are 16. On top of this, many existing concessionary schemes for young people are being cut as a result of cuts to local authority budgets for transport.\r\n\r\nWe need the UK Government to work with bus providers and local authorities to make sure that there are cheaper bus fares for young people, concessionary schemes, and standardised child fares for those aged 16 and under. We need to make sure bus fares don\u2019t affect our ability to get to college or get a job. Our generation can\u2019t afford to miss out on opportunities because bus fares are too expensive.",
