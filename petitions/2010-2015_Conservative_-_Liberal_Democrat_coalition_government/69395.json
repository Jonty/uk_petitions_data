        "additional_details": "To prevent the naming of any warship being named after the City of Plymouth. Based on the blatant disregard for the City of Plymouth\u2019s true Naval Heritage. Since 1988 and the decommissioning of \u201c HMS Plymouth \u201c a fitting memorial to those who gave their lives during the Falklands War. One of the last warships built in Devonport , with a vibrant and important history and ties to this city, the last surviving Type 12 Frigate from the Falklands War and indeed the last surviving Type 12 Frigate.  This city has done nothing to promote it\u2019s Naval Heritage or indeed shown any interest ( other than for one year of berthing of HMS Plymouth ( in Milbay Docks ) in saving it\u2019s Naval Heritage.  To be quite frank this City is not deserving of the name Plymouth to be given to any of Her Majesty\u2019s Warships until it can prove without any doubt what so ever that it has earned the right to have a warship named after it.\r\n\r\n",
