These works amounted to a cost of \u00a3800,000 to the taxpayer.\r\n\r\nAn investigation was undertaken by a Designated Independent Person (DIP) and following this 3 senior officers left (2 under compromise agreements receiving a payout).\r\n\r\nIt has since been revealed that the investigation cost a further \u00a3225,000.\r\n\r\nThe Council refuses to publish in full the report of the DIP.\r\n\r\nThe DCLG should force the Council to publish this report.\r\n\r\n",
