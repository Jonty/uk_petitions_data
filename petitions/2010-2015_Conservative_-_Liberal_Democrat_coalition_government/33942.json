        "additional_details": "As from 5th May 2012, 3 people have died in holiday resorts in Spain in the past month from balcony related incidents, not to mention all the other deaths and injurys that happen to british holiday makers when away in Spain.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to raise awareness and to bring to the governments attention the lack of health and safety in these resorts.\r\n\r\nOf course people may argue that there is too much alcohol consumption that goes on in these resorts, this does happen but the point of this petition is to make people think twice when they go away, if we can even stop one person dying then this petition will be worth it.\r\n\r\nIf you are going away to these resorts this year, please be careful, by all means have a good time but think twice before you do anything silly. If you are a parent then please pass this on to your sons or daughters.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading.",
