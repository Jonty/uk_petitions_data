        "additional_details": "Everyone passes through the current state education system.  Unfortunately for some, this education is not embraced for a number of social or personal reasons.  A large number of teenagers leave without any qualifications what-so-ever.  I believe it is the state's responsibility to show these teenagers another education through army conscription.  It opens the door on another possible career when the doors for many other jobs may be closed.\r\nFor those who leave school and have obtained zero GCSE's I believe army conscription should be enforced.  It provides additional incentives for schooling, it supports our armed forces and it provides another avenue for a career, discipline, respect and self-fulfilment that cannot be found through the welfare state alone.\r\nRather than being consigned to the dole queue I believe this is an opportunity to show another way to \u2018better yourself\u2019 when a formal education cannot be obtained or is wilfully disregarded.",
