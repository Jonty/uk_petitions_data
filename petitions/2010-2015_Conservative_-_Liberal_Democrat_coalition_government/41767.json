        "additional_details": "This petition requests a change to our approach relating to extradition requests to allow suspects to be tried in the United Kingdom when a request for extradition is received. This requested reform goes far beyond the current high profile case which has embarrassed our government.\r\nInstigating a sensible reform, this measure would also go to help protect United Kingdom nationals from extradition requests which can be seen as excessive in some instances such as the home secretary\u2019s recent decision concerning preventing the extradition of another UK national.\r\nIt would allow extraditing authorities to provide a legal case using correctly convened and recognised legal process negating any concerns about evidence and due process by local control. In the event of a conviction the subsequent extradition to the convicted persons home country can be negotiated for the serving of the sentence, within the human rights act.\r\n",
