        "additional_details": "Why should private landlords and agencies rent their properties through local authorities?\r\n\r\nWhy can't they manage their own properties?\r\n\r\nPrivate rental means the local councils are paying more to the landlord than renting in normal ways such as council own property.\r\n\r\nThis means landlords turn a blind eye to problems which the council don't deal with eg anti social behaviour. I'm sure if landlords knew the tenants other residents wouldn't have to deal with such problems.\r\n\r\nPass the responsibility back.\r\nI live on a private estate with one house rented this way. Everyone has had grief through this one property and we don't stand anywhere. No contact with landlady and council won't do anything. ",
