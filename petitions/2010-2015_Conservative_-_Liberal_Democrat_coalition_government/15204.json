The government are refusing to release this dossier because they know it will reveal the true state of HBOS at the time of the takeover. Vince Cable when not in power requested the previous government to release this dossier but he is the one now refusing to release it!\r\n\r\nI believe this confirms what we all know to be the truth and that shareholders were deceived into voting for the takeover of HBOS in order to save the British Banking System!",
