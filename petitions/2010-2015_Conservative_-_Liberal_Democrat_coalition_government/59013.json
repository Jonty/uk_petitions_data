        "additional_details": "Recent research states many young people now feel as if they \"have nothing to live for\". Youth unemployment is currently at an all-time low, with consequences such as increased violence, crime and mental health issues.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is compulsory supervised voluntary work for children in schools. Benefits include:\r\n\r\n1) Young people get a stronger sense of self-worth.\r\n\r\n2) The work will enable young people to be more employable. The diversity of voluntary schemes means that each student will have different skills and experiences.\r\n\r\n3) Reduced youth boredom with a choice of several projects or schemes (examples include planting/cultivating crops for the community or creating fundraisers such as charity gigs). A change of environment from the standard classroom setting will be seen as fun and exciting.\r\n\r\n4) Children learn the importance of compassion and kindness in 'follow-up' sessions involving explanations of how their work is benefiting society.",
