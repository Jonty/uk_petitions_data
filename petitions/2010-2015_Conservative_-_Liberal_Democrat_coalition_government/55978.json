EVERY person in a position of responsibility in the management chain above the officers concerned should be sacked immediately with no pension. If you are paid for a responsible position you need to take responsibility. The police officers them selves need to be locked away for the offence - a minimum of 10 years. Every case they have ever been involved in needs re-opening and examining, if they lied over this what else did they lie over?\r\nNothing less than this is acceptable, nothing.",
