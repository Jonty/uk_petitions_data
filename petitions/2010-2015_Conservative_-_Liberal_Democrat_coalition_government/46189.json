        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call upon the UK govt to enforce the existing Communications Act & other communications laws with regards to online abuse especially on social networks.\r\n\r\nThe Communications Act makes it clear that it is an offence not just for individuals to post hateful and abusive messages but, also that network or service providers should ensure that their facilities are not being used for that purpose.\r\n\r\nWe want the likes of Twitter to have to abide by UK law not flaunt it or indeed directly ignore it.\r\n\r\nAbuse targetted at UK residents should be dealt with by UK law not by spurious rules of a non-UK corporation.\r\n\r\nIn other words, make the social networking provider more responsible for how their network is being mis-used rather than turning a blind eye to abuse.\r\n\r\nOrdinary users should have the same protection as those of celebrities etc. At present, that does not occur in reality.\r\n\r\nFreedom of Speech should never equate to a Freedom to Abuse.
