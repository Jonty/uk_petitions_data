        "additional_details": "UK\u2019s aid (\u00a34bn) from our contribution of EU budget that goes to EU states to support the euro, agriculture, regional & social development, etc; should have been made from HMG\u2019s aid budget. In 2010, UK paid \u00a36.27 billion more to the EU budget than she receives. Of the \u00a3110bn EU budget for 2010, nearly half of which is allocated to agriculture & 35.6% (i.e. \u00a340 bn) to give financial support to under-developed and economically weak EU regions. EU is a trading block between sovereign states, not requiring a constitution or common monetary system. EU is a form of rule by dictation (as if Britain lost WW2), like the former USSR. Britain should not be coerced to support Germany\u2019s brainchild the euro. Britain has already supported the euro when UK voluntarily gives support (over \u00a37 bn) to Eire's euro woes. UK Parliament should remain sovereign in actual daily practice, not dictated to by EU commissioners, EU Parliament, EU Council of Ministers, ECJ, ECHR.",
