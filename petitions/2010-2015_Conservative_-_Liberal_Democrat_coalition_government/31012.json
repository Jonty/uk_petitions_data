        "additional_details": "The government should allow heterosexual civil partnerships and relegate 'marriage' to a purely religious ceremony which has no status in law.\r\n\r\nPeople could have a religious marriage ceremony, but this would not be recognised by law.\r\n\r\nReligious buildings could be licensed to perform civil ceremonies simultaneously to marriage ceremonies, so people could still have a traditional 'wedding' if they wished. Religious organisations should be free carry out same-sex marriage ceremonies at their discretion.\r\n\r\nThis would create a true equality for people of all sexualities and religions. Removing the outdated concept of heterosexual religious marriage from law and installing a new blanket system which would cover all partnerships between any 2 people.",
