        "additional_details": "large and small companies use non geographical telephone numbers (0844, 0845, 0847etc) as their only means of contact.  Most of the time we call these companies it is due to a fault on their part but with these numbers they deliberately keep us on hold longer, use extensive unnecessary telephone menus......why? because it costs a lot more money for the publc to call these numbers and they rake off millions from us calling them!!  They should be banned and only normal geographical numbers should be allowed!!",
