We want Government to step in and give inshore boats who fish within the 6 mile limit a fairer share of quota.\r\nCurrently 85% of our fishing fleet share only 3-4% of the UK Quota - this is crucifying communities and the industry.\r\nAlso:-\r\nDiscards need to be stopped.\r\nExperienced (fisherman) need to be employed in setting quotas for their area.\r\nArea IV needs sub-dividing to get clearer representation.\r\nFactory ships are unsustainable and need to be de-commissioned.",
