        "additional_details": "London's Council Tax Payer's funded the Olympic Stadium. How can it be right that West Ham are handed that stadium for no more than a meagre contribution towards its conversion costs (the majority again being funded by taxpayers ) AND also be allowed to keep all of the sale proceeds of the Boleyn Ground?\r\nAs a minimum measure West Ham should be compelled to return the proceeds from that sale to ALL London Boroughs in order to reimburse Council Tax payers and for the club to also pay a fair and commercial annual rent (amount still yet to be officially disclosed) for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThat an already wealthy Premiership Football club owned by private individuals should benefit so significantly from London's hard pressed council taxpayers pockets is morally wrong, wholly unacceptable and must be addressed.\r\n",
