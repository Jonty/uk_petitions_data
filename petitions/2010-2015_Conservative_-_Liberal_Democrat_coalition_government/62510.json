        "additional_details": "At present carers can receive Carers Allowance and work, as long as they do not earn more than \u00a3100 a week.  If they work 16 hours a week, they can also get Working Tax Credit.  Last years minimum wage increase took many working carers over this threshold, meaning a loss of \u00a359.75 a week in carers allowance (\u00a33,100 per year).  This years proposed minimum wage rise will mean more working carers will lose this vital support.\r\nWhilst a rise in the minimum wage is needed, the Government needs to ensure it adjusts the limits on Carers Allowance to take these increases into account and allow working carers to keep the essential support given by Carers Allowance.",
