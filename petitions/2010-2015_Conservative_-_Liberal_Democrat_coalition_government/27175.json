        "additional_details": "We ask the government to ban the sport of banger racing. Banger racing is a dangerous contact sport, usually resulting in the destruction of up to 100 classic vehicles in a single race. Surely it must be illegal under health and safety laws?\r\n\r\nCars are often stolen to race, and those that are not are usually saveable classic vehicles that are being destroyed. This is in turn destroying our classic car industry (recently recognised to be worth in excess of \u00a34 BILLION pounds per annum to our economy).\r\n\r\nThis is an anti-social sport, which has a history of being associated with criminal elements.\r\n\r\nWe would ask the government to ban any motor racing which results in deliberate contact between vehicles.\r\n\r\n",
