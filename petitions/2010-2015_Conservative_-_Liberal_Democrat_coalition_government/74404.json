        "additional_details": "After the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, this showed the world how dangerous nuclear chain reactions can be.\r\nIt may be clean energy, but the aftermath of a nuclear\r\nmeltdown is much worse. During the earthquake in Japan, and the Tsunami taking out the nuclear power plant systems, which made the reactor explode. Despite there being inspections on nuclear power plants, they can still be extremely dangerous if the cooling systems fail. I think the government should find other sustainable ways of providing electricity to the UK.",
