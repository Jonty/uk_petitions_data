        "additional_details": "Stop criminals from getting time let off if they plead guilty, i mean where is the justice in that. i was attacked at knife point and 6 years later the monster got caught, they had 5 years knocked of their sentence because they pleaded guilty. what is this world coming too. i am still suffering after all these years and i could honestly say i feel like i have done the sentencing and not the monster. the law needs to be tuff on these criminals. they should not be let out if there are murderers, rapist and pedos why should they do a short time and have a life after when they have taken someone elses. we need to put a stop to this and maybe if the prisons and sentencing were harder they maybe these criminals would think twice. lets make this world a better place and put the bad ones down",
