It is about time they were given the same protection as other coarse fish within the UK.\r\n\r\nCurrently people can catch and take as many of  these amazing fish as they want for the table, even though they are now considered good sport and an asset to the sport of fishing.\r\n\r\nIt needs to stop and be controlled Now!!\r\n\r\nLet's get over 100,000 signatures so that this will at least be looked at in the House if Commons.",
