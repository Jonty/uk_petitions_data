We believe that the work of Jehovah\u0092s Witnesses does not serve the public benefit, and is entirely self-serving. We also ask that the charity commission should take greater care in ensuring that all charitable organisations serve in the public benefit, according to the 2006 Charities Act.\r\n\r\nIf a thorough investigation of the religion were undertaken, it would be discovered that (1) the practice of shunning former members is rife, even among families, (2) the faith encourages the refusal of certain medical treatments, thus endangering lives, and (3) local congregation elders are empowered to internally police cases of child abuse, and dismiss and conceal cases that were not witnessed by someone other than the victim. None of the above practices are in the public benefit.\r\n\r\n",
