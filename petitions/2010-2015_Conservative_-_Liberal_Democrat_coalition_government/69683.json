        "additional_details": "The government should create a law abolishing all school uniforms as it is restricting our rights to a free education and free speech.\r\nMany people see wearing school uniform as infringing on their human rights. They feel that if they had the right to free speech then they should have the right to wear what they want at school unless it is inappropriate.\r\nShould kids also feel that they are going to prison in the mornings by wearing their uniform; it also stops their creativity in classes and could help parents with their economic difficulties. It costs a lot of money to get the right uniform and can sometimes put parents out of pocket. They say there is a right to free education but is this really free education!\r\nAt many schools you can only get uniform from a select few shops. If they are out of stock this is very inconvenient to families as it can affect the time and money spent on getting the uniform, and pose the problem of what to do while waiting for your order. ",
