        "additional_details": "Carbon monoxide (CO) is an invisible, odourless, tasteless gas. It is known as the silent killer.\r\nIt is produced from the incomplete combustion of fuels such as gas, oil, coal and wood.\r\nCO can kill in less than 3 minutes, and even low levels can cause serious health complications.\r\nIn the UK, 4000 people are affected each year by CO poisoning, 50 of which result in death.\r\nWe urge the government to promote more awareness of carbon monoxide and to reduce the cost of CO detectors which would increase the likelihood of people installing them in their homes and protecting themselves against this poison.\r\n",
