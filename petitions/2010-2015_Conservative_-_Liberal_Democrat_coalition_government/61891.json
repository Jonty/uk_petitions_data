        "additional_details": "Russian military forces have invaded Ukraine and are occupying its territory. These actions violate Russia\u2019s international obligations and are a threat to Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and the security of Europe. Both Russia and the UK are signatories to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, under which they are committed to the sovereignty of Ukraine. In a joint statement with other G7 leaders, Prime Minister Cameron condemned \u201cthe clear violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine\u201d and restated the UK\u2019s commitment to Ukraine\u2019s independence. This and other statements have resulted in no change in Russian policy.\r\n\r\nIt is time for the UK to prove its commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty, not just with words but deeds. We request that the UK government implement financial and trade sanctions against the Russian state, as well as individuals and companies linked to it. Only through imposing sanctions can the UK communicate its resolve to defend the independence of Ukraine.",
