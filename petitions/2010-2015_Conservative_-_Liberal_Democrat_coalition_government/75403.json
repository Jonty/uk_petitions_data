        "additional_details": "Dissolve the Fire Service over a period, whilst teaching fire fighting in schools (most fires extinguished by the person that finds it.) Use a crew of retained firefighters to respond, similar to RNLI (Maybe these retained crews could be made up of ex-military, used to covering for the Fire Service.) All new build housing to have not only fire detection equipment but suppression system (all modern houses have mains pressure water piped in.) Extracting someone by removing the roof of their car, is something the police or ambulance could do.\r\nAnyone in doubt about the above, please have a freedom of info request to your Government and ask how many fires were put out per year, you'll be amazed how few. Example small town in Hampshire, 5 watches of Fire Fighters nine fires attended in 365 days, how many days work did you do in a year?\r\nOur Nurses work extremely hard everyday of the year, can we afford to pay Fire Fighters to sit around watching TV, lifting weights or on the sunbed?
