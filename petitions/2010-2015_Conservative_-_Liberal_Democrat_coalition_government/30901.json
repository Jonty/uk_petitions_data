        "additional_details": "People should support this petition because personally skinny models are not pleasant to look at as well as the health risks it has upon them.\r\nIn the 60's Marilyn Munroe was the body icon which was a size 12 and now the body icon is stick thin size 0. Honestly, being a size 12 is a lot healthier than being a size 0.\r\nThese days teenagers, particularly girls, are facing eating disorders which are becoming more and more common. Having super skinny models in the magazines they read do not help but only contribute to their anxiety resulting in their condition getting worse. Is this what we really want for our children?\r\nModels looking for jobs in the fashion modelling industry are pressured to be this size and shape. The requirements are bad for the poor girl's health and in some cases girls faint in shoots because they have not eaten enough or in some cases die.\r\nWe want this to stop now so the eating disorder can lower and so people can feel more comfortable with their body.",
