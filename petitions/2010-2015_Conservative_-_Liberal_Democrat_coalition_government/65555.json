        "additional_details": "This petition calls for Education Secretary Michael Gove to reverse the call for more British works to be studied.\r\n\r\nThe impact of his latest reform has been that the exam board OCR has been forced to remove great works such as \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", \"Of Mice and Men\" and \"The Crucible\" from its English Literature syllabus.\r\n\r\nBBC News states \"OCR said the decision to drop the works by the US authors was because of the DfE's desire for the exam to be more \"more focused on tradition\" and there were fewer opportunities to include them in the new syllabus\".\r\n\r\nOne of the reform's suggested aims is to widen the range of texts studied, but evidently there will be more books restricted instead.",
