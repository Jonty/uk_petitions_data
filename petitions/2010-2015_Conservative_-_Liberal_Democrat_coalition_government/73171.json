We work hard as local clubs to attract both adults and children into sport, theses increases will price people out of the sport they love and hinder recruitment of future generations.\r\nMany small local clubs are worried that they will fold and cease to exist, parents are rightly worried about the health implications for their children if there is no sports club for them to join.\r\n",
