One company even uses the colloquial word for 'casual money with few / no strings attached' as their name.\r\n\r\nThey use senior citizen caricatures to represent a friendly face and a target character as vulnerable, weak-willed and absent-minded. This characterization identifies in the mind of the viewer to link towards individual who was considered a source of tax-free income to solve debt problems in the past. (i.e. cash 'loans' from lone senior citizens, never paid back).\r\n\r\nThese and other adverts create in the mind of the viewer a distorted sense of judgment of how best to resolve debt problems. They have create this judgment distortion so as to escape the ASA.\r\n\r\nIt's not the answer to borrow more money however pretty it\u2019s dressed up. Just increases people's monthly outgoings.\r\n\r\nWe urge the Government to bring in tighter controls on 'payday loan' companies.\r\n",
