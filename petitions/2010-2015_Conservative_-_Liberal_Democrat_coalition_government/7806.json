        "action": "Ban the sale of tattoo equipment to unlicensed individuals.",
        "additional_details": "The rise in popularity of tattooing and body piercing over the previous decade has resulted in the formation of an unregulated industry, based predominantly online, who are happy to sell tattooing and piercing equipment to anybody regardless of the individuals background. This has led to an enormous increase in unlicensed tattooing in the UK.\r\nThe result is that individuals throughout the country are operating unregulated 'studios' from bedrooms and kitchens, often with no creditable training or knowledge of infection control and sterilization.\r\nThe result of this is that 'tattoo kits' are changing hands on online market places for as little as \u00a310. Often in used condition and contaminated with blood.\r\n",
