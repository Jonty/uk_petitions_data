        "additional_details": "Recently, a man named Adam Koessler has received over 60,000 signatures petitioning to have charges against him dropped after being found to have fed his young daughter the oil of medicinal cannabis, a remedy that has been found to reduce cancer cells and alleviate other symptoms. Our government should follow the Americans in the case of legalising cannabis for medical use only.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to grow strains of medical cannabis without the Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC - the psychoactive constituent in cannabis). We spend billions of pounds on cancer research each year when we have an answer to reducing cancer cells today. Our government refuses to pass this legislation due to the millions in tax revenue it would lose. Cannabis does not affect other treatments such as Radiotherapy or Chemotherapy either.\r\n\r\nWe the people demand the immediate decriminalisation of medical cannabis without cancer sufferers living in fear that they will be sentenced to their final years in prison.",
