        "additional_details": "We want the Government to make a clear commitment to the setting of Toll charges on the Severn Bridge Crossings before the next General Election.\r\n\r\nIn 2017 ownership of the Severn River Crossings will revert to the UK Government, who will have the freedom to set toll charges. We understand that the current charges are enshrined in Law and are linked to inflation, however, when the Department of Transport takes over responsibility for the Bridges in 2017, we believe that a fair pricing policy should be adopted, reflecting operating and maintenance costs only, and should not be used as a tax revenue.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that in 2010 the rate charged to cars would need to have only been \u00a31.50 in order to cover costs. The current rate for cars is \u00a36.00. This is a real economic and social barrier for those that use the Bridges and the UK as a whole.\r\n\r\n",
