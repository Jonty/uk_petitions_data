For instance using your car to travel to a destination you hit a pothole in the road causing damage to the wheel and tyre which could cost you hundreds of pounds. It bearly covers the cost of the fule required to travel to your destination. If council vehicles were availible this would be a great option to enable choice. Due to cuts there are little to no vehicles availible for use.",
