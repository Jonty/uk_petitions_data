Guards are trained not to treat prisoners as human beings, \u201cbut as dogs or pigs\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe UN Human Rights Council established a year long Commission of Inquiry into these violations in March 2013.\r\n\r\nHowever, we have an obligation to prevent such atrocities more urgently and decisively.\r\nShin said, \u201cPeople think the Holocaust is in the past, but it is still very much a reality going on in North Korea.\u201d",
