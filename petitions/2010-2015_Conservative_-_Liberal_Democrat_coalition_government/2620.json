The question should ask whether the people would like a fully elected house or not.\r\nIf the House of Lords is made a fully elected chamber of the parliament the new house should have extended powers with respect to finances, budget, taxation, criminal and civil law in general, the import of law from the European Union and parliamentary regulation.\r\nThe new house should be elected every 5 years in the middle of the present term of the House of Commons and this should be a fixed date that cannot be decided by parliament unless under exceptional circumstances.\r\n\r\n",
