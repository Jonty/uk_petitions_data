        "additional_details": "The ever increasing argument that countless studies are strongly concluding is that children need more than what our concrete walls or tarmac playgrounds can offer them. They need more than what the education system offers them alone. Our children need green natural environments and for more than simply recreation. There is a need greater than can be measured to allow children freedom, for their own health and wellbeing physically, mentally and universally. That need without question is being ignored or overlooked. Legislation and the fear within our own society are two of the biggest barriers to our children\u2019s own self discovery and that that limits their true potential. I am calling for the government to take a radical look at how health and safety laws are limiting our children (and adults) to what many call 'the death of common sense' as the first step to, ultimately, a healthier, happier and enriched society.",
