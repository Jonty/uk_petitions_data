        "additional_details": "The DOH is currently considering removing unsocial hours payments for working on Saturdays and Sundays; axing those for working Saturdays; lowering rates for Sundays and bank holidays and changing night-shift starts from 8pm to 10pm. In the last five years we have seen our working conditions deteriorate, our pay has been frozen for five years, our pension contributions have significantly increased and our fees to governing bodies has doubled. To then remove a significant percentage of our pay will only demoralise the frontline staff even more and It may create an exodus of talented and caring healthcare professionals. The hours we work are unsocial, we pose a significant risk to our health by working night duty and regularly forfeit social occasions with friends and family in order to provide care for our patients. We deserve the extra pay as compensation for these sacrifices.",
