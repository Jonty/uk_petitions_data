        "additional_details": "With WW2 Army service records awkward to access even for family members (the current waiting time with the Army records people is up to a year), it is very hard for descendants to find anything about their family members service unless they died during the War (basic details can then be found via the CWGC). It is not uncommon for family members to be unsure of which regiment their loved one served in. Putting the medal rolls on open access (probably via the internet) would help solve this problem (they will give name, regiment and serial number) and be a fitting tribute to the wartime service of the WW2 generation.  Navy Medal Rolls up to 1971 are easily available to view via a well known family history website.",
