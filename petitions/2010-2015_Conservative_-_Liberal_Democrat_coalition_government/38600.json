One of the benefits of living in a democratic country is meant to be that of the freedom to choose. Yet if you happen to live in Hull and want a phone line or internet connection we have no choice but to go with Kingston Communications. Hull is not an island, but part of the UK, so PLEASE afford us the right of choice the rest of the UK enjoy.",
