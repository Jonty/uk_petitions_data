        "additional_details": "With some parents having little interest in disciplining children, teachers hands tied with regard to effective discipline and police rapidly losing the powers for effective enforcement of law and order, it has become apparent that things need to change.\r\n\r\nThe army is a strong and united force that instills discipline and respect in its recruits. By reintroducing National Service, it will offer hope to the youth (particularly with the number of career paths within the armed forces) but also instill a sense of national pride, respect and discipline within a society that is slowly disintergrating.",
