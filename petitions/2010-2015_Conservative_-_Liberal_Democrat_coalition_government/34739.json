        "additional_details": "Every day as I walk through London, I see hundreds of empty buildings that have been disused for months.  I also see many homeless people sleeping rough in all weathers who would love the opportunity of just one night in a safe and warm building.\r\n\r\nI know hundreds of people who would volunteer to operate this project but first we need the government to back this plan of utilizing empty space in the capital.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, there is NO excuse for rough sleeping in a City like London.  It is barbaric, dangerous and unjust.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and help this neglected minority.\r\n\r\nThank you.    ",
