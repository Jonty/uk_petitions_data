Sure, there are guidelines, but these are easily manipulated.\r\n\r\nProducts advertised as half-price for a 2 week period; in the next 2 week period, the price is doubled - but you get one free! All a retailer has to do is double the price at 1 of thousands of stores for a while, then they can promote it as half-price nationwide. The so-called offer price is on offer for most of the year; it's actually the real price!\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is, the shopping public is systematically and cynically ripped off 24/7. Laws are needed, not wishy-washy guidelines\r\n",
