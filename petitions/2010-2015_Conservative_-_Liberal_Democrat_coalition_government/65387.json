        "additional_details": "Nuweiba is a beautiful, peaceful and safe tourist resort located on the east coast of Sinai, less than 100 miles from Sharm el Sheikh.\r\n\r\nIt has never witnessed any violent terrorist acts, and is home to thousands of peace-loving Bedouins who have relied for decades on tourism but who are now suffering from severe poverty due to the negative effects of the current travel advisory of the UK and other European governments.\r\n\r\nWe respectfully call upon H.M.s Government to relax the travel advisory with immediate effect.\r\n\r\nWe also cordially invite any government representatives to come and visit our beloved Nuweiba to see for themselves.",
