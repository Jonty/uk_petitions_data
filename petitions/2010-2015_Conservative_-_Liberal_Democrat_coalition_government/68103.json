        "additional_details": "This petition aims to force the government, to fully publish the report on the Westminster Paedophile Ring to the public. It is vital that these monsters who abused and hurt children in the care system are punished, named and shamed so they cannot be in a position to continue to hurt vulnerable people, and made to face up to their crimes publicly.\r\n\r\nWhy should they receive anonymity and protection while many children's lives were destroyed by their abuse of power. So far, the report has been lost, a few member's names have been hinted at if nothing more. One judge has resigned while many more are still at large, still in a position of power; enabling them to continue to hurt children.\r\n\r\nCommon sense says the government will not publish the whole report, and do it over a period of a few years to try and avoid 'civil unrest'. These people need to be stopped, they need to be forced to face their victims and the public for what they have done.",
