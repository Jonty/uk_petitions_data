        "additional_details": "Some food products are labelled \"suitable for vegetarians\" clearly.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are many products that are suitable for a vegetarian diet yet are not labelled so. Also, the products that are not suitable for vegetarians are not labelled as not suitable, leading to consumers remaining unsure as to whether such a product agrees with their choice of diet.\r\n\r\nThis 'grey area' often leads to consumers choosing items  they would not choose had they known the reality of the contents therein.\r\n\r\nThis petition has been created to demand changes that will result in clear labelling of products stating that they are either suitable or unsuitable clearly for the significant lifestyle choice of vegetarianism.\r\n\r\nA simple \"not suitable for vegetarians\" will help not only vegetarians but also Muslims, Jews and other people in not going against their dietary requirements.",
