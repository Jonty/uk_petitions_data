If there is no success then go to the rest of the world after.  The government just allowed another country to take a very large contract, what does that mean for Briton.\r\n1  None of the money paid for this job will be spent in UK.\r\n2  British business' will start to close because there is no work for them, putting many people out of work.  Which in turn will cost the government money.\r\nIt makes sense that if the tender stays in the UK, then British people are working and the money in return is being spent in the UK which keeps other business' open also.",
