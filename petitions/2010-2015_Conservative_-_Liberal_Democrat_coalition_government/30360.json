        "additional_details": "The Justice system should regard any claims of 'consent' or 'willingness', and any discussion of how old a young person may look as opposed to the actual age, with extreme disfavour or prohibition.\r\nThe concept of 'consent' to sexual activity where the young person will be exploited in any way can never have any validity whatsoever. Appearance never signals 'consent'.\r\nSuch claims, especially where they are made by sexual partners who are older than the young person, should add to the severity of the Charge and considered as such when sentencing takes place.\r\nFor young people to know that Justice works for them, and perpetrators sent an unambiguous message, the above is an urgent need.\r\n",
