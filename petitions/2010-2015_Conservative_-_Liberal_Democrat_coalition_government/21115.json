        "additional_details": "As reported in the local media\r\n\r\n'THE prime minister has condemned people in Aldershot for showing \"discrimination and prejudice\" towards the town\u2019s Nepalese community.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Ghurkha rights campaigners, David Cameron said such attitudes directed at the former Ghurkha community in Aldershot were \"simply unacceptable in 21st century Britain\".'\r\n\r\nWhen  people in Aldershot speak out because extra funding is needed to help the community cope when the local population had been suddenly swollen in a 12 to 18 month period by around 10%.  Do we get extra funding to help, no it seems that we get condemned for \u201cdiscrimination and prejudice\u201d by the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nI think that it is high time that the Prime Minister a) apologises to the people of Aldershot for effectively branding us as a bunch of racists and b) gets extra funding in place to help local services cope with the influx PDQ.\r\n",
