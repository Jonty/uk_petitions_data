If you want a gun licence you just fill in the form, there is no precondition of insurance , competence or accepted into a shooting framework. What I want the government to consider is before granting a gun licence, that person to belong to a national shooting body such as CPSA, or BASC, for them to run training programmes and for that gun owner to be part of that organisation, when he has passed the competence test for him to then go forward for consideration for the police to issue a gun licence. It will reduce the workload on the police in so much as when renewal comes up there is a form sheet supplied by his national authority as to level of use etc. Its important for the whole sport that everyone who owns a gun knows what their responsibilities are to the general public. At this time there is a dislocation in the system that needs correcting.\r\n\r\n",
