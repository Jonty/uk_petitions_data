        "additional_details": "This is a petition to UK government to enable a settlement route for immigrant workers holding Tier 2 ICT Visas.\r\n\r\nAnyone holding this visa category would automatically be a skilled worker earning at least \u00a340,000 per year. They not only pay NI and Tax at the higher rate but also contribute well to the UK economy by spending their hard earned money.\r\n\r\nImplying a 5 year limit on such a visa and a mandatory 1 year cooling off period discourage them from feeling 'at home' and hence not make long term investments like buying property and so on within the UK.\r\n\r\nThe UK government is completely justified in applying controls to stop illegal immigration and other legal immigration routes that costs the tax payer or British jobs. The Tier 2 ICT route however, is a contributing route - the country will loose out if it closed its doors on these people. ",
