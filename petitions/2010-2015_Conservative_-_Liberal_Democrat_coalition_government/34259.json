        "additional_details": "Unlike alcohol there is no law in England and Wales that prevents adults buying tobacco on behalf of minors. As of October 2007 the minimum age was risen from 16 to 18, meaning it is illegal to sell cigarettes to under 18s. However, unlike alcohol there is no criminal offence for a person under 18 purchasing or attempting to purchase cigarettes. There is also no offence if an adult buys tobacco products on behalf of someone underage.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland it is now illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to even attempt to purchase tobacco products while it is also illegal to buy tobacco on behalf of a minor just as it is with alcohol. Let's allow retailers to refuse the sale when they know or have reasonable suspicion that the cigarettes are being purchased on behalf of someone under age! ",
