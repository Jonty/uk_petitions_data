        "action": "Stop the governments plans to remove ESA after just one year",
        "additional_details": "The proposed reforms to the benefits system are a scandal. Many hard working citizens of this country who in recent years have been unable to work due to illness or disablility will have received contribution based Incapacity Benefit. Most of these will now be moved to ESA  in the work related activity group (WRAG)\r\nThe proposal is that ESA will stop after just 1year.\r\nIf your partner is working or you have a relatively small amount of savings YOUR BENEFIT WILL FINISH. This is not targeting the scroungers. This is hurting the people like myself who have paid our income tax and contributions for decades and now find that we are too ill to work. ESA must continue for those who are truly entitled to it . ",
