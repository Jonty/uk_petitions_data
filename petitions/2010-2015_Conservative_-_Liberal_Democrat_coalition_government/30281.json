        "additional_details": "If you live in Burnley or any of the surrounding towns and become ill, you are generally taken to the hospital at Blackburn.  If you subsequently die at that hospital the death has to be registered in Blackburn.   This is because, although Blackburn is in Lancashire,it is unitary authority and therefore not part of Lancashire County Council.  It is a complete farce that in times of deep distress you have to travel from the home town of the deceased to an alien place just to register the death, in our case, a round trip of 40 miles.  This trip is in addition to the frequent trips made to visit the relative/friend ill in hospital.\r\nIt is possible to have the death registered in your home town but it takes 10 days and longer due to paperwork, apparantly going missing frequently.\r\nThe Government need to make it possible for anyone to register the death of a loved one in their home town, irrelevant of council  or county boundaries.",
