        "additional_details": "Football fans all over the UK have been asking for safe standing. We would like to follow the German model of safe standing that has proven to work efficiently after many years of use in Germany. Safe standing has proven to be safe and many fans want the option to stand whilst watching the club they support. The DFB in Germany have granted clubs the option to add standing areas and this leads to an increase in atmosphere and may even lead to an increase in attendances. The rail seats concept is a great one and clubs should be given the right to implement them.",
