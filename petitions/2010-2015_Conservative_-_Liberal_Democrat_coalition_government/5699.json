        "additional_details": "This petition calls upon the Government to set a maximum ceiling for the rented private sector. At present the boom in buy-to-let is driving up the market rents artificially, making properties unaffordable to many and preventing first time buyers from being able to amass the deposits needed to purchase a home for themselves. The market cannot be left to self-regulate here: as a generation struggles to find affordable housing demand for rented property is increasing, average rents rising in a cycle that favours investors whilst pricing out the young and the vulnerable. Without intervention this cycle won\u2019t be broken: we need the Government to set upper rental limits, as is done in other European cities, according to local need not profit opportunity. We need greater regulation within the buy-to-let sector, to curb reckless acquisition within low-income areas, and increased checks on landlords and letting agents, many of whom exploit tenants with unreasonable fees and poor conditions.",
