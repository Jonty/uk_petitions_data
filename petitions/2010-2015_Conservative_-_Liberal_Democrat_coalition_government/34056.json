(Aston, Lozells, Newtown, B6 7LB)\r\n\r\nPart of this site should be offered as D1, D2 uses (leisure/events) with the hope of having a swimming pool built, and open water swimming supported in the adjacent lake.\r\n\r\nServing north, central and inner city Birmingham this pool would sit next to the motorway so is nationally and regionally accessible, next to a river and lake that is used for water sports and in an area that would benefit hugely from this sort of investment.\r\n\r\nIn a massive plan for the area we should be encouraging various investments and not just office space!\r\n\r\nOur idea\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/AstonArena/photos\r\n\r\nThe wider area plan\r\nhttp://www.birmingham.gov.uk/astonaap",
