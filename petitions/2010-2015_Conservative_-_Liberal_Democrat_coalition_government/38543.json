        "additional_details": "Santander plan to take over RBS branches in England and Wales and Natwest Branches in Scotland. Affecting 1.8 million people.\r\n\r\nSantander have already acquired Alliance and Leicester, Abby National and Cahoot. They are consolidating branch banking on the high street leaving people with less and less competition and choice on where they bank and invest their money.\r\n\r\nSantander\u2019s recent downgrading by ratings agency Moody\u2019s is also a concern. Why is the Government and FSA allowing high street banking choice to diminish. We should have more banks offering competitive products not more banks becoming to big to fail!\r\n",
