As a global entity let's express our frustration at Luis Suarez's behaviour and the ridiculously misplaced support of the Uraguayan nation and agree that the 1st. August,  shall be enshrined as National Bite a Uraguayan Day. On this day any person knowing a Uraguayan national on UK soil shall be entitled to 'bite' with a legal amount of force,said Uruguayan on the shoulder. The British Government should enshrine this action as law until the Uraguayan nation accepts this unacceptable behaviour in any walk of life.",
