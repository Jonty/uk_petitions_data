        "additional_details": "The government announced an 8 week consultation on Feed-in tariffs (FITs) to run until 23rd December. This included a registration deadline for existing FITs of 12th December.\r\n\r\nFor a new build this 6 week notice period is unreasonable given that most will be at least one year in the build and even longer if you include planning. Depending on stage of build most people will have no chance of meeting the deadline despite having ordered their solar panels but will have made their decisions based on the existing tariff.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition asks that the registration deadline is extended to 1st April 2012 if there is proof of order prior to the announcement of the consultation.",
