        "additional_details": "Online gambling is proving to be highly addictive and problematic for a lot of people, and credit cards are adding to the problem.\r\n\r\nCredit cards can be used to fund online gambling accounts, and credit card companies extend credit to their customers, with little in the way of checks.\r\n\r\nFor those that become addicted to online gambling, credit cards help to fuel the addiction.  The extra credit increases provided by the credit card companies,  fuel the addiction for longer and leaves the customer in far greater debt.\r\n\r\nIts morally wrong how easy it is to get credit to gamble with and the way that banks extend your credit when you've lost it all.  Its causing a lot of problems and I think it time that gambling using credit cards is banned.",
