They have no choice but to even though they would rather be working for more money than claiming less for doing nothing.\r\n\r\nShouldn't the government be encouraging us to save more money?\r\n\r\n18k is simply not enough to live on when you have no income at all so why are people not allowed to claim jsa and council tax benefit until they can support themselves again?\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
