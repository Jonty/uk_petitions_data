In the past 2 weeks they have removed all our tributes & put them in cupboards, in the car park next to the rubbish bins. If they are not collected by 28th Feb they are to be disposed of. We only lost My Wife last April & most of her tribute's were left by my 3 & 5 yr old grandaughters, It's heartless to remove them with barely any notice & why can't we remember our loved ones how we wan't Its not hurting anybody. I've been leaving things up there for 35 yrs+ ",
