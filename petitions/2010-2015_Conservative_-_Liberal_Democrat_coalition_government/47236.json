        "additional_details": "We urge the British Government to urgently act to protect the savings up to 50,000 ex pats in Cyprus from a bank levy introduced by the new Cyprus Government (without our agreement) on their savings held in Cypriot Banks (which were previously guaranteed by the Government).\r\n\r\nMany of these ex Pats are retired and have no chance to earn the money again, that the tax will take. This will have a hugely detrimental effect on the lives of British citizens that are retired in Cyprus.\r\n\r\nWe request urgent assistance from H.M. Government at both the EU Parliament and with the Cypriot Government to stop this tax.\r\n",
