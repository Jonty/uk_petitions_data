Since the night closure of a&e patients lives have been put further at risk.\r\n\r\n-if the staff are not suitable or available, then do something about it.\r\n-if more money is required to bring it up to the correct level, spend it.\r\n\r\nThere is no excuse not to have it reopened.\r\n\r\nStafford hospital has been at the front of news headlines for a while.  The coalition has been in power for just as long.  Shouldn't this be a priority?.  Isn't the health of the nation a priority?\r\n\r\nPlease debate why it has been allowed to go this far, why Stafford hospital hasn't been used as a poster child for success in the NHS and for all MPs who care about the people.    Please REOPEN Stafford hospital A&E\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\nJas harrar",
