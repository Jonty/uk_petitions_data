        "additional_details": "From 1 January 2012 the age threshold for the Housing Benefit shared accommodation rate will increase from 25 to 35.\r\n\r\nShared room rate is particularly low and finding suitable accommodation in area's that typically use the shared housing to house students.\r\n\r\nThis could also create a problem for Crime, Bullying and Disease.\r\n\r\nIn the job market that we are in now who know's when you may need to rely on Housing benefit.\r\n\r\nSo I ask of all of you that come to this petition to bear in mind that this indeed could include you and how would you feel having your private rented accommodation taken from you after paying into the system.",
