        "additional_details": "The Government gives aid from UK Tax payers to Countries who clearly do not need it. Some of these countires have their own Nuclear Weapons Program and even Space Program. Whilst it is acknowledged that some areas of these countries experience poverty, that is caused by mismanagement and not a lack of resources. Government should only send Aid to those countries who are in true need of it and thereby reduce the overseas aid budget to assist our own financial position",
