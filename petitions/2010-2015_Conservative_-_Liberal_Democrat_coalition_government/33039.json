My cats NEVER go further than 150 yards away on the grass-piece behind our house.\r\n\r\nBoth cats have survived, and though millions of people dislike cats - these are members of our family, we love them. We've also had to pay their vet bills totaling almost a thousand pounds within 3\u00bd months.\r\n\r\nAir rifles can cause serious damage, may as well give handguns to people as ANYONE who has intent to shoot something, intends to kill it.",
