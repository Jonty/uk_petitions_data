        "additional_details": "We the undersigned British citizens urge our government to take practical steps in stopping Israel\u2019s continued violation of human rights against Palestinian prisoners.\r\nRecently, Palestinian prisoners, Maisara Abu Hamdiyeh and Arafat Jaradat died in Israeli jails due to lack of health care and torture.\r\nPoor health and chronic illness is endemic within Israeli prisons while access to treatment and care is restricted. Of the 4,500 Palestinians incarcerated in Israeli prisons, including children and woman, 25 are diagnosed with cancer and are in desperate need of medical care.\r\nWe urge our government to put pressure on Israel to stop its violations, provide proper medical attention and treat them accordance with the fourth Geneva Convention and Int. law. Such willful negligence can lead to further violence across the Middle East meanwhile ending prisoners\u2019 plight will contribute to peace in the region.",
