        "additional_details": "The words Wales and Welsh are inappropriate and possibly even racist, these words derive from a word meaning \"foreigner\". Surely nobody should be called a foreigner in their own country? And surely the country shouldn't be called \"land of the foreigners\"? The \"Welsh\" people have for years called their country Cymru, but it's official name still remains to be \"Wales\".\r\n\r\nA recent petition to the National Assembly received 119 signatures but unfortunately the Petitions Committee felt that the Assembly does not have the power to change the legal name of our country.\r\n\r\nAs such it can only be assumed that the UK Government and Parliament have the power to change our name. We propose that the UK Government and Parliament proceed to ensure that our country's name and the words used to refer to it's people are taken from the \"Welsh\" language, Cymraeg, to avoid the ignorant and racist use of terms towards the \"Welsh\" people.",
