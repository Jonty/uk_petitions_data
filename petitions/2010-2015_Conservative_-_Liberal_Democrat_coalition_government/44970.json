The office was set up by Parliament in 1995.\r\n\r\nIt should be replaced with an independent organisation, whose members are not appointed by MPs, able to investigate complaints of improper behaviour by MPs of any kind, including criminal activity.\r\n\r\nThis should be empowered to consider any matter in which evidence, at first sight, suggests there is a case to answer.\r\n\r\nIt should not be bound by previous Parliamentary rules, which have allowed MPs to abuse public trust without punishment.\r\n\r\nIt should operate without fear of interference from any person or organisation with an interest in hindering it.\r\n\r\nAnd it should be able to launch court proceedings for criminal matters; any MP found guilty in such circumstances should be stripped of their seat and a by-election called.\r\n",
