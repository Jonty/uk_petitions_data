This being the case, we call for the e-Petition system to be abolished. The people of Britain should be aware of just how little accountability their MPs have to them, and not be mislead by cheap tricks.\r\n\r\n[1] \u2013 \"NHS Bill E-Petition Debate Turned Down By Commons Committee\", Huffington Post http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/02/28/nhs-bill-e-petition-debate-turned-down-by-commons-committee_n_1306829.html",
