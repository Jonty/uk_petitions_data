        "additional_details": "Visa applications from Bangladesh will no longer be decided-upon in Dhaka, but in New Delhi, under \u201ccost-saving measures\u201d. This is despite the busy volume of applications made in Bangladesh, and almost 300,000 people of Bangladeshi origin living in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nRemoving visa decision-making powers from Dhaka deprioritises the importance of the UK\u2019s relationship with Bangladesh and is counter to effective immigration policies.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the government to demonstrate its commitment to a strong relationship with Bangladesh and Bangladeshi people, and reconsider this decision.",
