        "additional_details": "After recent events on the streets of London I looked in to what measures the Government are taking to tackle the growing problem of Islamic extremists in major cities around the UK. To my shock and embarrassment it seems not a lot.\r\nWhat I want debated in the House of Commons is\r\n\r\n1. What is being done to stop the genital mutilation of young girls and women in the name of Islam? and why has nobody been prosecuted for these crimes? It is estimated over 20,000 girls under the age of 15 are at risk in the UK, Source BBC\r\n\r\n2. What is being done to stop the growing use illegitimate Sharia law courts in UK to undermine the basic human rights of Muslim women living in the UK.\r\n\r\n3. What is being done about Islamic schools that teach hatred and intolerance of western values and beliefs?\r\n\r\n4. What is being done about the radicalisation of young Muslim men, in schools, universities, Mosques and prisons?\r\n",
