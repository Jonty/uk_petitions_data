        "additional_details": "The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) found that there was an 8 % rise in positive, refused or failed breath test in June 2011 within the UK, compared to June 2010. In addition, there was a 30% increase in tests for drivers under the influence of drugs, which resulted in 122 arrests. Inappropriate drug usage and alcohol consumption whilst driving risks the lives of others. Millions of tax payer\u2019s money is also wasted each year to pay for the police time and NHS services used to deal with alcohol related incidents. If you want the government to take this issue seriously and discuss the introduction of a ban on drink-driving in parliament, please sign this e-petition.",
