I was forced by the police to accept the reprimand and the case will be closed. They made it sound very simple.\r\n\r\nI am now 27, I have graduated as Therapeutic Radiographer and registered with the HCPC. Whenever I disclose my reprimand I get no interviews. Whenever I don't, I get interviews.\r\n\r\nI PLEDGE THE HOME OFFICE to look into this matter as soon as possible. I should be giving treatments to patients with cancer and paying my taxes. Instead I am on benefits because I cannot get a job within NHS.\r\nTHIS WAS OVER STEALING A PENCIL CASE AS CHILD.\r\n\r\nNot to mention that I still have to pay off my student loan. ",
