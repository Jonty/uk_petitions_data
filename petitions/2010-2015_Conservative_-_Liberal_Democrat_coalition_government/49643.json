The cost of running the prime ministers office has been on the exponential increase since the early days of Tony Bliar and Gordon McBroon and must be curtailed.  NOBODY, especially prime ministers who ALL develope Hubris Syndrome, should NOT be given carte blanche unoversighted authority to spend taxpayer pounds on bolstering their own party political status.  It is time to bring down the cost of government, not continue to increase it on the whim of delusional prime ministers.",
