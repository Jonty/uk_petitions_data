        "additional_details": "GP Out of Hours has wasted billions of a taxpayer pounds (I know that because I helped set it up in 1996).  NHS Direct (and the 'new' 111 service) have proved to be, at best downright useless, at worst downright dangerous, and is also an immoral waste of taxpayer pounds. The facilities already exist in our hospitals, all they lack is money to run them.  There is no new money available so take the funding from these two failed pink elephants and put it into A & E and start providing a proper medical service to the people of this country - and in accordance with coalition policy, to anybody who turns up at our shores wanting to avoid paying for medical care in their own country.\r\n",
