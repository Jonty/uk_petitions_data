On the other hand I can understand that some look back to our commonwealth days and thought we had good times then with easy migration to Canada and to Oceania. Manuel Barroso lately said the UK was a special case why can't we make this to our advantage entirely and ask the commission to allow our commonwealth nation's that meet the humanitarian requirements for membership either Automatic members via us or candidate countries for full membership and all the benefits that would give them and us. We are the only Country on earth to have a Mornachy that is our Head of State along with other major countries and the Anglican faiths head. We have major cheques time to cash them in. PM remember Scotland to have the UK behind you is like having all the aces God could hand you. ",
