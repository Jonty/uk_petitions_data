        "additional_details": "The state retirement age must be linked to average life expectancy. At present we are living longer, and spending a disproportionate time retired compared to working. For any pension to be sustainable this either means contributing more, paying less or making the pension age relative to how long the average person can expect to live. By linking the retirment age to life expectency we stablise the required investment, and prevent today's pensions becoming a ticking time bomb for the next generation.",
