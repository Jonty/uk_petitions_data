        "additional_details": "The current system of allowing garages to provide MOT tests and also provide servicing has resulting in there being a vested interest to 'fail' vehicles applying for an MOT certificate. I propose that the Government adopts the European system that all MOT testers are independent and cannot offer to repair any issues they have discovered. This would remove the temptation to fail a vehicle and thus obtain financial reward. ",
