        "additional_details": "I am a mother of an 11 year old boy who has several food allergies. Pea, shrimp, nuts, egg, lentils, chick pea, sesame, and more. I do not trust anyone to cook for my son alart from the imidiate family, and recently went out on a two day trip having taken food for him in containers hoping that we could get it warmed up when we went out to lunch and dinner at the restaurants, it turns out we couldn't because of health and safety as he could burn himself. I say the law should be changed and they should be made to warm food for children and adults.  Even if you have to sign something to say that in case of burns the restaurant is not at fault. My poor son felt he had spoilt our weekend because he couldn' eat with us we ended up having sandwich in the hotrl room.a",
