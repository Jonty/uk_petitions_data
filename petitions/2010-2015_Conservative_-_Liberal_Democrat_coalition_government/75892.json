        "additional_details": "This contraption,is a inhumane,abuse and extremely dangerous. Not only to these poor animals,but to other drivers in and off highways,street,etc. This cage that was built and mounted to the outside of someones car... is the cruelest most inhumane thing I have ever witnessed. The animal,which is being hauled around,outside and in the rear of vehicle,is scared,definately being abused and tortured. This contrapment needs to be stopped,and this company needs to be shut down,and have criminal charges brought to them. And,just these photos alone,shows just how abusive this is. These poor dogs,being strapped to this car...like a piece of luggae. Please stop this,before danger comes to these animals..and people driving around them.",
