        "additional_details": "A new law should be passed which would allow the goverment to sieze and sell assests from convicted criminals to pay for their incarceration. This should also be inclusive of joint assests and for under 18 's, the assets of the parent or gardian. This would deter criminals from risking their family home and also drive accountability of parents. A fair system should be debated to come up with a level that would deter criminals, this should be subject to means testing so as not to end up being counter productive. To encourage criminals not to re-offend, first time criminals would have the oportunity to reclaim the value of their siezed assests if they do not reoffend and have rehabilited themselves into society within a relevent timescale to the offence committed.",
