        "additional_details": "It is reported that politicians are to be given tickets to the opening ceremony (value GBP2012.00p), which is what I would have to pay if I were able to attend.  If I were to be given such a ticket, as a PAYE employee, I would be required to declare it to HMRC as a benefit in kind and would be charged income tax on it.  There is absolutely no reason why politicians - who are PAYE employees - should be above the law when it comes to taxpayer funded freebies.  THEY SHOULD BE MADE TO DECLARE AND IF THEY DON'T THEY SHOULD BE ARRAIGNED BEFORE OUR COURTS ON CHARGES OF TAX EVASION - which is, again, exactly what would happen to me or any other non-politician taxpayer who didn't declare receiving such a free ticket.",
