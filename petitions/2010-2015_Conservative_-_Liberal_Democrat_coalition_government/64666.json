We suggest that the GIC clinics should be stripped of their inappropriate level of power over the lives of trans people. And that they should be reformed using the well tested \"Informed Consent\" model.\r\n\r\n\"Once seen at a Gender Identity Clinic, 46% of\r\nthe participants felt that they had experienced difficulties obtaining the treatment\r\nor assistance that they needed.\"\r\n\r\nThis flawed system is endangering the lives of trans people. It needs to be changed.",
