        "additional_details": "With many children, political opinions (generally of a left-wing stance) are imposed on students in schools. School should be a completely Politically neutral place, when instead, Universities and colleges are a breeding ground for Communist and Socialist ideologies. This could potentially be very dangerous for the country as students will not be allowed the opportunity to think for themselves and instead will have a cemented Communist stance, however it is not always Left-Wing as there are some quite Right-Wing teachers, which could also be just as dangerous.\r\n\r\nWe would like the Government to make it Illegal for teachers or any form of educational authority to have any political stance in schools and impose it on students.
