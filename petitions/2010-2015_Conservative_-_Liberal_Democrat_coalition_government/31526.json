        "action": "Don't change Sunday trading rules during Olympics",
        "additional_details": "Abandon plans to relax Sunday trading rules for large shops during the two months of the Olympics in summer 2012.  Allowing large stores and retail parks to open 24/7 will harm small shops who will lose trade to chain stores.  Local economies will suffer and local shopping streets lose business.  The loss of small businesses, and of local trade and professional contracts will increase unemployment long-term.  Pressure on shop workers will increase, causing particular problems at times of celebration and school holidays.  The special status of Sundays free from mass-consumer culture will be eroded, and this temporary relaxation will increase pressure from large corporate lobbies for a permanent change in the rules.  Outside London especially, these plans are damaging and should be abandoned.",
