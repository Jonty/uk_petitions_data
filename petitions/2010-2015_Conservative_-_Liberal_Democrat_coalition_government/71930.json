        "action": "Stop the reduction of maintenance loans in 3rd year for undergraduate students",
        "additional_details": "The reduction of maintenance loans in 3rd year causes a lot of problems for those in their final year. Most cannot afford their rent and are not aware of this until it is too late to change. Even if a student can afford their accommodation, there is little or no money left over to contribute to living costs. Final years are stressful enough for students, and adding money worries into the mix causes even more issues. The aim of this petition is to make the government and those who should be concerned with student finance aware of the issues with the reduction of the maintenance loan and consider changing this. ",
