        "additional_details": "It has failed to achieve predetermined key government targets of 5.5% of participants finding sustainable work, instead achieveing 3.5% (It's worse than doing nothing)\r\n\r\nThe \"payment by results\" of the Work Programme creates a serious risk or \"already happening\" phenomena as listed below.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tOperation deficiencies and cultural corruption to \"cherry pick\" in favour to low effort investments by providers, while 'neglect' high investments job seekers. This is counter intuitive and incorrect.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tCreates a decoupling of DWP statutory requirements as Work Programme providers follow DWP guidelines, that are easily miss executed or wrongly understood, with severe consequences for participants that are grossly unfair, cause hardship  or injustice and illegal.\r\n\r\nWe urge the government to cancel the DWP Work Programme in the interest of fairness, value to tax payers and justice to all British citizens.\r\n",
