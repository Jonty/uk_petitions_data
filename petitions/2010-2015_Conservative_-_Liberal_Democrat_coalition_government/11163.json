        "additional_details": "As in some other countries prisoners work in prisons in order to benefit society they abused earlier. Part of their \u201cearned\u201d money goes to their families, if they have ones, and another part to the government or to the victims. There are small factories nearby or on the prison territory. This practice is good especially for those criminals who lived only on social benefits as they will be taught to work and will acquire new skills which help to find their place once they back from the prison. Prisons cost a lot of money to the taxpayers, why not to change it? All other convicted, but not imprisoned must do all kind of unpaid work for the benefit of the community, including small businesses.",
