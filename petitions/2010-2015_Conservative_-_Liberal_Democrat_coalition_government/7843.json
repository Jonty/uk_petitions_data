        "additional_details": "The police Services of the United Kingdom are, by government policy, underprepared to react to large scale civil unrest as demonstrated during the \"student\" riots of 2010 and London Riots of August 2011. We the undersigned members of the United Kingdom population consent to allowing the Police Services of the United Kingdom the tools to do their difficult duties to the best of their abilities. We consent to the use of water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas to maintain law and order on the streets of the United Kingdom during times of civil unrest.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching the threshold the government should debate and enact legislation that allows the use of the above riot control measures and devolves authority for the use of such measures to Police Chief Constables on a case by case basis. Chief Constables should not have to seek permission from the Home Secretary to deploy such measures to ensure the use of these measures is free from political influence.",
