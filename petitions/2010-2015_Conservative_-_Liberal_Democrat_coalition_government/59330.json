        "additional_details": "It is now too easy for an individual to move into a house next door to a pub or club and then complain to the council about noise from live bands playing there. Even if that venue has been there for many years, is known for and relies on this activity for custom. (A live band is NOT a CD player that can simply be 'turned down'. It just doesn't work that way. As we all know, music sounds much better loud, thanks to the Fletcher-Munson Curve).\r\n\r\nIn many cases this very quickly results in the venue being served with a noise abatement order, after which all live music & events are cancelled, and the venue loses its business & has to close.\r\n\r\nIt is fair to say that this ruins local live music and the businesses that rely on it. It is damaging to the culture of the country as a whole.\r\n\r\nIt is time for common sense to take a front seat once more, and let the music be heard.\r\n",
