There are cases of both child and adult trafficking, and among the incidents of trafficking are sexual abuse and labor abuses.\r\n\r\nChildren and adults are often trafficked for prostitution in metro and rural areas, but are also  trafficked and exploited for illicit corporate blackmail.\r\n\r\n\"The Illicit abuse of people in the businesses underworld\" is a way in which these victims are abused. Disliked competitors in business are referred to as \"Chickens\" in some criminal circles, and they are targeted maliciously with threats and extortions involving child abuse.\r\n\r\nIt is actually not uncommon in some cities to see criminal gangs carrying child victims or even adult victims around the way of the people they are targeting.\r\n\r\nThis is a horrible crime that must be stopped.",
