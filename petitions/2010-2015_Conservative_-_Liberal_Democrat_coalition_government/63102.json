        "additional_details": "Young women in England & Northern Ireland under the age of 25years are not routinely screened for cervical cancer. In 2015, the age of cervical screening is also set to rise to 25 for Scotland & Wales.\r\nWe are campaigning for immediate referral for colposcopy to be made when a young woman under 25 is experiencing unexplained vaginal bleeding, (such as after sex), an inflamed cervix & unexplained pelvic pain.\r\nA colposcopy is a harmless test which can determine straight away the presence of any cell abnormalities by using a colposcope.\r\nTherefor, the argument posed by Dept of Health re the 'false positives' in cervical screening in under 25s isn't relevant for colposcopy. It is a very clear decisive test at any age.\r\nEarly diagnosis of cervical cancer is vital.\r\nPlease sign our petition & save lives.\r\nThank you.\r\nSandra.\r\npp. Mercedes Curnow Foundation.\r\n",
