I cite climate change, pollution and habitat destruction as just a few examples. Many will be aware of ways in which to reduce their \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d, and if enough people are, perhaps it will have an impact.\r\nHowever, this does not seem to be happening half as well as it should be. I call for our Government to help to persuade people to live a more environmentally aware lifestyle, and to influence our country and others to be sustainable in the way they are managed. Is it possible for the U.K. to lead the world in attention to such issues where other countries have ignored them? What one country does has the power to be influential over the world.\r\nI ask with this e-petition that the Government thinks seriously about how it can have an influence over the organisations and individuals in this country, and encourage sustainability.\r\n",
