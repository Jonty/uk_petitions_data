        "additional_details": "We cleared out a plot of derelict land which is owned by Dundee council that has not been used for anything other than a dump site for decades. In short we've put 1.5yrs of backbreaking work revitalising this land and creating a haven. We cleared tons of waste the council has dumped here over the years, recycling it into a mud and clay roundhouse and organic compost for fruit and veg; a public garden where the community can get organic food for free, as well as learning to use the vegetation and land we are surrounded by.\r\nThe council want us off the land. They are sending a wrecking crew to forcibly remove us and to destroy everything we have toiled so hard for. The press have been informed and the land has been photographed for the papers. We want the government to recognise the efforts made by the people of this city to make Dundee a prettier, cleaner, friendlier place and stop the destruction of our sanctuary.",
