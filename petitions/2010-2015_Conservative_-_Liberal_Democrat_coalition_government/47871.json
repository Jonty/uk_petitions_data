        "additional_details": "Recently in Sri Lanka and Burma, violence against Muslims has spiralled, with Muslim owned businesses, mosques, and centrers attacked. Described by the BBC as 'Worryingly reminiscent of Nazi Germany' it is clear this is a serious issue. In Burma, Muslims have been subjected to Mob violence by the Buddhists whilst the security services stand idle or do not do enough. With entire Muslims families burned alive, and  driven from their houses.\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom reside more than 2 Million Muslims, and we the undersigned call upon the prime minister and government, to whom we pay taxes ,to take steps to shape foreign policy to ensure Muslims are not persecuted, and call upon the Srilankan and Burmese government to do more to stop this wanton violence.
