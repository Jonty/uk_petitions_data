        "action": "Establish a Standard Academic Year for fees and abolish the Seasonal Academic years for fees.",
        "additional_details": "The Seasonal Academic Year currently prevents education providers, such as universities, from charging over \u00a36750 per Seasonal Academic Year. The Seasonal Academic Years are: Autumn (1 September - 31 August), Winter (1 January - 31 December), Spring (1 April - 31 March), and Summer (1 July - 30 June). The Standard Academic Year would be: 1 September - 31 August. Currently a student starting a degree in February who pays \u00a36000 cannot start his/her second year in September as the university will not be able to charge them without exceeding the limit stated, and instead has to wait for the following year.\r\nBy using the Standard Academic Year more options will become available to students and educators, the system will be streamlined and easier to understand, but course fees will still be appropriately capped.",
