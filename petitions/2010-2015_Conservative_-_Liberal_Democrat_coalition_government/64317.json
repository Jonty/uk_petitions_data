        "additional_details": "Wheelchair users already have legal priority for disabled spaces, as they should.\r\n\r\nWe would like the priority for \"pushchair\" spaces on buses to be given to disabled parents who cannot fold their children's pushchairs, and parent's of disabled children who use a pushchair in place of a wheelchair. We want all bus companies to be aware of this, and enforce it accurately (ie, not telling a parent of a disabled child that they have to fold their pushchair, when a space is taken up by an empty pushchair)\r\n\r\nFrequently, disabled parents and parents of disabled children are put at a disadvantage, which is technically already covered in the equality act. We would like clarification of the act, to state that disabled parents/parents of disabled children take legal priority over other parents.",
