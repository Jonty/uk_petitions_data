        "additional_details": "I propose the any member of a secret society, should be banned from also being permitted to be a member of government or its related bodies, i.e. our town halls, the judiciary, military and the police etc. \u2013 as it\u2019s without doubt a major conflict of interest. - This currently abhorrent state of affairs where anyone involved in our governments etc. are allowed to be also members of a secret society that require death defying oaths to be sworn, - whereas the blindfolded initiate, and with a dagger held to their heart, swears to be 100% allegiant and committed to the Masonic agenda, - and over and above that of all else.  The potential for corruption and dodgy deals makes a complete mockery of our democracy and justice system.  Our government and its representatives; via our town halls and justices of law must be free from commitment to these highly influential groups if they are expected to maintain a shred of credibility and earn the public\u2019s trust and respect once again.\r\n",
