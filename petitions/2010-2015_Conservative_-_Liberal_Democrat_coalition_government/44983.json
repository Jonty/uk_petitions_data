        "additional_details": "An objection to the redevelopment to 'Kelvin Way Open Space IL1' would greatly impact on the natural wildlife of the surrounding area, along with disruption to the local residents and children who currently use this open space for functions and recreational activities. Without this area being available to the public, it would cause many people to have to travel (by car) to the next nearest area which is Sandwell Valley. Due to the fact that there are already many vacant factory units in the area, building more does not seem logical.",
