        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, would like to see the Highway Code more vigorously enforced so that dogs are always restrained adequately when traveling in a motor vehicle. This is for the safety of the dog, the driver and other road users. Specific legislation already exists in many other countries but drivers in this country seem unaware of their responsibilities. We'd also like the Highway Code amended to include mention of the danger of dogs being left unattended in cars on warm days. The RSPCA are called out to an average of 6,000 incidents each year of dogs found in distress in hot cars. Educating drivers on the speed in which cars heat up and how dogs are unable to regulate their temperature may alleviate some of this suffering in the future. Defra has already publicly supported the Dog Cook Your Dog Campaign but it would be really helpful to have some help from the Department of Transport, too.",
