        "additional_details": "I often hear parents say that they have not been in touch with a Firm of Solicitors as they simply didn't know how or they didn't know their child may be entitled to damages to put them into the position they would have been in had the accident not occurred both now and in the future.\r\n\r\nI think it is absolutely right that the medical profession should be legally obliged to inform children and/ or their parents of their right to seek advice from a Solicitor to investigate whether an award of damages can be obtained. This is particularly relevant in the case of severely injured children, whose futures need to be protected.\r\n\r\nChildren often sustain such severe injuries that they will never have the capacity to instruct a Solicitor. If their parents do not know of their right, they will be heavily reliant upon the state for care and support. ",
