It is overstretched due to cuts in staff and budgets and can not perform as it should or was intended when first opened.\r\n\r\nI think that we should all pay \u00a310 a month \u00a35 for OAPs regardless of status or employment.  This would inject the much needed cash our health providers desperately need.  This in turn would reduce waiting times, reduce errors, better level of care and updated equipment and medicines to save more lives.\r\n\r\nIf only half of this extra revenue was given to.the health authorities the rest could be used to pay off the Countries debt.\r\n\r\nSo rather than the government cutting services that has taken years to build and decimating the Country, lets put a little more, not much, into it and get us up out of this mess we are in.",
