        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to ensure that police officers who abuse their positions and commit perjury by lying in court are dismissed from their employment as quickly as possible. There have been in recent years a number of high profile cases that have involved the police lying in court and yet there have been no prosecutions, let alone disciplining or dismissal of officers. It appears the police are above the law in this respect and this is an entirely unacceptable situation. The Government would restore some confidence in the police serice if it ensured officers that lie in court are at least sacked.",
