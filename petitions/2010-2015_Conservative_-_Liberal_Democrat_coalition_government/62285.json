        "additional_details": "School Phobia, School Refusal and Separation Anxiety is growing.\r\nIn 2009 I had my own experience with my son and was shocked at the lack of support through the education system.\r\nI created a website & group for parents & I am now flooded with emails from parents telling me of their same experience with regards to their child & school. School responses include denial, judgements, refusal to co-operate.  Some parents are taken to court despite pleading this is an illness.\r\nWhat my signatories ask is this condition is formally recognised within the Education system, training given to staff to recognise & refer and support given to parents to help reduce the strain on families.",
