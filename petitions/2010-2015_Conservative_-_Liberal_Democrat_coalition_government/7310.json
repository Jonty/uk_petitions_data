Road safety experts consider that rear facing seats are safer upto a minimum of age four and would reduce such accidents.\r\n\r\nThe petitioners therefore request that  the House of Commons brings in legislation to make it mandatory for children upto the age of four should sit in child seats that face the rear of the vehicle due to the massive safety benefits this gives.\r\n\r\nUK children deserve to be kept safe in the car.",
