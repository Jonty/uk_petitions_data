        "additional_details": "I am asking the government to implement laws to make Adultery, Disertion, Alienation of affection a crime. The causes a great deal of emotional pain, anguish, mental problems, health issues and many more problems. Some people think it is ok to run off with someone else's husband. The government must send a strong message to such people that it is not okay to do so. Often the children are left with emotional scars and society has to pick up pieces which then cost the tax payers billions. This is resulting in the breakdown in our homes and societies around the world. For the government to speak to myself and others to change the laws. To send clear messages to people that such behaviours should be met with strong forceful laws.",
