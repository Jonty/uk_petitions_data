        "additional_details": "Whilst we, the undersigned, believe that everyone should have the freedom to express their own religion, the inclusion of Anglican Christianity in State business actively excludes people from being able to express this in public life.\r\n\r\nAs such, the affixation of Christianity to the mechinery of State should be removed as it is no-longer representative of our nation. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n1) References to God in law;\r\n2) The requirement to make oaths in Parliament and in court;\r\n3) The automatic inclusion in the House of Lords of the Lords Spiritual (whilst understanding that they have a role to play in representing their congregations and should still be offered positions based on this);\r\n4) Prayers said before, during or after any meeting of any instrument of State which are mandatory according to the agenda of the meeting.",
