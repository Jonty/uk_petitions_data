ONE WAY, TO REMIND THE ARGENTINA GOVERNMENT OF OUR FUTURE INTENTIONS, WOULD BE FOR THE M of DEFENCE TO ARRANGE MILITARY TRAINING EXERCISES IN THIS AREA, TO REPLACE EXISTING EXERCISES AT PRESENT CARRIED OUTSIDE THR U.K.  THEY COULD ASK OUR COMMONWEALTH SPECIAL FORCES IF THEY COULD DO SOME FOUL WEATHER TRAINING.  A VISIT FROM A NUCLEAR SUBMARINE, IN FACT ANYTHING OF AN IRREGULAR FREQUENCY, AS WELL AS THE NORMAL TRAFFIC OF OUR FORGES STATIONED THERE, SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED.  CONSULTATIONS WITH THE FALKLANDS`S AUTHORITIES MAY ALSO THROW UP FURTHER SUGGESTIONS.   ",
