        "additional_details": "The title is fairly self explanatory. Reopening the south side entrance to Hanwell Railway Station would cut 2-3 minutes off my current outrageous 5 minute walk to Hanwell station.\r\n\r\nOther Pros:\r\n\r\n- It would make the 'Station Approach' road name actually make sense\r\n- It would make directing people to the station from said road considerably easier.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n- Barney would lose his favourite peeing wall. But he has informed me he is willing to make this sacrifice\r\n\r\nClosing the south side entrance was clearly the worst decision in the history of British Rail since the Beeching Report. Please sign this petition to right this wrong.",
