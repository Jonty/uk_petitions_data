        "additional_details": "A yacht to commemorate Her Majesty's jubilee is a superb idea. What is completely inappropriate, however, is the notion that this may be paid for out of taxpayers' money, in whole or in part.\r\nIn times of great financial struggle and austerity, such a huge and somewhat unnecessary spend would be an abhorrent decision.\r\nThis petition calls upon the treasury to dispel all concerns the public may have regarding where this proposed \u00a360m is coming from and clarify that public funds will not be drawn upon.",
