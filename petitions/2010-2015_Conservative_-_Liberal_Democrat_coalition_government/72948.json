        "additional_details": "The trend in reducing timescales between exchange of contracts and completion of purchase/sale of domestic property to less than one week is having a severe negative impact on home movers and the companies that assist them.\r\nWith less than a week between exchange of contracts and completion of a sale, homeowners are not able to arrange their moving process, as most removals companies request full payment in advance, until a matter of days before the move.  They are also left in limbo, as last minute problems with the process can mean that they don\u2019t know if they are moving home only days before the event.  It has resulted in last minute problems stopping the move on the day itself, sometimes after their belongings have been removed from their property, and must then be moved back in.\r\nTo prevent these issues in what is one of the most stressful times of people's lives, I propose it be made compulsory to have 14 days between exchange of contracts and completion of sale/purchase.\r\n",
