        "additional_details": "Any companies that have the advertising of any of their goods or services restricted or banned, could have its advertising expenditure assessed and taxed in full.  This would be linked to profitability year-on-year to make sure the businesses are not over-exposed.  Furthermore, no business in this sector would have any benefit from having a ban on this advertising, i.e., an increase in profits\r\n\r\nThis has two benefits;\r\n\r\n1) Company profits would not be affected as this expense was already charged to and paid by the businesses\r\n2) The income to the treasury would be sizable and would lead to the possibly harmful products or services funding the means of dealing with them, amongst other things\r\n\r\nThis is both sound ethically, and practically, and I urge you to sign this e-petition.",
