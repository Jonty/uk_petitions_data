        "additional_details": "The current UK laws on Fox hunting and Badger culling are ineffective and 80% of the UK population want bans on these so called blood sports. Time and again it has been proven that killing of such animals, similar to the stray dog issues in Eastern Europe serve no purpose, and in fact encourage breeding Foxes and Badgers to take over the area of a previously killed animal.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government must implement a 7 year ban on all forms of hunting of foxes and badgers and instead implement a catch, neuter and release program nationwide that will within this time span decrease the populations in a humane and acceptable fashion.\r\n",
