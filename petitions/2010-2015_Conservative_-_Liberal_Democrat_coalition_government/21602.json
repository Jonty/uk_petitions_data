There are dozens of petitions calling 'for the reintroduction of 'capital punishment' for example: each with one vote - defeating the whole purpose of a petition. We want one petition with 100,000 signatures, not 100,000 petitions with one signature? The suggestion is that the public should be allowed to suggest topics, but not create the petitions. Therefore the moderators of the site should consolidate suggested topics into one properly worded petition, which we can then vote on.\r\nFor the existing petitions already signed, votes for similar issues should be accumulated by the moderators into one petirion covering all the similar topics.\r\n\r\n",
