        "additional_details": "The 30 hour a week ruling to qualify for tax credits is too high for fibromyalgia/CRF sufferers. They should be able to get tax credits for a 16 hour week for self-employed or employed work; where they are continually turned down for DLA and their disability is disregarded by the system.  Fibromyalgia is a chronic illness and shorter working hours must be applied to this debilitating and incurable illness in order to qualify for Tax Credit.",
