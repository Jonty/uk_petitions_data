Scrap Child Benefit all together, save the money that goes to those that do not need it, save the money that goes into running the system and simply just increase the Child Tax Credit for everyone. This is already means tested so the extra money available would easily go to those who need it the most! P.S Anyone earning over \u00a345k a year doesn't need monetary help from the government, they need to learn to be more prudent and how to budget. Yours sincerely, Mr R N Bicknell.",
