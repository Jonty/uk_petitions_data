        "additional_details": "Mrs Longley the head teacher was removed from our school which is St Edmund Campion Catholic Primary School at the beginning of January 2014 by the South Nottingham Catholic Academy Trust which the primary school falls under. We as parents have not been given any information and there has been an acting head put in place but not the assistant head from the school. We want answers from the Chair of the Trust who has multiple roles within the diocese of Nottingham and its services, but ultimately we want our national leader of a head teacher back that always puts the children first.",
