        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition HM Government and the DfT to reverse the latest extension to London Midland's (LM) rail franchise.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding infrastructure faults beyond LM's control, services on all routes operated by LM are subject to regular delays and cancellations and overcrowding.\r\n\r\nAlthough LM claim to have resolved the driver shortage problems of late 2011, they still have no capacity to cover for staff illness or displaced train crews, resulting once more in the passenger being left stranded.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, they make no effort to provide alternative transport when a service is cancelled, simply directing peak-time travellers to use already crowded local bus and metro services is not providing an alternative, this being one example of the disregard LM have for their customers.\r\n\r\nLM's performance has a detrimental effect on the region and removal of their franchise would be in the interest of the local and national economies.",
