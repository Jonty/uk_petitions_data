        "additional_details": "The undersigned wish the Government to impose a 25 year moratorium on the proposal that access to forms etc. should only be available online.  The moratorium would be imposed on all public bodies, including Local and National Government.\r\nPeople born over the past 20 years or so, have come into a world where technology is the accepted norm.  This is not right for many elderly and disabled citizens who will have their right of independence compromised by such proposals.  It could also lead to them being susceptible to financial and other forms of abuse.  Some elderly and disabled people who currently do not have internet access or the knowledge and equipment, may wish to conduct business online.  Government must therefore provide proper and full funding for training, the right type of equipment and software, and access to the internet to enable this to happen.\r\nLocal Government must be charged with ensuring that no citizen is overlooked if such a programme is to be established.\r\n\r\n",
