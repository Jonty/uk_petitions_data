        "additional_details": "Instead of increasing the motorway speed limit to 80mph, why not increase the MINIMUM speed for vehicles under 3.5 tonnes to 60mph on motorways. The proposed increase of the speed limit is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nA large portion of Britain's motorists plod along at 50mph on a motorway. These people are a danger to themselves & everybody else. It is illegal to travel at 90mph on a motorway because you are closing in on traffic doing 70mph too quickly. These people that drive at 50mph are therefore causing other motorists who drive at the 70mph limit to close in on them at the same rate. This is dangerous enough as it is. The proposed rasing of the speed limit will only increase the closing speeds of traffic on what are already over crowded roads and will lead to even more accidents than we have now. Increaseing the minimum speed will make our motorways that little bit safer.",
