        "additional_details": "Despite being a cruel trade, the UK is still supporting the fur trade in which animals are kept living in dire conditions and killed using cruel and unreliable methods such as electrocution, drowning and gassing. As well as being cruel this trade is also unnecessary with synthetic furs available which looks and feels just as real fur does without the cruelty.  Banning the sale of fur within the UK would show that we will not tolerate this cruel trade and also that we are a forward thinking and compassionate nation.",
