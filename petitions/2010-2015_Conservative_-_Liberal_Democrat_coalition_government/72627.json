The income and affordability survey should be based upon age, profession, size of family, taxes, necessary expenditures, such as, childcare, food, fuel, transport, etc.\r\n\r\nThe cost of living in the UK is one of the highest in the world. Unfortunately, wage increments have not kept up with the cost of living.\r\n\r\nI hope that a national survey will shed light on the disparity between the cost of living and earnings and that the government will take appropriate action.
