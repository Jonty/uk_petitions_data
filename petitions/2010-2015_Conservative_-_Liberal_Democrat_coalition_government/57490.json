        "additional_details": "We propose that personal wealth of UK Citizens be limited with a 500 Million cap not including shares in UK industrial companies and charitable contributions. Financial, property, non-profit, and service companies to be specifically excluded. (richest UK individual currently 13,300m, Branson et al about 3500m).\r\n\r\nFurther to encourage a proper market situation we propose a market cap limit on any individual UK company of 7000m. This will mean more smaller companies, more competition and more innovation.",
