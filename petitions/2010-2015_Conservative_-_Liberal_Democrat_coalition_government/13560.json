I feel that the rules need to be changed, either that they are made ineligable to play for the Republic, or that The Northern Ireland Association (Irish Football Association) is compensated for the developement of the players in youth team.\r\n\r\nWe want as Northern Ireland fans to be treated fairly. Northern Ireland has taken great strides to be a family friendly venue, now the Republic of Ireland is the real sectarian figurehead.",
