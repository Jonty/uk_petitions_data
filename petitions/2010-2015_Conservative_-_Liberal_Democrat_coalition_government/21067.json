We are faced with high unemployment, housing shortage, rising food prices, lack of primary and nursing school places, air and sea pollution, lack of hospital care.\r\nIn a crowded society, responsible procreation is a must.\r\nThey test pensioners for pension credit. They test disabled. Why not be selective for child support!\r\nWe ought to give more support to children of broken marriages, children of unfit parents, children with behavioural problems.\r\nWe should not encourage women to have indiscriminate unprotected free sex. Women, mainly young girls, who, without a stable partner and often after a one night stand binge, are happy to become pregnant and cash in on \u00a3175/WEEK basic benefit while pensioners get hardly \u00a3400/MONTH.\r\nLet\u2019s change the system. It\u2019s about time.\r\nThis petition asks the Government to require that to be eligible for child support mothers must name the father of the child.\r\n",
