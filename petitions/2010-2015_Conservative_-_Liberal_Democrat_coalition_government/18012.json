Why can\u2019t Greece sell one or more of its many islands to help pay off their debt. I\u2019m sure Germany would like to buy one or two and perhaps we could invest in one for Britain. This theory could also be taken forward in the brewing financial troubles of Italy and Spain.\r\nGreece can't have its cake and eat it too, by expecting tax payers from other countries to just wright loans off. At the very least, its assets should be used as collateral for any further loans or bail outs.\r\n",
