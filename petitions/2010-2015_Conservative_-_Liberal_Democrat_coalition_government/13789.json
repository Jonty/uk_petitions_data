As the number of people in prison is now at a record high, the cost is rising fast.\r\nPrisoners currently have everything they need supplied for them. Therefore, by making prisons as self sufficient as possible, massive savings could be made.\r\nIf it can be grown, grow it! If it can be made, make it! Basically, if it's something they want, they need to put in the work to get it!",
