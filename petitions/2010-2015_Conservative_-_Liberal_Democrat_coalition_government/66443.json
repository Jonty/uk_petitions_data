        "additional_details": "I think it's time something was done about the great depression rapidly spreading throughout the football fans of England. Adrian Chiles takes you from good mood to bad the moment he opens his mouth. He is un-educated in the world of football (or if not un-educated, just plain ignorant towards it). He's not funny in the slightest and quite frankly he's rude. I've spoken to many football fans about Mr Chiles and I'm yet to find one who can tolerate him. Please can we look at having him replaced with somebody with a little charisma, charm and maybe even a touch of footballing knowledge.",
