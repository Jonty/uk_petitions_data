As a country we cannot compete with China, India etc etc in manufacturing goods because the cost of production is too high.\r\nWe clearly want to have a country that can be highly paid because of our skills in insurance, specialist engineering etc. The minimum wage would not affect salaries here. But we also want to make Burberry clothes in Britain rather than China, and can't because the minimum wage forces us to be uncompetitive.",
