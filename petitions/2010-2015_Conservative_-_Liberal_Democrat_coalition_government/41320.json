        "additional_details": "I am a constituent of Nadine Dores and have become increasingly tired of her self publicity. Her latest decision to disappear for an ego trip on reality tv which also protentialy pays her the equivalent of nearly a years salary as an MP is a gross deriliction of her duty as an MP. Her argument is that if people watch a TV program then an MP should be on it. People watch Crime Watch so should MP's be featured on that as well?",
