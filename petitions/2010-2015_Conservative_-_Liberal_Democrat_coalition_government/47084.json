This unit delivers a high standard of care to both the patient and family members at these difficult times. No other ward will be able to deliver this high standard of practice due to not enough staff to patient ratio. Please stop this very wrong decision by The University Hospital of Morcambe Bay Trust. Please give us Gold standard status so they can not close us again.",
