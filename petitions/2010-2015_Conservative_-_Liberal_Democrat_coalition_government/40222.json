        "additional_details": "GMO crops are filled with 'Roundup' pesticide to kill off any pests to get a good yield for the farmer. The only trouble is, the pesticide is always in the crop and used in the food chain. Recent studies show lab rats with enlarged tumours from eating only GMO crops all their lives, riddled with cancer they die young.\r\nBreakfast cereals in America contain GMO, many cereal makers her in the UK are subsidiaries of those American companies and must be using GMO in their products.\r\nLet's ban all GMO products from Britain.",
