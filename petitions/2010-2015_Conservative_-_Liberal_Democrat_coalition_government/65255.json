However, suffice to say, this is the man who is widely regarded as having \"won the World Cup\" for England. Clive Woodward rightly received a knighthood for Managing the team. Jonny Wilkinson now deserves the same honour for the role he has played in elevating the sport to new heights. Please create Jonny Wilkinson as the first player \"Knight of rugby union\".",
