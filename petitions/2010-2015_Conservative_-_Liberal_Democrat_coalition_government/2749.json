        "additional_details": "This is a call for the government to look into redeveloping the British rail network for high speed trains by upgrading existing lines, rather than developing new lines through some of the countries areas of natural beauty.\r\n\r\nThese upgrades would also include euro-star extensions via London to other major cities in the UK, such as Liverpool, Edinburgh and Cardiff to continental Europe promoting increased tourism from all corners of the UK to Europe.\r\n\r\nThese lines can also be used to carry high speed freight trains between these major cities to reduce the cost to individual passengers and to freight companies.  This will also speed up the traveling time of freight as well as reducing the amount of freight carried via airlines, ships and lorries.\r\n\r\nWith growing investment to fight climate change would it not be wise for high speed electric trains to run partly on energy produced from green sources?\r\n",
