Once gone they cannot be replaced.\r\n\r\nThe largest market for mahogany products is the UK. By banning the use and sale of mahogany timber and products the driving force to cut them down will be gone.\r\n\r\nBy saving the trees we save the rainforest.\r\nBy saving the rainforest we save biodiversity.\r\nBy saving biodiversity we save ourselves.\r\n\r\n",
