The UK can no longer afford to continue giving billions of pounds in foreign aid to countries that do not need it.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United Kingdom are being heavily taxed and children are living in poverty. There is mass unemployment and our infrastructure is creaking under the strain.  Our old age pensioners are just about surviving on the pension that they receive. And councils are cutting services due to a lack of funds caused by this government. It is therefore immoral that this government 'gives' taxpayers money away to countries that have a nuclear and a space program, and have better roads and services than we have in the UK. Surely this is a case of mismanagement of public funds ?\r\n\r\nOr is there another reason for our generosity ?",
