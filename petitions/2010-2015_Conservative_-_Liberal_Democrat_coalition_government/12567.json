The Public enquiry would open a lot of answers to the reasons why individuals took to rioting and looting or maybe what actions the Police and the Government took to bring order to our cities. This is a Public issue and so should be investigated by us all, not just by internal government, to be buried in red tape. Please vote to force the hand of government to govern our way.",
