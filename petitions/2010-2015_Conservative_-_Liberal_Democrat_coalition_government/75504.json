        "additional_details": "Sometimes people need to call the police, and similar agencies. calls to 999 are of course free, however, calls to 101 are not free from mobile phones. This can lead to people choosing not to report something where they otherwise would. some circumstances make people unsure if it is serious enough to call 999 and take up valuable time for others trying to reach the police or other services in a life threatening or emergency situation. There are times when a call to the police needs to be made but it is not life or death, but still important. Calls to 101 should be free for this purpose so that crimes and other things are reported if needed.",
