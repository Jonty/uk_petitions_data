        "additional_details": "Belle's is a preloved clothing shop situated in Sandwich, Kent.\r\nOur planning permission was denied on the basis that the small 4.5X4.5 log cabin will increase traffic on the road outside the complex. It is said to not fit in with the farm shop surroundings, however their is another log Cabin adjacent to the building which was granted planning permission. The log cabin is classed as outside the town, the reason we were given is 'Clothing is not to be sold in the countryside'. The member of the Dover planning offices who was on our case actually told us to build it before the planning permission deadline as she saw no reason why it would be denied.\r\nWe will be resubmitting our planning application and need all the support we can get. Please sign this petition to show your support. ",
