        "additional_details": "Today, I visited a blood donor centre where as a gay man, I was unable to donate because I have had sexual contact within last 12 months. How ludicrous. A gay man in a committed relationship will also be unable to give blood as \"gays are statistically at higher risk of being infected by HIV\" ever thought that this could be because there is a lower population of gay men than heterosexual?  A heterosexual person can go on a \"lively holiday\" and have sexual contact on various occasions than come home and donate blood.. But a committed homosexual can't. This needs sorting, and now. It's discrimination. Straight people can contract HIV too.  ",
