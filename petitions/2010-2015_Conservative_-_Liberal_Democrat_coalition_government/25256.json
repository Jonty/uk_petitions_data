        "additional_details": "Ban the use of gas powered \"cannons\" used by farmers, Other bird deterrents are available and should be used instead. These guns make living in rural areas a misery as they are now operating 12 months of the year. They are affecting the use and enjoyment of our homes. We cannot sit outside in the summer, instead we have to remain indoors with the windows closed but even that doesn't drown out the bangs which often start at 4 or 5 in the morning and go on until after dark or even all not too. The government needs to ban or closely regulate the use of these devices.",
