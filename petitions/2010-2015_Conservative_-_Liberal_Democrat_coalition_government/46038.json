This is rediculous in the 21st Century. There needs to be a discount on the bill for \"lost pay\" to compensate for lost income. I am therefore petitioning the Govt to approach BT for a change in Policy for the benefit of everyone in the country. Companies need to revolve around the needs of customers not customers around the needs of business!",
