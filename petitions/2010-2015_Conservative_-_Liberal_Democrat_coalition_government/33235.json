        "additional_details": "Just seen the PM saying he cares about hard working people and those who save hard for their retirement.\r\n\r\nI was made redundant about 6 weeks ago and subsequently signed on for JSA, for which I am entitled to receive for 6 months, after which I lose because I have savings. Why?\r\n\r\nI along with many others have worked hard and saved hard, as they prefer and encourage us to do, so why are we then not allowed JSA after 6 months for as long as it takes us to get another job?\r\n\r\nThis is unfair and not correct. If I had whittled my savings away on fancy material items, flash holidays, smoking, drinking, etc... and was left with no savings, then I would continue to get support. Why?\r\n\r\nCan someone tell me why? I would be grateful if this question could be put to the PM or other politicians in power.",
