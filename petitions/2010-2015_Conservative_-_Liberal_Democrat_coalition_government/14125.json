        "additional_details": "We wish the government to urgently re-examine the EU directive which leads to drivers with diabetes being stripped of their licences if they suffer two hypos in a year, even whilst asleep in bed. We ask them to consider the large number of safe and careful drivers with diabetes who, whilst suffering occasional hypos in their sleep, afford no risk in their waking hours on the roads. These drivers will lose their independence and even their work as a result of implementation of this directive.",
