If an adult dog was adopted from an animal shelter and found to be already trained to an acceptable standard, a reduced-rate licence should be available.\r\n\r\nIf dogs cause a nuisance by barking, the person responsible should act immediately to quieten the animals and failure to do so should constitute a breach of the peace. In the first instance the penalty should be an \u00a380 anti-social behaviour fixed-penalty ticket.",
