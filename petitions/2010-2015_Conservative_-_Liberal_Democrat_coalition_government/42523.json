        "additional_details": "We call upon the government to implement, in full, the recommendations of Leveson LJ following his inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the press.\r\n\r\nOver the last 70 years the printed press has repeatedly and consistently demonstrated that it is incapable of adequately regulating itself. A free press is a just and essential requirement of a democratic society, but the power that the press wields cannot be allowed to be abused to serve the powerful and privileged.\r\n\r\nThe broadcast media has long been governed by the statute-backed Ofcom, without its independence and effectiveness being compromised. We regret the suggestion that such a regulator would weaken the printed press.",
