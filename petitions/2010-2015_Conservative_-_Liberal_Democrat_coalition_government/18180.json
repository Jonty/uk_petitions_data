This is a huge incentive for many people to pick up a book and is a logical step forward into the 21st century for local libraries.\r\n\r\nIt is a win-win scenario, allowing greater access to books for those who do not have easy access to a library. In addition, it enables libraries to provide access to thousands of extra books they otherwise would not have the money to stock.\r\n\r\nThe government should adopt this approach in the UK and give thousands of potential readers a new avenue to access the services of their local library.",
