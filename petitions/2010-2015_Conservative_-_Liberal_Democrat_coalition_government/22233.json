        "additional_details": "We call on HM Government to give maternity rights to mothers of children born through surrogacy.\r\nUnder the law there is no entitlement to either maternity leave or statutory maternity pay as these benefits are available only to employees who give birth.\r\nIn the UK couples generally choose surrogacy as an option only if they cannot physically carry children themselves. For people who do surrogacy through a registered charity there are strict guidelines as to who is eligible. How is it fair that these mothers do not receive any maternity rights, maternity pay or a guaranteed job at the end of their maternity leave?\r\nIf you adopt a child, you have the right to up to 52 weeks Adoption Leave. Why is the law different for surrogacy?\r\nMaternity rights are not solely designed to enable physical recovery from pregnancy and child birth \u2013 they are to enable a child to get the best possible start in life by spending as much of its first year as possible with its mother.",
