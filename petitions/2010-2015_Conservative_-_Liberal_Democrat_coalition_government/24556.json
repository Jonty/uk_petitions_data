There are far too many immigrants in this country and public services are struggling to cope with the influx of so many new people. Having a British passport in itself makes it almost impossible to deport someone.\r\n\r\nIn many other countries, people must wait longer than 5 years before they can apply for citizenship. We therefore ask the Home Office to raise the time limit to at least 8 years.",
