My sister runs her own business which has been suffering due to the health condition of my bother in law. They have an 8 year old daughter and have been advised that he is not entitled to any sick pay or ESA regardless of the fact that both have worked for over 30 years and paid into the state counts for nothing. If you have not paid enough NI in the last two years you are entitled to nothing.How do people who come into this country after paying nothing at all receive benefits, houses and all the support they want and ask for. The system is wrong and it needs to look after people who have paid their way. It is shocking!The government preach about children suffering poverty well my niece will be one of them if my sister loses her house.",
