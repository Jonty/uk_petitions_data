        "additional_details": "Parkstone Railway Station in Lower Parkstone, Poole, Dorset, could lose its ticket office and associated member of staff under a proposed government cull of 675 ticket offices nationwide.\r\n\r\nIf that happens, it means you will no longer be able to buy your rail tickets from Malcolm, the popular and helpful member of staff who runs the ticket office. Instead, you will have to use the ticket machine, or buy your tickets on-line as the station will be unmanned.\r\n\r\nTime is of the essence, so please sign this petition NOW, and encourage everyone you know who also feels strongly about this issue to do the same.\r\n\r\nTOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE!\r\n",
