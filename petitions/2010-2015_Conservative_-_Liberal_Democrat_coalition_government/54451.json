        "additional_details": "There are many people using the 'birth certificate' argument in court to say that this is what makes a baby a legal 'person'/entity and it is this that gives the UK government the ability to impress laws and powers over 'persons'. There is a mixed translation of this amongst judges. The break down descriptions on the internet make legal sense, but is it real? Are citizen birth certificates really company-like entities and are all bills and court orders addressing this 'person'? Can the UK government please verify the claims of this?",
