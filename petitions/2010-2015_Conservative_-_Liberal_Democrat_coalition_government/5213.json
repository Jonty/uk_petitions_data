Whilst the minority of businesses will do their part for society, the vast majority do not.  With 19% of the working population registered disabled, it is not too much to ask that all medium and large companies be required to have at least 10% of it's staff at each level registered disabled, and all companies required to publish annual accounts should be required to indicate in the annual report what grades and how much in percentage are registered disabled.",
