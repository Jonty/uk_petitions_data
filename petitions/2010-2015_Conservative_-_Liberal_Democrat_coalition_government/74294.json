        "additional_details": "Nurse recruitment in London is getting harder.  It is especially difficult to attract and retain experienced staff. One key factor is the cost of commuting as  house prices in London are too high for most staff.  With rising train fares exceeding salary increases it would benefit the healthcare sector if rail and public transport fares were discounted for its workers.  The Metropolitan Police have a subsidised travel scheme, why can't Nurses have the same benefits?  The Government should provide discounted travel on the public transport network for all key workers.",
