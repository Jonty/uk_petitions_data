        "additional_details": "Jay walking should be made illegal.\r\n\r\nToo often, I see people crossing roads without looking, and without waiting for approaching traffic to pass by.\r\n\r\nCrossing the road in this way puts them in danger of injury / death which would easily be avoided. It is inconsiderate to other road users who may have to take evasive action to avoid a collision.\r\n\r\nI have seen the rise of this particularly by people distracted by their use of mobile phones / devices whilst on the move.\r\n\r\nJay walking is illegal in some parts of Europe and the rest of the world.",
