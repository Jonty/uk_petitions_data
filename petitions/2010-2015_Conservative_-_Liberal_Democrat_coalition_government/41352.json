While a couple who both work 16hrs a week with 1 child, claiming HB, WTC and CTC earn LESS.\r\n\r\nTHIS NEEDS TO CHANGE.\r\n\r\nIs there any wonder more and more people are turning to JSA and HB and as an alternative to working because it pays more than having a job?\r\nThis petition is aimed to guide the government into a policy change whereby benefits are greater for those who work on a low income, than those who do not work.\r\n\r\nCHANGE THE POLICY, HELP THOUSANDS.\r\n",
