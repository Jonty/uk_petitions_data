        "additional_details": "There is a real threat to rural England across the country due to the Government's National Policy Planning Framework (NPPF). Around 50% of local councils have not completed a Local Plan leaving their districts wide open to speculative housing developers.\r\n\r\n The Government want more houses at any cost.However builders are targeting rural villages and market towns across the country. Many of the new homes being built are not selling due to lack of demand. These are then sold on to housing associations. One has to ask the question why, if there is no local demand, are these houses not being built in the areas where they are needed?\r\n\r\n  Local councils MUST listen and must fight on our behalf but we must change Government policy.\r\nWhen Parish Councils' object to development on legitimate planning grounds this should have real influence at county level and the application should be refused - this should be enshrined in law.\r\n ",
