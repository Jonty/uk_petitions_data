The EU is funded with taxpayer\u2019s moneyand the public have a right to know how our EU contributions are spent.\r\n\r\nThe Accounts being blocked by EU politicians could mean there is fraud, waste and abuse of EU money and the British people have a right to know about corruption so we can stop it just like the MP expenses scandal. Unlike the MP's expenses scandal the sums of potential fraud within the EU budget is a lot greater.\r\n\r\nIf you believe in accountable government then you must sign this e-petition\r\n\r\n\r\n",
