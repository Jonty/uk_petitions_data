        "additional_details": "When football clubs go out of business or into administration in the main with large debts it is the football industry that protects itself through this rule.  This means that other clubs, players on large contracts, are always guaranteed to receive monies owed to them but the companies servicing clubs with outstanding invoices only receive whatever the creditors agreement allows, normally 1/2p in the pound.\r\n\r\nHow can this be fair to these businesses that are at risk of going out of business?\r\n\r\nFootball must be brought in line with standard business practices, please support this petition.",
