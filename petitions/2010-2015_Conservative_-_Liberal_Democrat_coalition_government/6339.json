        "additional_details": "Why do we not introduce \u00a3350/month jobs in UK along the same lines as the German 400\u20ac jobs. The simplicity of the scheme is that the employee pays no tax or social security contribution and the employer pays only a modest contribution for social security and pension. There is no specific rate of pay per hour and no bar on the employee having several such jobs. It also overcomes the EU Working Time Directive. It does not drive down wages as every job is settled by mutual negotiation. Its major advantage is that both employer and employee have flexibility as there is no long term employment contract involved. The employer\u2019s commitment is clear and specific, \u00a3350 plus the social security and pension contribution for each month the employee is needed.",
