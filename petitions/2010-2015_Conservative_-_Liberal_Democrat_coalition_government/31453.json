        "action": "Build a Bridge/Barrage over the Duddon Estuary, connecting Barrow in Furness to the West Coast of Cumbria",
        "additional_details": "At present, the only way to go from Barrow to Millom and the West Coast of Cumbria, is along the A595 - a journey of around 20 miles each way. This road is little more than a dangerous single track in places and the return journey takes around one hour.This road is also the main access road to Sellafield. A Bridge across the Estuary would cut the journey time to under 10 minutes, would save fuel and greatly reduce the Carbon Footprint of the vehicles making this journey. The Bridge could also incorporate a Barrage which could generate Tidal Energy and power - a much more predictable form of power generation than Wind Generators. The cost of this Bridge has been put at around \u00a3620,000,000 and could be funded by Sellafield, the EU and from the energy generated by the Barrage. The Duddon Estuary is a beautiful, and largely unknown, part of Cumbria and could become a large Wildlife Sanctuary that would bring much needed revenue to this part of the UK. ",
