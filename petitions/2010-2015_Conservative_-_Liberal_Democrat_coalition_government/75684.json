        "additional_details": ".I believe that there is a serious problem with littering not just where I live but in the whole of the UK. this problem is due to laziness and peoples lack of respect for the place they live.\r\nThe laziness of people is also demonstrated with the amount of people that are unemployed in England. I will not accept the line that \"there are no jobs available\" there are plenty!. if a job is too hard for them to find, they need to be doing something for there community to be able to access there benefits. I suggest litter picking as this is easy and will improve the environment, it will also encourage people to get a job who are just being lazy, any job is better than litter picking. Benefits cannot just be handed out, it is peoples hard earned money and I refuse to sit and watch it be given to people who just cannot be bothered.",
