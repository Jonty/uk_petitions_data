        "additional_details": "Pig Farmers are also suffering with rising production costs (mainly feed), such that many British Pig Farmers are making a loss.\r\n\r\nSince Christmas, the price of soya meal, (important for protein in pig), has risen from \u00a3290-295/t - to \u00a3400/t. As such average production costs are about \u00a31.75/kg deadweight, compared with a current average pig price of \u00a31.50/kg deadweight.\r\nresulting in a loss of c. 20p/kg or about \u00a318-20 on each pig they sell.\r\n\r\nNot only are pig farmers being paid less than the cost of production, the differential between gate price and production cost has increased significantly over the last 12 months, and is continuing to increase.\r\n\r\nWe are looking for government to combat the monopoly that the major retailers have in squeezing the price paid to British pig farmers.\r\n\r\nWe require a minimum farmgate price (ppkg) ABOVE the average cost of production, with a reasonable margin, or subsidy to fill that gap, to ensure British food products continue to be produced.",
