        "additional_details": "The new drug driving laws that came into effect on March 2nd are not fit for use. Drivers are being penalised for being sober when tested but testing positive for previous use, which can relate to any time from the day before to over a fortnight ago. The drug driving laws should be parallel to the drink driving ones, if you are impared and under the influence you lose your licence. In a court of law there would need to be sufficient evidence to prove the driver was impared as with alcohol related cases so why is it now a different story for illicit and prescription drugs.\r\n\r\nPlease rethink and repeal this new law and make amendments before a lot of time and resources is poured into a sprawling pit for the outcome to be disastrous.",
