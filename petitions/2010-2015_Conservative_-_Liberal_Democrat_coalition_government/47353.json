        "additional_details": "The petition asks to legalize pepper spray in the UK as a defense against dogs and other animals.\r\n\r\nPeople living in some areas are attacked by aggressive dogs almost daily. Neither the police nor dog owners do anything about it.\r\n\r\nPepper spray works well in other EU countries as a deterrent. Dog owners make a real effort to call their dogs back whenever they see that the victim (often runners) carries pepper spray but not otherwise.",
