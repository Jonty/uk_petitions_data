This is not a fair processes I have had my daughter at the top of the waiting list for our local catchment school which her sister already goes to and because someone else who has the same criteria has moved into the area lives 300 metres closer they have gone to the top of the list. If your in catchment your in catchment surely it should come down to the period you have been on the waiting list. The whole process isn't fair. ",
