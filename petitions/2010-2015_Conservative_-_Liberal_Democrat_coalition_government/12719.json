        "additional_details": "Remember how Saturday afternoon's used to be?\r\n\r\nSitting at home watching Final Score with your Dad, while the football results came through one letter at a time at the bottom of the screen.  All the while that beeping noise adding to the tension.  Would your team come back from a goal down?  Would anyone get stuffed so badly that the number of goals was spelt out in letters after the score?\r\n\r\nNew technology has given us so much, you can now sneak a look at a match on your mobile phone while being dragged around the shops.  But we've also lost something - the beeping noise that came from the Vidiprinter, AND WE WANT IT BACK!\r\n\r\nSo come on, sign this petition and together we will make the politicians get the BBC to bring the sound effect back. (and after that the pools news - we know that you do the lottery now and haven\u2019t seen a pools collector at your front door for 20 years - but this is our heritage dam it!)\r\n",
