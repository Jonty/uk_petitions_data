        "additional_details": "Hendre Fourie has represented England at rugby, been in the UK paying taxes for 8 years, has a English born son but due to injury is no longer allowed to stay in the UK on his visa. While we are letting so many immigrants enter the country to claim benefits it is a disgrace that a guy who has been working and can still earn a living is not welcome. Sign this petition to tell the home office to all Hendre Fourie and his family to stay",
