        "additional_details": "Differential pay rates for public sector workers in the regions offend natural justice, in that the same job - say a secondary schoolteacher - should fairly receive the same reward irrespective of the postcode in which it is practised. It also discriminates against poorer regions in reducing their already low per-capita incomes, making public sector recruitment almost impossible, and in the wilful creation and maintenance of 'low economy' areas, who nevertheless pay the same taxes, fuel duty, etc as the rest of the country. This will lead to low aspirations, mass exodus of talent and built-in depression. It is indefensible.     ",
