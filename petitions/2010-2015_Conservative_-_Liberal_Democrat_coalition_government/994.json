        "additional_details": "Currently, the most severely disabled people in the country, of 'working' age, receive NO Winter Fuel Allowance. I propose EXTENDING the WFA to those below retirement age, who are officially classed as 'severely disabled' by the DWP (or those in receipt of Severe Disablement Allowance) and also receiving the 'care' component at lower or higher rate of DLA. Disabled people always need to spend more on fuel...but the most severely disabled are often housebound and are surely the most needy and deserving of some extra financial assistance.",
