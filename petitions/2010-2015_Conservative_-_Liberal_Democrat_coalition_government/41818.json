        "additional_details": "November 9th 2012 it was announced that year 12 and 13 students from September 2013 January exams will be removed. However students have entered willingly into A Level courses without being informed of the upcoming changes. This will involve possibly taking up to six exams for one subject if re-sits are needed to be taken. The generalised view is that A Levels have 'gone soft', this is not the case, and the removal of January exams will increase the amount of pressure on students aged to 16-18.",
