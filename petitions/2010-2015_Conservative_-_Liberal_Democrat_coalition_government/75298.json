        "additional_details": "The plan to put the Union Jack flag on projects paid for by UK taxpayer money to 'show the public where their taxes are being spent' is unnecessary. Since the independence referendum showed just under half of the country no longer desires to be part of the UK, this is arguably a somewhat inappropriate and questionable thing to do and could further create a divide amongst Scottish citizens.",
