He has also made so manny U-turns that no one knows where we are any more.There should be a quick mechanism to remove poorly and wrongly perfoming ministers from office other than having to wait for several years for an election,after all any employee in any other job would be sacked if they did not come up to standard,why should the government be any different?\r\nMy suggestion is a tv/internet/postal election/deselection when enough people go onto the tv/internet/postal mechanism a register their dissatisfaction with the MP's decisions.It is time for a government to be truly representitive of the peoples will.",
