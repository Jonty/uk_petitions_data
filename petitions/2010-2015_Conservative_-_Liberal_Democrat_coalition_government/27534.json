        "additional_details": "Currently if your baby is born alive before 24 weeks and dies it is \"neonatal death\" however many people still refer to this as miscarriage, including press and medical staff. There needs to be more awareness.\r\n\r\nCurrently if your baby dies before birth, before 24 weeks, this is officially classed as a miscarriage, not a still birth.\r\nThe terminology needs changing as mothers who loose their babies still have to give birth to a fully formed baby, and then face their baby being called a miscarriage. As a mother labour's and gives birth it should be refered to as still birth. Hospital's should treat these mothers with the same respect as a full term still birth.",
