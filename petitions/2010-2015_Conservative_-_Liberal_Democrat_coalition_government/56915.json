        "additional_details": "This e-petition concerns the growing public concern that finds that Lenders have not signed the deed that relates to any registered estate in the UK.\r\n\r\nThere is also a finding that there is no statutory power for any Borrower to sign a document that purports to grant any lender a \u2018mortgage\u2019 of any registered estate in the UK.\r\n\r\nAlarmingly; according to Shelter; (BBC News, 4th Nov 2013) there are some 82,000 families with children who are living in boarding due to the repossession of their homes. An increase in interest rate will see more families lose their homes.\r\n\r\nThe Law says that a Deed must be signed by a lender. The Law says Lenders must not 'mortgage' registered land.\r\n\r\nWe seek review and consideration that all members of the Judiciary at first instance look to the validity of a mortgage of any registered estate in the UK and evidence of both the lender and borrowers signature on the deed in any possession proceedings.\r\n\r\n",
