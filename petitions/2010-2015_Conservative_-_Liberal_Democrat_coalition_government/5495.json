Some people might say \u201cSo what, humans are not rats!\u201d To which I would respond \u201cOur DNA is very similar to that of a rat, which is why they use rats for testing, but more important than this is that we have a much longer lifespan than a rat so if it affects a rats short life it will very likely effect us\u201d.\r\n\r\nFor decades side effects have been reported:-\r\nHeadache\r\nFlushing\r\nSweating\r\nFacial pressure or tightness\r\nNumbness, tingling or burning in face, neck and other areas\r\nRapid, fluttering heartbeats (heart palpitations)\r\nChest pain\r\nNausea\r\nWeakness\r\n",
