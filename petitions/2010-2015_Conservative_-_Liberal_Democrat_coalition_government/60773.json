This advice is undermined when personal addresses are freely available to access by typing someone's name into a search engine.\r\n\r\nPlease implement:\r\n\r\n-An end to private companies being able to redistribute personal or business related data for profit without explicit consent. Such data should only be available at the source eg. Companies House\r\n\r\n-Greater transparency and education of where people's information may become \u201cpublic\u201d (eg. Electoral Roll)\r\n\r\n-Opt-in rather than opt-out for proffering personal details  (eg. on the edited Electoral Roll)",
