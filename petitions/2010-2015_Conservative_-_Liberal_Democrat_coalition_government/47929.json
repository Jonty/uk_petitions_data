        "additional_details": "I would like to see the reintroduction of the use of 'The Stock' for misdemeanours, anti-social behaviour and lesser crimes in towns and villages.  The Stocks have never legally been abolished.  The Stocks works on the principal of humiliating the offender publicly.  The Stock are a painless, cost-effective and highly visible way of administering restorative justice.  People can see justice in action and there is a huge deterrence factor for both offenders and would-be offenders.  Some towns still have their original Stocks and some have even been restored, lets start making use of them.  Where towns and villages do not have Stocks, it would be a cheap and simple matter to have new ones installed.. ",
