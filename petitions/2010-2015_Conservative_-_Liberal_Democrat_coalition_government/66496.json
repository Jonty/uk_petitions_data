        "additional_details": "The Government is proposing changes to close Tier 1 (General) extension on 6 April 2015, if this is passed then a large majority of Tier 1 visa holders will be affected who could not accumulate the continuous residence period by April 2015 that is required to settle permanently in the UK. (via ILR)\r\n\r\nI strongly believe a lot of Tier 1 visa holders will benefit if the closure is not implemented for the next 2 years (atleast) in order to allow a wider community to become eligible to settle permanently in the UK.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition today if you believe the Tier 1 Extension should not be closed in April 2015.\r\n\r\nThank You\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
