Youngsters are left clinging to ankles, Teens are sat alone and depressed in bedrooms and Parents are in despair as the threat of court fines and imprisonment closes in.\r\n\r\nWe need REAL CHANGE within the system to quickly recognise and respond when school absence is a MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE and NOT TRUANCY or A PARENTAL SKILLS DEFICIT.\r\n\r\nEarly intervention is the key to stopping many of these youths from developing life long mental health problems. Please Help!",
