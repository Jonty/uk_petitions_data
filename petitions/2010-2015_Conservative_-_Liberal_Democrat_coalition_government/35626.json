        "additional_details": "Today I read a news article announcing that 179 police stations are set to close, and there will be a 6% reduction in frontline police officers by 2015.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Justice can prevent this by raising funds from criminals.\r\n\r\nThey can pay for their own food and living costs by working (minimum wage) in any business.\r\n\r\nA jail could be a sweatshop, for example. They can make clothing, and jails can seek contracts from companies looking for cheap labour.\r\n\r\nThey can make their own clothes, bedding, and anything else required. This is one example, the possibilities are endless. Each jail can have a different industry.\r\n\r\nThis allows them to gain skills and experience required to work after their sentence.\r\n\r\nThey can pay for education (to study outside of working hours). If they want a PS3/TV, they buy it, and then they pay for the electricity.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned would like the necessary changes to be implemented to make jails self-funding, removing the burden from the state.",
