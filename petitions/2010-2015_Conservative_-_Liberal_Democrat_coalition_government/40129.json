        "additional_details": "Have you, like many other people gone to the park with your dog or child and have found that they have been in an accident due to glass or litter. I have twice now and its cost me more than \u00a31000 Many times I have called up and complained to my local council and my Mayor as well, to tell them of this, and the response was \"we can just get some one to clean it up for you\". But hang on don't you do that any way? and the other response was \"we can't control the actions of youths\"but wait a second, what are the police for? and the response I got is \"there's not enough of the police\". All I would like and I think what you as the community would like is a safe environment for our dogs, children, and even the adults, to just go to a local park and not have the fear of having an accident due to the negligence of the council. Please sign this and lets make an impact, lets make our children, community and our pooches proud!",
