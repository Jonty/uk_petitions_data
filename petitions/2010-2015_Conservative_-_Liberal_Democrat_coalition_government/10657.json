        "additional_details": "The Cycle to Work scheme is a UK Government annual tax exemption initiative introduced in the 1999 Finance Act to promote healthier journeys to work and to reduce environmental pollution. Despite the passing of 12 years and a pilot study, government employees of the NICS still do not have access to the government backed scheme. The latest excuse being the cost of integration into the HR Connect system. A system which cost \u00a3465M and was supposed to simplify and streamline HR functions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the interests of health, environment and equality for government employees across the UK, we call on the government to instruct the NICS to implement the scheme.",
