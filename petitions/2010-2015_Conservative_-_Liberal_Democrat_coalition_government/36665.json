Just because we are are on edge of the county,  this should not mean we have to put up with a second rate Health service and have to travel over an hour to the nearest hospital.  This could mean life or death in some cases.  Berwick maternity unit is second to none in pregnancy and aftercare.\r\n\r\nPlease Keep it open!!\r\n\r\n",
