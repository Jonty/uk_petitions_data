        "additional_details": "Currently in South Korea over 2 million dogs are slowly and horrifically killed for meat per year. As a country concious of animal welfare it is up to the U.K Government and other members of the U.N to put pressure on South Korea to not only outlaw the savage killing of dogs in korea but also to make it illegal to sell dog meat within their country. These dogs are not killed humainly, they are stabbed, hung and even boiled alive and it is an unnacceptable way to treat any animal in the 21st century! please sign this petition and pass it on to anyone you belive would help to put a stop to this barbaric act of cruelty.",
