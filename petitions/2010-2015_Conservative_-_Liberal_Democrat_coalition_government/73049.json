        "additional_details": "This petition demands appropriate funding of education facilities in this part of Surrey to enable the Howard of Effingham school  to undertake a programme of regeneration on its existing site rather than decimate an entire village to generate sufficient funds for its redevelopment.\r\n 70 acres of  Green Belt, surrounding the small rural village of Effingham, and representing the first wildlife corridor outside the M25 / A3 corridor is under threat from a joint alliance between Berkely Homes and the Howard of Effingham school.\r\nSurrey C Council are refusing to fund the development the school says it needs, forcing it into a confrontation with the small rural community in which the school resides, and into an unholy alliance with developers to fund the school project by building in excess of 300 homes in a small rural village in the heart of the Green Belt.The project will take six years, double the settlement size of the village, cripple infrastructure and add to congestion.
