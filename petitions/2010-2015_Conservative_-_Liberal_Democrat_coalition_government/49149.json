        "additional_details": "Supplementary schools such as part time religious schools, private tutors and private sports coaches that operate for less than 12.5 hours per week currently hold the legal right to smack children in their care. Such institutions need to be brought in line with all other schools and child care settings and be subject to the same laws barring them from smacking children who should be able to trust them. The government needs to amend this and make it a criminal offence for such institutions to physically punish children.",
