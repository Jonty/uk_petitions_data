They have taken this decision without any public consultation stating that the company is not obliged to consult publicly on its proposals. In the case of many older people without transport this is far more than an inconvenience. We would like the Government step in and request that Royal Mail undertake an Equality Impact Assessment and ask people in the local area their views.\r\n",
