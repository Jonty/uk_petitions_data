        "additional_details": "The conditions on this train service are unacceptable: not only are they are cramped and uncomfortable, but they pose a severe health and safety risk to both its passengers and staff. As a daily commuter and student, I have seen some of society's most vulnerable members paying the cost of the rising demand that is being placed on the line. More and more people are travelling to and from the city centre every day, however, First Great Western don't seem to be taking appropriate action to ensure that they maintain their high standards of comfort and safety on this service. I believe that the best course of action would be to acquire another carriage for usage at peak times to ensure that neither safety nor comfort is compromised. I hope that advice and support from the Department of Transport would help to achieve this in the most efficient way possible.",
