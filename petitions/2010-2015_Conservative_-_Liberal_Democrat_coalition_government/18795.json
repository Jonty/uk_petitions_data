You may receive calls from very angry people, who would have been provoked by your colleagues from other departments,\" Zuma told them.\r\n\r\n\"Remain calm, patient and be humane and human. You will solve a lot of problems if you remain human and avoid being technical.\"\r\n\r\nHe said once the system started working efficiently, the volume of calls would go down as the government \"should by then be more responsive, departments will have learnt the importance of responding quickly\".",
