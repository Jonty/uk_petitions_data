It is an hereditary condition where the teeth do not have the protective enamel on them making them very weak and prone to damage, rotting and falling out, the teeth also have very small roots so even a slight knock can cause them to come loose. I feel that as this condition is hereditary and no fault to the carrier that dental charges should be waivered. ",
