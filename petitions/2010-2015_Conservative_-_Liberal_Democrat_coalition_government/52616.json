It's high time there was equil rights for all parents.. High tine grandparents were given a voice.. High time sheriffs took these matters as serious as murder or rape because in some cases the abuse that is neglected can lead to ruined life's.. High time this government I helped elect paid me back by helping fathers have access to there children.. High time any parent stopping another from seeing his of her children were punished for doing so without cause.. It's time this country addressed family values And recognised it takes 2 parents to raise a child.. ",
