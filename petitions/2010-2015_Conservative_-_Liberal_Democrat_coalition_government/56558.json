        "additional_details": "He was tortured by Pinochet and exiled to the UK 40 years ago.  In that time he has been a burden on British taxpayers through his extensive medical treatment by the NHS.  It has now been declared that his injuries were caused by government sponsored torture before he left Chile.  Had he not been tortured criminally the British taxpayer would not have had to pay for his treatment.  To invoice the Chilean government to recover the cost of his treatment is, therefore, a reasonable act on behalf of the British taxpayer and it MUST be done.  The cost of medical treatment made necessary by a criminal act must ALWAYS recovered from the criminal.  It is NOT the duty of British taxpayers to fund the consequences of criminal acts anywhere on the planet.",
