Rather than handing qualifications that meaningless and don't provide proper preparation for the working life; the students of these qualifications are left poorly literate/numerate. The government should increase the vigour and incorporate a progressive system in which the student of such qualification can progress to a higher level , instead of being left with poor English and maths\r\n\r\nThe government needs to change the 'set system' and stop students feeling 'stupid'.",
