        "additional_details": "Following the recent riots in London, Birmingham, Bristol, etc., I propose that the UK Government takes emergency measures to re-introduce Conscription/National Service in a bid to stem the rapid demise of society at the hands of 'feral youths'.  It is clear that today's youth have no respect for authority, no manners or social skills and are fast becoming out of control.  Furthermore, it will take the responsibility from parents who, quite clearly, have no hold on their children and have lost the ability to discipline their young.  The Government must act now before it is too late and the UK becomes a 'no-go zone'.",
