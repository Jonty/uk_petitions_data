However it is a myth that anything that HMG own would not make any money. Socialism is public ownership with a stated objective of giving benefit to all citizens (like healthcare, schooling, social benefits), though communist states are not necessarily ethical, democratic, non-corrupt. Free quality healthcare, school, social benefits already cost HMG hundreds of \u00a3bn yearly. People of various persuasions are often unnecessarily grouped as belonging to various categories (like religious, left-wingers, right-wingers, pacifists, criminals, mentally ill, etc). Neuroimaging techniques (like MRI, PET, SPECT) may be used to research into whether such categories are due to (1) genetics (2) wiring of the neurons in brains structurally (3) learned (4) prevailing circumstances & context (5) artificial.",
