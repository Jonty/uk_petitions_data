        "additional_details": "Within the last year there has been random attacks on women in this alley the most recent on a 16 year old girl!\r\nIt is also known for drug deals and people hanging around making other feel intimidated and vulnerable it is not a safe place anymore and I'm sure most woman in the area will feel afraid to use the alleyway that leads from Dulnan close into Edgar Millward close. This area is on a bend with poor lighting and has alot of bushes which anyone could hide in, if the ally was to be widened it would make the ally alot more visible and maybe it would make people more at ease. I'm proposing that the existing wall and bushes be removed permanently and brighter lamps used in the ally and foot path leading from there into dulnan close,I would also like to point out that the rest of the Dee park estate is currently being regenerated but this problem area has failed to be considered.\r\nPlease sign and make our area a safer one, for our selves and our children ",
