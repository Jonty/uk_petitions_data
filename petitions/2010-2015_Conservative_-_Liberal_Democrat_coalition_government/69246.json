        "additional_details": "In 2010 American documentary film named Catfish was made. (A catfish is someone who pretends to be someone they're not using Facebook or other social media to create false identities, particularly to pursue deceptive online romances or for monetary gain).\r\nIt was directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, with a story about a young man, Nev, being filmed by his brother and friend, co-directors Ariel and Henry, as he builds a romantic relationship with a young woman on the social networking website Facebook.\r\nThis is happening more and more to innocent people through social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter and yet unless the person being \"catfished\" has been tricked out of money it is not seen as a criminal offence.\r\nIt is not taken into account that the victim has been lured into thinking that they are in a relationship with someone and how this affects their self esteem and confidence.\r\n\r\n",
