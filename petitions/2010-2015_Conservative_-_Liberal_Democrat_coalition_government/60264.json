        "additional_details": "Recently as some of you may know there has been plans for schools to be teaching 10 hours a day. Although this is just a mere idea the fact of 10 hours a day, 5 days a week (50 hours in total) excluding extra curricular activities is absolute madness. There is a point in which the brain refuses to take in information which is bordering on the 6 hour mark. Having 10 hour days is just impractical. Starting at 6 an finishing at 4, starting at 7 and finishing at 5? This would totally ruin social and family lives.\r\n\r\nSign this petition before its too late.",
