        "additional_details": "Nadine Dorries decision to appear on \u2018I\u2019m a celebrity get me out of here\u2019 is a blatant abuse of her privileged position as the member of parliament for mid Bedfordshire. As an elected MP she is a representative of the constituents who voted her in, her role is to represent them in the constituency and within the House of Commons. Her personal ambitions to gain more publicity and air her personal views on matters such as the abortion time limit are not in the public interest.\r\n\r\nNadine Dorries actions should therefore trigger the discussion of the Recall bill to introduce the power of recall elections. This was stated as a discussion point within the Coalition Agreement 11 May 2010.\r\n",
