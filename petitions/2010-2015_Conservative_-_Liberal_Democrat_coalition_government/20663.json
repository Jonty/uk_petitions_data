        "additional_details": "Britain must develop a strategy to work closely with the Eastern European countries, especially countries like Ukraine, Russia, Romania and others to combat  sex trafficking taking place within the country. The British government has to put pressure on the Eastern European countries to do their bit by working towards spreading awareness about sex trafficking within their countries and develop an effective strategy to investigate and prosecute all those who are involved in sex trafficking. Britain needs to urge the UNODC to provide all the necessary support that it needs and work towards combating the menace. The effective seizure of assets and funds from sex trafficking can help the government to fund other aspects of the project, like providing victim support, conducting investigations and so on. The government must also work towards spreading awareness among school, college and university students about sex trafficking so that women and girls are protected againnst the menace.\r\n\r\n",
