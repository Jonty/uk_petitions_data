        "action": "Increase funding for the Mental Health sector of the NHS to help younger people with mental health issues",
        "additional_details": "Due to the involvement of the Internet and other technological advances, younger people are becoming more vulnerable to verbal attack, through things such cyberbullying.\r\n\r\nThis means youths aren't even safe from these forms of attacks in their own home. It is leading to more and more reported incidents of self harm, depression and suicide from youth who are unable to be seen by people in an attempt to resolve these feelings.\r\n\r\nWhile targeting the roots of this problem would be ideal, it currently isn't practical, meaning this would be a useful and potentially lifesaving temporary alternative.\r\n\r\nA large amount of youths feeling symptoms of depression or other disorders are not being seen by medical professionals for several months due to a lack of funding. I feel that the DoH should increase the funding to this sector by a minimum of 7.5% in order to increase the amount of staff and facilities available, meaning people who really need help can be seen sooner.",
