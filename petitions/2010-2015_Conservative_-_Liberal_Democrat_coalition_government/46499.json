        "additional_details": "If councils raise council tax by more than 2% they must have a referendum and all those not paying full council tax would also get the vote despite not being financially affected. In fact it is in their interests to vote for higher taxes which they would not have to pay in total or part.  I propose that only those paying full council tax are allowed to vote as the local council redistribute other peoples tax.",
