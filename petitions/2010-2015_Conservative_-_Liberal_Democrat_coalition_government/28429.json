        "additional_details": "Whilst it is admirable that the UK should give a significant percentage of GDP to less well off countries, in the current economic climate Foreign Aid should be reduced.  Aid to several countries should be abolished altogether - namely India - and targeted to countries that are worst off.  0.2%/\u00a33.5 billion is a reasonable sum considering UK debt has recently passed \u00a31,000,000,000,000 (one trillion) and economic growth is flat-lining.  The funds could be reinvested in essential front-line services or reduce annual spending.",
