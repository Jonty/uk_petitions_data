        "additional_details": "Losing a child is something a parent never wants experience yet so many do. For those who miscarry there is often no support. Those who lose in first trimester are not given an option as to what happens to their child. Often the thought of a child being treated as medical waste is unbearable. For those parents they not only get no closure but they have to live with the thought of their babies remains being thrown away, or in some cases flushed away. That is a very traumatic memory that adds to the trauma of miscarriage. Parents & their precious babies regardless of gestation (a person is a person no matter how small) deserve the same choices any other parent has when it comes to the unfortunate loss of a child. They should be offered counseling at the hospital, given the option of burial, cremation, or that of allowing the hospital to take care of the remains. In cases of no remains, ALL parents should be given counseling & choice for a memorial service.",
