        "additional_details": "Prisons need to be places for rehabilitation as well as punishment.  When many prisoners' literacy levels are low, and improving literacy can reduce reoffending rates, it is wrong to prevent prisoners from being sent books.\r\n\r\nReading helps to educate and to learn about the world, and this is more important for prisoners than most people as many of them are there because they have not understood the boundaries of society.\r\n\r\nReversing this ruling is necessary not just for the wellbeing of prisoners but for the good of society at large, because denying prisoners access to books is not going to help rehabilitate prisoners or reduce reoffending rates.",
