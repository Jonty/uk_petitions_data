        "additional_details": "I wish to petition the government(Home office, Theresa May\u00a0MP) on her advocacy to interdict DR Zakir Naik on his entry to the UK on unfounded pretences. Her semblance of authenticity in taking this action is a total misrepresentation of DR Zakir Naik. His is a man of Dawah ( a person who invites people to understand Islam through a dialogical process) and futher more has been quoted on numerous occasions of totally refuting violence. The grounds on which Theresa may reject him entery to the UK where unfounded and futher more untrue. Quoting DR Zakir Naik totally out of context.\r\n I feel it is our human right to hear the truth and facts of any religious faith according to there respective \"Holly texts in context\". ",
