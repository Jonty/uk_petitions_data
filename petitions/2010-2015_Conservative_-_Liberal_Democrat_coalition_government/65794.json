        "additional_details": "We call for further protection for cyclists. The current system poses great danger for cyclists on dangerous and busy roads without cycle lanes. We would call the government to allow cyclists, as long as they pose no danger to pedestrians, to cycle on the pavement should they feel in danger or if there is no cycle lane present. We would allow police officials to stop cyclists if they do pose a danger to the public. They would be able to ask the cyclist to walk or give the cyclist a fine, should reckless cycling be the case (much like the law for drivers). This law would protect children and young adults who are the most in danger under the current system. Whilst still protecting the pedestrians who use the pavement. ",
