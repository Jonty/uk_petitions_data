        "additional_details": "Almost 2 years on from the Supreme Court rilung the OFT could not assess bank charges for fairness. Nothing substantial has materialised and it seems the banks won the matter on a surprising technicality.\r\n\r\nThere are still millions of consumers who have paid thousands and thousands of pounds in unfair bank charges who with the confusion of the court cases are usnure what to do.\r\n\r\nThis petition is for the Prime Minister to instruct the OFT to assess the price of bank charges against the actual costs incurred by the banks and establish if the price is fair under The Consumer Credit Act 1974.\r\n\r\n",
