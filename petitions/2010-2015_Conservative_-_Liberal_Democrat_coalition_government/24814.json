They enjoyed the boom years and now seem happy to deprive the next generation. This petition is not about a tax cut or rise. This is a petition requesting that the government reduce all existing funding specifically aimed at people aged over 45 (for example the winter fuel allowance or discounts on second homes) and re-allocate this money to things specifically aimed to benefit people aged younger than 45 (for example promotion of affordable housing or university fees).",
