        "additional_details": "A proper debate to change the new national anthem for England. An anthem about the country we live in and not about the past rulings of a small elite of people. To be honest I don't know what the anthem should be, but it must be about the land and its people.\r\n\r\nIts so ridiculous and outdated that it means nothing to so many people.We are in the 21st century for Christ's sake.\r\n\r\nSign this petition and lets change this for the better.",
