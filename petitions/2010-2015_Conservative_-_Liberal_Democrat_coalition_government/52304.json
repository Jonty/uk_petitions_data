        "additional_details": "Social network websites all over the world are full of horrific images of the transport and inhumane, barbaric slaughter of dogs and cats for food in China.  Animals are rammed into tiny cages, without food, water or rest for transportation.  At the destination these poor animals are skinned and boiled alive, or clubbed to death, strangled, poisoned, electrocuted or hanged by the neck and, whilst still alive, are burned with blow torches to remove the fur.  It is ignorantly thought that the more the animal suffers, the better the meat tastes.  These images are amongst the worst of their kind that I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nPlease pressurise the Chinese to stop this vile trade which we in the civilised world find abhorrent.  Until it stops, China will be viewed as backward and uncivilised, still living in the Dark Ages, and unfit to participate in world events.  The Chinese who participate in this trade are beneath contempt.\r\n",
