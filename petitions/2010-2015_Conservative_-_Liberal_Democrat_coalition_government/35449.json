        "additional_details": "David Beckham has been a fantastic servant for his country, on the football pitch and away from it. He is one of the few players of his generation to represent his country with complete dedication and passion. He has heavily supported the London Olympics, travelling around the world to do so. Despite all of his dedication to the sport and his country, Beckham has been omitted from the team GB squad for the Olympics. Going in his place are Craig Bellamy, a good footballer but a man who's career has been riddled with petulance and I'll discipline, and Ryan giggs, a man who slept with his own brother's wife. These men are not role models, and have contributed nothing away from the pitch. David beckham is a role model and given his heart and soul, on the pitch and off it. He deserves one last chance to represent the country he has given so much for.",
