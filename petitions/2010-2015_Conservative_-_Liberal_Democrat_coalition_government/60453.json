        "additional_details": "There is currently no regulation of animal shelters and rescue centres. Anybody, with good intentions or not, can set themselves up as a 'rescue' and there is no process of their facilities or practices being checked and regulated.\r\nI am involved with dog training and have learned of many local dog rescues which sound like they are not well run and people are taking on dogs that do not always suit their situations. Reputable rescue centres will never allow someone to take on an animal which will not be suitable, and this is how animals end up being advertised on free-ad sites when the adoption doesn't work out. In the long run, the unregulated nature of this industry does not always achieve what it sets out to do.",
