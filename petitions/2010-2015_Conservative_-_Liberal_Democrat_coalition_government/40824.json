        "additional_details": "We are attempting to persuade the council to hand over the registry office so that we can convert it into a community theatre for Guisborough. If successful, the theatre will function as a small-scale commercial theatre which will attract a broad range of professional and amateur performers. We will also install cinema equipment and host regular film screenings.\r\n\r\nThe building will be used by the Earthbeat Theatre Company (a local disabled group) during the day but it will also be available for community use during the day, at evenings and at weekends. It is our hope that the building will become not only a premier arts venue but also a focus for community use and involvement.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to support our venture please sign the petition. If you would like to know more, please contact us by email or come to the public meeting at Sunnyfield House on Wednesday 7th November at 7.30pm.\r\n",
