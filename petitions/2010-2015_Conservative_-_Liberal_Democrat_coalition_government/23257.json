        "additional_details": "Under current legislation unions only require the support of the majority of their membership who actually vote in a ballot, rather than the support of the majority of their total membership before they can lawfully announce industrial action. In practice this can result in strikes being called on a very low turnout, sometimes with less than 20% of the total membership voting in favour of strike action. Therefore I propose that current legislation should be altered to require over 50% of the total membership of a union to vote in favour of industrial action before those members can be legally called out on strike.",
