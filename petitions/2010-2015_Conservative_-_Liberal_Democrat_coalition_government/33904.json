        "additional_details": "I am not suggesting a reduction in benefits however I believe that benefits, particularly income benefit are being misused by people. On countless occasions I have seen people who I know to be on income benefits going out to pubs every night of the week, or with the latest technology and designer clothes, surely this money is not being spent in the way that it was intended.\r\nBenefits should not be in the form of cash but should be in the form of credit that can be used in supermarkets for the purchase of food and clothes etc. but it should not be used for the purchase of alcohol or cigarettes. The credit should also be able to be used for utility bills and housing etc. This would enable a system where people in need of benefits are provided with the things that the money being allocated should be spent on.\r\nNot only does this allocate benefits better but will also reduce smoking and alcohol consumption within the U.K and promote healthier living in general.
