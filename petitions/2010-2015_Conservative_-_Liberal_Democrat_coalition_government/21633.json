        "action": "Reduce public sector pensions to private sector level",
        "additional_details": "Public sector pensions are extremely generous. As reported recently, a teacher on \u00a337,800 at date of retirement will receive a pension of \u00a325,200. A private sector worker would have to save \u00a3675,000 into a fund in order to get an equivalent pension.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it now appears that public sector workers are complaining at having to work to the same retirement age as private sector workers (67 years or more).\r\n\r\nWhy should this disparity exist?\r\n\r\nIts not as if public sector salaries are lower - they are not. Furthermore, private sector employees do not enjoy the level of job security that public sector workers have.\r\n\r\nWe would like the Government to increase public sector pension contributions further whilst reducing the level of pension that public sector workers receive in order to bring these into line with what an average private sector worker may reasonably be able to achieve.
