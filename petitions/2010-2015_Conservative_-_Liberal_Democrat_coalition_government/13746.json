This would allow a lower cost environment in areas which would be difficult to get to for \"family and friends\" of the inmates. Mobile phone masts could be switched off and the prisoners would understand what solitude and separation from society should really be like, rather than the holiday camps they call prisons now. Local people denied income by the closure of existing camps would be given a lifeline in jobs.  ",
