        "additional_details": "There is currently much public and governmental divided opinion regarding the public funding for Lady Thatchers funeral on Wednesday 17.04.2015. This is additionally further exacerbated by current austerity measures which are in place to cut public expenditure.\r\n\r\nTherefore we, the undersigned, submit the proposal that because opinion is divided on this issue the government should offer the tax payer the choice of whether they are happy to assist in funding this funeral from their own pocket and giving those who supported her policies and decisions the opportunity to contribute. Additionally those who don't wish to (due to political beliefs, etc) the opportunity to \"opt out\" and not fund the funeral. Any shortfall in expenditure can subsequently be made up by private & personal donations by those who wish to make them (ie supporters of Lady Thatcher and her perceived contribution to the UK during her term of office).",
