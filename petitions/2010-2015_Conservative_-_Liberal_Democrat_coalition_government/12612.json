        "additional_details": "It should not be a right to get to top of housing list unless it is assessed that living with the mum's parent(s) is not viable due to welfare/safety of the child. Parents should be made responsible for educating teenagers getting pregnant and the Government should remove incentive to have a child to get house & benefits. The family should be responsible not the taxpayer but the child should be safe and if not then taken into care rather than just give them a house where they have no form of monitoring. This will avoid Tax Payers paying for inexperienced teenagers raising a child without any help & possibility of children being raised in an environment that could involve harmful/illegal substances & irresponsible behaviour from the mother who is still a child herself.  The Family of the child having a child should be made to take on more responsibility and end the culture of having a kid for benefits.",
