        "additional_details": "As an English citizen of the United Kingdom, I propose that we call on Parliament to:\r\n\r\n1. Unconditionally fulfil the pledge made to the Scottish people during the recent Independence Referendum.\r\n\r\n2. Devolve more powers to the Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies, in the light of the recent Scottish Referendum.\r\n\r\n3. Initiate an England-wide discussion (through a Constitutional convention) of how we (England) want to have devolved power.\r\n\r\nOur Westminster politicians seem to have become embroiled in discussions about how powers should be devolved to England, and linking this to the pledge made to the people of Scotland. However, a pledge is a pledge, and the fulfilling of which should not be affected by party politics.\r\n\r\nIssues to be resolved regarding the 'West Lothian question' can wait a year of so to be resolved properly, rather than rushing into a poorly thought-out solution. England deserves a proper solution to this, and determining this solution will take time.\r\n",
