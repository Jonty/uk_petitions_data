        "additional_details": "On 10 December 2013 at Bulford Military Court 15 soldiers from 1st Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment were jailed for disobeying an order to stand up. Another soldier awaits sentencing.\r\n\r\nSoldiers are often ordered to carry out tasks that are irrational (e.g. painting Land Rovers whilst it is snowing heavily). Soldiers are also ordered to carry out tasks that are immoral (e.g. detaining civilians and handing them over to be tortured). There are also times when the Officers and Senior ranks highlight the fact that it is one rule for them and another for the Junior Ranks (e.g. Officers getting drunk in their mess when the Junior ranks are confined to two cans of beer per day). Any resistance to this system take courage and should be supported.\r\n\r\nRelease these men from detention.\r\n\r\nVeterans For Peace UK",
