Teach children both Metric measurements and Imperial Measurements, require products show both Imperial and Metric Measurements e.g Fluid ounces and Millilitres, Grammes and Ounces.\r\n\r\nThe youngest of children still measure weight in stones and pounds, and height in feet and inches decades after metrication.\r\n\r\nIt would be simple to require both measurements are shown and would please foreign people, Britons, Americans, Canadians and Irishman. It would comply with EU rules as long as Imperial Measurements are not bigger than Metric Measurements in packaging.\r\n\r\nTeaching children Imperial Units would help teach them helpful real life problems as well as legal and scientific measurements that you would use for example as a doctor. It is pointless to only teach children metres and kilometres, when virtually all signage is in inches, feet, yards and miles and is used consistently in conversation.",
