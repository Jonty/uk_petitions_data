They don\u2019t give people proper breaks, work them long hours, don\u2019t pay them the commission that's due to them. Then they fire them just before their probation period is finished so that they have no real legal right to complain.\r\n\r\nSome employers are not even producing proper contracts or payslips.\r\n\r\nWhen is the Government going to clamp down on these rogue Employers.\r\n",
