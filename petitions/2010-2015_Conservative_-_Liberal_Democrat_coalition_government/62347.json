Not huffing and puffing wind bags;  people who clearly do not have the common respect to sit quietly, listen to the debate and wait their turn to speak.\r\nIf, in The House, they were not allowed to shout and geer, debates would become more efficient. Members would be taking small steps into becoming better role models, and perhaps things might get done a little quicker. ",
