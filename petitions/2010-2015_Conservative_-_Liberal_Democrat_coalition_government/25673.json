        "additional_details": "The metal recycling industry has been getting a free pass on air pollution. The practice of burning (oxyfuel cutting) scrap metal in the open air is being allowed near residential homes, putting residents Health at risk and damaging the Environment. Metals are occasionally alloyed with beryllium, a highly toxic metal. Coatings can include arsenic. Legislation is needed to protect public health from air pollution of metal recyclers and  should include: \u2022 controlling all emissions from a scrap yard and foundry, \u2022 enclosing all scrapping activities indoors, \u2022 maintaining a negative pressure in the indoor facility to avoid pollution escaping, \u2022 using two tiered ingress/egress, akin to an airlock, \u2022 ensuring rules cover VOC\u2019s and other gases, particulate emissions (metals, etc), and other chemicals, \u2022 providing a Compliance Schedule, \u2022 building in Air Monitoring, specifically at the fence-lines of facilities, and \u2022 keeping detailed records that are open to public inspection.",
