        "additional_details": "Petition to open full Accident and Emergency dept,\r\nfor the residents of Runcorn and surrounding areas.\r\nDespite Runcorn having the most densely populated area in Cheshire it does not have a full A&E within the Halton General Hospital. Currently it only provides care for minor injuries and is a totally underused facility.\r\nThis puts both life at risk and patients and their families under stress. Local people have to travel to Warrington for emergency care, traffic congestion can add to vital life saving time when seeking help with serious accidents and health issues.\r\nThis situation also puts all medical staff and services involved under dreadful pressure. The people of Runcorn deserve BETTER !\r\nPlease sign this petition and together we can get this\r\nGovernment to rectify this appalling situation that this and previous Governments who have for too long ignored the wishes of the electorate!.\r\nThank you for your support,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
