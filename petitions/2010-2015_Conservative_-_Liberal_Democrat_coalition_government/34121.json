(Rape cases excluded)\r\n\r\nIf a child is loved and wanted by both parents intead of financial reward it will be brought up with love & guidance.\r\n\r\nI was brought up to believe it is a parents responsibility to feed, clothe & provide shelter for a child and that the welfare state would provide provide education between ages 5 - 16, free health service including free dental & eye treatment for all & to provide care only for those unable to provide for themselves through illness & age.\r\nNo other animal in the World gets help to bring up its young yet seems to do a better job.  What does that say about the human race",
