        "additional_details": "International calls are a nuisance and cannot be stopped. They bug you every day and not just once. As many times as 6 or7 we can get. If you get an answer from them they put the phone down on you when asked which company they work for but mostly their computer rings you to see what time of day you are in so a person can ring you back then. TPS doesn't work, the BT handsets only block out the ringing but why should we have to go to these lengths? We don't want them and haven't asked for them - Ban them. ",
