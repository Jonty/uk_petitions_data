        "additional_details": "Whilst in no way seeking to express support for the Assad regime we call upon the UK government to acknowledge and condemn the increasingly systematic, violent and widespread persecution, by hardline elements of the Syrian opposition, of Christians and other minorities in Syria. Christians make up around 10% of the Syrian population, having been there since biblical times, but many are being driven from their homes and country by a targeted terror campaign which appears to be Islamist-led. Similar accusations have recetly been made about rebel treatment of Kurds in Syria.\r\n\r\nBy uncritically supporting the rebels and remaining silent on these issues, the UK government risks legitimising and accelerating such vicimisation. We call upon the government to halt non-humanitarian aid to, and expressions of support for, the rebels until such atrocities cease. ",
