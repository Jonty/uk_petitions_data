        "additional_details": "On Saturday 3rd January at south ewsters cottage, distressing scenes were witnessed of 2 dead ponies, one of which was been eaten by 3 Alsatian puppies. This case can been seen as a neglect case, seen as the police involved could not see any 'animal cruelty' charges due to Frank Scott declared that he was unaware any were dead and they 'must of died of natural causes'.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately due to Mr Scott agreeing to the 3 surviving horses from his care no charges are being made toward mr Scott meaning he is free to commit these crimes again, which is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nPlease sign our petition to get Mr Frank Scott's rights as a human being to be removed of owning or caring for any other animals in the future. And to have any animals currently in his care removed for his safety and the paramount safety of the animals and the surrounding community.",
