        "additional_details": "This epetition is intended to reveal the truth about how Tony Blair in the face of overwhelming pubic oppostion dragged this country into a shameful war that has cost lives of countless innocent people.In 2009 the the labour government under pressure from the public over Mr Blairs actions established the Chilcot inquiry. Three years since the last witness gave evidence to the inquiry with a  cost of \u00a37.4 million the inquiry report remains unpublished. A majority of the British public believe that Mr Blair along with Alistair Campbell exaggerated the evidence that Saddam posed a deadly threat to Britain while suppressing advice that the decision to go war may be illegal. These action we believe were on the Cabinet,Parliament into backing an invasion, Mr Blair had already agreed with George Bush. Mr Cameron we demand that through your office and with back of Parliament will finally allow the truth about the Iraq war to be known and the principle players brought before the courts",
