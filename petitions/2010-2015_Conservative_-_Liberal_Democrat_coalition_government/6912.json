It includes the site of the current ground and the industrial land to the North to create a larger area in which the new stadium can be built without the need to ground-share or move out of Haringey even for a temporary period.\r\n\r\nThe club and local government need palimentary support to ensure this vital project becomes a reality and securs not only the future of THFC but also the surrounding wards and boroughs.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
