        "additional_details": "So the EU proposes new laws which basically requires all ports and terminals to compete with other companies, like agency companies, can compete for the work which comes into our ports and terminals. The new laws will undermine every collective bargaining agreement as other employers could take our work. The competition for work would come down to the lowest price, meaning the company which offerred the lowest wage, terms and conditions wins, and we would lose.",
