        "additional_details": "Mental health is not uncommon. Six million people in the uk are suffering from depression, anxiety and emotional stress according to the Department of Health. A further 8 million people are afflicted with a variety of mental illnesses. Yet there is no specialist help readily available to date. Mental health facilities can sometimes feel clinical and don't always provide the right support and understanding.\r\nMy mission, is to start a foundation in the uk. Work shop programmes are needed to provide access to free support without going to your GP. The foundation would offer advice to those who need it, from volunteers to professional people with a background in mental health studies. It could also provide group activites, such as fun days out.",
