        "additional_details": "Instead of the current benefit system where people receive money, which they are able to spend on products such as cigarettes, alcohol and drugs; we would propose a new benefit card system. People would receive a benefit card that they could only spend on necessities, such as utilities, local travel, food and clothing, they wouldn't be able to purchase luxury items. These would be non-transferable with an I-D photo on card. Based on the current benefit levels people would receive 70% of the total benefit on their card and in order to receive the remaining 30% as cash, applicants would be required to do community service.",
