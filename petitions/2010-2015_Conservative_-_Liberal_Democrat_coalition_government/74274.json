        "action": "Improvements to the process of reapplication for a driving licence following a medical condition",
        "additional_details": "There are thousands of drivers with medical conditions who have to refrain from driving for a period of time.  Many of these drivers, even when they recover and are medically fit and able to drive, are prohibited from doing so due to the bureaucracy, administrative errors and insufficient resources at the DVLA.\r\n\r\nIt is commonplace for people to have to wait in excess of six months past the original term of not driving before the DVLA returns their licence to them.\r\n\r\nI believe this causes unnecessary anxiety and hardship to those who rely on their own transport and that people who have already had to face up to life-changing illnesses, deserve a better service.\r\n\r\nI would therefore like to petition the government to review current practices and resources within the DVLA in order that it can provide a service which meets the needs of drivers reapplying for their licences in a timely and acceptable manner.",
