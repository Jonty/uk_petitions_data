        "additional_details": "I would like the 20mph speed limit to be removed in Brighton and Hove and the original speed limits to be returned. I am fully in support of 20mph limits around schools and hospitals at appropriate times but the Green Party in Brighton seems to be intent on punishing the motorist and driving people out of Brighton. Furthermore, they are wasting millions of tax payers money on unnecessary transport schemes that the local residents have not asked for. The money would be much better spent in our schools and hospitals and supporting local businesses.",
