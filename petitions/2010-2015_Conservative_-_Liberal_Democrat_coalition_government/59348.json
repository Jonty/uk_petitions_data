        "additional_details": "As speaking to the local authority didn't seem to work I am petitioning for more dog bins in the Abronhill Area of Cumbernauld. There are a number of area's where there are not enough bins in area's regularly walked by dog owners, if bins were in place it would significantly decrease the amount of dog feces that is not being picked up.\r\n\r\nSpecific areas where there is not enough bins\r\nIn Almond Road there are 4 different areas lacking bins\r\nIn Elm Drive there is 2 areas lacking bins\r\nIn Oak Road there is around 5 areas lacking bins\r\nThe list is endless\r\n\r\nThe dog warden comes out only when a complaint is made and rarely at the times when owners are out.\r\n\r\nSo it's time we as residents of Abronhill start making our voices heard.\r\n\r\nI am a responsible dog owner Who would like others to be considered and to help get these bins put in to make our community a nicer place to stay.\r\n\r\n",
