There has to be SOMETHING which caused or contributed to the failure of so many hundreds of people with responsibility for his welfare.  Could it be that our health professionals were so utterly afraid of the treatment they would receive from our government, if they got it wrong about preferred foreigners,  that they simply were NOT prepared to put their heads above the parapet and poor Daniel came out as just collateral damage in them protecting themselves.  Again, there has to be SOMETHING which caused similar inaction by so many people - and we need to know what it was.",
