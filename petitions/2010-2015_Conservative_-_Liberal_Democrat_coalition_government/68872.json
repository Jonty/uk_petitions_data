Otherwise the referendum in Scotland should be re-run with this condition in mind.\r\n\r\nOur reasoning:\r\n1) Why should those of us outside Scotland bear the cost of something we had no say in?\r\n2) Scotland entered the Union to have it's massive debts paid. The least it can do is bear the cost of departing. ",
