        "action": "Equal Pensions for re-joined Armed Forces Personnel",
        "additional_details": "Some members of the Armed Forces are seeing their pensions nearly halved because they have had a break in service (re-joins). Many of these service personnel may not be aware that as a rejoin, their pension from a previous service is not worth as much as they think. There are members who do a full 22 year term and will receive nothing until the state pension age, unlike those who have served equal years with no break in service. They will receive no lump sum, and no immediate monthly pension.  For example:  a soldier who re-joins and completes 22 years as a sergeant could lose 210k over a period of 25 years until he/she reaches the state pension age . We want the government to review this and give us an understandable explanation (in civilian language)  why such blatant, and open discrimination can happen.  These men and women have served their country and endured the stresses of war, separation from their families, benefit cuts and yet remain faithfull and determined. ",
