        "additional_details": "Stalybridge Market Hall has been a focal point for many generations who have lived, worked and shopped in Stalybridge over many years. This Petition is being created in order to provide evidence that the people of Stalybridge do not wish Stalybridge Market Hall to be removed from potential use for the community. The Community Rooms at the rear of the hall are utilised by many local and community interest groups although, due to prohibitive costing, the main hall is currently underused with a single regular Market organised by MWL Events. We would like the Market Hall to be returned to its original condition so that fayres, festivals, exhibitions and markets can be held in the beautiful surroundings.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition so that local and national government can see that the people of Stalybridge do not wish one of the towns greatest assets to be taken away from community use.",
