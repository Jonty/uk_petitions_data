I've now been told that in August they are swapping  my large black bin for a slimmer substitute, which is no good we recycle all we can to the point I regularly run out of space in my blue recycle bin, but still generate a fair amount of waste like nappies! I cannot let them take my large black bin as it will leave me with rubbish in my kitchen and bags uncollected in the street! Please sign so that local councils see reason thanks.",
