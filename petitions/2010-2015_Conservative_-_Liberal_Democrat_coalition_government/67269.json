This would be a lovely thing to have in the area, hundreds/thousands of locals spent many days searching and were left devastated when his body was discovered! This would be a lasting memorial and a place for people to go to keep his memory alive! It doesnt require a huge amount of space, please help us to make the council give us a little space to put it in the local area! ",
