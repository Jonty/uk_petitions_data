Pensioners are already the single most taxed group of individuals in the country and are being deprived of the human right of equality of treatment by the very people who introduced the human rights laws into this country, our dishonourable electeds (who are also members of 'the rich').  The law must be changed to allow pensioners to be paid through a personal services company so that they can take advantage of the lower tax rates enjoyed by 'the rich'.",
