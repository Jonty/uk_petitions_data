        "additional_details": "We believe that greater education as to what constitutes abuse is a vital subject for schools (particularly secondary schools) to tackle.  This should be a core subject, taught in every school across the UK.  Surveys have shown that worryingly high numbers of young people in the UK have experienced abuse. We have a duty of care to teach young people how to spot the signs of abuse - physical, emotional, sexual, psychological or financial - and where they can go to get help.  Abuse is NEVER okay and young people need to be aware of the signs to watch out for.",
