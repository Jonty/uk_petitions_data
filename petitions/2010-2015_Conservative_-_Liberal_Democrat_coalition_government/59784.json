        "additional_details": "I think St Georges Day should be celebrated (it was banned one year). It is part of English culture and I bet Ireland were allowed to celebrate St Patricks.\r\nI think the day and it's parade was banned to stop offending muslims. Why should we worry about them? This is not a muslim country! If they want to live here they should respect it as our culture. But I heard that there was a protest against the parade.\r\nWe do not go to other countries and ban their special days.\r\nSo celebrate St Georges and ignore the muslims. If they do not like it, it is their problem, not ours.  ",
