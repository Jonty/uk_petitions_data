        "action": "Insurance for young drivers under 25",
        "additional_details": "Recently in December of last year, it was made illegal to use gender as a basis for discriminating in the pricing of car insurance. As new driver, I can not afford to gain experience on the road shortly after passing my practical driving test. Like many others, being a student is not financially cheap. I would like to propose that the Department for transport imposes new legislation, or amend such relevant legislation, so that just like the new laws imposed in December, it shall be illegal to charge over-rated insurance for young drivers. Alternately, imposing a minimum insurance rate for insurance companies to abide by could potentially be beneficial to those young drivers whom simply can not afford to be on the road.",
