Hospitals are no different, yet there is often just one doctor \"on call\" scheduled to look after 40 patients at weekends.  It has now been well documented many times that a patient is statistically more likely to die if admitted over a weekend than any other time (e.g. Dr Foster report).\r\n\r\nI call for enforced 24 hour full staffing of all hospitals in England, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
