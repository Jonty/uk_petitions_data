        "additional_details": "In 2010, Unison reported that more than one third of workers had been bullied in the previous 6 months, double the number a decade ago.\r\n\r\nComplaints of bullying are now more prevalent in claims for unfair dismissal and discrimination. However, the current law does not provide adequate protection for the targets of bullying.\r\n\r\nThis petition urges the Government to introduce individual criminal offences and corporate criminal liability for bullying in the workplace, similar to the provisions of the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007. Penalties should include imprisonment, unlimited fines and compensation orders.\r\n\r\nBullying and harassment in the workplace was recently criminalised in Australia following the suicide of 19 year old Brodie Panlock, a waitress who was bullied at work.\r\n\r\nTragic events should not be necessary to catalyse legislative change. This petition urges the Government to criminalise workplace bullying and harassment.   ",
