We live in this country and we are forever having forced upon our eyes charities asking for money to support 3rd world countries and such, I would like to ask the Government to impose restrictions on adverts and campaigns to help these unfortunate 3rd world countries, I am all for helping people that are less fortunate then ourselves but it is about time that we realised that charity starts at home and that is our great country, Great Britian!!!!",
