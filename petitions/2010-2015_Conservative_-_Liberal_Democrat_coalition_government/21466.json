        "additional_details": "Roads with an even number of lanes just confuse the majirity of british motorists. How can they drive in the middle lane if there isn't one? This leads to the situation where (particularly on 4 lane motorways) they drive in the 2nd overtaking lane (lane 3) even though the road is empty. Traffic coming up from behind becomes infuriated by this crass stupidity and then performs stupid & dangerous manouvers to encourage them to use the driving lane (lane 1). It also negates the intended congestion relief of having the extra lane.",
