        "additional_details": "The current guidance is that smear tests should be only performed by a GP from the age of 25 and at three yearly intervals.\r\n\r\nCervical cancer takes only 5 years to develop and can have a fatal impact if not detected early, in a best case scenario it will jeopardise a woman's fertility. 3 yearly tests are sufficient to detect potential cancer cells before it is too late especially at smear are not a fully effective and deterministic test.\r\n\r\nCervical cancer is now becoming more common in younger women and the government\u2019s policy of increasing the age limit to 25 is irresponsible.\r\n\r\nSmear tests can in indicators of the potential for Cervical Cancer and although they can be stressful and invasive, the benefits far outweigh this and the cost.\r\n",
