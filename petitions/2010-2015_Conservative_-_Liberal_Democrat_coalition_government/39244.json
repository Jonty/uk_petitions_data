        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister of Pakistan has offered a reward for the death of the man who created the film about the Prophet Mohammed. This behaviour is wholly unacceptable and repellent to the international community. To send any further Foreign Aid to Pakistan can be seen to be acknowledging this behaviour and hatred to the West. We therefore request that all Foreign Aid to Pakistan is immediately ceased and sanctions imposed on the country.",
