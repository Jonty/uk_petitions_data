        "additional_details": "This petition is a show of support for the parents of 5 year old Ashya King.\r\nWe are appalled at how the U.K Government have been treating his parents.\r\nThey are within their rights to seek medical treatment outside of the NHS and should not be punished for it.\r\nIt is understandable that a search should have been conducted for Ashya when he left hospital to ensure his well being. He has been found safe and in the loving care of his parents who are only seeking the very best treatment and should now be left alone.\r\nThis petition is to show your support of the parents and to ask the UK Government to stop the extradition order from Spain, to allow them to seek the best treatment, to make a full apology for the stress and concern caused to the family and to ensure that no charges of any kind are brought against any member of the family.",
