Whilst driving, as it is at least a big a distraction as using a mobile phone as this is already banned. Plus the smoke inside the car is a pollutant for the passengers and the film accumulates inside the windscreen and increases glare.\r\n\r\n3. Near an exit/entrance to a buildig (eg. if a venue is non smoking, I should not have to fight past a cloud of smoke to get in or out)\r\n\r\n4. At bus shelters. This would make the law consistent with railway platforms.\r\n\r\nand Increasing the fine for dropping a cigarette stub on a pavement.\r\n",
