        "additional_details": "A significant number of commentators have made inflammatory statements blaming the elderly for the financial plight of the young.\r\nThis is not only untrue but the accusations are rapidly creating a culture where the elderly are seen as a burden on society. If such statements, often by public figures, continue unchecked, they are bound to result in discrimination, hostility and assaults against the elderly. In the longer term, public support for compulsory euthanasia is inevitable.\r\nThe vast majority of the elderly have earned their meagre pensions and deserve a peaceful retirement. The state has an obligation to ensure they get it.\r\nThis petition requests the government to legislate to make incitement to hatred against the elderly a criminal offence equivalent to incitement to racial hatred.",
