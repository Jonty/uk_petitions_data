        "additional_details": "For the people of Wales we face long waits for specialised treatment. The health board funding system makes it difficult to access the specialised services we need. I have a rare brain condition that needs treatment and can be done in the neurosurgical unit at cardiff (by general surgeons) with a 6 month wait to see urgent cases. i could actually go to England and see a specialist in my condition within 2 weeks, however the local health board make this difficult and they choose who is acceptable for this treatment. i am fed up of wales having a second class health service and reducing our choices so we have no choice. We are supposed to be an united kingdom what a joke!",
