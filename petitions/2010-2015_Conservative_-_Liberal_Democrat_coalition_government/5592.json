        "additional_details": "Replacing millions of FM radios with DAB may bring \u00a3billions to the treasury in VAT but will cost HUNDREDS of pounds for EVERY household.\r\n\r\nThe government lists advantages of DAB such as \u2018pause\u2019, \u2018rewind\u2019 and low costs \u00a335 sets but fails to mention the \u00a335 DAB radios do not have premium functions such as \u2018pause\u2019 and \u2018rewind\u2019.  Those radios cost hundreds of pounds and beyond the reach of most listeners.\r\n\r\nThe BBC estimates households have an average of 6 radios. Given that some are Hi-Fi quality radios, it will cost households many hundreds of pounds to upgrade.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of DAB are small to the listener. The disadvantage of switching off FM transmissions are enormous. Hundreds of millions of radios will become useless and thrown into landfill.\r\n\r\nThe difference between FM and DAB is too small to warrant the replacement of EVERY radio set in the country. Better to wait for a new technology that provides a real improvement on what FM provides.\r\n.\r\n",
