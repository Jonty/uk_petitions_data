This petition of the British people declares that a significant reason why many are so Euro-sceptic is due to a lack of education about the European Union and its institutions, and how it pools sovereignty, rather than simply taking it away. An example of our ignorance are the British friends of a German diplomat who refused to vote in the last European Parliament elections because they \"didnt want to give more power to the Belgians.\"\r\nThe petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons make the European Union a compulsory aspect of the British education system, so as to fix the European participation crisis, and make sure that the British people are well represented in the European Union, and informed about the true beneficial nature of our membership. And the petitioners remain, etc.",
