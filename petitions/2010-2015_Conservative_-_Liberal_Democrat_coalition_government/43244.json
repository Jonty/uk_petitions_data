        "additional_details": "Establish at least in principle that benefits should be withheld for those people convicted of benefit fraud. Too often the courts simply order these cheats to pay the money back plus costs. If the cheats are exceptionally naughty they may have to do some community service. What kind of punishment is that? The cheats simply plead poverty and pay back at \u00a31 a week. Custodial sentence should not be considered, it costs the taxpayer too much. These people are not rapists, thieves or thugs they are simply low-life cheats. Hit them where it hurts and that is stop their benefits. Not all benefits as some e-petitions  have advocated, just those components which they have dishonestly claimed, and then not for all-time for a first offence, but certainly that should be an option considered for repeat offenders.",
