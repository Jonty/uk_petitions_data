        "additional_details": "Currently, those convicted of drink or drug drive offences get a minimum disqualification for 12 months. Which a magistrate can extend at their discretion. However, I believe that there should be a further punishment of having their vehicles forfeited in which they were discovered committing the offence. This would not only be a further punishment, but would serve as a deterrent that they would lose a vehicle of unlimited value with no compensation.",
