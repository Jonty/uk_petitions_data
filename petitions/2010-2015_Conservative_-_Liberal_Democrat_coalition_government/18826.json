        "additional_details": "In 2004 the NHS introduced Agenda for change to harmonise the full NHS pay system, as a result our working week was cut from 40 hours to 37.5. We were subsequently allocated new split shifts which included an UNPAID period of time during our shift to eat, rest etc. Now we have it imposed on us for 3 months from 10th Oct 06:00hrs that we WILL be available throughout this period for what equates to \u00a31.92 per hour! (\u00a3250 for our 130 hours 'rest breaks' per annum). This was currently agreed by our unions, despite over 80% staff rejection, for a 3 month period during further consultation.\r\n\r\nIf this gets implemented then for a 12 hour shift we will get paid \u00a31.44 for our 45 minute \"break\". We will be working 130 hours a year for a tiny fraction of the current minimum wage!\r\n\r\nPay us properly for the hours we work! You want us for 40 hours so pay us for 40 hours!",
