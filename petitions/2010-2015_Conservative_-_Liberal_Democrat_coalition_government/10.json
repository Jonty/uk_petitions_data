        "additional_details": "We, the people of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, call upon Prime Minister David Cameron to resign with immediate effect and to call a general election. This is required due to his lack of mandate, the Conservative Party having gained only 36% of the vote in the 2010 general election. It is doubtful that anyone who voted Liberal Democrat would endorse the neoliberal policies currently being pursued by the coalition government. Therefore a general election is required in order to validate or repudiate current governmental policies. ",
