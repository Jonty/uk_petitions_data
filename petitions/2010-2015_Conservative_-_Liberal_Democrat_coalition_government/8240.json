        "additional_details": "The sale of fireworks to the public should be banned. Fireworks are not used as they should be used, on fireworks night. They now seem to be used all year round. Recently, fireworks, that are now more powerful than ever, have been used to destroy property and have been used as weapons. If people wish to see fireworks, they can attend organised displays, instead of taking chances with lives and using these explosive devices around their homes. Sign this petition to ban the sale of these ridiculous legal bombs. ",
