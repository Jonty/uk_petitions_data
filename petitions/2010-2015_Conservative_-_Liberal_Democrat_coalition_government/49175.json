        "additional_details": "revert the BSI standard for instrument tuning from 440hz back to 432hz\r\nThe reason for this is because for thousands of years 432hz was the standard for tuning most instruments, it is more harmonic, easier to sing and is the true freq of the crown chakra in buddism, also if 432hz was A then 512hz would be C, 512hz is also the heart chakra.\r\nChanging this over time will reap many health benefits for society and will also change many peoples attitudes and remove aggression in society.\r\nHaving all recorded music set to 440hz is actually damaging peoples DNA by resonantly switching genes off, 432 hz would switch them back on and keep people healthy.\r\nI understand this is a strange request but take note that the original Stradivarius was made to resonate at 432hz",
