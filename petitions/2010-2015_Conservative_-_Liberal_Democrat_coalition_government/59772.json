        "additional_details": "School Governors are the largest volunteer group in the UK over 300,000 people give up their spare time to, essentially, run our schools at local level.\r\n\r\nMany aspects require attendance during school hours, legislation allows for time off work but is quiet on the subject of pay.\r\nAs there is a significant shortage of governors with as many as 1 in 4 posts unfilled and calls for higher standards of governance from Ofsted and the DoE support for school governors has never been more needed.\r\nWe ask the Government to legislate to ensure employers support this aim by paying for  appropriate time off work for school governors  with special consideration given to the higher time commitments for chairs and vice chairs.",
