        "additional_details": "The government has greatly reduced Legal Aid for Family Law. This is now only available in exceptional circumstances. This is wrong for people who have kids and split from there partners, and an aggrement cannot be made over custody. We need 100,000 signatures to debate this in the house of common, and I myself, will not give up until we reach it. I'm now stuck in a position where I have to represent myself in court to gain joint custody over my son, as I don't have thousands of pounds. Please help me by taking a minute to sign this petition.
