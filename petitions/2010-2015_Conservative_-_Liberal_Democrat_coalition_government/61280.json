Do you work hard all month ,50 hour weeks to find when you get the your pay it's swallowed up by rent  . Insurance  tax and transport that you use to get to work and many many more . Before you have even put food on the table . There is no support or incentives to the working class in this country and that is why so many people are living on benefits . This needs to change . Even a little help would be appreciated to the people that turn the cogs of this country . .we want to see change , and put the great back into this country because I for one feel let down by a government of a country I love and put every part of my life into .although I understand that these expenses have to be paid to some extent they are just way to high if they were a reasonable amount it would be fair . If you feel the same please sign this . ",
