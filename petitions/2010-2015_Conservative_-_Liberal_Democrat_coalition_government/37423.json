Personally  than go to that watered down\r\nI want to remember Oldham Carnival for what it used to be, when thousands of people lined the streets for the amazing parade, Union street looked more ghost town  on and there was a million and one things for families to see and do at Alexandra Park.\r\nNow it's just a farty little parade which isn't even worthy of the name 'parade', followed by a couple of bouncy castles and a hot dog stand.\r\nWell when they bring back the full parade which was well over a mile long, proper fun fair,  and then  I'll return. Until then,they can\r\nwe the people of oldham want it back  the way oldham  carnival use to be  ",
