        "additional_details": "Recent budget legislation requires Churches to formally employ casual workers such as organists, vergers and cleaners where they have in the past been regarded as self employed, paid gross accordingly (usually very small amounts) and paid tax through self assessment procedures. Now Churches have to maintain PAYE records for each of these and they rarely have the experienced financial volunteers to do so, or sometimes the computer knowledge as many volunteers are elderly.\r\n\r\nIt is ludicrous that they therefore have to employ accountants, at a cost greater than the initial remuneration, to do so to stay within the law in an unneccessary piece of red tape which threatens to harm Church music and other services. It also puts burdens on already stretched volunteer financial resouces in the Church.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that the Government re-instate the concept of regarding organists and other assistants as self employed and pay them gross.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
