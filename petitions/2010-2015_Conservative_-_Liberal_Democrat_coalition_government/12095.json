The United States has less than 350 senators  doing the same job as our MP's yet the USA is a large part of a continent.\r\n\r\nWe do not need such a financial burden on the taxpayer, there are many small constituencies that can be centralised to create larger constituencies with less MP's.\r\n\r\nAlso MP's should be made 100% accountable, if there is any sign of misuse of expenses then they should be held to account on fraudulent terms being made to pay either with custodial sentences, large fines or confiscation of property and loosing their status as an MP.",
