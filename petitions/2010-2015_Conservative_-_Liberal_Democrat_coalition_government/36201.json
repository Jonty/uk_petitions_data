        "additional_details": "Mr Matt Sterling is attempting to close the Colchester leisure world gymnastics classes for children aged from pre school years up to 16 year olds. He seems to think it is not financially viable. These children will suffer, have to go on a waiting list for other gymnasiums which are already very long (700 children on the list for one already) and the classes help children gain confidence, self esteem and recognise own talents. The instructor will lose her job also. It is the Olympic year! The government want us to encourage health and fitness for our children but how can we when someone like Mr Sterling thinks its ok to shut down children's classes. I want the government to realise the importance of these classes and stop this from happening.\r\nPlease sign to help keep a much needed class open and running.",
