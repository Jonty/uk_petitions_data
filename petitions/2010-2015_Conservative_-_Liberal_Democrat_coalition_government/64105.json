        "additional_details": "Due to the current deficit in many NHS hospitals, I call on the government to bring some common sense back on prioritising treatment and eliminating i.e. stopping ALL \"vanity\" operations. A quick search has shown examples of these to include breast adjustments, ear, nose and even foot reshaping, tattoo removal plus many more.\r\n\r\nI do not understand how these VANITY operations can be offered, when citizens have to raise money via charitable funding for operations; a case as example is an operation on Sophie Thomlinson's spinal cord, where health chiefs decided that the \u00a325,000 surgery was too expensive.\r\n\r\nVanity Operations are not necessary and the NHS was not created to accommodate these.\r\n\r\n",
