        "additional_details": "Private Finance Initiative funding of new hospitals, schools, transport projects and MOD accommodation has been detrimental to public finances to the advantage of private interests.\r\n\r\nAs an example: South London Healthcare NHS Trust had two hospitals built under PFI schemes around 10 years ago. The cost was \u00a3210m but with payments this year of \u00a369m and amounting to \u00a32,500m over 30 years, it is heavily in debt. This is being used as an excuse to close Lewisham Hospital's A&E.\r\n\r\nAt least six other NHS trusts are similarly facing bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nThis is clearly due to profiteering by banks and construction firms at the expense of the public purse.\r\n\r\nWe call on H M Parliament to pass legislation annulling all existing PFI contracts without\u00a0 compensation and transferring ownership of the buildings concerned to the commissioning organisations.\r\n\r\nSee www.PeopleBeforeProfit.org.uk for more information\r\n",
