        "additional_details": "Many European member states have already temporarily reduced the rate of VAT on labour intensive local services such as hotels and restaurants. Francis Clark LLP calls on the Government to allow UK businesses within the leisure and tourism sector an even playing field when competing against foreign holiday destinations and to reduce the rate of VAT within this sector to 5%. A stimulus to the tourism industry, particularly in the South West region, is urgently required given the current economic conditions.",
