        "additional_details": "This is a petition to the UK government to replace the current vehicle tax system with a new system that is fair to everyone.\r\nThe present vehicle tax system is currently unfair - a car that produces fewer emissions enjoys a disproportionate level of vehicle tax.\r\nAt present, those with high emission vehicles that are financially least able to replace them are subsidising those who are able to replace their vehicles. They are being taxed at several times the tax rate. This is unfair.\r\n\r\nA much fairer and straightforward system would be to have fee for each unit of emission (g/km). These could be banded as previously.\r\n\r\nFor example:-\r\n\r\nBand A  Up to 100g/km \u00a3100\r\nBand B 101 to 110g/km \u00a3110\r\nBand C 111 to 120g/km \u00a3120\r\nBand D 121 to 130g/km \u00a3130\r\n...and so on.\r\n\r\nAdoption of this system would mean that the tax is fair to everyone.",
