One box of pills to be taken in sequence, according to one set of instructions. You cannot take either drug in isolation or the treatment will not work as intended. And yet, because each blisterpack contains two different drugs, two prescription charges are levied! I want the government to change the rules on this. Where two drugs are prescribed as a single combined therapy there should be one charge only. ",
