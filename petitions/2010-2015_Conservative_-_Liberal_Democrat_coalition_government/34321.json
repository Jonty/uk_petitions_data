        "additional_details": "The licensed trade, especially the on trade, is always targeted & blamed for underage sales of alcohol yet the people under the age of 18 that commit a criminal act under the Licensing Act 2003 are never, or rarely, penalised. We believe that if the police took action and/or issued fixed penalty notices (FPNDs) to the under 18s who attempt to purchase alcohol, or consume alcohol on licensed premises, then there would be a reduction in the number of under 18s committing these types of offences. Many pubs and clubs invest heavily in preventing under age sales and the police and trading standards invest in testing premises, nothing however appears to happening to address the under 18\u2019s that commit the crime. S149 of the Licensing Act 2003 is clear that an individual under 18 commits an offence if they buy or attempt to buy alcohol. If youngsters received FPNDs we are sure the problem licensees face would reduce. If you agree please add your name to this petition.",
