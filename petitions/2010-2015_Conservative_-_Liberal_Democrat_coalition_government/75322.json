        "additional_details": "Ethiopia has adopted Christianity (The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Religion) as a state religion in the 4th Century and has since maintained its Canonical and Dogmatic sovereignty. The Church has more than 50 million believers and has presence all over the world.\r\nA recent ruling at the High Court of Justice , Chancery Division,London in the matter of EOTC of Saint Mary Debre Tsion London has directly intervened in the autonomy of the Church and dismissed the Canonical and Dogmatic sovereignty and the spiritual value of the Religion.  This has caused spiritual devastation and anger amongst the believers and members of the Church.\r\n\r\nWe Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church believers thus request the Ministry of Justice to respect the autonomy of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church faith and stop intervening in our religious matter in particular EOTC of Saint Mary Debre Tsion London, Registered Charity 1060394.\r\n",
