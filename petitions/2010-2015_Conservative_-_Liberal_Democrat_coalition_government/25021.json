They can not get jobs, we can not get jobs. Its putting more and more strain on the government that waste money on benefits for people without jobs (many of which shouldn't be here).\r\n\r\nImmigration should be reduced and only selected people should be able to get in (i.e. if they already have a been given a job in the UK). Countries like the USA already use this kind of system.",
