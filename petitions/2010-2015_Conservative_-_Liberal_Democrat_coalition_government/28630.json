        "additional_details": "Gazundering is where a homebuyer demands an unjustified reduction on the agreed purchase price at the 11th hour just before contracts are signed.\r\n\r\nIt is the most despicable and unethical form of negotiation. It holds innocent family's to ransom as the buyer is acutely aware they have already committed themselves financially.\r\n\r\nThe practice (currently prolific) is causing mistrust between sellers and buyers causing a further slow down to an already slow housing market. The ramifications of these unethical negotiations will undoubtedly contribute to a slow economic recovery.\r\n\r\nI would like the Government to make \"gazundering\" illegal in England and Wales in the same way it is in Scotland",
