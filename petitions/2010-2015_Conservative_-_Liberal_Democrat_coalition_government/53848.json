        "additional_details": "Specific elements of the Scrap Metal Dealers Act (SMDA), covering licensed ATFs, will have an adverse impact on the end-of-life vehicle recycling industry.\r\nThe industry is already highly regulated and subject to levels of bureaucracy that are not experienced in the scrap metal industry.\r\nThis petition registers our deep concern that the added bureaucracy will place a further economic burden on the industry, delivering outcomes that run counter to the intention of the Act, to provide traceability in the scrap metal value chain. Instead, it will likely drive criminals underground and make the industry tougher to monitor.\r\nThe ATF must obtain and verify photo ID and proof of address for the seller of the vehicle for all vehicles purchased which is impractical as the seller is often not present when the vehicle is recovered.\r\nSign this petition to show your support against the proposed legislation changes and promote your support where possible through the hashtag #ATFsagainstSMDA\r\n",
