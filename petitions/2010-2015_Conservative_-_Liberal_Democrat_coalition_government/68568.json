        "additional_details": "This petition requests the Home Office to consider introducing a Fast Track option for UK citizens who apply for a UK passport from abroad.\r\n\r\nWhen someone finds out short-term that they need a new passport; has had their passport stolen or lost; or has gotten married or changed their name, a quick service is of great importance.\r\n\r\nIt is not always possible for applicants to travel back to the UK for one to seven days to use Premium or Fast Track services; likewise, an Emergency Travel Document or extension may not be appropriate.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Fast Track should also be available abroad. The interview could take place at a British Embassy or Consulate, and a processing fee could be charged. If someone needs a passport urgently, they are often willing to travel to the Embassy in their country or pay a higher fee.\r\n\r\nThis would help individuals to whom the current six to eight week processing time poses large difficulties, due to short-term notice of needing a new passport.",
