The project ignored the recommendations of the WCD (World Commission on Dams) and India is going ahead with the project; totally disrespecting the calls of the people of Barak valley (people from both upstream and downstream) and ignoring both joint detailed and independent Environment Impact Assessment (EIA), which is required under the Environment Protection Act 1986.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the dam:\r\n\r\n* One third of Bangladesh and the lives of about fourty million Bangladeshis will be affected;\r\n\r\n* In the event of a medium size earthquake in the region, the dam will vanish in minutes and ten million lives will be in danger.\r\n\r\nWe are requesting your help alongside other campaigners, local MP\u2019s and the Prime Minister to help stop the Tipai-Muk Dam.",
