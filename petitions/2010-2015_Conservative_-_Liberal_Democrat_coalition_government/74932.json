        "additional_details": "In a nutshell, the film Fifty Shades of Grey should be banned as it glorifies rape. Even people who use BDSM and ex-dominatrix's who have spoken to journalists have explained how this doesn't represent what it's all about and that it is essentially rape being aired in cinemas!\r\nIf rape is illegal why should watching rape not be banned? Government should ban it and also prevent more advertisements on buses and TV which can be and have been viewed by children.",
