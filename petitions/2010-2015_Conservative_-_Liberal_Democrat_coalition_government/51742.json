It doesn't hit you in the face like a cigarette warning does.\r\n\r\nWe need to make the warnings explicit. Consumers are not as effectively protected as they should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe wish for the Government to take action so, that by requirement of law,  hair dye products must print these warnings explicitly on the front of the product box.",
