        "additional_details": "With the wide range of options available from other companies, paying BBC a fee is unjustified. \u2018The corporation should be planning for a future without the licence fee and investigating subscription-based payment options.\r\n\r\nThe licence fee as one of the most regressive taxes in the UK today,\r\n\r\nThe BBC is an important British institution that should be contributing substantially to the national economy, not just exploiting the exclusive benefits of the public.\r\n\r\nWe argue that shifting to a voluntary subscription model is the best way to make this happen. It would allow the public the chance to make its own choices.\r\nThe concept of TV licensing is outdated and firmly belongs in a pre-digital era when the BBC held a dominant market share.\r\n\r\nWe ask the Government to replace the TV Licence Fee with a voluntary subscription. It is high time that the \u00a3145.50 fee was scrapped altogether and the BBC made to pay their own way.",
