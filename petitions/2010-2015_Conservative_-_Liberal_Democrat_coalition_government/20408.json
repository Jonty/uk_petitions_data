Many car garages lie and try to steal money off motorists by making up false issues with a car. The Government should not put its name to an M.O.T certificate and endorse company's that try to steal money from motorists. I would recommend either the scrapping of M.O.T's and the police to monitor and spot dangerous vehicles, Or have M.O.T's done by a Government body and not private company's. ",
