        "additional_details": "Overseas Qualified nurses need to score Individual score of 7/9 in Academic IELTS to gain  registration with the  Nursing Midwifery Council UK. many non-English speaking countries nurses get registration without this pre-requisite as they are in European Union. However,  most of  the university courses  demand language competencies with IELTS scores below 7.  In the UK,  overseas qualified nurses majority of whom have  gained bachelor or oligarchs degree from the  UK , who are competent are working in the health care sector as health care assistants and support workers at  minimum wages.\r\nIn light of these facts, we hereby request to consider the following  suggestions;\r\n1 Reduce the academic IELTS score for NMC registration.\r\n2 Provision of  exclusion for  nurses who completed  degree or oligarchs from UK universities.\r\n3 Reduce the IELTS requirements for overseas nurses who have 3 or more years of work experience in the Health care sector in UK.",
