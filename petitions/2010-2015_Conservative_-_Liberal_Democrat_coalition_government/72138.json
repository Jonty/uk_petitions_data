        "additional_details": "Under the current Road Traffic Act 1988, Section 170, it states that a driver must stop and report an accident involving (8) a horse, mule, ass, cattle, pig, sheep, goat and dog.\r\n\r\nWe propose that subsection 8 be amended to include cats.\r\n\r\nWe request this amendment, both to promote awareness of careful driving, and to ease the suffering of the families at loss.\r\n\r\nWith the change in society regarding the care of pets, requirments for micro chips and laws concerning neglect and cruelty, we feel it is a time for the amendment of this law. Cats are as much a part of the family and loved as dogs. This should not be about the protection of asset, but about the safe guarding of innocent and defenseless animals. ",
