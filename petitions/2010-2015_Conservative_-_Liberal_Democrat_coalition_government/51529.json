        "additional_details": "In view of  the statement by the Prime Minister that we are all in this together,  it is time for Government & Ministers  to personally contribute to the deficit  & with the vast increase in foodbanks it is very clear that for charities to continue to maintain this increase will be impossible and that Government Funds will be required. It is therefore unacceptable for tax payers to fund subsided catering for the House of Commons when Ministers etc can afford to pay the full price for their meals. As with other benefits a cap should be set and anyone earning over \u00a360.000 should pay the full price for the meal and wines etc. An example must be set by Government that they are being responsible with tax payers money and not treating Ministers differently to the general public. The money should be given to food banks where it is desperately needed. A Food Bank Fund should be set up by Government as a matter of urgency.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
