Iam extremely passionate about protecting all chilldren including my own this kind of image is disturbing for a child and if they come across these pornagraphic sites without an adults knowledge who is to say that they won't act this out in life or worse ! there is a lot of hardcore ,nasty porn easily found on the internet and violent porn with under age chilldren which is VERY WORRYING. It is our job as parents to protect our children in life but how can we do that if you as a government won't help protect !!",
