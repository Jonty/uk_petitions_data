Making vulnerable people and families even more vulnerable. It will make poor families and people even poorer than they are now, forcing them into debt, possibly having to rely on extortionate loans. To promote work is an entirely good thing, but there must be jobs available. The whole tax will be detrimental to the health, mental health and well being. By demoralising  and demotivating it may have an adverse effect on the ability of people to find work.",
