        "additional_details": "As a student paying tuition fees of \u00a39000 per year, I find it completely ridiculous that universities do not allow feedback to be given on essays before their final submission date - what are we paying lecturers for if they won't even look over essays and make sure students are on the right track? The Department for Education should be working with universities throughout the UK to ensure that students are given value for money on their degree course, and the best feedback possible on essays and coursework, both before and after the final submission date.",
