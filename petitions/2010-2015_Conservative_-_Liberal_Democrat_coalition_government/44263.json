        "additional_details": "Oscar Neil Duffy was born asleep on the 11-11-12 at 37 weeks. Days before Oscars Mum had the Flu vaccine and the Whooping cough vaccine on one appointment (7 vaccines in total). The pregnancy was perfect throughout, but after the vaccine it all went downhill resulting in death. I am fighting to have the law changed for vaccines in the UK.  I am not opposed to Vaccines I just believe more information should be given before the injections.\r\nNo 1.  During Pregnancy no more than one injection can be given in a 4 week period.\r\nNo 2.  One weeks cooling of period is to be given from offering the vaccine to having the vaccine.\r\nNo 3.  The booklet that is issued for the vaccine should state clearly the name of the vaccine, the make, the contents (other vaccines contained), and any manufactures safety warnings i.e. not recommended for pregnant women.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of Oscar Neil Duffy thank you for your support.
