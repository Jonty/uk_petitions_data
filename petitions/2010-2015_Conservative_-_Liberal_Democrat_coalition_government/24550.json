Whilst crisis has become a norm at Fratton Park, a second spell of administration could well be on the cards. It's apparent English football suffers from ineffective \"fit and proper persons\" tests. The FA need to bring in stricter rules to stop reoccurring issues like this happening not just at Portsmouth FC but at other football clubs as well. ",
