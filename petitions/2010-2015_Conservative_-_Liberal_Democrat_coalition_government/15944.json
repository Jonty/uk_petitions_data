If a vehicle is recorded as overstaying its welcome,  some  car park operators then request DVLA   to supply the name and address of the registered keeper.            Anecdotal evidence suggests  that  this may  be a rip off  and a scam.\r\n\r\nPlease prohibit  supermarkets  taking photographs  of car registration numbers.",
