        "additional_details": "This petition is about how it should be a woman's choice to have a cervical screening under 25 not the government's. I and lot of people do not think it's right to be turned down when a woman is showing symptoms. In the last year I have heard of quite a few women under 25 dying of cervical cancer and women who have been misdiagnosed just so they don't have to give women a screening. This needs to change before more under 25 women die.",
