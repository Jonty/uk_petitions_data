No.\r\nWe are already paying  high taxes to fund for peoples housing and living expenses and yet it has been revealed that some of these people have then chosen to destroy businesses and destroy out cities.\r\nIf we continue to fund these people they will never appreciate the value of money and the consequences of their anti-social behavior.\r\n----I suggest they are billed with the substantial amounts of money it will take to rebuild and regenerate many areas of our cities.\r\n-----I suggest if they cannot pay then they should devote their time and labour to rebuilding what they sought to destroy in the first place.\r\n\r\nWe only have one country, but millions of voices and if we make these voices count we can change the way situations like these national riots have been handled.
