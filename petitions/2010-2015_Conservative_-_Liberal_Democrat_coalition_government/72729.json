Road lanes like that on Grapes Hill are now tighter than before with the additional bus lane..\r\nThe above should also apply to bus gates too.\r\n\r\nHolland has a great system for motorcyclists and pedal cyclists alike and their policies should be influencing the way we move two wheeled vehicles in and around Norwich/Norfolk\r\n\r\nAs a small, but busy city, with severe congestion around both inner and outer ring roads and 1.5bn being spent on road upgrades by the government, what better city to run at least a pilot scheme?\r\n\r\nThis would encourage more people to ride further through the year.",
