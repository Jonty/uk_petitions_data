        "additional_details": "Another year gone by and another price increase by National Rail. Latest news has it that we \"UK\" fares are the most expensive in Europe, Some passengers paying up to four times more for tickets. All this would be well if the service was improved. However over the last 8/9 years service has dropped majorly.\r\n\r\nTrains being cancelled, trains running late, congestion even though trains are supposed to be running on a strict timetable, new trains with less seats than the old ones, smelling trains, poor station announcements, takes longer to get into London City from 80% of stations than it did 15 years ago.\r\n\r\nAll of the above appears to be what we are paying for. National Rail explain they increase there price to improve service. The above justifies why this e-petition should be accepted. ",
