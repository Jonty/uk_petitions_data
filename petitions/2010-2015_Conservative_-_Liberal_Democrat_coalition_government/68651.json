They appear to be acting as judge, jury and executioner.\r\nWhatever happened to a fair trial in this country? Innocent unless proved guilty no longer exists because of the media.\r\nA fair trial cannot happen when the media treat people the way they do.  It has to stop.\r\nWe need a law to prevent this happening again, and quick.",
