        "additional_details": "I know this is not a local matter & I haven't contacted you about this before but I am hoping you may be able to help.\r\nLennox is a dog in Belfast that has been seized & ordered to be put to sleep because he looks like a Pit Bull. There has been a lengthy court battle to try to save his life but despite all the evidence in his favour, the battle to save him was lost today. There is a large campaign of over 100,000 people in support of Lennox. This dog has never been aggressive & is actually a therapy dog for the owner's disabled child. Is there anything you can do to help? Thank you for your consideration.",
