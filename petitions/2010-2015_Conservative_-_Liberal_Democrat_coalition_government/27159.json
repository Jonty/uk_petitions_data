I think this is unfair and feel that the bands should stay in place but everyone who owns a car pays a minimum of \u00a3100 a year and then extra for what band their car appears in. People who have low co2 cars should pay some sort of tax amount like the rest of us have to. This would give more money to the treasury. Also scrap the \u00a35000 incentive to those who buy electric cars. They cost \u00a330000 anyway so these people are rich enough to buy such cars and don't need this subsidy. This cost the Government \u00a38.5million in 2011. A further saving to the treasury.",
