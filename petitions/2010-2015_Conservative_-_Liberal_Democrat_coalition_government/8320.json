        "additional_details": "The recent riots in London occurred during a time when a large percentage of the Government was on holiday and Parliament was in recess.  This means that when things needed to be considered there were significant delays.  This handicaped the police in being able to deal with the situation as well as they might have.  It has been stated that the Army and Water Cannon should not be considered yet.  What is the level when they should be considered?  Legislation also needs to consider what should be done when all available police cells are full of rioters \u2013 ways to provide more space and, under this situation, longer detention times before interview.  This petition asks that Parliament considers this.  Save our society.",
