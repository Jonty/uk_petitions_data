        "additional_details": "After campaigning since the early 1970\u2019s, Chrissie Maher officially launched Plain English Campaign to fight for clear public information. In the US, President Obama signed the US Plain Writing Act of 2010 on October 13, 2010. The law requires that federal agencies use \"clear Government communication that the public can understand and use.\"   Clear communication is at the heart of our society, and is an essential tool for both our personal development, and the future of all our nations. We call on the UK Government for a UK Plain Language Act that follows similar guidelines to the US Act (details can be found on this link http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-946).  Unnecessary jargon creates a fog of confusion, apathy, and inactivity.  Plain English brings clarity and the power to take action.  Clear information is not a luxury to be dependent upon our changing fortunes.  It is a human right - it will help our economy recover, and needs to be law. ",
