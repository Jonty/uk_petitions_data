The presence of waste or litter on land or property should, within reason, be the only evidence required to take enforcement action.\r\n\r\nThe Derby Telegraph, Derby City Council and Normanton Empowerment Team request that the House of Commons change the law so:\r\n\u2022\tproperty owners must keep their land free from litter and waste.\r\n\u2022\tthe burden of proof to prosecute for fly-tipping is reduced from \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d to \u201con the balance of probability\u201d.\r\n\u2022\tpowers are introduced to make it an offence for a person questioned by a council enforcement officer on a litter or fly-tipping matter to withhold their personal details.\r\n\r\nAnd the petitioners remain, etc.\r\n",
