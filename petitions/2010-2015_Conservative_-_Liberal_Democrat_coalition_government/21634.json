This is what is legally constituted as work.\r\n\r\nInterns are workers and are legally entitled to some form of remuneration, and this should be, at the very least, the National Minimum Wage.\r\n\r\nThe government must abolish unpaid Internships. Any working contract lasting longer than two weeks that does not guarantee a full or part time paid job at the end of it, were someone is given set hours, and set tasks and responsibilities, must invoke the National Minimum Wage.",
