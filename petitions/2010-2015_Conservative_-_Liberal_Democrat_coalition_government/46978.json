        "additional_details": "In the wake of a Digital Rights Management (DRM) and server overload scare involving the launch of SimCity in 2013, we call for the government to regulate digital rights management technologies (DRM) so that people who legally buy video games will be able to easily install and play it in, for instance, 50 years time.\r\n\r\nThe regulation of digital rights management is also essential because if video games fall under compulsory British Library deposit laws then it will be essential to ensure that such games are accessble in future, otherwise future generations will not be able to experience it first hand.",
