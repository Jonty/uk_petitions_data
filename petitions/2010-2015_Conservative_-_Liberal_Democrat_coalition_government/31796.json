        "additional_details": "To draw attention to the number of lawyers subjected to abuse, humiliation and murder in representing their clients. The Chinese lawyer, Chen Guangcheng, has been placed under house arrest by the Chinese government. He was \u201csentenced\u201d for damaging property and disturbing traffic; targeted by the government for his investigations into forced abortions. In Colombia this year 5 lawyers have been murdered. In March 2012, Iran sentenced Abdolfattah Soltani, a prominent Human rights lawyer to 18 years imprisonment. As such we would ask that the House condemn these abuses on lawyers and ensure that aid is not provided to those countries which victimise their lawyers in such a fashion. We would also seek that they raise these issues with those countries so as to allow lawyers to undertake their duty in safety.",
