        "additional_details": "A large African culture present in the UK today upholds the belief in witches, demons and evil spirits. Pastors and individuals, who claim they hold the rite to exorcise, have exploited this belief for monetary gain, mental indulgence and physical self-gratification.\r\nThere are terrible consequences associated with the branding of children in this manner that can result in the short and long-term mental, physical and sexual damage of children concerned. Irresponsibly accusing vulnerable children in this manner is child abuse and can lead to severe health implications and neglect \u2013 something that can no longer be ignored.\r\nCulture and religion should never be manipulated to abuse children and it has become imperative for the Government to act to cease all of the activity in the UK that currently enables children to be labelled in this manner. The government need to ban the branding of children as witches, demons and evil spirits in order to protect them from harm.\r\n\r\n",
