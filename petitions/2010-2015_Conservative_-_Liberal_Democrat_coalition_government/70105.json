        "additional_details": "There is a great deal of misunderstanding when it comes to having the electrics checked in rented properties. Currently it is a recommendation for non HMO properties to have the check done every five years.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose the following:\r\n\r\nMake it a legal requirement for all rented accommodation to have an electrical certificate done every five years just like the Gas Safety Certificate is done annually.\r\n\r\nElectrical safety should be made a priority as under fault conditions on badly maintained electrical installations, users can be injured or even killed.\r\n\r\nWith the rental market increasing in size year on year and the number of landlords going through the roof, along with a high industry call for regulation change we hope that this petition will lead to the successful change to the current confusing recommendations.\r\n",
