        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call upon the Government to set up an inquiry into the failure of the Metropolitan Police to investigate allegations of treason. Allegations of treason by some members of Government have been sent to all police forces in England. The allegations list the violations of English Constitutional Law over loss of sovereignty to the EU. These allegations have been recorded by 25% of police forces and handed to the MET.\r\n\r\nThe MET has refused to investigate saying they were 'vexatious' and without giving a reason. The allegations were checked for legal accuracy by a barrister and a solicitor before sending to the police. Failure to carry out investigations for treason is committing misprision of treason and carries a life sentence on conviction.",
