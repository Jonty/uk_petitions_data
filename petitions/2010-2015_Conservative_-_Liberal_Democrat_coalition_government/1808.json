As well as providing a more secure environment for bringing up children post divorce, these measures should also reduce tax payer burden by aiming to keep children in self-supporting families with an income earner:\r\n\r\n\r\n1) An initial assumption of 50/50 shared residence, negotiated down only as far as the maximum sustainable contact that any non-resident parent can offer.\r\n\r\n2) When making contact orders, all children living in a family are considered equally, so conditions have no detrimental impact on step- and half- siblings.\r\n\r\n3) Change the definition of the \"best interest of the child\" so that it is met by the parent who can provide the most stable and supportative family circumstances going forward.\r\n\r\n4) Enforce sanctions against resident parents who obstruct contact, including loss of access to assistance from the CSA (and successor organisations)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
