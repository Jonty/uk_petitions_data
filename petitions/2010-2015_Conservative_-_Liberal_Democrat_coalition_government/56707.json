Ninety-two percent did not go.\r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom Government has reneged on the 1971 assurance given in writing to the United Nations International Labour Organisation, that the spirit of Employment Service Convention 1948/88, which was confirmed on\u00a09\u00a0July\u00a01948, would continue to be fully upheld following the Government\u2019s denouncement of the Convention\u2019s requirement to maintain a free public employment service and which included specialist employment services.\r\n\r\nThe stated reason for the denunciation in 1971 was to be able to charge employers fees.\r\n\r\nOnly three countries have denounced the International Labour Organisation requirement to provide a free public employment service:  Bulgaria,\u00a0on 13\u00a0March 1961; United Kingdom, on 6\u00a0August\u00a01971; and\u00a0Italy,\u00a0on\u00a09\u00a0August\u00a01971.",
