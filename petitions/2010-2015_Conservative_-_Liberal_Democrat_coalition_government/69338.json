For a calling number to be connected they MUST provide the Connected Line Indentification (CLI) information when making the call.\r\n\r\nAny calls not compling with this would receive an automated message stating that \"the telephone number you have called not does accept anonymous calls\"\r\n\r\nThis would allow those who wish to block unwanted nuisance calls. The CLI number provided MUST be the calling number of the originator of the call, not a generic number for the calling company. This is allow anyone to complain to the originator, if calls are unwanted for any reason",
