        "additional_details": "The government should leave the pensions alone of public sector workers such as the police,nurses,fire service,teachers,and any others who preform jobs that help everyone,  regardless of whoever they are or where they come from. This country relies on these people to do jobs most of us would'nt and which we cannot do without, and therefore we should be grateful to them and insist this government leaves their pensions alone.  Why should just bankers get perks and MP's pensions not change?",
