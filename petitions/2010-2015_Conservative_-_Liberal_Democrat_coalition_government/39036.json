        "additional_details": "The refusal by the Foreign Office to recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital undermines Britain\u2019s strong relationship with Israel. It also ignores the significance of Jerusalem to the Jewish people and goes against the Palestine mandate. The borders of Jewish Palestine under the mandate included Jerusalem and this was seen as the capital of Jewish Palestine. Nothing in the UN Partition plan changed this.\r\n\r\nIn whatever peace agreement is reached Jerusalem will be Israel\u2019s capital. Moreover, from its existence the status of West Jerusalem as part of Israel has never been disputed.\r\n\r\nThe UK is treating Israel differently to other nations. This is because the UK has recognised other disputed capital cities when Burma and Kazakhstan have changed their capitals and Israel should be treated no differently.\r\n\r\nWe are asking the public to sign this petition to pressurise the UK Government to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\r\n",
