The BBC should therefore look to generate it's income in other ways and should consider the following:\r\n\r\n(1) All areas of the BBC including television channels, websites and radio channels could have adverts paid for by private companies.\r\n(2) The amount of income brought in by advertising would be sufficient to cover all running costs of the BBC.\r\n\r\nTherefore the Governent should consider the following points:\r\n\r\n(1) Citizens should not be required to purchase a TV License in order to view television.\r\n(2) TV Licenses should not be sold or bought anywhere across the country.\r\n(3) All remaining TV licenses should not be refundable. (to cover change over costs)\r\n\r\nSay no to TV licensing.",
