        "additional_details": "On 9th July 2012 new Immigration Rules came into place regarding Spouse Visas.The Sponsor must show earnings of a minimum of \u00a318,600 to support the Applicant. This cannot include any benefits or help from a 3rd party, even if in the British Citizen Spouse's rights. This is unethical and against human rights to refuse families on that basis in a country stuck in recession. Those with families and lower income jobs CAN adequately support their families, they shouldnt have to provide such a high unrealistic figure to prove this. Allow exceptions on the financial requirements of the appendix, for hardworking families under compassionate circumstances and stop keeping families apart. ",
