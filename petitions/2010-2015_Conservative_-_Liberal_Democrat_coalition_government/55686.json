        "action": "Revert all of Michael Gove's news laws regarding retaking GCSE's.",
        "additional_details": "The new laws regarding retakes of GCSE's are unfair and insatiably demanding on today's year 11 students (and possibly those to come into year 11).\r\n\r\nEveryone deserves second chances without it dramatically affecting them for the future.\r\n\r\nThe government claims to 'care' about society's students, but obviously 'forget' this 'claim'  when they are stressing them to do their best in their only chance.\r\n\r\nThe amount of pressure put onto students these days is absolutely ridiculous and this shouldn't happen.\r\n\r\nThe government take no note of how the students will cope with this, they only do what they think is best for us without actually consulting us. It's not justified, by any means.\r\n\r\nSign this E- Petition if you agree that the laws should be reverted to the way they were, because after all, nothing was wrong with them to begin with. Why fix something when it isn't broken?",
