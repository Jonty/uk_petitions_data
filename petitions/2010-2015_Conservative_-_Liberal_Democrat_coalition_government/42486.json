        "additional_details": "I propose a fast (non-stop) South West Train service from Ascot to London Waterloo (AM) and from London Waterloo to Ascot (PM) should introduced to the Peak timetable.\r\nIn this area, the only non-stop train we currently have is a fast train from Guildford into London Waterloo. But this provides no service to commuters who live in Wanborough, Ash, Aldershot, Ash Vale, Frimley, Camberley, Bagshot or Ascot, as their Gold Card will not allow them to travel beyond there station and change.\r\nFor this reason, a non-stop train to and from Ascot will provide current Commuters with a faster and more useful service. This service will also offer a faster route to and from London for commuters in surrounding areas such as; Martins Heron, Bracknell, Wokingham, Winnersh, Winnersh Triangle, Earley and Reading, wishing to travel into London Waterloo rather than Paddington on the First Great Western Line, as they'd have a non-stop train transporting them over half of their journey.",
