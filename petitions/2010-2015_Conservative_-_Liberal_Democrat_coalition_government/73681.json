        "additional_details": "Anjem Choudary is instrumental in the radicalisation of numerous Muslims seeking jihad in the UK and around the world. He has an ingrained hate for infidels or non-Muslims that will not be diminished and is calling weekly for Sharia Law to be implemented in the UK.\r\n\r\nSharia Law will allow Muslims to legally kill anyone who disagrees with Islam, or is gay, or leaves Islam.\r\n\r\nHis role in ISIS (radicalising and recruiting British Muslims to fight in Syria and Iraq) is untenable and threatens directly the safety of the British people.\r\n\r\nHe does not belong in nor respect our country he wants Sharia Law in the UK, he wants Jihadi on our freedom.",
