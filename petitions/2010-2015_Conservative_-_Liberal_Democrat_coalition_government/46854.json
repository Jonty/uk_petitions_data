        "additional_details": "On 17 February 2008 the Republic of Kosova formally declared it's independence.Great Britain was one of the first countries to recognise this will of the people of Kosova.\r\n\r\nCurrently the prime minister of Kosova is engaged in dialogue with the PM of Serbia to 'improve relations' between the two countries,a dialogue which doesn't protect the interests of the people of Kosova and only serves to accelerate Serbia's membership to the EU.\r\n\r\nShould Serbia gain membership before Kosova or before recognising its independence,they would block attempts for Kosova to join the EU.\r\n\r\nSince the people of Kosova can't rely on its political leadership to represent its interests,due to the high level of crime and corruption that this leadership is engaged in,they must rely on allies such as Britain to do so.\r\n\r\nI request the British government delay (veto) membership of Serbia to the EU until such time that Serbia has recognised the Republic of Kosova and respects its full sovereignty and borders.",
