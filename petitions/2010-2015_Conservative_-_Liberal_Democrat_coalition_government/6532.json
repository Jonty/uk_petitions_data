        "additional_details": "It would appear that raising the age that people are allowed to buy cigarettes has had no effect on the numbers of young smokers, particularly women who appear to see it as an alternative to a healthy diet and exercise. Youngsters seen drinking in public are dealt with by the police, but schoolchildren smoking seem to be ignored, so perhaps raising the age again and some enforcement may go some way to reducing the numbers taking up the habit.",
