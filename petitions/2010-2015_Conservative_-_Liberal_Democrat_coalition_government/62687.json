Despite having smear tests since I was 18. Ranging from abnormal to boarder line. And this was still not picked up!\r\n\r\nSmear testing should be made available to girls  the age of 16. As this is the legal age of sexual consent, the HPV vaccination is given at this age. So why shouldn't they be protected from the virus and the disease by getting tested??",
