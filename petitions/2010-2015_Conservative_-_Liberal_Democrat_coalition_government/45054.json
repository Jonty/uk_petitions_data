        "additional_details": "Families with children are facing an unprecedented squeeze as a result of the rising cost of necessities like food, petrol and childcare and reductions in benefits and tax credits, while pensioners have been protected from many austerity measures and now benefit from a pensions \u2018triple lock\u2019.\r\n\r\nFamilies have contributed their fair share to deficit reduction and need a \u2018triple lock\u2019 too. That means:\r\n\r\n- Delivering an ambitious vision for families, including: childcare, backed by investment; greater investment in housing; a shift in spending to early intervention; and a credible strategy to eradicate child poverty.\r\n\r\n- Protecting crucial services for families from spending reductions. This means maintaining real spending on: free early years childcare; early intervention services like Sure Start Centres; and parenting support.\r\n\r\n- Committing to no further real terms cuts to family benefits, to ensure they maintain the support they need to prosper.",
