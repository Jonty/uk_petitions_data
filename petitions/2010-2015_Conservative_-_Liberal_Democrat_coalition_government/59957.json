Parents will take more children out of school for holidays to compensate.\r\n  If it is such a good idea, why then don't private schools run the same timetable already?  They have a slightly longer day and generally extra curricular activities on Saturday Mornings, but MORE holidays to compensate.  Their results are better because they have smaller classes!\r\nStandards will drop not rise.",
