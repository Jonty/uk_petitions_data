The current owner has neglected these magnificent craft, and they are in danger of passing beyond help. The hovercrafts home is The U.K. And The Princesses Margaret and Anne are the last surviving examples of the worlds largest commercial hovercraft. We will not see their like again. They should be taken into public ownership and restored for future generations to enjoy.",
