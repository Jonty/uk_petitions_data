        "additional_details": "A minority of drivers, but particularly in our larger cities and suburbs, needlessly obstruct their forward-vision with 'fluffy dice', air fresheners, compact-disks, and various other 'lucky charms' dangling on threads from their rear-view mirror.\r\n\r\nThese obstructions are big enough to conceal from the driver's view vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, and even whole cars at a distance. Driving with such devices present should thus be considered to show a criminal disregard for others' safety.\r\n\r\nGiven the stringency of rules regarding chips on the windscreen, it is particularly absurd that these dangly distractions are so widespread.\r\n\r\nTo improve safety on our roads, please give the police the powers and encouragement to instigate a crackdown on all such obstructions to the driver's view, and make them an MoT failure point.",
