        "additional_details": "We call for a Public Inquiry into the running of the National Trust Lettings including with Farm tenants. We demand an investigation into concerns of tenants being evicted and their rights being abused for what seems to be for short term commercial gain - rather than the National Trust focusing on the long term national interest. The inquiry should consider whether the National Trust's status as a charity - which has responsibilities to communities as well as properties - should continue. Subject to the findings of the inquiry we believe there should be Government and Parliamentary action to ensure the National Trust puts the needs of people and heritage before short term speculative gain.",
