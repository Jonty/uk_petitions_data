        "additional_details": "The state should not spend much needed resources funding the brainwashing of children. Religion can be taught in the context of providing information about the different religions and cultures of the world but should not be force fed to children while they are too young to make a proper informed choice. To paraphrase someone, a child is no more able to make a choice of which religion he/she wishes to follow than to make a choice on whether he/she should become a fully paid up member an employment union. All religions want to get their next generation of members while they are still young and the state should not sanction that.",
