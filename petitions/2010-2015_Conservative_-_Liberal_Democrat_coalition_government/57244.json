        "additional_details": "In 1997 Gordon Brown raided pensions and created uncertainty for anyone needing security in their old age if they were under the age of 40. Currently, 1m people who have only worked 30-40 years get a final salary pension of over 30k a year plus state pension. People now working just as hard will have to work 50-55 years and will get far less.\r\n\r\nThis is not fair so I propose means testing all pensions over \u00a320k on a sliding scale to \u00a330k where people under \u00a320k get all their state pension on a sliding scale where people over \u00a330k get nothing. This would save upward of \u00a310bn a year. Pension tax credit 5bn cost.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could then just upgrade out shoddy railways to be like Germany's!!!\r\n\r\nGive the working youth some hope",
