        "additional_details": "Everyone has a right to defend themselves, gun crime is increasing despite nearly all guns being banned, that is because the criminals dont give a crap about gun laws so it is us law-abiding citizens who suffer, we should be allowed to own guns to defend ourselves, I want to own a Lee-Enfield or Lee-Metford or Martini-Henry rifle, i believe that's me right, i have a right to keep guns to defend meself and me property!\r\n\r\nI also think special target shooting centres should be set up so people who like to shoot guns can shoot them without the chance of harming someone, target shooting centres are rare in the UK and expensive to become a member of and a long way away from most people",
