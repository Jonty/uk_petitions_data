They have deemed that the route to Southill Lower School from the villages of Broom and Stanford is safe for children aged 5 - 9 to walk each day.\r\n\r\nThe route is approximately 1.7 miles on unlit, un-pathed and untreated roads as well as having to cross the busy B658 which is a major trunk route between the A1 and M1 within the county.\r\n\r\nPlease help us stop this council putting childrens lives at risk.",
