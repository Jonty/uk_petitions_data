        "additional_details": "Ensuring a consistent, steady, healthy annual growth in fuel efficiency has a host of benefits. Not only could people save at the pump, pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide would be reduced. This would satisfy everyone: those who are fed up of having to fill up so regularly; those who want action to stop Climate Change; in addition to those concerned by respiratory diseases such as asthma and premature deaths linked to high emissions of the former pollutants. As such, I petition the Department for Transport to introduce mandatory fuel efficiency increases of 5mpg per year on every model in every car manufacturer's fleet. To put it simply, the most effective approach is a little, often.",
