        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition if you feel that any cosmetic/beauty/cleaning/hygiene product that has been tested on animals, (or includes ingredients that have been tested on animals), should have a advisory notice on the packaging. It is not good enough that products that have not been tested on animals are the only ones to feature a warning. It should be standard. People should have the right to see exactly what they are purchasing and what the company has done in order to produce their products.\r\n\r\nA bag of peanuts has a warning on the packet indicating that it contains nuts. There is no reason why animal tested products should not feature a similar warning.\r\n\r\nThe only reason this is not presently disclosed is due to negative feedback and drops in sales. If that is the case, perhaps it would be better to not to test on animals in the first place.\r\n\r\nPeople have the right to choose what they buy based on an informed decision.",
