        "additional_details": "Consumers have no choice but to receive water from their local water company.  This is in effect a monopoly.\r\n\r\nWater rates are paid in advance, yet when there is a 'shortage' and use of water restricted, the consumer still pays for the water.\r\n\r\nThis petitions asks that water companies be held more accountable to shortages in their area and refund rates to consumers when restrictions of use are in place.  This may help focus the water companies to invest more in infrastructure and storage.",
