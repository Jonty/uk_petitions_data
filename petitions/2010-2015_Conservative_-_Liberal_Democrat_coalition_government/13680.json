One is from a wealthy family and one is from a less priviledged background. So even though they have the same education and career prospects, the one from a wealthy background is left with a massive debt and the other friend has a much smaller debt. This is unfair! They are both equally equipped to pay of their debts. It is unfair to assume that a person from a less-priviledged background will earn less money if he has the same education as someone from a wealthy background!",
