        "action": "Move all freight to the Railways",
        "additional_details": "I believe that all Freight should be moved to the rail network and the rail network expanded to cope.  Only short range local deliveries would be allowed on the roads.\r\nTransitional arrangements would allow road transport companies to adjust and for the rail network to expand.\r\nThis would create an enormous amount of employment opportunities and develop a freight transport system suitable for a future where the cheapest energy is centrally produced by Nuclear based power plants and reduce the UK need for overseas fuel.\r\nThis proposal would also increase the capacity of the present road system enormously and reduce the need for new road systems.\r\nIt would also eliminate the present situation where overseas drivers create a serious safety hazard to all UK drivers.",
