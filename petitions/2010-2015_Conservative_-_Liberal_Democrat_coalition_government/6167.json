At the moment unless the CSA directly request this information they are not obliged to adhere, to the Residency Order and it will be ignored, or possibly be considered Contempt of Court to provide the Residency Order, without prior leave of the relevant court to do so. This needs changing or why have a Residency Order, which cannot only be ignored by the other parent, but by government departments as well, financially benefiting  the parent who does not obey the Residency Order, thanks to the hole in the CSA's legislation.",
