        "additional_details": "I would like the government to significantly increase funding and resources for dementia care in the NHS. An ageing population will result in a huge increase in dementia patients, who at present are not cared for adequately in NHS hospitals. Dementia is a disease not a social inconvenience and more resources are needed in research, treatment and care. Please don't let our elderly population down - we are all going to be in this position one day. Stop our money being wasted overseas and get our own house in order now before dementia cripples the NHS.  It's our future. ",
