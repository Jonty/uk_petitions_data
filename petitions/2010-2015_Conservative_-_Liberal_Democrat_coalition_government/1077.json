        "additional_details": "\r\nEvery year around 90,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with skin cancer. Around 2,600 people die annually from the disease.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn England alone the total cost of skin cancer treatment for the NHS is in excess of \u00a3190 million. In addition to this are the wider, and probably greater, economic implications of people being sick and dying.\r\n\r\nVAT is not charged on prescription drugs yet is charged on sunscreen - a product that can and does save lives.\u00a0\r\n\r\nGiven that \u00a0sunscreen costs upwards of \u00a35 a bottle many people simply do not bother. Many of those that do use it sparingly to make it last longer rather than reapplying as often as recommended. This is particularly worrying when it comes to children from poorer backgrounds. It is proven that over-exposure to sun in the early years increase the likelihood of skin cancer in later life.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned propose that sunscreen of factor 15+ (the minimum strength recommended by the NHS) is classified as VAT exempt.\u00a0\r\n",
