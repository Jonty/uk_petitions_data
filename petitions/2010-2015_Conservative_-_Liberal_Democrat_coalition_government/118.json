        "additional_details": "We ask that Caroline Spelman reconsiders the decision not to investigate the appalling animal cruelty at Cheale Meats. The fact that the footage was gained from cameras placed whilst trespassing cannot justify the decision to ignore this cruelty. DEFRA, as ever, seems to be biased towards protecting the interests and profits of the food and farming industry rather than looking after animal welfare.",
