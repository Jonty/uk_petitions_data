        "additional_details": "Almost half of the 125,000 heroes from Bomber Command did not survive the war. Despite the huge risks and hardships these young men undertook answering the call of their country they were never rewarded for their service with a medal. Political expediency meant they were over looked when medals for service were awarded after the war. The young men who risked their lives did not choose their mission or their targets, but their sacrifices brought us the liberty that we enjoy today. At present the government only offer a clasp to fix to the 1939-1944 Star which has to be applied for online or by phoning the MOD.  The last few remaining Bomber Boys deserve proper recognition whilst they are still with us and able to accept our gratitude.  Please sign this petition so we can take our fight to The House of Commons, we need over 100,000 signatures to put the case forward. ",
