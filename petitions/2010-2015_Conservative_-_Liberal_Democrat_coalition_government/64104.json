        "action": "Closed British Consular against British nationals caught up during the economic downturn",
        "additional_details": "When the financial markets folded up in Britain due to the consolidating housing market. The financial markets went into turbulence. British nationals headed for capital mobility nations in likes of Brussel, Australia, US, South Africa, as far as Middle East(Abu Dhabi, Dubai and so on including China). Citizens caught up in once florishing nations like the coastal West Africa went that direction but the financial meltdown had eaten a chunk crunch of their financial system which had much affected dual British nationals. I am a Part Qualified Accountant from an accredited British University, with peculiar interest in added value for market niche and growth trends for the corporate entity, small & medium size enterprise. We are in the hope that Foreign Direct Investments(FDI) would flow back towards to these province and regions. Or aid to get back on track with capital mobility nations.\r\n",
