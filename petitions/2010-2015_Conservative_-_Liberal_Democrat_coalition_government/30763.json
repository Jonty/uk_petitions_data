Bus, Rail, Tube, Tram fares are rapidly becoming out of control because of private companies charging extremely high fares. If the state owns the public transport services then costs can be reduced, create more income for the UK, more jobs, better transport services and can instead be a non profit organisation meaning the money is re-invested in public transport instead of bosses six figure salaries.",
