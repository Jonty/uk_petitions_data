Then why do some people find it acceptable to sell or give animals away to complete strangers forever?\r\n\r\nThe leading animal charities in the UK promote home checks before homing an animal. This helps ensure that an animal receives the right care, a suitable environment and does not get neglected. A lot of pet shops, dog shelters, and breeders do NOT ensure their animals are placed in a safe environment with a family or owner that provides suitable care.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to ensure a system where every animal from a shelter, shop or breeder has had it's potential owner homed checked to a suitable standard.\r\n\r\nThe key to stop animal abuse or neglect is to prevent it from happening. This will save a lot of time, effort and funding in the future.\r\n",
