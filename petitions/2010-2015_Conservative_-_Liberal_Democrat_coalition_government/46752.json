        "additional_details": "This petition is to show that there is a significant number of people who would use a direct rail service between Wakefield, Normanton and Castleford in West Yorkshire and York and Scarborough who because of a lack of such a direct service do not currently use rail. It therefore calls for such a service to be brought into use including bringing back into use the second platform at Castleford railway station., This will also boost tourism and regeneration in the area.",
