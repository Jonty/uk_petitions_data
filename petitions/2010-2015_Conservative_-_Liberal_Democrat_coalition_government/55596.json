        "additional_details": "It should be a human right issue that nobody whatever their age, is allowed to knock on householders doors to 'trick or treat' in the Halloween season. It is begging which surely is illegal whatever the context - it is threatening by cursing; inflicting evil, and frightening people which surely has to be illegal. They give no care for anyone of a sensitive nature, and the elderly; in addition, it is offensive to many religions. It is our human right to feel safe in our own homes; this evil, selfish practice must be outlawed, The Government must uphold people's civil liberties so we feel safe in our homes.",
