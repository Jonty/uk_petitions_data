        "additional_details": "On Saturday the 18th of January 2014, 43 year old Pete Trudgill, dedicated father of Abby & Keira, husband, climber and paramedic, was swept into the sea by a freak wave from the North side of Stonehaven Harbour and drowned. The safety equipment available at this location was insufficient to be able to attempt any rescue, and the Stonehaven Lifeboat was not operating at the time. This appeal aims to raise a petition and funds to improve the safety and rescue facilities at Stonehaven Harbour.",
