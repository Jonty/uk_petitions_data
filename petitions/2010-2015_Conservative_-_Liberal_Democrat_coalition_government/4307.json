        "additional_details": "We need to move away from the concept of the global market. We need to produce more in our country and stop importing goods from abroad often produced in dictatorships where factory conditions resemble those here 200 years ago. So employ British people in environmentally acceptable conditions where we don't need to cause polution transporting products across the planet. So impose tariffs on products that could be made here or the European Union. Let's face it other countries have found ways to stop our products being imported. This will help correct the madness of the current system of trade which is totally out of kilter.  ",
