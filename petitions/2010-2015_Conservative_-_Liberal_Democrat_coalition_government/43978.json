The National Wildlife Crime Unit (NWCU) is a British national police unit that gathers intelligence on wildlife crime and provides analytical and investigative support to police services.\r\n\r\nWildlife crime of all types is rapidly growing across the world, with elephant and rhino poaching both hitting new highs in 2012; organised crime is increasingly involved. Illegal bird trade, smuggling amphibians, raptor persecution and rhino horn are key operations.\r\n\r\nA mere \u00a3136,000 has yet to be signed off by Home Office and funding expires 31/3/13. DEFRA have agreed their share.",
