        "additional_details": "We the undersigned ask that the government create legislation that forces Internet Service Providers to link average internet connection speed in a local area to the amount of money people are required to pay for it. This would mean that people who currently pay for speeds \"up to 20 MB\" but actually receive far less would pay less thus creating a fairer system and encouraging Internet Service Providers to provide a more competitive and universally fast internet network in the UK.",
