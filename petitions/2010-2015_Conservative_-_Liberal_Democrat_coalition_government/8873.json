Users should be checking is there is an existing petition to sign, but generally this does not happen.\r\n\r\nBy creating a duplicate petition you could actually be hampering the chances of it being discussed .\r\n\r\nIf there are 4x petitions relating to the same topic,  each with 20,000 signatures, none of them will be likely to be discussed.\r\nCombine these together and you instantly have 1 petition with 100,000 signatures to reach the benchmark required.\r\n\r\nPetitions should be moderated and combined where appropriate in order to deliver a greater opportunity of the petition reaching debate.\r\n\r\n",
