Their minds are unaffected so they know whats coming.\r\n\r\nThe government need to donate money into research to FIND A CURE. At the moment it is costing the taxpayer alot of money for care assistants, home improvements, etc; this money could be saved if we find a cure. There is a cure around the corner, we just need the funding. Please help us PETITION THE GOVERNMENT for funding for RESEARCH  into this terrible condition",
