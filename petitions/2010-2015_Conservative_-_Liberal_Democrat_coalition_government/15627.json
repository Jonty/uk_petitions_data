It seems wrong team or individuals that  represented us are not avialable to all.  As citizens of the country that our great sportspeople  go out to  represent, we should all have the opportunity to share in their success and failure, irrespective of income.   Such sporting events provide psychological zones where a heightened sense of 'us' as a nation is animated. They create a common interest and bond, set in place millions of conversations, and connect people in experiencing the elation of national success, or conversely despair.  These\r\nevents shouldn't be privatised to a specific group, but freely available to all,  so that the 'we' of being in something together is bought from the background to the focus of our subjectivity.\r\n",
