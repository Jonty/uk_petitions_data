        "additional_details": "We feel it is immoral and against the public interest for public funds to be used by public sector organisations (such as the NHS) to issue gagging orders, whether to silence whistleblowers or as part of legal settlements to for negligence etcetera. In such cases, taxpayers are effectively paying to keep information from themselves - information that they surely have a right to know. We therefore ask the Government to take steps to outlaw this practice as a matter of urgency.",
