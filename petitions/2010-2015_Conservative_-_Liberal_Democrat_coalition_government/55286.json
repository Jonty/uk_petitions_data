        "action": "Make the minimum wage the same for all ages",
        "additional_details": "The national minimum wage in the UK for a 16/17 year old is currently \u00a33.68 and for an 18-20 year old is \u00a34.98. However, for anyone 21 and above the minimum wage is \u00a36.19 which is a big difference.\r\nMy proposal is to make the minimum wage in the UK the same for every age, as it is completely unjust that a 16 year old doing the exact same job as a 21 year old, perhaps even to a higher standard, should receive a full \u00a32.51 less. By putting this into place it would also reduce age discrimination in certain jobs, as often employers may be tempted to higher younger candidates as they know they can pay them less.\r\n\r\nIf you agree with this and believe in a fair wage scheme for everyone in the UK then please sign this petition.",
