        "additional_details": "The continuing roll out of speed bumps is becoming not only unmanageable but totally ineffective. The amount of traffic calming  measures in place needs to be assessed, in particular speed bumps which are not maintained by the local council. A large number of speed bumps are in need of repair and are a danger to drivers, the main problems are the white paint has rubbed off a lot of them which means that they are not easily visible, when hit within the speed limit they could cause both the vehicle and the people in it damage. Also the way different sized cars negotiate them means they are often misshaped.\r\nSpeed bumps should also be consistent in design and not just lumps of left over tar thrown onto the road. This e-petition would look to trigger a review of speed bumps as a traffic calming mechanism.",
