        "additional_details": "Some prisoners are incarcerated in the USA for years and in line with the eligibility criteria meet the requirements for a transfer back to the UK but are declined this basic right. If a request is denied one can only apply again after a 2 year period has elapsed.\r\nSome of these prisoners have family, children, partners and are deprived from seeing loved ones due to financial circumstances. The UK needs to work closer with the USA to ensure prisoners are given basic rights as too their families, so they can have some form of contact.",
