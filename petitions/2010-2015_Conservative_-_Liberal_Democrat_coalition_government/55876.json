        "action": "Stop direct recruitment from outside the police service, to senior police ranks",
        "additional_details": "The government propose that candidates can be recruited directly into senior roles within the police force bypassing the need to serve as a Constable. The office of constable is a fundamental role which needs to be experienced by all senior officers who have to make operational decisions in all real time situations. The new proposals will signify an end to a 180 year tradition and allow management of officers by individauls who don't necesarily understand the fundamentals of policing. A career in the police service is a long term apprenticeship with prosepcts of advancement through promotion. The new proposals will seriously undermine the natural progression of officers rising through the ranks through hard work and dedication to the job.\r\nI ask that the new proposal be scrapped in the interests of our great british police force and preserve the 180 yearss of tradition.",
