        "additional_details": "The ICC was founded to end impunity by prosecuting individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. However, it cannot yet try those who engage in an illegal war.\r\nIn 2010, the UK was part of a consensus that agreed to the definition of a new crime, aggression: \u201cthe use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations\u201d. This would make it illegal to order the invasion, bombing or blockading of another state unless such orders comply with the UN Charter.\r\nFor this definition to come into force and give the Court jurisdiction over aggression, 30 states must ratify an amendment to the Court's founding statute. So far 13 states have ratified it and many more are in the process of doing so.\r\nWe the undersigned call on the Government to ratify this amendment to the Rome Statute to show the UK's support for the end of illegal wars.",
