        "additional_details": "The government urgently need to review the laws relating to buying and selling property.\r\nBuying or selling a property is one of the most stressful experiences of any adults life.\r\nThe current system is open to absolute abuse and gives neither the buyer or seller any security or confidence that the transaction will be completed.\r\nShould one part of the housing chain collapse, many individuals and families are caused massive distress,anxiety and finacial loss.\r\nIt isn't difficult to change the laws to those they follow in Scotland.\r\nThis is the 21st century, the laws need to be changed now.\r\nAs far as I can see the only reason changes haven't been made is because the solicitors  don't want it changed, if the property sale falls through they still get paid.\r\nPlease sign this petition as one day you might be facing the same legal farce involved in buying and selling property (if you haven't already).",
