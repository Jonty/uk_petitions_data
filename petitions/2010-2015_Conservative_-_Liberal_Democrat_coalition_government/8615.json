        "additional_details": "In 1984 Lord Jack Ashley (Hansard) referred to DWP vilifying (standard treatment) drug-damaged disabled persons and campaigned for a draft directive on product liability.  See 1985 EU product liability directive. Daubert v Merrill Dow case was heard in U.S. in 1993; like Primodos, debendox / bendectin & thalidomide 'evidence' was produced to say animal testing had been carried out properly, relying on 'development risk' defence; yet again!\r\nDWP/PCS and UK local Council & government collectively appear to continually ignore the damage these medications and oral contraceptives are thought to have caused worldwide.  The denial of disability benefits, playing of word games & use of authorised(?) criminality must end.  Accept liability and help, not hinder, those rendered in need of assistance through birth defects/injuries.  Empowerment is a responsibility; wilfull blindless is avoidance of responsibility as is political deafness Mr J Straw (referrals to other MPs obstructed).   ",
