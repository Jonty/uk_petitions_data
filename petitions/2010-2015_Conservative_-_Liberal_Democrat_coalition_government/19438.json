        "additional_details": "There are two or three good reasons for banning music in NHS waiting rooms. The first is that it's a waste of public money as, presumably, the NHS has to pay the PRS fees like any other provider of public recorded music. The second is that musical tastes are very personal and music that one doesn't like can be very disturbing and distressing when one is feeling unwell or if one has some disabilities, such as hyperacousis. The third is that waiting rooms are an inappropriate space to be polluting with unnecessary sound.",
