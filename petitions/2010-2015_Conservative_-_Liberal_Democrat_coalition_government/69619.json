        "additional_details": "I petition the government to change the law in order that parents of young people, aged 18+, with Learning Disabilities or Autism,  to be able to remain in control of their childs' life if that is what both parties so wish.\r\n This is in order to stop professionals ignoring parents and thinking that they know best and can make all the decisions.\r\nOur youngsters are human beings with feelings. They need us.\r\nBecause the child turns 18, it DOES NOT mean that the parents have to take a back seat.\r\nIt's wrong and cruel, and it should not happen.",
