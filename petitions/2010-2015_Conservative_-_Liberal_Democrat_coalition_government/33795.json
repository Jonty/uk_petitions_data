This tax is based upon the redundant Rates system and the discredited, loathed Poll Tax.\r\n\r\nCouncil Tax is unfair. It is based solely on property value, not ability to pay. The assumption that all persons living in the same band have identical incomes is a fallicy.\r\n\r\nThe Coalition Government is urged to usher in a local tax, based entirely on ability to pay.\r\n\r\nFeasibility studies into alternative means of raising revenue for local government, other than through householders, also needs to be pursued by this Government.
