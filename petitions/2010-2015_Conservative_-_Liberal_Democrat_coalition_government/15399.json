If we are to become a Digital Britain then this network of aluminium cable needs to be replaced fast. South Yorkshire through Digital Region have just layed massive amounts of fibre cables, but due to the poor BT network I am un-able to connect to this because of the aluminium. I am just one of many that will suffer this problem. I would like the government to keep to its word in making the UK a leading country in the digital age and force BT to replace all aluminium cabling or ask OFCOM to look into this massive problem. We are paying BT and third party companies good money for Telephone and Internet services only to be let down by this poor infrastructure. If customers are found to be on aluminium network they should be offered services at a lower rate until BT change the cabling.",
