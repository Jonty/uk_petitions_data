        "additional_details": "David Cameron's has proposed the introduction of compulsory 'National Service' for all teenagers once they reach sixteen.The problem is the universal nature of this proposal. For every teenager who decided to take part in the riots there were many more who deplored the action. The government should not waste money on programs for those who neither need it nor want it. They should instead be concentrated on those who need it.The activities proposed in addition to community service are also a waste of time.Compulsory community service for everyone also detracts from its status as a punishment.
