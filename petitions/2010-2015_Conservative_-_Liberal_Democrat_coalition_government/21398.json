We are only a very small island but we insist on giving aid to countries like China and India whose economies are far greater than our own.\r\n\r\nWe propose that any aid should be in the form of goods and services and NOT cash in order to better target the problems.\r\nThe provision of goods and services rather than cash should then create more jobs within the UK and reduce unemployment\r\n",
