Why? Because;\r\n\u2022The cost of learning to drive is detrimental to those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds\r\n\u2022Educating teenagers about the dangers of driving from an earlier age would help prepare them; with 1 in 4 new drivers crashing in their first year, the safety of our generation should be prioritised.\r\n\u2022The cost of learning to drive is about \u00a31,333, why when it\u2019s a vital skill required for jobs, do young people not have any help towards this like GCSEs/A levels.\r\nYou wouldn\u2019t deny a child the right to learn Maths or English because they couldn\u2019t afford it, yet we\u2019ll discriminate towards those who have a lower income when it comes to driving. Fast becoming a requirement for work, can the government afford not to act with youth unemployment rates so high?",
