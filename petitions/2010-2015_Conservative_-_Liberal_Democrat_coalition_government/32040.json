This allowed Disabled and over 60s to travel with National Express by coach at an affordable rate.  Over 60s and Disabled are the groups hardest hit by excessive taxation on fuel. David Cameron's unfair treatment must stop. The over 60s lower income bracket will be suffering unnecessarily due to George Osborne's unfair Granny tax changes and his unacceptable belligerence in this regard.",
