We, the undersigned, are fed up with the same tired fire fighting fire policies which ignore common sense that resides in every British citizen. The culture of self and self interest aped by everyone and every institution at every level of society. Britain is rotten to the core and has no community or central ethos or value system around which to coellese. There needs to be a total change to the metric by which we make decisions. Happiness. Are people happy? People are happy when things are fair. When you get out what you put in. Where there is a reason and opportunity to contribute. Where role models are aspirational. We call on the government to create a happiness index like a carbon index and force parliament to meet targets by statute. Then let the Market of politics create happiness through good policy under pain of loss of power.",
