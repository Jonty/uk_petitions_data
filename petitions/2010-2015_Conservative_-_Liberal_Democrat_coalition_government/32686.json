        "additional_details": "People finding themselves unemployed have their motor insurance premiums increased, or policies can be refused or rejected.\r\n\r\nAs employment status has no rational bearing on risk when relating to a social, domestic and pleasure policy with mileage limitation conditions (imposed by the insurance companies) - this is clear status discrimination of the unfortunate for profit.\r\n\r\nArguably, less risk through no daily peak traffic journies and less obligatory use should be the case.\r\n\r\nForcing already unfortunate people off the road when they lose a job reduces their options of returning to a productive role in society by greatly reducing their employment location options.\r\nThe government should seriously consider the implications and make status discrimination illegal.",
