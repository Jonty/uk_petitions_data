        "additional_details": "I believe that channels that are aimed at children should not be showing advertisements that are: graphic in nature; talk about things that will make children guilty; or are aimed exclusively at adults.\r\nThis would include but is not exclusive to: Charity's drawing attention to pain & suffering with what they show onscreen or talk about in the narrative; or loan & credit providers.\r\nIt\u2019s inappropriate to expose children to material that will make them feel guilty or make them worry about matters that they shouldn't even begin to think about until they are older. The thinking behind this is understandable that parent's will be watching with their children or within listening distance of the TV, ignoring that these channels are aimed at children not adults.\r\nIf this petition gains enough signatures, I would like the government to put a law in place to prevent any such material from being allowed to appear on channels that are aimed primarily at children aired in the UK.",
