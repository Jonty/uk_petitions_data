        "additional_details": "Whilst succesive governments offer ample lip service to the cause of supporting ex-forces members, little is done to to offer practical benefit.\r\n\r\nThe current SIA quango insists that ex armed forces and ex police members pay for training and registration, to work within the security industry.\r\n\r\n Not only is this insulting to people who have been extensively trained, and are vastly experienced in security work. It imposes a financial burden which some cannot meet.\r\n\r\nAbolish this requirement for ex forces and ex police members to train and permit them free registration, also encourage employers to favour those who have served our country.",
