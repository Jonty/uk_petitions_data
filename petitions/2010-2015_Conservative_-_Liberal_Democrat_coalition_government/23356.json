        "additional_details": "Under current legislation, many innocent dogs are seized each year simply because of the way they look.\r\n These dogs are well behaved family pets who have committed no crime other than being assessed as an illegal breed which is banned in the UK under the 1991 dangerous dogs act.\r\n This Breed Specific Legislation does little to protect the public from so called \u201cdangerous dogs\u201d neither does it address the root problem which is mainly due to irresponsible owners with untrained dogs.\r\n Any dog which is seized and assessed as an illegal breed or crossbreed will be destroyed although, under the 1997 amendment, owners can apply to a court to have their pet registered on the \u2018Index of Exempted Dogs\u2019 but this is solely down to the judges discretion.\r\n If your dog is seized.. Sign nothing.\r\n If you sign, you are giving permission to have the dog destroyed!.\r\n please sign this petition if you want bsl to end,the dda must be changed and bsl ended otherwise any one of our pets could be next",
