The people of this country have little enough say in Gov policy, as it is.  Peaceful protest is ignored, appeals are ignored, and now this.  In addition, it seems that should an opinion be one which a party-majority is required, then a whip is employed to gain the vote required by this Gov.\r\n\r\nTrue democracy, indeed!\r\n",
