        "additional_details": "The illegal use of pedestrian footpaths by cyclists has reached epidemic proportions. Many cyclists believe that they have a right to cycle on or off the pavement or road as they choose, especially at traffic lights. Each year people are injured and sometime skilled by careless cyclists speeding along pavements. Furthermore cycles should be treated as vehicles and their users compelled to have some form of registration plate or device fixed to the bicycle, this would be coupled with the requirement to have personal liability insurance and to pay towards a road fund license, in just the same way as conventional motor vehicles.",
