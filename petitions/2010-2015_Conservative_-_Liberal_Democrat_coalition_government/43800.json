Being sexually abused. The loneliest, saddest, unloved little person in the world.\r\nCrying for her family and family are crying for her.\r\nRecently had only 13 minutes human contact in a 17 hour period costing you \u00a31200+ per week.\r\nShe wants to be with her family and can talk for England when the side effects wear off.\r\nThis emotional/sexual abuse should not be ignored and misinformation should STOP!\r\n ",
