This for me would allow younger people to be able to control a vehicle and therefore, when they do reach the legal age to take their driving test would allow more safer drivers on the road. The cost of insurance is phenomenal for new drivers and too many new drivers are being allowed to pass their tests before being truly ready to handle the roads. I feel this can benefit both younger drivers and the road safety.",
