The criticial time scale is the first 24 hours.  If we can get mobile phone operators to put text alerts on every phone about a missing child and the last known details such a registration numbers of verhicles etc., we have a 70% chance of finding them alive.  This system is currently operated in every state in the US and some European countries.  But it is not operated in the UK.  We need to ask ourselves why?",
