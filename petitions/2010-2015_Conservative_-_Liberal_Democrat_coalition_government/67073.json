        "additional_details": "The current driving test has been in force since 1935,\r\nbut since then nothing fundementally has changed. We still teach our people to pass a test rather than to learn all the skills required for modern driving.  The test is no longer adequate or of a standard we should accept.  Too many people are still dying or being seriously injured in avoidable accidents.  Local communities the police, the fire service, local councils, local focus groups are doing a fantastic job in their areas, the number of fatal accidents are down by18% since 2000. BUT; nothing has been done about education in schools or about teaching a driving skill for life.  We the undersigned are simply asking the UK Government to look at more education and change the driving test to one that reflects the modern issues faced by our new drivers.  We feel with the right education and the right test the number of people killed could be at least halved.  This action would also save the UK economy over a billion pounds.",
