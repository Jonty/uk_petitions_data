        "additional_details": "A number of E-petitions are calling for street lighting to be turned off at night or at certain times of the night. This is not the answer. The obvious answer is to convert street lighting to run from the many forms of renewable energy. Solar and wind energy is already used for some street signage and to convert all street lighting to this would provide extensive and sustainable  employment  for thousands. The technology is in place. The electricity providers would then be able to reduce their prices to the consumer and the Local Authorities.",
