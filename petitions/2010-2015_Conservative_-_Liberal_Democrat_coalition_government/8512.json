We have more people in jail than most societies, costing the law abiding tax payers a fortune.\r\nBring back the Birch for crimes such as rioting and looting.\r\nAlternatively use some of the closing military bases and offer work to the soldiers being paid off to set up Boot Camp style youth prisons, sleeping under canvas and non stop drills all day untill they can learn to appreciate how good their freedom is.
