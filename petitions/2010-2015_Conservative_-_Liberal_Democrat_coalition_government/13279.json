This should consist of, for example, a GCSE pass in 4 of: music, drama, english language, dance, art, textiles, graphics, DT and ICT. It would be aimed at students that wish to further their studies in more applied subjects without being made to study other subjects that they are not as clever or intelligent as other students. ",
