It is time, Time to start the ball rolling, it is time for it to be recognised for what it is, what it stands for, and how this tunnel can help bring much needed tourists to this part of the Valley. The councils of these days and the days past must now act or help in getting us back on the map. They used us for our coal and lives. We want something back, we are not asking a lot. Blaencwm is of great beauty these days, the walks are spectacular. Lets keep it that way and even get it better. Engineered by S W Yockney, Rhondda is the longest disused tunnel in Wales at 3,443 yards. Today its portals are buried. Though single line through it, the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway became double track as it emerged into daylight.\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
