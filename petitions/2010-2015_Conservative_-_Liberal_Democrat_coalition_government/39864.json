        "additional_details": "Max Clifford just said on \"This Morning\" tv programme on 5th October 2012 in relation to the BBC child sexual abuse scandal that there was \"loads of young girls throwing themselves at young popstars\" and \"when you have 4 or 5 or 6 pushing your way into your dressing room you don't ask for a birth certificate\". In the \"Guardian\" newspaper on Saturday 6th October 2012; Chris Poole who worked at Decca Records in the 1970s was cited as saying \"he was amazed it hadn't already come out\" but added \"that Savile's alleged habits needed to be set in the context of a highly sexualised era\".\r\n\r\nThis is justifying alleged child sexual abuse and there needs to be apologies and debates about this in the house of commons.\r\n\r\nThe BBC should give monies to charities working with children who have experienced child sexual abuse.\r\n",
