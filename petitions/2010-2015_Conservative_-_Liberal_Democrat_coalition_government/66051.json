Even then, they have very few powers to use to stop noise nuisance.\r\n\r\nThere should be a Law introduced, or series of Laws, to give the Police and/or Local Councils powers to stop excessive noise at any time of day or night, and particularly between the hours of 10:00pm and 8am.\r\n\r\nPerhaps another clause in the Harrassment Act specifically referring to excessive noise nuisance on two or more occasions would suffice?",
