        "additional_details": "In the wake of the release of the Hillsborough Independant Panel report, Sir Irvine Patnick has been revealed as one of the sources that made claims against Liverpool FC supporters, that resulted in the disgusting Sun front page story 'The Truth'.\r\n\r\n At the time of the disaster, Patnick was serving as a Tory MP for Sheffield Hallam. He sought to protect South Yorkshire's reputation by spreading lies and deceiving a nation for over 20 years of the brave and heroic actions of the Liverpool FC fans. He deserves his knighthood no more than Fred Goodwin did and he should be stripped of it.",
