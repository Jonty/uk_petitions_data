        "additional_details": "I would lie to petition for the Government to provide more services for young people in Bedfordshire who believe they are LGBT. There are very little services in Bedfordshire, and I think this is not acceptable, especially given the increasing rate of young people who are LGBT and may need to access the support that they, at present, are not getting enough of. I would like people to sign this and help me to get the voice of the LGBT community in Bedfordshire heard, as it is unfair that they are not getting enough support; support to which they are entitled to.",
