They spend this time scoring political points and the tax payer pays them for their yobbish behaviour. PMQs are there to hold the PM to account yet this rarely happens. A message needs to be sent to our MPs that this is unacceptable. We propose that the speaker should get a small cuddly toy named Bob. MPs are only allowed to talk if they're holding Bob. And if they are not nice, I'm sure there's room to find a naughty spot.",
