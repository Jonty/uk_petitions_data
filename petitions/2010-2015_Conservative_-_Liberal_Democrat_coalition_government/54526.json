        "additional_details": "During Mr Cameron's Election campaign in 2010 one of his Election pledges was that he would ban the English Defence League, he hasn't banned them. In 2011 during the riots, in Parliamentary PMQT he said \"there is none sicker than the English Defence League\". The English Defence League are spreading hatred towards the Muslim population. The English Defence League are costing taxpayers/Councils/Police Forces and excessive amount of money by holding demonstrations.\r\nI call on David Cameron to follow up his words of banning this hate group.
