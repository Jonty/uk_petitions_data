The parliament should consist of 100 members, and have control of all matters except Defence and Foreign Affairs that are currently dealt with by Quangos and other government bodies that only have a jurisdiction in England.  Local government should be reorganised, and consist solely of a 'layer' of Counties, and another of Parishes...and where appropriate the English Parliament should assume some of local governments existing powers.",
