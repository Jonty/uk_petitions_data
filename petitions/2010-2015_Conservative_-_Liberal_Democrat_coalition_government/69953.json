        "additional_details": "I require the Law to stop Ltd company directors the freedom to close companies after they have knowingly taken monies from customers, not supplied the goods or services and/or supplied sub standard goods or services and have no responsibility for this. Especially Small Companies with only the director and secretary , where the only person a customer deals with is the said director, who is responsible for every decision and dealing, they must be held responsible and accountable.\r\nThen there is the loop hole allowing directors to fold companies after committing one of the above offences and to re-open another company and immediately trade again which needs to be addressed and closed. Legal recourse to the director needs to be addressed and implemented. At the moment the loop hole allows for directors to knowingly take monies from people , fold a company and start up another company, i.e. legalised stealing!  This must be changed/stopped as soon as possible!\r\n",
