        "additional_details": "The government should re-think how they tax benefits. For those who apply for benefits, who do not have special needs or disabilities should remain taxed at whatever rate it currently is, but for those who have got special needs and disabilities, the taxing of benefits could be reviewed, and for a few ideas, the taxed rate for people who have special needs and disabilities could be reduced, or either should not be taxed at all.\r\n\r\nReason is because the people who have special needs and disabilities have a far less income, can only can work limited hours, or either do not have a job at all. They do not earn the amount of money that someone who works in a retailer or higher would earn. Having more support for those with special needs and disabilities would improve their lives and start helping those people more, then at present.",
