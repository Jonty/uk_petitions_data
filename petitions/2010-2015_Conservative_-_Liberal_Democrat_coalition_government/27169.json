        "action": "Make musician hearing protection voluntary rather than mandatory",
        "additional_details": "At present, all professional musicians, are required by law (Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005) to wear hearing protection at all times whilst rehearsing and performing.  The hearing protection results in musicians being unable to perform to the highest standards as they cannot hear themselves properly, or the other musicians they are working with.  This could eventually destroy live music in Britain.\r\n\r\nWe want the Control of Noise at Work Regulations to be amended to allow musicians to use their discretion about when hearing protection is appropriate, signing disclaimers if appropriate to prevent litigation against their employers.\r\n\r\nThe current regulations prevent musicians from doing their jobs properly.",
