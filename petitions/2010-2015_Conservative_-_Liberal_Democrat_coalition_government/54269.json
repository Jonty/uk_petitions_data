David Cameron, Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and respective heads of government departments must be held accountable for each failure of intelligence that has caused unnecessary suffering to those affected by false information, whether deliberately fabricated or not.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to show the government that the people will stand for it no longer. We must be quick with our opposition before all-out miltary action is taken against Syria, further destabilising the region and potentially leading to a retaliation from surrounding and interested nations.",
