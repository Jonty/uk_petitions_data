        "additional_details": "Abolish IHT in all its forms.  Any money concerned has already been subject to taxation when it was originally earned by the deceased.  IHT therefore results in double taxation, at absurd rates.  On top of that, it shows a lack of respect to a deceased who has spent their entire life saving to enable them to pass something on to their family, and can be stressful for bereaved family memebers.   It should be abolished, or at the very least reduced to a rate much lower than 40%.",
