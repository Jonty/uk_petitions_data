Child care benefits should be given to families who work, why should somebody with ten kids who has never worked get \u00a330k a year in benefits......when the workers get \u00a320 a week child tax credit and pay over \u00a3400 in child care! Put the GREAT back in Britain and help those who choose to help themselves.\r\nI want the Government to debate changes to the benefits system to help people who choose to work, reduced childcare costs for families who work. Introduce a system that stops penalising the workers of Britain.",
