        "additional_details": "Obesity is a serious national problem. Many people lack the confidence to cook for themselves. They buy ready meals instead. Many ready meals are too high in salt and are looked upon as being a contributory factor to an unhealthy lifestyle. Recent research from Harvard confirms this. Ready meals are also expensive. Bringing back home economics into schools would give the pupils the confidence needed to reverse this sad state of affairs. It would also reinforce the idea of good hygiene by instilling in them the need for regular hand washing. Home cooking might also help the small companies - independent butchers, grocers, etc who sell the raw ingredients for home cooking. The government should be supporting a move towards increasing home cooking amongst members of the public. The best way to do this is to give people the training in basic cookery techniques at an early age so that they're not frightened off by the idea of having to cook for themselves.",
