        "additional_details": "The current laws allow people to be held in mental health hospitals against their will. I was personally held in hospital against my will when I did not feel unwell. Even if I had felt unwell I do not believe the Mental Health Authorities should have the right to detain people against their will, certainly not if they do not pose a threat to others. I would like the government to ban mental health sections at least for those who do not pose a threat to others.",
