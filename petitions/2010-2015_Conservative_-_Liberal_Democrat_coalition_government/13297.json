        "additional_details": "Many people, found guilty of certain criminal acts during the recent period of riots and looting, are been given vastly disproportionate sentences to their crimes - at a huge cost to the taxpayer and to the detriment of social and community cohesion. Community Orders, through which certain offenders are made to clean up, rebuild and spend time with victims, would be more suitable in many cases - as opposed to custodial sentences.",
