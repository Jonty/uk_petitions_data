        "additional_details": "\r\n\r\n\r\nMercedes passed away on 14 December 2011 at the very young age of 23 from Cervical Cancer.\r\n Had there been cervical smear testing offered in England as they do in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland where the age is 20, Mercedes would of been alive today. Because of her age her symptoms were ignored by her G.P. at that time. If only he had just referred Mercedes.\r\nMercedes and I talked about setting up a Foundation to help other young women/girls under 25 to seek medical attention at the earliest possible signs. And if their G.P. practice does not take notice of symptoms, then our goal is to provde help, support, advice and funding for private cervical smear tests for women/girls under 25.\r\nIf this petition gets at least 100,000 signatures, it will be eligible for debate in the House of Commons.\r\nLETS GET THE AGE REDUCED !",
