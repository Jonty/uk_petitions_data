The museum, which chronicles the development of cinema and television as key 20th Century art forms offers a unique look at our recent cultural heritage and is an informative and enjoyable day out for adults and children alike.\r\n\r\nCuts in government funding are now placing the museum under huge financial strain and could potentially threaten it with closure.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call on the government to protect the museum's funding and ensure that this fantastic institution remains open and free for members of the public.",
