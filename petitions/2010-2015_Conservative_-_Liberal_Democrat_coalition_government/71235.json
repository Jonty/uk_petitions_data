        "additional_details": "All new police constables get a basic starting salary of \u00a322,443 and up to \u00a336,254 after 8 years of service. Figures released by Transport for London, showed that a basic tube drivers\u2019 salary in the capital was \u00a342,424. Thats an extra \u00a36,170 on top of 8 years service in the met.\r\n\r\nPolice officers do above and beyond the normal job. They make massive sacrifices to their family and friends because of overtime hours, cancelation of holidays for duties and given up their social working hours for policing.\r\n\r\nPolice pay should have a significant increase to represent their role within the public services, TFL train operators have such a large pay in comparison to police.\r\n\r\nPolice protect our homes, keep safe our families, investigate and arrest terrorists, act as counsellors within communities and many more roles.\r\n\r\nTrain operators are just a comparison with police to show that the govenment needs to put the money elsewhere to support their communities saftey and wellbeing.\r\n",
