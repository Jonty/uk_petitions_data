        "additional_details": "My aim of this petition is to have BBC 3 My Murder which was on Monday 26th March 2012 shown in each and every secondary school in England. This was a true story about a young boy called Shakilus Townsend aged just 16 who was beaten and stabbed to death in 2008. If watching this hour long programme makes just one teenager think twice about picking up a knife then it would be worth it. Www.BBC.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01f6qz1/My_Murder/ ",
