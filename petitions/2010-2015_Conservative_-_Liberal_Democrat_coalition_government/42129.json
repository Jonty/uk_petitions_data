        "additional_details": "In 2006, the people of Gaza democratically elected Hamas. The reaction of Israel was to unleash more suffering on the people of Gaza through economic blockades and other provocative measures designed to provoke Hamas.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 the situation escalated, nearly 800 Palestinians died in the conflict including hundreds of children. In comparison, only a handful of Israelis died. Despite Israel being reported to the ICC for war crimes, including the illegal use of White Phosphorus, no action was taken.\r\n\r\nThe latest escalation shows the disproportionate attacks continue. The Foreign Office have been slow to condemn Israel for murdering Hamas' military commander.\r\n\r\nWe call for the Government to work with the United Nations to condemn Israel's actions and stop the slaughter of innocent people in Gaza and impose sanctions on the state of Israel and for the Department of International Development to work with charities like Red Cross and provide much needed aid to the people of Gaza.",
