        "additional_details": "On September 19th 2011, Jamey Rodemeyer, just fourteen years old, committed suicide after being bullied both online and offline for his sexuality.\r\n\r\n\r\nJamey had to suffer through years of hate, teasing and bullying because he was gay. The BFL team believe that no-one, whether you\u2019re black, white, gay, bisexual, straight, lesbian, transgender, or whatever you are, should have to suffer the bullying and torment that Jamey has.\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough this petition, we are hoping to get at least 5,000+ signatures which will help persuade the government to pass a law to make LGBT equality taught in each and every school that follows the national curriculum and bullying illegal.",
