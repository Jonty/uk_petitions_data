        "additional_details": "On the 8th Novermber 2013, marine \"A\" was found guilty of murdering a wounded Taliban insurgent in Afghanistan. The supporters of this petition feel that any sentence passed on marine \"A\" should recognise the following facts:\r\n\r\n1) He was serving his country in an extremely hostile environment, facing an enemy that does not recognise the Geneva Convention.\r\n2) He had had close colleagues and friends murdered by insurgents while on on tours of duty.\r\n\r\nWe hence feel that marine \"A\"'s only real crime is serving his country under extremely difficult circumstances. Any sentence should be commuted and he should be set free immediately.",
