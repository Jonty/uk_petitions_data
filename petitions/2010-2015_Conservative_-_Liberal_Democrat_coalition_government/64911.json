        "action": "End Halal slaughter within the UK and petition the EU to ban the slaughter of animal for Halal meat Europe wide",
        "additional_details": "The slaughter of animals for Halal meat is unnecessarily drawn out and causes the animal continued suffering for no quantifying reason.\r\nThe continued unjustified suffering the animal endures after having its throat cut is inhumane and should be banned within the UK. The UK government should also petition the EU to ban the slaughter of animals for Halal meat Europe wide.\r\nThis petition is NOT calling for a ban on Halal meat sale but a ban on Halal slaughter within the UK and EU.\r\nA youtube video of how animals are slaughtered for Halal meat can be seen through the link below. Caution this video is disturbing hence the petition to ban it.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_bZzxep87c\r\n  ",
