        "additional_details": "We the undersign recognise that building of new houses may be needed for our economy and future. However the same undersign also recognise that brown field sites must first be exhausted completely before building on green open spaces.\r\n\r\nTherefore this petition supports the change of building policies to stop the erosion of England's green open fields and greenbelt. We ask that the new policy should protect green open spaces and greenbelt land.\r\n\r\n",
