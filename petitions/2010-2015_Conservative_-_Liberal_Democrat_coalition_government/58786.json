        "additional_details": "Abertillery is a town in Blaenau Gwent with a population of around 18,000. Unemployment is exceptionally high. It is a former mining town that, since the 80's,has suffered a vast increase in benefit receipt, a severe decline in amenities and very little prospects for its inhabitants. A train station would give access to thriving communities nearby that are rich with the jobs the town needs. It would also bring tourism to a beautiful part of the country. ",
