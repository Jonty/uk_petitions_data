It will do precisely what Michael Gove has previously stated he does not want to happen...that \"Music education must not become the preserve of those children whose families can afford to pay for music tuition\".\r\n\r\nThe Government must take steps to continue or preferably increase spending on Music Education within the state school sector.",
