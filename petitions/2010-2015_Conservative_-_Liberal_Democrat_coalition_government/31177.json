        "additional_details": "Many landlords advertise their properties with the tagline \"No DSS\".\r\n\r\nAs many disabled people are in reciept of state help with housing costs, we the undersigned believe this is in direct conflict with the Equality Act 2010 which \"prohibits unfair treatment in the workplace, when providing goods, facilities and services, when exercising public functions, in the disposal and management of premises, in education and by associations (such as private clubs).\"\r\n\r\nThere is a shameful history in this country of properties being advertised as \"No Blacks\" or \"No Irish\" which is obviously illegal. We would like discrimination against the disabled to be outlawed in the same way, through banning \"No DSS\".\r\n\r\nThank you.",
