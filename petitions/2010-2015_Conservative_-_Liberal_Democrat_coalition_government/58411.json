        "additional_details": "At present, if one parent decides to restrict the other parent's rights of access to their children it is a very long and expensive process to gain legal access. This can be made even more difficult if the main carer imposes their feelings on the children causing them to be negative toward the other parent.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the government to enshrine in law the automatic right of access for both parents unless a court order is in place to prevent this.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the non resident parent should be entitled, as a minimum, to have access to the children every other weekend from Friday night to Monday morning. This automatic right will ensure that the resident parent can not deny all access and hide behind a complex, slow and expensive legal system to the detriment of the children and the non resident parent.",
