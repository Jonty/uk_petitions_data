In light of a further comment by Boris \"the Government had a DUTY OF CARE for those who could not look after themselves and give everyone else the chance to get on.\"\r\n\r\nAs a result we would like you to shake things up and enforce compulsory IQ testing on ALL MP's  including Boris to ensure that the everyone in the government has a genuine IQ higher than 130 rather than the current level most MP's operate on of about 50.",
