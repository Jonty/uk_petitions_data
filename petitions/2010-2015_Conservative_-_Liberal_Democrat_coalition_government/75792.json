        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition if you are opposed to the planned expansion of the Al-Emaan Muslim Center on Croydon Road in Keston, on the grounds of traffic and road safety concerns in the area.\r\n\r\nCroydon Road is already a heavily congested road, being the main connecting road between Croydon and Bromley. The proposals to expand the mosque at Keston Mark to accommodate around 200 visitors would put an enormous strain on the local road network and have an adverse effect on emergency response times in the area.",
