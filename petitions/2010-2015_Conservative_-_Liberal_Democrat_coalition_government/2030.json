        "additional_details": "I want the Department of Transport to keep a record of all foreign vehicles when they arrive at entry/exit points in the UK.\r\n\r\nA simple accesible to all Europe wide insurance database and CCTV record would enable the victims to more easily trace the Owner/driver of the 'errant' vehicle.\r\n\r\nThis petition is the result of two family members who were victims of two foreign drivers in Kent.  Neither of the victims were injured but they have been put to a great deal of expense fixing their cars. The Police appear to be unable to act as the current situation stands.",
