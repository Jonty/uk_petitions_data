        "additional_details": "The British Government does not have the power to shut down the Hacienda del Sol Apartments in Tenerife.  However it does have the power to warn future holidaymakers of the dangers they face in holidaying there (and in other similar hotels where crimes against tourists is so prevalent).\r\n\r\nFollowing the tragic death of Lee Mairs in Tenerife in suspicious circumstances, we call for the Government to grant the Foreign Office the powers to warn British holidaymakers of potentially dangerous hotels and resorts (outside of their current remit).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, that the Foreign office establish a reporting system for British holidaymakers to raise their concerns about their safety in particular resorts.\r\n\r\nFinally that the Foreign Office report all incidents on their website where British Nationals have reported being victims of serious crime whilst on holiday so that areas of reported high crime levels are identified.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition in memory of Lee Mairs",
