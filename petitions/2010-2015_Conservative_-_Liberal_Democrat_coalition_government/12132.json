Instead I have a board of directors which I do not recognise and feel have no interest in my needs and wants as a shareholder.\r\nI therefore demand as a shareholder in UK PLC a vote by my fellow shareholders to replace the existing Cabinet and Prime Minister ( Board ) for a new Administration.\r\nI want an administration who will have the interest of the British people exclusively for the British people.\r\n",
