        "additional_details": "Victims and survivors of rape, sexual assault and domestic violence who testify against their perpetrator in court are 2-3 times more likely to be attacked by someone affiliated with the perp. For this reason 1 of 2 things must be done. 1- bring in proper sentences, like in the US where life genuinely means life and not 3 years before being released on probation, for such heinous crimes. 2- allow the victims and surviors who testify to have the option of entering into the witness protection service. At the end of the day, when you see the figures on rape, sexual assault and domestic violence in the UK, it's a surprise the country hasn't been boycotted by the US who actually have proper systems to help the victims and survivors.",
