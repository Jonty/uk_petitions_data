We were put in a temp. home which was empty for 14 months prior to us moving in, they removed stair lifts, did works and allowed us to move in. Our children are now settled having made friends, attending sunday school and after school activities, we really want to stay here and not unsettle the children again, Please can you try and help us.\r\nMany Thanks Emma and family ",
