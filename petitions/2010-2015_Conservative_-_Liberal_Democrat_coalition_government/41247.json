        "additional_details": "We are petitioning the government for scalp cooling to be offered as the standard treatment practice for all applicable cancer patients undergoing chemo in the UK.\r\n\r\nHair loss is a well documented side effect of many chemo regimes. It is often devastating & the fear of hair loss has been known to cause patients to refuse treatment.\r\n\r\nScalp cooling systems work by lowering the temperature of the scalp immediately before, during & after the administration of chemo. This can prevent or minimise the damage caused to hair follicles, meaning that hair loss is not inevitable.\r\n\r\nScalp cooling (or cold cap treatment) is available free of charge in some NHS & private hospitals throughout the country if requested by patients, nurses or doctors. All cancer patients should be given the opportunity to choose the treatment that is right for them.\r\n\r\nSaving hair, preserving dignity, retaining confidence.",
