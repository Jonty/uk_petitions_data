        "additional_details": "i would like help from our goverment for disabled young adults. the goverment is sadly closing the Remploy factories.  many young adults are left to flounder at home even after taking college placements, a lot of which have nothing to do with furthering their careers.\r\nI know from experience that these young people only want to feel that they are doing something worthwhile. They also know that they are being fobbed off with courses such as car valeting and international cuisine. it is time we started to treat these young people with respect. This in turn would help all parents.",
