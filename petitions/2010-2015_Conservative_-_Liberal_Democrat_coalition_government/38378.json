        "additional_details": "The option 'none of the above' should be included onto the ballot paper to allow the electorate to indicate their dissatisfaction with the choice of candidates. Electoral turnout is often so poor that it could be argued the winning candidates have little or no democratic legitimacy to represent the voters of their chosen area. Often candidates are put forward as party liegemen/women, 'the usual suspects', who represent party wishes against electors wishes. I want to encourage more people to vote. By including 'None of the above' on the ballot paper this should give more power to the electorate & make politicians realise they must try to represent all of us, not just a minority of vested interests. I believe this will encourage more voters. I believe people do not like to register dissatisfaction, being forced to vote for an alternative candidate. I believe 'none of the above' will create better politics & democracy for us all. ",
