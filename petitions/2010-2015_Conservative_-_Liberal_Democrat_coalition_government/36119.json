        "additional_details": "By applying a little common sense it would be possible to do away with all Personal Tax Returns.  Simply make sure that all personal income suffers a Final Tax Deduction at Source.  We already have PAYE.  Why not apply the same theory to all personal income.  Need to tax interest ?  Banks can hand over the tax and pay net interest to individuals.  Income from shares ?  Let the stockbroker pay over the tax on dividends/profits.  And so on.\r\n\r\nThe massive burden of checking everyone's personal tax returns will be eliminated, making for a far more efficient Tax Dept.\r\n\r\nPsychologically people will feel a lot better as all the income they receive will then be theirs to spend as they wish.  No more tax to pay.",
