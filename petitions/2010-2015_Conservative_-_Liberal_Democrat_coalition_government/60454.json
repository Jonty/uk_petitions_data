However many feel this damage could have be averted had more long-term defenses been build along the South West Coast Path.\r\n\r\nBy all means create a new alternate highspeed option north of the Dawlish Sea Wall.\r\nBut for goodness sakes do not destroy one of the most spectacular, beautiful, joyful and historic segments of Railway history this country has ever seen!\r\n\r\nKEEP THE DAWLISH SEAWALL SEGMENT OF THE LONDON-PENZANCE RAILWAY LINE!!!",
