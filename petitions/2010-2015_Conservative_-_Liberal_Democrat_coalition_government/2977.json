        "additional_details": "This petition is to request that Her Majesty's Government. keep the promise made to remove all tolls from the Dartford River Crossing.\r\n\r\nBoth this and the previous Government have wormed their way out of removing the tolls to date giving various excuses.\r\n\r\nFor those who have to use the crossing rather than make a traffic choked diversion of seveal tens of miles, know that the queueing times frequently exceed one hour and will cost the economy more than the loss of tolls.\r\n\r\nWhat cannot be calculates so easily is the effect on the environment of the perhaps 30,000 hours/day of idling petrol and diesel engines and the effect on the health of the drivers and the local residents.\r\n\r\nThe proposal to collect tolls by electronic techniques similar to that used in London should be seen as what it is, a means of taxing the road vehicle user and should be discounted.
