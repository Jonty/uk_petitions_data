        "additional_details": "Female genital mutilation comprises all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It has no health benefits and harms girls and women in many ways.\r\n\r\nIt involves removing and damaging healthy and normal female genital tissue, and hence interferes with the natural function of girls' and women's bodies. The practice causes severe pain and has several immediate and long-term health consequences, including difficulties in childbirth also causing dangers to the child.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned, ask that the government use all of it's political and economic influence to deter this barbaric practice at home and abroad.",
