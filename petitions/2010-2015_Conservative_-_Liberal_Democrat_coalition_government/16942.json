        "additional_details": "Make it law for the energy companies to give free electricity to poor pensioners over the age of 75 who do not own their own property. This is to stop the thousands dying each year of cold, or in even more cases deciding whether to buy food or stay warm during cold conditions. It can be funded by the energy companies who make tens of billions of pounds in profit as a social responsibility, good will to those in our society who deserve a better standard of living than they do at present.",
