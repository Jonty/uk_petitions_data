        "additional_details": "Oswestry is an important town on the English/Welsh border. Oswestry lost its rail link because of the Beeching report of the early 1960's. Reopening the railway line with Gobowen and even giving it a Link with Chester, Manchester Llandudno and my town of Wellington and with Wolverhampton would revitalise the Market Town of Oswestry, not to mention enabling me to visit Oswestry on a wednesday! It may be unimportant to those that live in Places such has Birmingham, Manchester and Staines, but to those of us that have happy memories of visiting Oswestry it is important. To many people of Oswestry, they live at the centre of their universe. We had the revitalising of Market Town initatives 5 years ago. It is not much use if people are unable to get there. We respectively ask our government to reopen the line and to set a Royal Commision to look at the reopening of rail lines in general. ",
