        "additional_details": "On 26/6/11 & 4/7/14, Nathan Brown was fined \u00a32k (est.) for stating that, with Ben Thaler in charge, anything could happen in a Rugby League match. The RFL, in their self-assigned capacity as judge, jury and executioner, fined Brown to punish & denounce such 'controversial' statements.\r\n\r\nHowever, on 20/2/15, Thaler again worked hard to prove these claims true when he refereed Warrington Wolves v St George and turned a blind-eye to several incidents instigated by St George. In an RFL showcase game, all St George gave was a demo of how the code shouldn\u2019t be played and yet Mr Thaler\u2019s performance ensured they still claimed this dead-rubber.\r\n\r\nThaler's often shown a lack of understanding of RFL rules. Equally, the RFL has often shown an inability (or refusal) to address this official\u2019s short-comings. Our only course of action is Parliament so please sign up to ensure Parliament asks that one, simple question that the RFL seems unable to:\r\n\r\nDoes Ben Thaler know the rules of RFL?",
