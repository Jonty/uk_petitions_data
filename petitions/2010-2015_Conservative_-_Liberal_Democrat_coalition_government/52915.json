        "action": "Alan Turing deserves to be given a pardon",
        "additional_details": "Mr Turing was chemically castrated in 1952 for being a homosexual. Shocking as that is, what is even more shocking is that he was the mathematical father of the modern day computer, and as such Britain can thank him for saving the fleet from being sunk by U boats, and helping to confuse the Germans over the Allied Landings. The Ministry of Justice has written to politicians stating that they are against overturning the judgement against Mr Turing. Alan Turing was part of the top secret Bletchley Park in the Second World War. The Ministry of Justice would be writing everything in German today if it wasn't for Mr Turing.\r\nPlease support this petition.",
