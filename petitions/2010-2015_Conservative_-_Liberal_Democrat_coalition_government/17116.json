        "additional_details": "This petition aims to promote the reform of Trade Union Voting Legislation. To carry out a strike is a crucial cornerstone of any democracy and should never be compromised by a Government.\r\n\r\nThis petition seeks reform of voting laws so a trade union must receive over 50% 'yes' votes from all members balloted.\r\n\r\nThis petition aims to prevent workers being forced to take strike action when a minority of workers want to go on strike.\r\n\r\nThis petition doesn't aim to introduce a compulsory figure for turnout but prefers to look at introducing a compulsory figure for 'yes' votes.\r\n\r\nThere is need for reforming Trade Union voting laws (especially with the Olympics in mind next summer) to ensure all members' views are represented if a strike is carried out.\r\n\r\nA debate on this matter is urgently needed in Parliament to address all the issues so please consider signing this petition.",
