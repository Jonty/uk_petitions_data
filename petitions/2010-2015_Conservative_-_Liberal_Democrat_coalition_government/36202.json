Is it no surprise, then, that we taxpayers NEVER heard any of these people espousing a view publicly on the huge amounts of money being wasted in Foreign Aid; keeping us at war in Afghanistan; the waste of money to put on the London Olympics while people die at the hands of the NHS because of lack of staff; the level of tax free expenses and allowances granted to our political classes - the list is endless.  THEY HAVE NO VIEW PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CONTRIBUTING ANYTHING TO THOSE COSTS, AS THEY ARE NOT PAYING TAXES LIKE THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNTRY.  ANYBODY who is being paid using taxpayer pounds needs to be legally required to be paid under the PAYE system.  No PAYE, no job.  Go and work for somebody else.",
