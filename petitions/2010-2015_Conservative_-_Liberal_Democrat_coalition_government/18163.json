For real change to take effect and for politicians to take notice of public opinion voting should be compulsory for anyone over the age of 18. In this age of technological wizardry it should be easy to allow voters to vote on line, by smart phone or even the old way of ticking a box with a pencil ( always puzzled me because that is open to fraud as well) . To truly reflect the will of the people then ALL of the people must vote. For those that do not want to vote for anyone then a box must be provided so they can abstain.I believe this will be the only way to stop the contempt that most politicians hold their constituents in.
