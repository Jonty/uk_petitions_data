        "additional_details": "I received a letter on the 25th of Nov 2011 - actually dated the 23rd Nov 2011 telling me they had cancelled my insurance on the 21st of Nov 2011.\r\nIf the Police had pulled me over i'd have incurred large damages, If i'd run someone down and crippled them- they would have not been able to claim on my insurance-YET- the Police see it as lower level crime and call it a 'civil dispute- or at least- Mansfield police do. The FSA and the Financial Ombudsman both don't seem to give a crap and when i say i want law altering so they can't do this to anyone else- I am talking to a brick wall because they know law does already exist and One Call ought to be sent to hell- BUT the rich have investments etc and its the working class that lose yet again. Get rid of these incompetents!",
