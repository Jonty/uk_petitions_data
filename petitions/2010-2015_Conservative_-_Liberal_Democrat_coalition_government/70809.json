        "additional_details": "This is petition by two students from Sidney Stringer Academy: Aynan Muse and Kamran Khan. Our aim is to reduce university tuition fees or abolish them altogether. One reason why we want to do this is to help bright disadvantaged students get into University to help them gain skills which will in turn help them get good jobs for their future since education is a way of climbing the social mobility ladder. University tuition fees have tripled since the Coalition Government had been elected and it has prevented many pupils who deserve to go to University from going to University because they can't afford it. If they take a student loan out, they'll be in debt for decades which will not be good for them. So, we would like for you to sign this petition to help us and all bright disadvantaged students to get into University and help them get a better life.",
