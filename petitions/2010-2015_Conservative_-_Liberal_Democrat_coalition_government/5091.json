With vouchers, families will still get the same support they need ie to pay for food etc just in a voucher style. this will also stop people 'sponging' and buying 4 cans of stella everyday with taxpayers money!! how fair is it that people have to work and struggle to survive when people just sign on and pick up more?. sort it out!",
