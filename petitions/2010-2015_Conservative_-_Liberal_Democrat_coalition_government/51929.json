Blocking Pirate Bay or any Torrent website was not just used for Illegal downloads but had also a lot of legitimate uses such as Linux distributions.\r\nIf we do not get a proper system in place then who knows what will be blocked next what about Youtube, there is a lot of content that is copyrighted.\r\n\r\n If the trend continues and large cooperations and governments control access to the internet then Freedom of Speech will be breeched. Imagine creating a website that shows the government is not operating correctly and it gets blocked, Just like china!\r\nCreating a situation where information can be blocked makes for a very corrupt and controlled situation.\r\n\r\nI think all websites should not be blocked for monetary gain and should ONLY be blocked to protect individuals and not Corporations!
