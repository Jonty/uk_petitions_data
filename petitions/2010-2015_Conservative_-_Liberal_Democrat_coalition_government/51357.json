        "additional_details": "Petitions asking for the PM to 'tell us why' or 'make a public statement' are rejected on the basis of '.....have not made it clear what you want to be done.....'.  Ironically, the ONLY thing that Mr Cameron has actually DONE since getting into office is TALK about doing something, we have yet to see him following up on something he has TALKED about doing.  He loves to talk a good talk but when petitioners ask for him to be specific about something - thereby asking him to do what he does best (TALK) - those requests are rejected.",
