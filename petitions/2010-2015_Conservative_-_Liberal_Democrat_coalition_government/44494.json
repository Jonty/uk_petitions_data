Measures to be taken could include local council rates reductions or a council funded rent scheme for the first 12 months for premises undertaken, with the inclusion of free local parking e.g - for the first hour.\r\n\r\nWith the closure of Jessops and the news of HMV going into administration the demise of the high street continues as retailers struggle to compete with the costs off high street retailing, online retail soars as buying habits change more needs to be done to encourage and safeguard retailers on the high street.\r\n\r\nSo sign the petition and encourage local business to thrive on the high street through council funded schemes and incentive based initiatives, instead of banging on about Europe lets concentrate on matters on the home front.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
