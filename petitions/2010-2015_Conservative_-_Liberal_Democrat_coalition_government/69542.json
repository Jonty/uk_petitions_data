        "action": "Stop Immigrants both legal or illegal changing British culture and traditions",
        "additional_details": "Over the past decade we have seen an number of our British traditions, cultures, views and beliefs either knocked down or stopped completely because of foreign immigrants both legal and illegal taking offence. For example the nursery song 'baa baa black sheep' is now discouraged. The children's cartoon 'Peppa Pig' is receiving huge criticism because it offends a certain religion. Our historic churches are being demolished and replaced with eastern Mosques. It's even to to the extent where Muslims are trying to enforce Shaira Law within some parts of London. It's only a matter of time before the British people are a minority and we need to stop things NOW.\r\n\r\nSo I propose that if anybody who is an immigrant weather legal or illegal is found complaining about our British Heritage should face a fair legal trial and face being sent back to wherever they came from.
