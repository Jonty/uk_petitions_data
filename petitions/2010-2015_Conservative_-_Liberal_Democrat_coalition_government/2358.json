        "additional_details": "On the basis that there is no evidence that there have been any benefits related to its existence despite significant cost, the Government should abolish OFSTED immediately. Inspection of Schools and childcare should revert to Local Authorities with the benefit of their understanding of local circumstances. Local Authorities should not be inspected- that should be a matter for their electorates, as it is already for the National Government.\r\n\r\nThe Government should also remove as many other national education Quangos as possible with any necessary functions reverting to local control: e.g. National College for School Leadership, OFQual, The Training and Development Agency for Schools, Children's Workforce Development Council, Young People\u2019s Learning Agency, Specialist Schools and Academies Trust. Any money saved should be transferred to Local Authorities.",
