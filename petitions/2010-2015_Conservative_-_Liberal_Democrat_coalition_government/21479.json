The amount of time they work would be equivalent to the amount one person's basic unemployment payment would cover if it were the lowest hourly pay rate. This could be in supporting local charities or other activities agreed by the local authority and would still allow time for searching for paid employment. It would allow the person on benefit to feel they are still able to contribute and keep the person active and ready for work. It would give young people in particular in the cycle of work and give a feeling of self respect.\r\nAn alternative to attending courses that lead nowhere",
