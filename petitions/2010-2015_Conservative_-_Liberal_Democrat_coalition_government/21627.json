Fly-tipping!\r\n\r\nIt is the scourge of the British towns and countryside and in 09/10 there were 947,000 'incidents' in England and Wales that cost at least \u00a3100m, yet the rate of successful prosecution was just 0.25% !\r\n\r\nDEFRA, councils, police and CPS must be more aggressive in prosecuting offenders and fines must increase to cover the cost of cleanup, remediation and any direct economic loss suffered by a private business or landowner.",
