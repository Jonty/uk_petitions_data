        "additional_details": "The changes that the Coalition have made to the way higher education is funded will saddle the next generation with huge amounts of debt before they have even started work.\r\n\r\nThese changes were not voted for by anyone, and changes such as this were strongly campaigned against by the Liberal Democrats. They were also pushed through despite huge protest by young people and without sufficient debate.\r\n\r\nThis issue deserves proper and detailed debate in The House of Commons. Please sign this petition.\r\n\r\n",
