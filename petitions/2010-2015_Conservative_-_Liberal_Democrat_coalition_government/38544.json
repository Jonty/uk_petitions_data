This man briefed journalists with totally untrue information with regard to the behavior of Football fans who attended the F.A.Cup semi final Liverpool v Notts Forrest, 15/04/1989.  The Sun & the Daily Express carried the story, under the headline \"Police Accuse Drunken Fans\" and giving Patnick's views, saying he had told Margaret Thatcher, whilst escorting her on a tour of the grounds after the tragedy, of the \"mayhem caused by drunks\" and that policemen had told him that they were \"hampered, harassed, punched and kicked\".  This has been found to be a gross lie & totally untrue.",
