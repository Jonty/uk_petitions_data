        "additional_details": "It has been announced that, from 2012, the BBC will relinquish rights to cover over half of all Formula One Grands Prix to Sky Sports, a subscription service that many fans cannot afford and that many, including those who can afford it, are unwilling to subscribe to on moral grounds, given the recent goings-on in News Corp. It is imperative that all coverage remains on ad-free, free-to-air television on the BBC. This petition aims to create sufficient pressure for the new deal to be stopped in its tracks.",
