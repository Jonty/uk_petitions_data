Research suggests 15,000 people live with the disease in the UK. There are an estimated 5,000 new cases each year and it causes more deaths in the UK every year than ovarian cancer or leukaemia.\r\nDespite the bleak prospects for sufferers, the British Lung Foundation says there is a lack of support for patients and very little funding, or guidance on how to tackle the disease,\r\nDr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said IPF was \"a devastating disease that can affect adults of all ages\". \"In the UK, we are currently very ill-prepared to deal with the growing impact of IPF. The availability of treatments and support, consistency in the quality of care, investment in research \u2013 these are all areas in need of urgent improvement,\" ",
