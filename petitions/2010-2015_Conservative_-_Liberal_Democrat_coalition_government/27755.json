        "additional_details": "SOPA and PIPA represent two bills in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate respectively. SOPA is short for the \"Stop Online Piracy Act,\" and PIPA is an acronym for the \"Protect IP Act.\" (\"IP\" stands for \"intellectual property.\") In short, these bills are efforts to stop copyright infringement committed by foreign web sites, but, they do so in a way that actually infringes free expression while harming the Internet.\r\n\r\nThis petition proposes that the UK Government effectively lobby the US government to stop this bill as it will inevitably damage the internet as a whole and will not just be restricted to the US.",
