This would completely destroy vast areas of spectacular countryside.\r\nThey have set aside \u00a3500,000000 to bury lines at beauty spots around Britain. Therefore if cost is the only issue, considering National Grid have the money, then all future power lines through the countryside should go underground.\r\n\r\nThe government, in order to protect our green and pleasant land from capitalist organisations lining their pockets at our expense, need to make it law that all power lines through the countryside go underground.",
