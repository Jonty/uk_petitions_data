This includes moving money into other accounts, money made or in connection with their business. The CSA fails to work with other agencies, eg credit cards , banks, loans. mortgages, landlords, tax, national insurance, to track and secure monies owed, fueling child poverty. This has to be treated like fraud not like owing a couple of hundred on a catalogue bill.     ",
