        "additional_details": "Give first-time property buyers the option to cash in their company contribution pension schemes that traditionally lock the money away until retirement age. This will enable an entire generation of 20-30s to have enough money for a deposit for their first home. This is a more concrete and dependable retirement investment than an uncertain amount of money based on an uncertain financial future.\r\nThere is a whole generation of adults who never thought they would need a deposit with the 100%+ mortgage offers that were commonplace - so put their spare money into company contribution pension schemes instead. Giving them this money back as a deposit will stimulate the property market and kick-start a new channel of needed first-time buyers.",
