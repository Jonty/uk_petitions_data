        "additional_details": "We request the Government to change the Legislation of 2006 that disallows Children born in the UK from unmarried parents before 2006, of which one parent is of UK Citizenship, to gain UK Citizenship automatically as do Children born in UK of unmarried parents after 2006.\r\nIt is our unanimous feeling that this Legislation discriminates against those Children affected, as they have no choice as to what their parents have done or choose.  We also feel this Legislation discriminates against unmarried parents.\r\n\r\nWe believe a child born in UK with a parent of the UK who is living in the UK as is the child and has subsequently spent their life in the UK should be eligible to automatic UK Citizenship as do other UK born Citizens.\r\n",
