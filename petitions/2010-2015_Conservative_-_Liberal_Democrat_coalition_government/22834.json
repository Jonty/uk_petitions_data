        "additional_details": "  In the current economic climate, I feel like governments of past and present have failed to capitalise on what scientists have deemed to be a harmless drug. What I propose; Legalise cannabis use and, to an extent, cultivation.\r\n\r\n  It is clear through research that an above average number of people have tried cannabis in their life and a number of people used it occasionally. If the current laws were to be changed, companies could cultivate and distribute/sell cannabis in a similar way to cigarettes, which would make it heavily taxable.\r\n\r\n  This would in turn give the government extra funding and could use this extra source of \"income\" to relieve other taxes, such as fuel tax. The natural hemp can be used to produce paper or clothing, giving another boost to the economy through exports which in turn creates more jobs.\r\n\r\n  Health issues would be raised but I feel can also be used as an alternative painkiller for terminally ill patients if conventional drugs have no effect.",
