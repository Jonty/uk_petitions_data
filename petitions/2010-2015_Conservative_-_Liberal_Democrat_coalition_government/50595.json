I have faith that the UK justice system would be able to use this penalty responsibly, unlike some other shadowy regimes around the world. Why is the UK taxpayer paying to keep the likes of Peter Sutcliffe, Dennis Neilsen and Ian Huntley, to name a few, in protective custody?  They've admitted their terrible crimes and have been convicted to multiple life sentences, yet the very society that they repulsed, not to mention the victims families, are paying to keep them alive. The sort of care and security surrounding these individuals costs an inordinate amount of money annually and really, what's the point? What purpose do they serve for society?",
