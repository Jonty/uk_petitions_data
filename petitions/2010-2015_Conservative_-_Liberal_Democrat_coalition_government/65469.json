In the majority of cases, patients suffered moderate harm, but in 12 per cent of cases pharmacists believed their patient was severely harmed.\r\n\r\n\u25cf Pharmacists are spending an average of two working days a month ringing around manufacturers and wholesalers to get hold of out-of-stock medicines\r\n.\r\n\u25cf Typically, they have to wait three days for an emergency stock delivery.\r\n\r\n\u25cf Manufacturers are failing to meet government guidelines \u2013 which say that pharmacists should receive medicines within 24 hours of ordering \u2013 in at least six in every 10 cases.",
