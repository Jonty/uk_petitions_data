        "additional_details": "Almost every TV documentary these days features at some point a member of the public or a presenter talking to a tv camera whilst driving their car.\r\n\r\nSometimes the driver even turns to look at the camera instead of looking where they are driving.\r\n\r\nIronically this practice is especially common on programmes promoting road safety or with the police enforcing road traffic law.\r\n\r\nThere is no justification for this extremely dangerous practice which flies in the face of increasingly rigorous enforcement to stop the use of mobile phones whilst driving.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the practice of in-car filming and interviewing of people whilst driving on a public road should be banned.",
