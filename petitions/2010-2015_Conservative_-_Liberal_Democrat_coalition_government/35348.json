        "additional_details": "On the 25th of June 2012 David Cameron gave a keynote speech on proposed Conservative future thinking on the welfare state regarding benefits, the speech was not for this term of office and was a blatant misuse of public funds by the Conservative Party.  Mr Cameron was being paid by us to go to work today as the leader of the coalition Government. This is clearly not Coalition policy and the making of such speeches is a misuse of public funds.",
