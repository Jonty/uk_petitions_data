Money should be not taken into account!\r\n\r\nLet us return to the old-fashioned standards of yesteryear where LOVE is the only criteria for two people wishing to marry, one of whom is a non-eu citizen,\r\n\r\nLet the Government practise what they say and prove that marriage is one of the most important institutions we have got!",
