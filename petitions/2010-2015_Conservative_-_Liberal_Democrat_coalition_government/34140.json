        "additional_details": "The amount of tax paid (Income Tax, VAT etc) by a normal household in the UK is at a very high level especially for individuals and families that have mortgage to pay as well.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to request Her Majesty's Treasury departmet to allow Interests on mortgages to be tax deductible for the their main home. Buying a house is a long term investment for a family and mortgage constitute a substantial outgoing and hence the interest must be tax deductible.\r\n\r\nThis tax relief is given to landlords for rental properties, Interests on Loan to Businesses etc - we request that this should be extended to Individual and families too.  This will immensely help families.",
