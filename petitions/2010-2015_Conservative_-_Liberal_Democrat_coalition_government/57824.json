        "additional_details": "Labour introduced a very unfair method of taxation that the Coalition conveniently ignored to reform. From \u00a3100,000 of earnings, \u00a31 of personal allowance is lost for every \u00a32 earned, which results in double taxation. With a \u00a310,000 allowance, this means an effective 60% tax band exists in Britain between \u00a3100,000 and \u00a3120,000. As Allowance is raised, the band is growing. As 40% band is accordingly lowered, the ones in the band are hit by doube whammy. Let's reform this ridiculous double taxation.",
