Surely, this country does not expect its immigrants to pass on its history, culture and traditions over its born and bred citizens with ancestral footprints behind them? Theresa May, do you know what percentage of the population identified themselves as Sikhs in 2009? Without asking one of your advisors, probably not.\r\n\r\nActions:\r\n1. Make the 'Life in the UK' test a compulsory exam during 'Citizenship' in all secondary schools\r\n\r\n2. All UK citizens intending on standing for public office have to pass a compulsory 'Life in the UK' test.",
