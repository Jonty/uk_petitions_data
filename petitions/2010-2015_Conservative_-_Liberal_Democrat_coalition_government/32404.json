        "additional_details": "The Home Office announced on 1st April 2012 that it proposes a new law that will allow the government to intercept all phone, text, email and web communications of anyone it wishes without suspicion and sometimes without even getting a court's approval (warrant).\r\n\r\nThis is an unacceptable invasion of a citizen's right to privacy. The last government tried to do the same but had to back down in the face of mass criticism. At the time, the current parties in government led the outcry. Now it seems they have not learnt the lessons.\r\n\r\nThe government should swiftly move to scrap this invasive proposal which, as David Davis MP points out, is not even required as current laws are enough to deal with the real threats.
