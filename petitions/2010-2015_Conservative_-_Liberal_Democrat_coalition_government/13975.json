        "additional_details": "The NHS Management Service revealed there were over 150 reported physical assaults on healthcare staff per day in 2009/10, which is 56,718 assaults in England. Frontline workers are particularly at risk of suffering violence. It is the view of the petitioners that the government could reverse this appalling situation by insisting perpetrators of all violent offences against NHS staff are prosecuted in most and more cases for their gratuitous behaviour.",
