        "additional_details": "Following the flawed blanket ban of all pistols in 1997, we ask that The Home Office should consider reclassifying .22 Pistols as Section 1 firearms.\r\n\r\nDuring the Olympics, it has been highlighted that Team GB were not well-represented in pistol disciplines.\r\nThis is because bad, knee-jerk legislation has rendered these disciplines impossible to train for and compete in, within Great Britain.\r\n.22 rimfire pistols are not the criminal's choice of firearm and the perceived danger to the public is purely fictional.\r\nCurrently, there is no legacy for shooting sports following the games, despite one Gold medal.\r\nIf there is to be a legacy for shooting after the London Olympics, let it be a lifting of the ban on .22 pistols for target use. Therefore allowing a future generation of Team GB shooters to train and thus compete against the World on an even footing.",
