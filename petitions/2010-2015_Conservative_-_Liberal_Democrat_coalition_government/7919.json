Rather than opperating a system that sources the cheapest product or allowing individual staff to make decisions in organisations such as the health service benefiting foreign companies.\r\n\r\nAs someone who has worked in British manufacturing for sometime with people in similar roles from various industries I have seen first hand the frustration caused.  In times of economic uncertanty foreign organisation and governements will reduce the amount of foreign goods they purchase where as from what I have seen organisation such as the NHS reduce the amount of domestic goods they purchase in favour of products from manufcaturing countries with lower standards and prices.",
