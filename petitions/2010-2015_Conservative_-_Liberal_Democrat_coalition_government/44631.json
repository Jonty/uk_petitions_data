Care homes would introduce more rigorous staff checks prior to employing staff, if they were made legally responsible for abuse taking place on their premises. Help protect our vulnerable, we request that:\r\n\r\nExisting legislation is amended to make a corporate body guilty of an offence if the way in which its activities are managed by its board or senior management neglects or is a substantial element in the existence and/or possibility of abuse or neglect\r\n\r\nOffences should be punishable by unlimited fines, remedial orders and publicity orders.\r\n\r\nThose with relevant information about suspected abuse or neglect must supply information to Adult Safeguarding Boards if requested to do so.\r\n\r\nFamily/persons responsible for admitting a vulnerable person into a care home should have any previous/current investigations into abuse disclosed to them, in order to make an informed decision.\r\n",
