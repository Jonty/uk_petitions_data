        "additional_details": "The current system of final salary pensions for public sector employees is grossly unfair and unaffordable, the government should do more than just saying that most people in the private sector would love to have a public sector pension, the government should withdraw its current generous offer as a start and lay bare the precise facts about the pensions of those in the private sector, both in manufacturing and service industries, who are the wealth creators and who finance the public sector and the many important services it provides, finally, the pension age for public sector workers should be identical to what it is now and wil be in the future for private sector workers. No one forced public sector workers into taking any job in the sector, few probably knew how generous the pension arrangements were at the time, before they strike on the 30th November 2011 they should think twice about just how good their pension arrangements currently are and vote against any strikes!",
