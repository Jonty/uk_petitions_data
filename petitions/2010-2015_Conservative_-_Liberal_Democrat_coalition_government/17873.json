        "additional_details": "The government to cease using the Liverpool Care Pathway to rid themselves of the countries Pensioners. LCP was designed for terminally ill patients, NOT TO KILL OFF ELDERLY PEOPLE. When the elderly are admitted into Hospital, the Doctors quickly sedate the patient and is then placed on the LCP without informing the patient or relatives, this is to ensure their death, by withdrawing all fluids,food and medication. When the relatives realise what is happening it is too late, damage has been done and the patient dies. We petition the Government to make it illegal for any hospital,doctor, nurse or care home to place any patient on the LCP who has not agreed/or who's relatives have also not agreed for them to die this way. At the moment over 20,000 Elderly people have died in this country. ",
