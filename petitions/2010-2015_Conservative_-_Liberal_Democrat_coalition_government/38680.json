        "additional_details": "The two unitary authorities Cheshire East and Cheshire West/Chester were created in 2009 against the wishes of the people expressed in a referendum where they voted for no change as preference #1 and one single authority as preference #2. The option chosen by the Labour Government ignored these wishes. Because Cheshire East is wasting tax payers money so profusely without punishment of the perpetrators, it is time for the present government to abolish it along with Cheshire West/Cheshire and reinstate the previous authorities. All reinstatement costs must be borne personally by those who authorised the 2009 changes, not the taxpayer. ",
