        "additional_details": "The Driver Cpc European Legislation - EU Directive 2003/59.\r\nHas been introduced to enhance driver knowledge and improve safety in the Transport Industry.With the deadline to complete the first set of 35 Hours of periodic training less than a year away there is still doubt in the industry with regards the validity of the legislation. The belief is that it will go away, The fines and reprimands to come are not publicly known, so to that end there needs to be a Government lead advertising 'call to action' campaign introduced. this will build awareness and keep the Transport industry running smoothly.The driver Cpc is not going away and is not to be ignored, So there needs to be a similar initiative to the road safety type campaign",
