        "additional_details": "The European Union was first created as a single market\r\nThis has lead to the cripling disaster of the Eurozone.\r\nNow the continent believes that we cannot have a prosperous single market without having political union.\r\nThis is resulting in the theft of British sovereinty and right to self determination and is turning the EU into an oppresive federal super state ruled over by Germany.\r\n\r\nAs such Britain can no longer decide anything without approval from the EU. Therefore I urge the Government to withdraw from the political slavery of the EU and to honour what the EU was designed to do - to make trading easier. the EU is killing Freedom and the Government must take action now if our liberty and democracy is to survive the onslaught of the EU which is intent on controlling every aspect of our lives.",
