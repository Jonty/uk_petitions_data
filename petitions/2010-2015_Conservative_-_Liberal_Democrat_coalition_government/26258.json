        "action": "Prevent train companies increasing rail fares unless they meet targets at commuter times",
        "additional_details": "Currently train companies massage their punctuality and reliability figures to always keep them above the current 98% targets by including trains that run at all times of the day and night - including those that have no, or virtually no, passengers. However at commuter times these trains are delayed or cancelled a staggering 50% of the time (based on personal experience).  In addition to this the train companies propose to increase prices by an average of 6% in January.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is that unless they can meet targets of 95% punctuality and reliability at commuter times (so approximately 7am to 9am, and 5pm to 7pm) then they should not be allowed to increase ticket prices at all.  As currently they are unable to justify the increases due to their poor performance at times when it actually matters.  Likely this will require direct legislation or amendment of a current act of parliament.",
