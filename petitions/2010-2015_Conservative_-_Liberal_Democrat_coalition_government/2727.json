Companies could engage the employment of prisoners, at a lower cost, for better export competition.Prisoners would gain a work ethic, and could 'buy' a [reasonable] reduction in their sentence for good performance; in short and as in life generally, harder working prisoners see a better return for their efforts. Victims could also receive a proportion of the wages in compensation.",
