        "additional_details": "Wilshaw and Gove continually undermine teachers.  Their expectations are unrealistic and are leading to stress and teacher drop out. Young talented dedicated  teachers are leaving to move into less stressful and more lucrative jobs.  Let's see how they get on teaching in inner city high schools. Maybe then they will revise their policies and make teaching an attractive and respected profession.   ",
