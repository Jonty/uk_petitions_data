        "additional_details": "I think it is unacceptable that we add vat to the charge for essential veterinary treatment for pets.\r\nMy dog recently had an operation on his leg. The vat on the invoice was \u00a3300.  As a pet owner, I accept there is vat on pet foods, and have no problem with this. However, I believe that essential veterinary treament should be zero rated, or at most 5%. This would enable more people to afford veterinary treatment for their pets, and reduce suffering.\r\nI hope all animal lovers will support this petition.",
