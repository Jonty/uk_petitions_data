It is in danger of being taken over by superstore Tesco.We are slowly loosing a wonderful independent business community and if we lose that, we erode away at England\u2019s unique identity.\r\nIndependent shops and public houses are the lifeblood of England\u2019s local economy.  Money spent at our independent shops and public houses stays in the communities because it is recycled locally. Research shows that money spent in independent shops and public houses circulates on average three times within a local community, where as money spent in national or international chains leaves our local economy quicker.\r\nSave this 17th century Inn. It is part of Norfolk's history and it is Inns such as these that give England its identity.",
