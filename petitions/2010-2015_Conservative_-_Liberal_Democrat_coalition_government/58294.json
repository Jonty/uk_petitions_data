        "additional_details": "\r\nNational surveys in England suggest about 3 in 10 2-15 year olds are overweight - while a staggering 20% are obese. Obesity has been linked to serious illnesses during childhood and an increased risk of developing conditions such as type 2 diabetes, asthma and breathing difficulties during sleep. Why would you put your child at risk of these potentially life threatening illnesses? Bullying is also a major issue with obese children as a bully doesn't need to know the child to get through to them - one look is enough to start years of harassment and pain.\r\nWe know the side effects of obesity yet in 2009 nearly 4000 children needed hospital treatment for problems complicated by obesity compared to just 872 in 2000.\r\nThe government needs to act upon this by prosecuting   parents for allowing their children to become obese as it is become an increasingly worse issue among the youth of today.
