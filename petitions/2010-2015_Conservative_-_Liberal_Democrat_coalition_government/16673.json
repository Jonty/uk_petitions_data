        "action": "Raising Standards of Nursing",
        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the introduction of a vocational i.e. non-degree qualification in nursing which would be vocational, practial and it would be primarily ward based.  If a nurse passed this qualification and had shown an acumen for further training then they could be put on a part-time degree course, but they would still have to work in a local hospital.  It is hoped that this would raise standards of care for all patients in hospitals, and result in those nurses who have the acumen and the caring mentality for this worthy career being offered every incentive and help to develop a career.",
