And I also believe that there are millions of us in this country who have the same thought.\r\nHowever, unless we get the government to discuss this and let them know of our feelings, nothing will be done.\r\nToo many youngsters carry weapons and aren't bothered because they will be free in 6 or 7 years time.\r\nToo many people are being killed and justice isn't being seen to be done.\r\nPlease sign the petition , 100,000 signatures are needed to get the government to discuss it. Dont just think about it, make your voice heard and hopefully this will be a better place to live in. Thank you ",
