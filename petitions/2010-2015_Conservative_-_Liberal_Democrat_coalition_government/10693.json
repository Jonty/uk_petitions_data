        "additional_details": "We the undersigned think that there should be an independent review on the rules concerning who is allowed to serve as an MP. Specific points that should be included within this review are whether or not a person who has been found guilty of crimes such as fraud, corruption, deception and theft should be allowed to serve as an MP. Further, if these crimes occur during their tenure, this should result in an automatic and immediate sacking with loss of all pension benefits and any honours (eg. Knighthoods, CBEs etc.) that were accrued whilst acting as an MP.",
