        "additional_details": "In Sweden parents can take 480 days (16 months) at 77.6% of their salary. The 16 months can be split between the mother and the father and the parental leave can be taken at any time up until the child is 8 or finishes their first year of school which ever is latest.\r\n\r\nCurrently in the UK maternity leave is  39 weeks paid (6 weeks at 90% of full pay and remainder at a flat rate of \u00a3136.78)\r\n\r\nPaternity leave is 2 weeks at a flat rate of \u00a3136.78 and up to 26 weeks\u2019 paid Additional Paternity Leave - but only if the mother returns to work.\r\n\r\nThe current UK leave forces parents to take leave immediately, makes families financially struggle and provides better leave for the mother (33 weeks additional leave at \u00a3136.78 compared with 26 weeks for the father).\r\n\r\nI am asking the government to change parental leave to Sweden's policy as families need flexibility and need to be able to make choices regarding childcare.",
