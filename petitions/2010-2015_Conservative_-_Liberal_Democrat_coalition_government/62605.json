        "additional_details": "I believe that any sanctions against russia will have a negative effect on the uk. This in turn will show that we need energy security more than ever that is not reliant on Russian Gas imports .This will then be strengthening the uk governments push for fracking and will virtually be giving all schemes the green light based on national energy security. Convenient that you have the potential to create and solve a problem?\r\nMr Hague you still have far more problems at home before you start foraying overseas, we have a country that wants to leave us or are we going to send in our army to protect all the the english in scotland that want to stay in the union?\r\nStay out of russia we are Sick Of conflict",
