        "additional_details": "For over a decade Mr Vance Miller's company advertises to sell and specialise in high quality fitted kitchens.The advert states that he aim's to supply nothing but the best quality fitted kitchens available at the best prices in the UK and claim that cheap kitchens can be high quality.He also's claim's to sell kitchens made from real wood for less than its competitors can sell you a chipboard kitchen,and their supply is from MFI and liquidated stock.His customers disagree and claim that under the The supply of Goods Act 1982 they have been sold damaged, missing, faulty goods.They claim to be deliberately misrepresented the truth and were duped by his false advertising and that he is guilty of failing to supply a kitchen in an acceptable standard and quality far below which his salesman promised.The public want the government to shut him down,all his assets and profit from fraud ceased, and customers compensated.",
