This will encourage people to care more about their health and in the same time it will reduce the amount of money NHS spends every year treating people who neglect their health.\r\nSome private health insurance companies already have a similar scheme in place (members receive points every time they go to the gym, buy organic/light food, exercise, etc.) which helps people reduce their insurance premium and it's been proven very popular.",
