        "additional_details": "Existing towns and cities are very expensive to live in. Parking and traffic can be horrific when trying to get to work for 9:00am. The centre is often crowded at weekends, and during special events. Sign this petition to charter a new, affordable, convenient place to work and live. The new town will contain amenities such as a prison, airport, power plant, rail terminal and ship yard to keep prices down, but provide employment. However, it will be designed around functionality and pragmatism. Homes will be scattered within close distance of the workplace and commercial areas minimising travel time.",
