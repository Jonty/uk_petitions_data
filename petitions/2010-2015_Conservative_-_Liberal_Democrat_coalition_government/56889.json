I feel that a conviction for murder is wrong in this instance because the marine in question was engaged in a war with an enemy that was not operating within the Geneva convention and his actions were those of an individual or a leader of a group of individuals who found themselves in an exceptional situation surrounded by hostile insurgents and mercenaries. The marine known as Marine A should be found not guity of murder and released.",
