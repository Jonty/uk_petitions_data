        "additional_details": "There have been far too many incidents* of attacks by use of air-weapons (pistols and rifles) against people, pets, livestock and wildlife, resulting in horrific injuries and fatalities. These weapons are too widely available and all too easily obtained. Culprits are rarely, if ever, apprehended. Enough is enough. There can be no place in our society for such weapons. We the undersigned call for a total ban on the manufacture, sale, ownership and public possession of ALL air-guns.\r\n\r\n* see Gun Control Network website",
