Unless it is a media photographer who has a licence or the person has been given permission to photograph the child, it should be illegal to do so without consent! The photography of children in public without consent by stranger is EXTREMELY dangerous as they could privately share what the child looks like and share what location they were at and who with, then target them for child trafficking or some form of pedophilia. Even if the person photoshops the child's face onto a photograph of a naked woman's body for their own pleasure this is sick and wrong and shouldn't be facilitated in the first place! Change the law! No consent = No photographing. Protect our children instead of protecting the criminals!! ",
