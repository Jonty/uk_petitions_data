        "additional_details": "Currently, the NHS only supplies new digital hearing aids and are phasing out analogue hearing aids. The new digital aids do not suit every user, despite the ability to mimic analogue aids. It has left a large number of dissatisfied hearing aid users whose daily lives are severely affected, this affects schooling, work and mental health. We want the right to chose analogue or digital and not have the right to chose taken away. Let the service users decide.",
