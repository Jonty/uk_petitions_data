        "action": "Reinforce national grid and incentivise energy storage for future renewable energy.",
        "additional_details": "Renewable energy generation can provide reliable and predictable energy supply just like nuclear, etc. It just requires energy storage.\r\n\r\nIn my job I see wind turbines dumping free energy because grid does not manage the variability of wind. Wind power is penalised due to insufficient energy storage. Energy security of the UK demands change.\r\n\r\nFuture wind farms on the grid need energy storage - otherwise when its windy the electricity price drops meaning wind energy is penalised exactly when most productive. Energy storage avoids this.\r\n\r\nNational grid must accomodate more wind energy, not curtail it. Transmission lines need to be of sufficient capacity for the windfarms attached and huge energy storage should be incentivised. Pumped hydro is tried and tested method. Other storage methods should be encouraged.",
