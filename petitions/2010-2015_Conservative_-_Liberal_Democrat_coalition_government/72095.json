        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call on the government to abolish all animal testing.\r\n\r\nTesting on animals is unrevealing and leads both to useful treatments being disregarded (as they are harmful to animals) and other treatments being approved (as they are therapeutic in animals) only to later cause human fatalities.\r\n\r\nMany medicines safe for humans are unsafe for animals. E.g. aspirin is poisonous to cats, penicillin is toxic to guinea pigs.\r\n\r\n9 out of 10 drugs fail human clinical trials after appearing effective in animal trials.\r\n\r\nMore than 10,000 people die each year in the UK due to adverse reactions and side-effects to prescription drugs. That figure is 100,000 in the US.\r\n\r\nThere are more reliable methods available to be used for pharmaceutical testing such as using human cells and tissues.\r\n\r\nWe urge the government to end this pointless cruelty to animals and encourage the more effective non animal related research.",
