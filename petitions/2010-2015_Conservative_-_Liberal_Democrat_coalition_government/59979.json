We have put up with having waste food and produce sit in the summer heat for 2 weeks at a time creating maggots and flies.There has also been an increase in cats, fox's and other animals trying to scavenge through the waste due to the stench. We feel that this is not hygienic and not in our best interests. We would like you to review and reinstate our weekly collections with immediate effect.",
