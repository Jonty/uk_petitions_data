        "additional_details": "Two women a week are murdered in the UK by a partner or former partner. Yet the term \"Domestic Abuse Murder\" is never mentioned by the police or media.  Instead these tragedies are referred to as \"isolated incidents\" and \"domestics\".  This is inacurate, dismissive and offensive to the vitims and their families.  We will not be able to tackle the problem of Domestic Abuse Murder until the police and media are willing to acknowledge what they are dealing with.  Sign this petition to end the denial of Domestic Abuse Murder.",
