        "additional_details": "The UK must scrap the Communications Data Bill to preserve internet freedom. It does not discriminate between the innocent and criminals. It is a colossal waste of money to ISPs.\r\n\r\nThis witch hunt has gone on far too long, and it's gone too far this time.\r\n\r\nNot only does it infringe on any sense of freedom, it is completely ineffective on a fundamental level. Encrypting data is incredibly simple, would-be criminals will encrypt their data - it would be impossible for the government to decode it.\r\n\r\nThe government has no idea whatsoever on technology. They are hugely out of touch. They don't have a clue of the inner workings, how easy the whole thing is to circumvent.\r\n\r\nIn this country, we are supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. This bill allows government to monitor us all as they would criminals. They are taking away our right to innocence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It's more like something I would expect from the Iranians or the Chinese, frankly.\" - Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales",
