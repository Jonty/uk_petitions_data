        "additional_details": "The SS Richard Montgomery is a WW2 Liberty Ship which sank in the Thames Estuary in 1944. It still contains approx 3000 tons of weaponry and 1400 tons of TNT. Its condition is deteriorating and if an explosion happens it will cause massive damage to nearby towns and possibly a tidal wave which will affect London. My petition is that finances be allocated to deal with this and other sunken vessels which contain hazardous materials, including phosphorous and gas agents. ",
