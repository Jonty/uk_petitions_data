        "additional_details": "It seems that to the BBC, British Asians only means South Asians (people of Indian/Pakistani origins).\r\nThis is most obvious in the programmes of the Asian Network. It only promotes issues and people with links to India and Pakistan or Bangladesh.\r\n\r\nIf you go the site, you can see what I mean. They are full of 'Indian events'.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/asiannetwork/events/\r\n\r\nThis is an insult to other communities who did not dare to speak up, including Chinese and Vietnamese groups.\r\n\r\nThe BBC Asian Network should stop this bias against other Asian communities or it should be renamed as \u2018Indian Network\u2019.\r\n",
