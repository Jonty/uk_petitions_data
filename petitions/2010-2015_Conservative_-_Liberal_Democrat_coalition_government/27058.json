        "additional_details": "This petition is for members of the public who are victims of crime and have been let down with the Justice System and one or all it's agencies. The law as it stands allows the victim no recourse other than to ask the Attorney General to look at the sentence - if one is passed and ask him to appeal an unduly lenient sentence. If you buy a pair of shoes and they are faulty you have more legal rights than you do if your loved one is brutally murdered, in 2012 this cannot be a fair and just system. When Judges undermine other Judges how can we trust in this broken system?  We victims of murder manslaughter want an appeal system same as the Criminal Cases Review commision so we too can have recourse when things have gone wrong.  The CPS and Police are not always right and has failed too many victims.\r\nMurderers are being released early by getting wrong sentences, due to the truth not being told in courts of law.\r\n\r\n",
