In this modern society for many people in the UK religion is considered a very minor part of their lives and most atheists do not interfere with religious practices. Primary schools cater for Catholic, C of E, Muslim, Jewish and other organised religious orders. The same seclusions should be a choice for an atheist, to ensure their progeny are not told contradictory information than what they are taught at home using empirical facts rather than metaphysical presuppositions. If you're an Atheist for God's sake tell people! ",
