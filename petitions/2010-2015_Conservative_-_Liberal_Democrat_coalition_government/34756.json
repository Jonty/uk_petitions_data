        "additional_details": "I want the Government to agree with Elizabeth Truss, MP for South West Norfolk and bring forward a bill to de regulate Childminders thus making childcare more affordable to parents. This will also ensure that a childminders time is spent looking after the children in their care and not wasting time doing unnecessary paperwork. Childminders are finding it more and more difficult to do their job due to \"teacher style\" education imposed on them. We are not trained as teachers and should not be expected to take on this role. When parents look for childminders their main aim is to ensure that their children are well looked after and cared for. They are not looking for a teacher. All they want is a \"home from home scenario\". A loving and caring environment where they know that their child/ren is/are happy. ",
