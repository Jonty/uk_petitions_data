        "additional_details": "There are British people having to wait many years for council housing, having to live in over crowded conditions, while immigrants can come here,not even as an asylum seeker,and be allocated a council property. Why is this? I see increasing numbers of families from countries such as Romania,Somalia,Pakistan occupying council housing in my city over the past few years. It seems they are made priority over our own people. Why do they even have a right to housing when our own people have to continue living in cramped conditions because they can't afford to buy or rent a property,plus there being lack of housing to go round anyway.Sign the petition to put a stop to this and have our own people made priority and be at the front of the waiting lists.",
