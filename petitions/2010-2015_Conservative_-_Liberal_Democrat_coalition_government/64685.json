        "additional_details": "There is a current trend to about the responsibilities of dog owners, quite rightly, to clean up after their animals and to ensure that the general public are safe in the presence of pets.\r\nHowever, there are becoming more and more places that owners are not allowed to exercise their dogs.  Parks, beaches and the countryside either ban or restrict dogs to leads.\r\nPet owners would like to play with and exercise our pets.\r\nMy petition is to ask for all councils to provide safe pet exercise areas (whether this is in existing parks and beaches or new areas), where we will  not be victimised for enjoying our pets.",
