It should be repaid via the tax office.\r\nStudents should not be given loans, they should be paid fortnightly to stop 'students' receiving a lump sum and then not attending university. The amounts are then hardly ever recovered.\r\nPaying in a lump sum often means that drugs, alcohol and other purchases are made and the student then cant survive the semester out. Look at the Australian Student Allowance model. Any overpayments are recovered by Unemployment benefits or the tax office.",
