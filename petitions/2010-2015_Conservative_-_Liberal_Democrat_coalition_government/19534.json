In this economic time when petrol, food, energy, council tax and utility prices are at eye watering levels, the cost of running a car does not make life easier for people in the UK. Yet a car is now an essential part of peoples lives, surely as a LEGAL requirement there is no justification in the obscene over inflated prices these insurers are charging us. The government needs to intervene and make sure that all prices are fair and justifiable. \u00a32000 to insure an \u00a3800 car is but a prime example of these companies fleecing us out of money via legal blackmail!!",
