My idea is as follows:\r\n\r\n1) Reduce the Member of Parliaments base wage to \u00a340,000 per annum.\r\n2) Make the MP\u2019s office staff payed by the government directly rather than through the MP\u2019s expenses.\r\n3) MP\u2019s are no longer allowed to put a second home on expenses unless that second home is less in its upkeep cost than the travel to the Houses of Parliament.\r\n4) MP\u2019s can only claim a maximum expenses per annum equal to and no more than their annual wages.",
