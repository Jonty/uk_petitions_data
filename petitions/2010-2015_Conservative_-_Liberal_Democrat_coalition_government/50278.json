        "additional_details": "We the undersigned are unhappy the the planned closure and service cuts to children's centres in Hull. We believe that these services are invaluable to those who use them both on a regular and on a drop in basis. They offer low priced, affordable childcare, friendly play sessions for the under fives and friendly advice regarding parenting, budgeting and much much more. Many children as well as parents will lose much needed social interaction if these services are lost as they are often the only chance they have of interacting with children their own age and in the case of many parents a chance to speak to other parents, swap advice and make new friends. The staff work hard to make these centres a bright, happy, friendly place for children to learn through play, aswell as proving support for those families that need it.\r\n\r\nWe are asking the government to keep these services open and available for all parents and children of Hull.
