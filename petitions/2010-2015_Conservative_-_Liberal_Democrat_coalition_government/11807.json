        "additional_details": "An estimated 40-60% of the fish caught by fishermen in the North Sea are discarded back into the ocean dead.\r\n\r\nThis is because the current Common Fisheries Policy enforces a quota (intended to protect fish stocks) sets a limit on how many fish should be caught. Fishermen can\u2019t land any fish over that quota so the vast amounts that are caught accidentally are thrown back in to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe European Commission have published proposals for reform of the Common Fisheries Policy which recommends a discard ban.  At the moment, this is only a proposal. This petition calls on the Government to unequivocally commit to a discard ban and to lobby for its enshrining in EU law.\r\n",
