        "additional_details": "The government needs to crackdown on employers abuse of probation periods.\r\nSo many employers now hire new staff, put them on probation and then sack them at the end of it with no intention to keep them in the first place.\r\nManagers do this for a variety of reasons (ie) to get emergency staff for busy periods (eg) Christmas.\r\nTo avoid paying sick pay and holiday pay.\r\nThey can also not give any reason for sacking you, leaving the employee with a difficult situation in future interviews about why they left thier last job.\r\nThe government should either force companies to give reasons for termination of employment during probation.\r\nGive employees right to file for unfair dismissal during probation if they can prove thier manager never intended to hire them at all.\r\nOr scrap probation periods altogether.\r\nStop managers abusing the use of probation periods.",
