I am from South Ayrshire, Scotland, and I have heard the worst horror stories about Camhs and about how useless they are, all I ask is for the trial and error system the workers use to be changed to something that helps us young people, I've found that certain branches of camhs are less helpful than others, but in a whole, I say camhs create more problems than they fix! I have tried to contact the government but I have found no other way than a petition, so this petition is to fix the faulty system that camhs use to help young people!",
