I got diagnosed when I was 15 even when my school found out they still did nothing to support me. At 16 I was forced to leave due to bullying by both fellow pupils and teachers. I moved from Wishaw where I resided back to Glasgow and got into a training course I still receive no support and am ridiculed by colleagues and employer. I can't stand and watch that happen to others with Autism or Aspergers I just wish for something to be done and other people not to suffer the way I did. ",
