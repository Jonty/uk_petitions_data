        "additional_details": "We the undersigned request consideration of reducing the processing time for Tier 1 (General) visa extensions.\r\nDuring the latter half of 2012 onwards, it was noted that the processing times were largely in excess of the 4-week processing time for 90% of applications quoted on the UKBA website (accessed 10/01/2013).\r\nSee http://www.trackitt.com/uk-immigration-trackers/tier-1-general-extension - days lapsed from the application having been filed are often upwards of 90 days, with application pending. Before May 2012, applications were decided within the 4-week period. See also: http://www.immigrationboards.com/viewtopic.php?t=60577&sid=a0be4c2cc14844b972fe9cbb8f1c67d4\r\nReducing. the processing time of Tier 1 (General) visas may be achieved by, for example:\r\n\u2022\tHiring more staff\r\n\u2022\tOnline system for applications (current application form for main applicant alone is upwards of 60 pages).\r\n\u2022\tAccurate reporting on percentage of processed applications\r\nThank you for your consideration.\r\n",
