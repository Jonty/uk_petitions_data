In doing so, you would ensure that the next generation are privy to their desired avenues' of Academic success - helping thousands attain grades that they otherwise would have been deemed 'incapable of.'\r\n\r\nStudents should have the options of taking written or oral exams, with variations for each. One could decide whether to take multiple or single exams, for example.\r\n",
