Support for my son and others like him to achieve their goals and to move onto University. My son is 'Statement' has Dyspraxia and finds theory work difficult. He has completed the level 2 Games Development with a 'Merit' but has been thrown off the level 3 course due to the course being 90% theory, which he struggles with. He is being forced to take another course he has no interest in 'Retail.' He is unable to follow his ambitions because they do not hold a 'Practical Based course.' I am asking fo the government to support these students by bringing 'Practical Based' courses to our local college.\r\n ",
