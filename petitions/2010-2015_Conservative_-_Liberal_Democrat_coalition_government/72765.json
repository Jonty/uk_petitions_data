        "additional_details": "I think much more support and understanding is needed for pregnant women and post natally  with mental illness. Women who stop taking medication due to being pregnant need a significant amount of help and support. More research is needed on safe anti depressants to take during pregnancy and after care once the baby has arrived is essential. Mothers suffering from mental health problems should be allowed to have their significant other stay with them 24/7 whilst they are in hospital to give them extra support as midwives are simply too busy. Mothers with mental illness should also be reassured that breastfeeding is not always best and instead going back on any medication would be more suitable for both mother and her mental health and the wellbeing of their baby.",
