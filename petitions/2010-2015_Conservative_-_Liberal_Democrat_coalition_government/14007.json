However, on passing the driving test they are immediately allowed on a motorway with no experience. In many cases, they may never have even driven at more than 30 MPH.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the law to allow learner drivers in possession of a valid Provisional Driving Licence to be allowed to drive on a motorway under the supervision of a fully qualified DSA Approved Driving Instructor.",
