        "additional_details": "Introduce a new law to permit the courts to sentence convicted rioters and looters etc. to a caning or birching.\r\nThere is no effective punishment to deter children,  teenage girls or boys or older thugs from carrying outsickening mindless antisocial crimes.  At the moment they simply laugh at the current punishments handed out by the courts such as referral orders, suspended sentence, community orders.\r\nEveryone convicted of such crimes should automatically be sentenced to a caning, to be carried out immediatly on being convicted, and to report for further canings for those guilty of more serious thuggery. Repeat offending adults could be birched.\r\nChildren shouldn't be exempt, no matter how young, a caning will be a short sharp lesson they will remember to show them that society will not tolerate their behaviour. Their parents should be made to attend the caning to witness their shame.",
