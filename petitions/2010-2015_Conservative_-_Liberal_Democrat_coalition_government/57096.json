We propose a change to the definition in Part IV; Section 20 of the act to prevent a person or company from using of the terms 'architecture' and 'architectural' in relation to the practice of building design unless they are also entitiled to use the title 'architect' under the act.\r\nThis would avoid the public being mislead by building designers who are not architects such as 'architectural consultants', 'architectural designers' and firms that offer 'architecture' as a service with no architects employed.",
