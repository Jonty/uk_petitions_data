        "additional_details": "Duncan Ross is a visually impaired young man who was registered blind at birth.  He lives with his parents in rural Aberdeenshire and his only mode of independent transport is the local buses. He relies on the buses to get to and from Aberdeen to attend college and the North East Sensory Service. However since the new bus station at Union Square was built he has encountered several problems. There are no audio announcements to let him know when his bus is leaving and when he has asked staff for help they have been abusive to him..so much so that only a few weeks ago a member of staff swore at him and told him to see for himself. This has left Duncan feeling isolated and alone!  It has gotten so bad that Duncan has given up going to college and is working from home. The bus station refuses to do anything about this and say it costs too much money..even though they have a speaker system in place. I ask you to sign this petition to support Duncan.",
