        "additional_details": "For Many Years the Junction from Williambarefoot Drive going onto Green lane in London SE9  has always been dangerous, numerous car accidents have happened over the years and it continues to happen and nothing is done to protect drivers or pedestrians. There is no traffic control coming out onto green lane or turning into William-barefoot drive and not enough safe places to cross for Pedestrians.\r\n\r\nJust recently a dear friend of our community was injured whilst turning into the junction and was in Intensive Care Unit with serious head injuries and now we as a community feel something has to be done before it claims a life.\r\n\r\nWe as a community want the council and High ways to consider making massive safer changes to the Junction so no other family have to go thorough the same horrendous and life changing accident that has recently happened.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and share this petition to make it safer for everyone to use.\r\n",
