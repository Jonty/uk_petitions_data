Bringing back selection does not have to mean a mandatory condemnation to the horrors of the reviled Secondary Modern for those who don't get into a Grammar School. It doesn't work that way in Germany and it was never supposed to work that way in the UK. The UK government should try to get right what it couldn't the first time around. It should introduce a properly funded and sensitively crafted Tripartite system (http://tinyurl.com/3f7s7px) of Secondary education.",
