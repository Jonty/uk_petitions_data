        "additional_details": "These fines will arise out of organisational failures and are NOT the result of any detrimental activity by taxpayers, so taxpayers should NOT be required to pay the fines.  Managers or others who are highly paid for taking on the responsibility of providing ambulance services are the people who should be required to pay the fines.  If it is later proven that it is as a result of activity and imposition of impossible targets by government health ministers then it is they who should be required to pay up.  Reliance on the taxpayer, by taxpayer funded employees, for the consequences of failure in their professional responsibilities must be curtailed.",
