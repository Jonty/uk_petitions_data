        "additional_details": "Greenwich Council has decided to close the 311 year-old Blackheath Bluecoat School. Despite financial difficulty, the indisputable improvement in standards of pupil achievement and the quality of leadership and management since the inauguration of the Federation with Saint Cecilia\u2019s, Wandsworth in January 2009 is a source of great optimism for the future, and this proposal is therefore ill-timed. Since 2006, the number of pupils in Year 11 achieving 5+ A*-C grades including English and Maths has increased from 19% to just under 50%, the greatest increase of 17% having taken place in the past two years. This rate of improvement in the last year alone is twice as fast as the average for schools in the Greenwich area. Hence we are not a school that is failing to provide a satisfactory standard of education for our pupils, as confirmed in our OfSTED inspection report of June 2010. Please sign petition to stop the only Church of England school in the Borough of Greenwich from closing.",
