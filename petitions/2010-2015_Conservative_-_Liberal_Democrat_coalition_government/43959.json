Unfortunately it does happen that the property rented comes into disrepair. As soon as this is the case the Tenant MUST report the problem and MUST keep paying rent, no matter how long the problem takes to be resolved. The Landlord must repair the damage when it  is stated so in the Tenancy Agreement but can take all the time in the world to do so in case it is not a Health Hazard.\r\nI for one was living in a property for one year that was molded through and through and Landlord did not repair any leaks in the damp proofing. Council was of no help either due to the fact that Tenants have too few rights. The day I moved out they painted it over and now there is a family living there with newborn twins...\r\n\r\nThis has to change and Landlords must be given Timelines in which the most common faults must be repaired in by law.
