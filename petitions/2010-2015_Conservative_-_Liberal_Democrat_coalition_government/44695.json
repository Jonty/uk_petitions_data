In comparison scientific research and development budgets are minuscule yet consistently return advancements and the knock on effect of national growth.\r\n\r\nConsidering Britain\u2019s historic, long and leading role in the forefront of Science and Technology the loss of such a symbolic property through commercial sale would be shambolic, just going to highlighting the lack of regard scientific endeavour is held in current society .\r\n\r\nWhether the Government tries to encourage charitable donation or finds national funds, the loss of such a property can not be allowed to happen.\r\n",
