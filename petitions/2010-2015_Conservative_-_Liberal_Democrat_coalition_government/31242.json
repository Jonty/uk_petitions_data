        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition to help us fight against the lack of transport in rural areas/communities. Did you know that in rural Mid Devon alone, the number of bus routes have been more than halved in the last eighteen months? Lots of people have had to stop going to sport clubs or even major jobs because of the lack of buses. If there were more buses/trains then there would be far less emissions coming from cars and would therefore help restore the countryside's natural beauty. I would like the government to review this and then  invest in more transport for these areas.\r\nThank You.",
