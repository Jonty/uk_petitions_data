Because it took me so long to get there that by the time I was ready to go home there were no more trains. The last train to London left at about 7:30pm. My parents were very worried about me that night.\r\nI think that 7:30pm a bit early. London Rail is open until 1am.\r\nSo think the rest of the rail service should do the same. So people are less likely to get stuck.\r\nI was nearly stuck in Southend one night too (as the show I went to see finished late and last train left before midnight). But was lucky enough to catch the last train.\r\nBetter still could they not operate 24 hours? ",
