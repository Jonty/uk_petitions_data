It is not difficult.\r\n\r\nIn this way, customers will avoid unneccessary unauthorised overdraft and other fees.\r\n\r\nFor each statutory circuit meeting of Payments Council, and new Credit Reference Council, 12 members must be selected by local jury list.\r\nEach must be able to remove obstructive banking and credit members.\r\n",
