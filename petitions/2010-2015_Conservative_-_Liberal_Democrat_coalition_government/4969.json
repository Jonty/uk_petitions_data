        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the legalisation of all illegal drugs. The case for the legalisation of drugs is very strong and a quick Google search should be able to explain why action should be taken to legalise the sale, the manufacture and the consumption of illegal drugs. Here are however some of the arguments; 1) The prohibition of the consumption of narcotics is borderline fascist. 2) The prohibition of certain drugs is down to simply cultural reasons, 3) Economics. Milton Friedman one of the preeminent economists of the last century spells out the economic reasons for the legalisation of drugs here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLsCC0LZxkY There are downsides however but these can be outweighed by the positives and remembering individual responsibility.  As a result there needs to be a debate in parliament and perhaps a commission set up to look at the practicalities of the legalisation of drugs. ",
