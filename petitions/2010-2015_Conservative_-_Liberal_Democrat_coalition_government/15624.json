The motorist pays up to 500 pounds annual excise license, 20% VAT on servicing, annual compulsory MOT (45 pounds) and 5% on compulsory insurance not to mention tax payable on a new car. Not content with all this the Treasury then hits petrol with, excise duty, VAT and the accelerator. The government must reduce the rate to a single VAT tax of 20% would bring the cost to about 72 pence  a litre - the price it was 7 years ago.\r\n\r\n",
