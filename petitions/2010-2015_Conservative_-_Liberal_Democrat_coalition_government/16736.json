        "additional_details": "God save the Queen is a dated and irrelevant dirge that alienates those that don't believe in a God and/or the monarchy. Jerusalem is a much better reflection of our country, it's melody is more inspirational and the lyrics are written by one of our great revolutionary poets, William Blake. The only problem with this proposal is that the song is written about England and not Britain but we could always tweak the lyrics to reflect the later. After all we have to change the lyrics of our current anthem to suit the gender of monarch.",
