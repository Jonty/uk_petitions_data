        "additional_details": "The Chinese fur industry has a reputation for their treatment of animals when collecting fur from their \"fur farms\", doing this regularly involves the electrocution of animals, purposely bludgeoning them to death and also skinning animals while they are still alive of which they continue to live for up to 3 hours after this has happened.  If these activities took place in the UK they would be closed down, so we cannot continue to support this abroad, if fur is to be traded it should come from places of which the animals are treated humanely.
