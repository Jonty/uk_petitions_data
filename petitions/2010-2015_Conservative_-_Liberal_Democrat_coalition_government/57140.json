Six major ISPs have been ordered to block access to SolarMovie and TubePlus, two streaming portals with millions of regular visitors. The ruling comes after Hollywood studios filed a complaint that remained uncontested by the ISPs.\r\n\r\ntubeplusIn recent years the UK has become the easiest country in the world in which to have a website censored on copyright grounds.\r\n\r\nWith several successful court orders in hand it is now a mere formality to have a torrent site or streaming portal blocked under Section 97A of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act.",
