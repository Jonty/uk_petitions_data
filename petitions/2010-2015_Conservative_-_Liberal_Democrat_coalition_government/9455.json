        "additional_details": "Over the last 15-20 years the ability of teachers, the police, authorities and even parents to educate, discipline and control young children has been severely undermined and reduced. This has resulted in youths and young adults today with bad behaviour where there is no respect for others, no responsibility for their actions, no contribution to society, lack of morals and so on.\r\n\r\nWe need to reintroduce the National Service to further educate young adults involved with crime or with records of poor behaviour, etc in order to set them on the right path with purpose, responsibility, respect where they will have a proper future in society and instead of a bleak future.",
