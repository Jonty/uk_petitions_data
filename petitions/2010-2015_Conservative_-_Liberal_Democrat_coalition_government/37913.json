In 2008 UK Sport declared that only the Olympics and Paralympics would figure in its next seven year funded strategy steered by Baroness Sue Campbell therefore, she and her UK Sport Board decided Deaflympics would not feature in its plans and suddenly stopped funding UK Deaf Sport.\r\n\r\nApproximately \u00a3500000 is needed to send a squad of deaf athletes to Deaflympics 2013 hosted by Sofia, Bulgaria. We want the Government to financially support us in the same way they support the Olympic and Paralympic athletes.",
