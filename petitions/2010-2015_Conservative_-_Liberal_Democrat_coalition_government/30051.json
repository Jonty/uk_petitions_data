        "additional_details": "The House of Lords has been in action for many centuries without any of its members being elected. It is that that distinguishes it from the House of Commons. The country must keep its tradition and keeping the House of Lords in its present format - ideally with the repealing of the House of Lords Act 1999, resulting in the reintroduction of hereditary peers. This petition calls on the Government to reject the reforms of the House of Lords and to repeal the House of Lords Act 1999.",
