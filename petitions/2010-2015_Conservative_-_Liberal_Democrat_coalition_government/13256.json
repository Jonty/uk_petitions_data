I am one of many people who don\u2019t use the local library, so why should I have to pay towards its upkeep.\r\n\r\nMy e-patition is asking for a small rental charge to be put on all books and DVD\u2018s, for example 25p a book and 30p for a DVD, this would help subsidise the system and reduce the burden of higher council tax charges on the vast majority who do not use this facility.\r\n\r\nBooks should still be free for students and people over 65, but everybody else should pay a small fee to offset costs.
