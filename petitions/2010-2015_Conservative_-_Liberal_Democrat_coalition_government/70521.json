        "additional_details": "Currently, prescriptions are provided free to anyone over the age of 60. The public sector retirement age is 65, and increasing to 68. Lifespans are also increasing. Private sector workers can continue beyond that age.\r\n\r\nThis means that the taxpayer is contributing to prescriptions for people at the peak of their earnings, who do not need it, at a time when the NHS faces a shortfall.\r\n\r\nFree prescriptions should be provided to retired people, not simply anyone over the age of 60, with fair means testing for those with high volume needs.",
