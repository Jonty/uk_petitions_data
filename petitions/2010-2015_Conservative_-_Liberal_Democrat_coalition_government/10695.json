If people are able to work and claim JSA, they should be required to work a number of hours per week (equivalent to the minimum wage).\r\n\r\nWe all see things that could be worked on within a 5 minute walk from out front door.  This would bring a sense of community to all those involved in the task, a sense of pride in their achievements and a sense of community spirit that is lost in many today.",
