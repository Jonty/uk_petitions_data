There should be a training program for doctors to make sure they know everything about the rare disorders that their patients have, because some doctors guess at what you have and guess wrong, therefore putting you on the incorrect medication, treating you for something you don't have, and this could make whatever you have worse, so doctors should know more about the rare disorders and illnesses so that they can figure out cures! If doctors give you the wrong medication, it can make your health worse and give you bad side effects, so they should be sentenced for jeopardizing your health. This law should be called: The Rare Conditions Training Program. ",
