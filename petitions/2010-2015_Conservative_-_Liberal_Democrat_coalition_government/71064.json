        "additional_details": "Outwood Academy was sold to parents as a SUPER SCHOOL, offering opportunities we  could only have dreamt of whilst at school. However reality is painfully different, in the space of  weeks countless children have gone from a straight A students, to getting detentions and warnings over the smallest of things. When questioned the teachers answer is if we don't like it, remove our children, my own son was the victim of a robbery and I was refused the ability to speak to him or someone in charge. Children are refused meals, refused toilet breaks and this is just the tip of the iceberg.\r\n\r\nThis is not an isolated inncedent either, we have complaints from across the whole of the country regarding the way Outwood Academy and Outwood Grange Academy are treating our children.\r\n\r\nPlease help us make a difference and sign the petition today.\r\n\r\nAlso please like us on Facebook www.facebook.com/OutwoodAcademyShafton ",
