        "additional_details": "Julian Assange has been taking refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London now for over a year, in what has become an international stalemate with no resolution in sight.\r\n\r\nThe Telegraph newspaper estimates that the cost to the taxpayer of maintaining a 24 hour police presence over the site is about \u00a311,600 per day. After only a year we have accumulated costs of over \u00a34.2 million.\r\n\r\nThis costly situation has no end date and could potentially drag on for many years. As Mr Assange is currently an innocent man and yet to be found guilty of any crime in court, we ask that the government withdraw all police from the Ecuadorian Embassy without delay. In these austere times, when frontline services are being cut, this situation is unsustainable for the taxpayer and our government.",
