        "additional_details": "Modular 100 MWe Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors (LFTRs), built on factory production lines, cost \u00a3150 million each. 400 units will provide all of the UK\u2019s future electrical needs and meet our carbon targets for \u00a360 billion. This will save \u00a350 billion of the \u00a3110 billion allocated by the DECC to meet carbon targets and this can be accomplished in 2 to 3 decades. This enormous level of tax saving, currently targeted at subsidising inconsequential renewable, can then be spent on health, law and order, education and retirement.\r\n\r\nThe worldwide market for such units is tens of thousands and several UK companies have the capacity and expertise to be part of the supply chain. Manufacturing jobs, growth and prosperity not seen in 3 generations is possible. It will take a piddling \u00a3300 million of Government investment to get the first-of-a-kind LFTR built, to kick-start business and industrial interest and investment.\r\n",
