        "additional_details": "Family visits are a means of maintaining family links and of enabling family members living abroad to participate in important occasions in the UK such as births, weddings and funerals. Such visits and associated tourism also bring economic benefits to the UK.\r\n\r\nPlease oppose any proposal to remove the right of appeal against refusals of family visit visas especially in light of the poor record of entry clearance decisions at such appeals. It is necessary to retain independent oversight of visa application through the appeals system.\r\n\r\nThe availability of appeals is a vital check against the poor decision making that the UKBA is well aware of, from the reports of the Independent Chief Inspector. The removal of appeal rights allows poor decision making to go uncorrected, perpetuating unfairness and thereby weakening the rule of law.\r\n\r\n",
