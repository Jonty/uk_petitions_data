Stopping benefit payments to anybody who have not been a UK citizen for more than 5 years.\r\n2. Ensure the sum total of ALL benefits (housing, job seekers etc) received by an individual NEVER total more than the wages earned by a worker on minimum wage.\r\nThus ending the life style choice of those who are \"paid\" more not to work and choose not to do so as its financially better for them.",
