        "additional_details": "Education secretary Michael Gove, has thrown out literary genius in removing the world's classics such as Steinbeck's 'Of Mice and Men' from the school syllabus. Dismissing some of literatures greatest authors.\r\n\r\nAs an 18 year old English literature student having studied Steinbeck in my GCSEs I believe it was a valuable addition to my education, not only providing me with English skills but also an insight to American history. We study Shakespeare throughout secondary education and traditional English authors.\r\n\r\nShutting out international authors is a backwards step for education, threatening to further restrict teachers already imprisoned by the limits of the curriculum. We must not allow our current Education Secretary's views crush passion and inspiration.\r\n\r\nTell Michael Gove to keep the door open to the world.\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition. ",
