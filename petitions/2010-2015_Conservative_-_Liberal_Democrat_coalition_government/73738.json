        "additional_details": "It has been reported that survivors have asked the Home Secretary to convert the inquiry into a judge led inquiry or Royal Commission.\r\nThe inquiry has been in action for three months and have been engaging with survivors & there has been much progress by the current panel to date. 99% of surveyed survivors agreed to be champions for the panel of the inquiry. We are concerned that if the panel is disbanded at this time then there is no guarantee of another inquiry going ahead. We are promised nothing.\r\nWe are calling for the Home Secretary to listen to the majority view of survivors.\r\nWe ask for the current panel to continue its work & to be given full statutory powers.\r\nWe ask for transparency from the Home Office as to why the current panel members have been appointed.\r\nWe ask for survivor input to be considered at every stage.\r\nWe ask for the complete removal of the threat of the panel being disbanded at any time before the work is completed.\r\n",
