        "additional_details": "Currently, with the Gay Marriage consultation, the topic of homosexuality is becoming at the forefront of people's attention. However, still, within the education system, homosexuality lacks the support and accessible information students need and should receive to progress through school safely and securely.\r\n\r\nIf the Department of Education find it acceptable to send out copies of the King James Bible to schools (despite that Church and State should be separate) and showing students that the church is right, it should be a Government responsibility to also support the homosexual population for students.\r\n\r\nI therefore suggest that Government enforce law which makes it compulsory to teach and advise student about homosexuality, and promote equality, fairness and security within the education system for the minority.",
