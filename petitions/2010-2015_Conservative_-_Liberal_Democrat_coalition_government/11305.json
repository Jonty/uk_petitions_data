        "additional_details": "Single parent benefit incentivizes young girls to have children outside stable relationships. Announcing now that this benefit will be abolished in  5 years time (with the benefit to be reduced incrementally by 20% each year) will afford single parents plenty of time to put in place alternative arrangements and, at the same time, send a message to today's young girls that becoming a single parent is not something which the taxpayer will fund in future. Single parent numbers would collapse as a result and this would send a message to the markets that this country is serious about tackling the deficit and restoring sanity to our bloated benefit system. The resultant savings would allow us to implement VAT or other tax cuts which would kick start our economic fightback. ",
