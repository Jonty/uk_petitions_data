        "additional_details": "Administrators Deloitte's role in MG Rover's collapse resulted in a fine of \u00a314 million, it is only right that they be investigated for their role in the administration of Comet.\r\nDeloitte got \u00a315 million for their 'services', \u00a38 million of which is for their own.\r\nUnsecured creditors and customers were left out of pocket.\r\nThey made no real attempt to save the company.\r\nStaff were left claiming statutory redundancy at the cost to the tax payer in the millions while Deloitte made Comet's owners a sum of reportedly over \u00a354 million and a further sum of above \u00a320 million.\r\nDeloitte's apparent involvement from earlier in 2012 to help carry out test closures in the summer showed they had already had plans in place to close the business even though Comet were showing great signs of financial stability.\r\nIt is the goverment's responsibility to ensure that Deloitte is investigated to ensure that the tax payer does not have to foot the bill again for something that could have been avoided!!",
