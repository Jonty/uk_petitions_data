        "additional_details": "I have a 9 year old son in P5 , since he was 6, the school has pushed for a diagnosis of Aspergers. We eventually got diagnosis in P5 but by that point, we have been summoned to go on all school trips, & lunchtime duty. Since the diagnosis, which educational psychologist Stephen Kerr pushed for, we've found out he has nothing to do with him now & the classroom assistant isn't there anymore. My son is getting worse & we are the ones who have to try & control his behaviour at school, as well as in the house. Support teachers should be in his class, especially considering he is not the only pupil diagnosed with Aspergers, but it all comes down to funding. I want this petition to present to the education board that they also have a duty to educate, regardless.",
