        "additional_details": "Consumable alcohol (ethanol) causes more harm to it's user than other, already classified drugs in the UK. Alcoholics have an even higher dependance than many users of other already classified drugs have. It causes huge damage to the social structure in the UK. The cost of dealing with alcohol problems is immense, to law enforcement, health services and society as a whole. The Home Secretary is to suggest to the government to include ehtanol (alcohol) as a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The government is to discuss this proposal in parliament. Parliament is to vote on this issue. ",
