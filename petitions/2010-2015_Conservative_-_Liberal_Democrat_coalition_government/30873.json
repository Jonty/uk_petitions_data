Irregardless of race or religion, once caught and waiting for trial they should be kept under high security. i.e not allowed outside the courts for a cigarette when at court, they should be recorded 24/7 in case they boast about their activities.\r\nAt the moment, too many of these gangs who groom children and rape them seem to show no remorse when they appear in public. Some laugh and wave at cameras, these people are clearly beyond help.\r\nYet nothing is done to protect our children against them, why not? These are serious criminals, and should be treated as such irregardless of race or religion.",
