        "additional_details": "Most of the money currently being used in out of hours goes directly into the pockets of doctors or provider companies.  Take them out of the loop, keep the money inside the NHS, by funding more doctors and nurses in A&E departments and have much more money left over to provide medical treatments - especially, it would appear from reports, for foreign health tourists (which will please our prime minister immensely).",
