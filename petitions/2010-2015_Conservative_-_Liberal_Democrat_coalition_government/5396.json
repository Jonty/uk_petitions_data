        "additional_details": "There should be a limit on the number of children per family for whom child allowance is paid.  This would encourage the population to have smaller families and be more responsible towards the use of resources in society in general.  A limit of two children would help to stabilise the population and ease many of the problems with shortages.   The right to have large families needs to be sacrificed for the benefit of the nation as a whole.",
