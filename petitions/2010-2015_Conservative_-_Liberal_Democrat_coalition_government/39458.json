No.\r\n\r\nCan you imagine having to fly from Northern Ireland to England for your child to have Heart Surgery? We can't either.\r\n\r\nThink ofthe many babies that will be born with serious heart defects in Northern Ireland. Think of the many children that will end up dying on their way to England. Do not sit back and let this happen to families who did nothing to deserve such treatment! Use your voice and save lives!",
