Official Visits by the Royals & Government Officials to represent Britain to a country which currently in adverse relationships may deliver wrong, discrepancy messages, causing dismays to the public.\r\n\r\nRecent example: Parliamentarians were suffered VISAs Ban to China and Hong Kong by the China Embassy, but the FCO still planning Official Visit to China in late February 2015.\r\n\r\nWe opposed the forthcoming Official Visit by signing this petition, and we demand FCO:\r\n\r\n1. Define the definition of Official Visit, and drawing guidelines.\r\n\r\n2. Official Visits involved and planned by FCO should inform to the Parliament.\r\n\r\n3. Official Visits involved by FCO, which request public funding should be accessed and questioned by the Parliament members, and should be approved by the parliamentarians  by voting.\r\n",
