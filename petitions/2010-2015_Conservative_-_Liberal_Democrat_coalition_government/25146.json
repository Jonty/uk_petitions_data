        "additional_details": "Making the Cycling Proficiency Test a standard and maybe a cheap alternative to a driving test; where people can learn how to use the roads properly on a bicycle. This may reduce collisions, road rage and help to make the roads a safer place for Cyclists and Drivers alike.\r\n\r\nPeople driving on the road also struggle to comprehend what cyclists are doing when hand signalling, so I propose it becomes a requirement for people to take a cycling proficiency test and for the Driving tests to include a section about Cycling Awareness.",
