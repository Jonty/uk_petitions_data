        "additional_details": "Aneurin \"Nye\" Bevan is a truly unrecognised national hero. In creating the National Health Service as Clement Atlee's Secretary of Health, Bevan has undoubtedly shaped the safe and healthy Great Britain we see today. A statue in his honour should not be seen as a party-political issue but should be on by all sides of both houses, as with Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George. The bird-dung covered statue in Cardiff town centre is not enough to commemorate this great man's life.",
