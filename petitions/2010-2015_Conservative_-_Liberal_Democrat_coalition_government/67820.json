        "additional_details": "Can we negotiate with the French government to arrange for termination of the proposed sale of 2 Mistral Helicopter Carriers to the Russians? Giving the Russians amphibious capability at the current moment endangers the security of our allies and other non-aligned states.\r\nTo aid the cancellation of the contract could the UK along with other EU\\NATO countries assist the French in paying the compensation costs for cancelling the Russian order? For example the cost of the cancellation is born equally by France\\Germany\\UK but the UK and German governments each acquire a cheap helicopter carrier. The UK could then use a Mistral as a replacement for the soon to be retired HMS Argus and HMS Ocean.",
