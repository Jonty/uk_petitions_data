        "additional_details": "While some local authorites do collect plastics the majority of the nation does not. Recycling plastic is something an individual must undertake and most people don't.\r\nPlastic does not bio-degrade, it photo-degrades; it is broken down by sunlight over decades. With the majority of plastics ending up buried in landfills they cannot be broken down and simply sit in the ground. Plastics that end up in rivers, reservoirs and the sea are broken down by sunlight into a poisonous chemical soup which contaminates water sources and poisons wildlife.\r\nIf local authorites made a collection of plastic materials for recycling there would be less plastics ending up in landfills and less damage to the environment by the production of plastic goods.\r\nLocal authorites already made a collection of paper, metal, glass and garden waste and yet many do not yet collect and recyle what is one of the largest pollutant dangers to the environment.",
