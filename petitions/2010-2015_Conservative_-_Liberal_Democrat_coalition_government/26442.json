        "additional_details": "Race Relations Act 1976 & Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 do directly not address the issues of racial taunts in a public place - except under Section 28 of Crime & Disorder Act 1998 of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour in a public place. We need new legislation to ensure police take seriously racial taunts in actual daily life (like youths in parks making meaningless taunts to passerbys) & take appropriate action immediately to prevent such taunts escalating further. Using any taunts or insults (racial or otherwise) can SEVERLY affect a person\u2019s self-concept & cause distress, alarm, persecute the victim in the ACTUAL receiving end of such verbal & psychological abuse. What is regarded as racism depends on the context, intention, frequency & manner it was said. Racist terms used can range from jest/banter, carelessness, letting off steam, swearing to degrading prejudice, expressing disgust, as well as bullying, hatred, discrimination, etc. ",
