Not be given a choice of residency reduction or distantance reduction.\r\nIf the mother restricts the fathers rights to see the child so she gets more money, then she should have the money reduced.\r\nWhen working out the payment amount then why is it income based? Does it cost more to raise a child who's father earns more than it does for a child who's father is unemployed or on low income? There should be a figure set out and each parent should be made to fund 50% not the father 100%. ",
