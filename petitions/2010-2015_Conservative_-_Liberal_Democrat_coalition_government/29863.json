        "additional_details": "As Scottish independance becomes a possibility, with a referendum due, it is of vital imprtance a debate and a referendum within the rest of the United Kingdom takes place as to how WE would like Scotland to be a part, or not, of the UK's future. With the SNP talking third ways and not total seperation there seems to be a case of having cake and eating it. WE in the rest of the UK should be able to say in the case of indipendance if it should be a total break or if WE are willing to let them use our armed forces, currency, make us pay for banks registered in their country etc. It should not be for Scotland alone to pick and choose what they want to pick from the bones of the UK whilst they carve it up.",
