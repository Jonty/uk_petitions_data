Hull FC are the main contributors to the damage of the pitch. Also, Hull FC are set to play on a Friday night at 8:00pm on May 3rd, with Hull City facing a must win game for promotion at 12:45 the next day. Hull FC also refused to change their game, when in the past they have, so there is no reason they can't compromise before such an important football match in the history of Hull City AFC football club.
