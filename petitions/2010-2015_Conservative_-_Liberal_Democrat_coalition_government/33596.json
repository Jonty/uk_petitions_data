If politicians share the experience of the public it will become clear enough to them that delays are not acceptable. It will also create opportunities for politicians to meet and talk with members of the public in an environment that should guarantee their personal safety. My assumption is this can be implemented overnight by executive order at no new cost to the taxpayer.",
