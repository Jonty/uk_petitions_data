        "action": "Strip First Capital Connect of it's Thameslink franchise",
        "additional_details": "Since the appropriate date of April 1st 2006, First Capital Connect has been bringing increasing misery to commuters on the Thameslink line. This vitally important route is the only mainline to run from North of London, through the city and continue to the South coast.\r\n\r\nFCC continue to run outdated, filthy, unreliable trains in insufficient numbers with some peak time services into London consisting of just 4 coaches and people in conditions that would be illegal for cattle. They claim trains are on time when in reality they just cut out timetabled stops when a train is running late. Customer service and information, as anyone who uses the line knows, are both abysmal and prices rocket every year. This petition seeks to have another Commons debate on the performance of First Capital Connect with a view to stripping FCC of the franchise.",
