        "additional_details": "Currently we have a wide range of institutions (public and private) which apply financial penalties for any reason they can find.\r\nMost common is failure to pay.\r\n\r\nIt is ludicrous that any person should be subjected to financial penalty in response to finding themselves without money.\r\n\r\nThe idea this is necessary as a deterrent to forming contracts that cannot be afforded ignores the credit checking system.\r\nWith consumer contracts often in excess of 18 months it is unreasonable to expect an individual to be able to predict recession, bankruptcy of employer, new bills through ill health or other changes of circumstance from the time at which the contract is formed which are beyond their control.\r\n\r\nThis petition does not seek to account for unwillingness to pay.\r\n\r\nSimply that \"It should not be legal to apply financial penalty in response to a person's lack of financial resources. Or force/incite a person to take any loan against such an event.\"",
