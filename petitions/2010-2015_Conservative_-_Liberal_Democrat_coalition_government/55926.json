        "additional_details": "Mammograms should be offered to all women from the time they're 20 in order to prevent breast cancer from an earlier age and therefore lessen the amount of cases of cancer in later life. Smear tests are performed from an early age so mammograms should be too. Catching cancer at an earlier age will strengthen chances of survival and a yearly mammogram will help protect women over a longer period of time.",
