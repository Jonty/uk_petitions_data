        "additional_details": "More and more we see cyclists riding 3 abreast or more on narrow country roads. This leaves no room to avoid them if when rounding a bend you are confronted by 3 or more cyclists taking up the whole lane and doing around 15mph. Any vehicle at this speed would need a flashing beacon. Also people start to take risks to overtake them, as large groups moving very slowly are difficult to overtake with traffic coming the other way.",
