        "additional_details": "Oil companies are using their vast wealth to aquire  energy patents, and burying them so that they are not developed and brought onto the market. Many excellent and green energy patents exist, but because the oil companies own them we are all being deprived of their massive benefits.\r\nThe action to be taken by the government is to introduce legislation which requires the oil companies to fully develop and market any patents owned by them immediately, and failing this, all patents owned must be auctioned off within six months through a government controlled auction process which is to be developed solely for this purpose.\r\nThe legislation must also forbid oil companies from seeking to aquire new patents.\r\nFurthermore, the government must vet all bidders for their ability and willingness to develop the patent bid for, and again, in the event of their failure, the patent must be re auctioned.",
