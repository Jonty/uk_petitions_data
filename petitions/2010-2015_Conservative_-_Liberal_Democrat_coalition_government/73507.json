We believe Northern Irish driving licenses should also display the Union Flag.\r\n\r\nThe DVLA themselves have called the Union Flag a \"symbolic sign of national identity\", so we are extremely disappointed that they see fit to exclude Northern Irish drivers from this policy.\r\n\r\nWe understand that some people in Northern Ireland would like the Union Flag on their driving licenses, and have no objections to those people making specific requests to opt out of having the Union Flag on their driving license.",
