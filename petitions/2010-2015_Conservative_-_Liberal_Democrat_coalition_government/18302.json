No.Instead criminals get such things as time off for pleading guilty,serve a mandatory half sentence,and recieve a paltry 15 years for a life sentence.It is about time that sentencing got a whole lot tougher.For example,stop the time off for pleading guilty,stop the serving half a sentence and a mandatory 30 years for a life sentence and a mandatory 20 years for peadophiles and serial rapists,and a tougher stance for those who commit certain types of manslaughter;such as drivers who kill while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\r\n\r\n",
