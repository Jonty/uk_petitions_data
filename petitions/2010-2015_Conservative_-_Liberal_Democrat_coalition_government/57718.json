        "additional_details": "We the undersigned wish to see a ban on the consumption of members of the genus Rana, and specifically the species Rana Temporaria.\r\n\r\nWhile these animals are protected by law against sale and trade, there is little to prevent them being eaten. We find it repellent that a native species would be devoured in so-called 'bravado banquets' and call for legislation to be made that would put an end to this exploitation.\r\n\r\nFrog consumption has already had a marked impact on population numbers in Harold and surrounding streams and ponds. A ban on the practice of eating these increasingly rare animals in sandwiches, soups and stews could prevent their extinction.",
