        "additional_details": "The Government should not spend UK taxes on international disaster relief. It should focus on relieving UK poverty, leaving charitable gifts for non-UK matters to individual choice & conscience.\r\n\r\nThe Government\u2019s responsibility is to the people of the UK. In this tough economic climate & with harsh poverty seen in children and the elderly our Government should concentrate its\u2019 financial resources on directly helping UK citizens, employers and, where necessary, charities helping the UK\u2019s needy.\r\n\r\nIt should be left to the generosity of the UK population to decide whether to provide financial or material support to victims of natural disasters and other catastrophes around the world. Worthy organisations like the Disasters Emergency Committee are already effective in encouraging individuals & companies to give to relieve poverty, drought & famine across the world - the UK has an enviable reputation for privately donated aid.\r\n\r\nLet those who have the money & desire to help do so.",
