Obviously, as they are Hungarian, this is not necessarily a suitable winner of \"Britain's\" Got Talent. This petition is to give Jack Carroll the chance to be on the Royal Variety Performance as he is the British act who came second. Sign this petition if you think Jack Carroll should be given a spot on the Royal Variety Performance. ",
