Gain too many and you are banned from travel for a period of time.\r\n\r\nThis gives other countries the ability to set limits for visitors (eg you must have no more than 50% of the maximum points or you must have no football offences) and allows us to ban those who continue to offend (explain that to the wife and kids when you can't go on holiday for five years because you can't behave at a football match). This would allow us to contain those persons who cause the most overseas embarrassment.\r\n\r\n",
