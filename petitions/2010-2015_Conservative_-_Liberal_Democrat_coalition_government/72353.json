They are trying to protect Britain.\r\nMuslims are the real villains. Remember grooming gangs?\r\nThe government are too easy on them. Muslims only need to say, they are offended by British doing something they do not and get their way! This is not their country and it is like the government are giving it to them.\r\nSo please do not arrest or charge Paul Golding, he is doing good.   ",
