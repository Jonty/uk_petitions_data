        "additional_details": "I don't know how it happened but of summer 2011 I found myself calling the town Wallingting. I then started to find myself hashtagging the town on twitter whenever I talked about it or whenever I was around the area.\r\n\r\nBecause of this I have converted many people to also hashtag the area when they are around. One person even said that because of my hashtagging, whenever he sees the name Wallington it just doesn't feel right. He needs to read Wallingting to feel content.\r\n\r\nWallingting is my home, I feel alive there. I would mean the absolute world to me if we could pull this off and change the town name to Wallingting.\r\n\r\nI hope this is a valid argument,",
