The result of this is that a number of offenders are free to continue offending despite cases being linked to them.\r\n\r\nPolice investigations and CPS reviews can indicate the offender to have committed the crime yet nothing can be done to bring the person to trial because of outdated laws. Many of these offender would be convicted under current laws. It is time to stop using laws that have been proved inadequate and protect our children.",
