Tenants MUST be MADE to pay all the money PLUS minimum Fine of \u00a31000 back to the housing benefit department. Current system is not working as the significant number of tenants are claiming the benefits but not using it to pay for their rent hence committing benefit fraud without too many prosecutions).",
