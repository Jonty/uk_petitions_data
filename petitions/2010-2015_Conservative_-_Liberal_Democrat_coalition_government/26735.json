This applies to trainers in off road driving and track based trainers, but is totally irrelevant.  Track and off road trainers teach full licence holders not beginners, why do they need to spend thousands of pounds gaining a qualification that has no bearing on what they do or would ever utilise?  LGV and trailer trainers do not require this qualification.",
