The nature and quantity of this fee is set out in the Communications (Television Licensing) Regulations 2004 (as amended).\r\nLicence fees makes up about 75% of the BBC's income\r\nEveryone in the UK who watches or records \"live TV\" (content as it is broadcast) needs to be covered by a TV licence, regardless of what or how you're watching.\r\n\"Live TV\" is content at the time it's being broadcast on a TV channel.\r\nWhy should the public be contributing to the profits of the BBC and allowing the BBC to pay executives and so called stars extortionate salaries for the privelege of showing \"Live TV\".\r\n\r\n",
