        "additional_details": "It is unnecessary to export UK farm animals abroad for slaughter or fattening.  UK farm animals should be fattened or slaughtered in the UK.  The Harbours, Docks & Piers Clauses Act 1847 makes it illegal to refuse a ship the use of a port if it is carrying out lawful trade. This law stops port owners refusing trade on ethical grounds. This outdated law must be amended to let port owners refuse, on animal welfare grounds, the export of live farm animals. EU Regulation 1/2005 on the protection of animals in transport must be reformed.  A limit of 8 hours must be placed on journeys for slaughter & fattening. Regulation1/2005 must also be enforced rigorously in the UK by DEFRA and local authorities. I call on the Government to update the 1847 Act to reflect changing attitudes and scientific knowledge about   animal welfare in the past 164 years. I call on the Government to persuade EU partners to strengthen Council Regulation 1/2005with regards to the 8 hour limit on animal transport.\r\n\r\n",
