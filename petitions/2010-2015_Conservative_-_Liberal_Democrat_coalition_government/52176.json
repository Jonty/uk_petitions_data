What a waste of \u00a3250,000.\r\n\r\nMembers of the public are suffering the effects of austerity whilst this monster drains the public purse. The cost of his treatment and lodging in this top security hospital could be put to much better use. Though a death sentence would be too good for him, in  times of austerity we have all got to do our bit. Let Ian Brady do his. He wants to die, do you know anyone who wants him to live? ",
