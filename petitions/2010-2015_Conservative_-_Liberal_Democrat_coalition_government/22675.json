        "additional_details": "EU member states are effectively living under dictatorship, like in the former USSR. A United States of Europe is doomed to failure. EU is reaching breaking point as to absorbing more countries, becoming too expensive, unwieldy & chaotic.  If Turkey joins the EU, it will become a gateway to Europe from immigrants without travel documentation from the Middle East, Africa, etc. EU regulations/directives make up by the EU commissioners & EU Parliament imposes obligations for the UK to comply, even if it is against UK's own self-interests & HMG policies.  Judgments by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) are precedents in UK, even in our highest court in the land (Supreme Court). Apart from the loss of national identities (like what happened in the former USSR), MEPs & staffing of the administration of the European Parliament are expensive & is a \u2018gravy train\u2019, as well as having to subsidise poorer EU member states.",
