        "additional_details": "Recreational areas such as parks & football pitches should be free from dog poo.  Local Councils should have designated 'dog areas' for dogs to do their business in, and wardens to patrol the parks issuing on the spot fines for owners not picking up after their pets. Would more poo bins encourage lazy owners to pick up? Why take your dog out to pooh? Train it to poo in your own garden and keep our beautiful parks clean from dog poo- who wants to picnic near a pile of dog poo, clean a pair of shoes that's trod in it or slide through it in a tackle?  Inspecting a football pitch before every game & picking up poo should not have to happen.  It's a health hazard which could risk your life & sight if it got in your eyes or blood stream.  Lets raise awareness & get rid of it!",
