All of these would also improve the road environment for cyclists.\r\nMany urban roads are too narrow to accommodate a dedicated cycle way.\r\n Reducing urban speed limits to 20 mph will increase atmospheric and noise pollution levels as drivers are forced to use lower gears, In addition it would increase urban journey times and congestion and drivers would be less attentive to road conditions as they spend more time checking they are not exceeding a pointlessly low limit. The current 30 mph limit is poorly enforced, what reason is there to think that a 20 mph limit would be effective?\r\nWe urge you to reject the poorly thought out recommendations of this report.",
