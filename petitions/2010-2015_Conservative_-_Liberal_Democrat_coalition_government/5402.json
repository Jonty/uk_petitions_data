If the route mainly from London used the old Joint line route thru High wycombe it could be done cheaper with little loss in over all timings, in fact steam trains used to do it in just over 1hr 40 minutes!!\r\n It will not take much to improve the line, there is plenty of scope for straightening and tunneling.",
