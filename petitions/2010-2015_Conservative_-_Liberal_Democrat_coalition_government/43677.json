(British Crime Survey) With this only due to rise during 2013, we need to look at preventing such cases.\r\n\r\nI find the way in which rape is depicted through the media outrageous. In no way should graphic rape scenes be allowed in a film of any age certificate. It serves no purpose other than to shock and glorify the act and to educate ill minded individuals.\r\n\r\nThe opposing argument to allow such horrific scenes to take place in today's media would be that \"it is part of reality and people should be aware of it\".\r\n\r\nAt point was rape accepted in reality?\r\n\r\nWe need to stop normalizing acts of sexual violence and ban graphic rape scenes in today's cinema throughout the UK.
