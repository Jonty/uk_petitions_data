        "additional_details": "It would appear that many of those within the range of Public Sector Careers are suffering tremendous amounts as a result of Budget Cuts, Recruitment Freezes and their wages. The people that work within these careers are working to improve our society and community, and trying to keep it a safer place for all generations. As seen with the recent UK Riots (2011), for example, the reduction in recruitment within the Police Force could have led to dire consequences.\r\nIt is important that those who provide copious amounts to our community are given sufficient wages, and are not affected so detrimentally by the Budget Cuts and Recruitment Freezes.\r\n\r\nPublic Sector Careers include:\r\n-Emergency Services.\r\n-Armed Forces.\r\n-Teaching Jobs.\r\n-Health and Care Jobs. (Including Security, Catering, Cleaning.)\r\n-Local Council Jobs. (Including Recycling and Rubbish Collection, Environmental Protection.)",
