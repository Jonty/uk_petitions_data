Many of these fatalities could have been avoided if the adult or child had been wearing a lifejacket or buoyancy aid.\r\n\r\nResearch indicates that wearing a lifejacket or buoyancy aid significantly increases the potential to prolong life and a person\u2019s chances of surviving in the water, therefore we call upon Her Majesty\u2019s Government to make the wearing of a lifejacket or buoyancy aid compulsory for everyone using UK waters, including (but not limited to) coastal areas, lakes, Lochs and other in-land waterways for commercial or leisure purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
