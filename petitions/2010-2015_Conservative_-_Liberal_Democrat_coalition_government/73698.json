        "additional_details": "My friend was a young, bright and loving student who had many dreams. He was overjoyed when his efforts allowed him to enroll into Paddington Academy 6th Form for A-Levels\r\n\r\nRegrettably, this was short lived. At the end of his first year he had an accident on a scooter bike outside of school which led to him being expelled.\r\n\r\nDue to his tough upbringing which left him vulnerable to antisocial behaviour, and the absence of school in his life, he got caught up in the wrong crowds. Bilal passed away. The streets were the next best option for a talented young boy who had so much to offer but was forbidden from fulfilling his dreams.\r\n\r\nSchools are prioritising academic reputation over student welfare by letting go of students they deem less able at any given chance. The department of education should increase the difficulty for students to be expelled and ensure those who are expelled are regularly checked to ensure they are on a progressing path to prevent others from a similar fate.",
