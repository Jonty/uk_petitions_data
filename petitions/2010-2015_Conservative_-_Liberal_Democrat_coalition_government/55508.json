        "additional_details": "Waitrose in Dartford, Kent are planning to close their store in March 2014. They say it is struggling to be 'commercially sustainable'.\r\n\r\n128 people will lose their jobs. We cannot let that happen. Unemployment in the area is already high - this will only add to the problem.\r\n\r\nIf Tesco build their store in the area (which they planning to do) there will be no competition, no alternative, as Tesco are seen to be taking over the world.\r\n\r\nWe need choice. We need Waitrose to stay in Dartford. Please show your support and sign this petition to persuade them to stay.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading. ",
