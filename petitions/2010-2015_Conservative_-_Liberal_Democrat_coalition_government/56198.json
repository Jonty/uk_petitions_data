        "additional_details": "This petition sets out to highlight the plight of talented and expressive Eyebrows at the hands of the boring immobile Fringes.\r\n\r\nEyebrows have an essential job to do, in enhancing and dramatising the delivery of the BBC Breakfast News. However in recent months a \u201cmaney veil\u201d has been drawn over our ability to ensure that the news items are delivered with the correct and telling expression.\r\n\r\nWe do not wish to single out any offending presenters by naming them here, but our Steph McGovern knows who she is.\r\n\r\nNo longer, in the name of fashion, should us Brows remain hidden behind the hairy curtain.\r\n\r\nEnd this follicle challenge and set us Eyebrows free to dance and entertain you. Sign our petition now and have hair restored to your screens, plucked, threaded and ready to seduce.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t cut the BBC budget, cut the Fringe and raise your Brows.\r\n\r\nDavid Cameron man the Shears!",
