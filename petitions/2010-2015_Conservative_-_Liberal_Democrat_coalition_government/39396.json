Many of the Countries we send aid to don't even need hand-outs any more and prefer to squander the money! We already spend over \u00a312 Billion on Foreign Aid and have cut our Defence Budget by 7% whilst the Government look to increase the amount we spend on Foreign Aid. Britain is currently a renowned world power, but we won't be for much longer if we carry on cutting defence and giving foreign aid to countries who in a few years time turn around and want to start conflict with the money we've provided them!",
