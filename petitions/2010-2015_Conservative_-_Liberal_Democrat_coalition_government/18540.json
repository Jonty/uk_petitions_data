        "additional_details": "On 26 September 2011, with no communication or consultation with the local community, Newham council announced that they are to close the only Leisure Centre in E15 permanently. Atherton Leisure Centre is the only public sports facility in the area surrounding the Olympic site.\r\n\r\nIn a BBC TV interview (28th September 2011), Newham Mayor Robin Wales stated that a new 'state-of-the-art' leisure centre will be built to replace Atherton Leisure Centre, however the minutes from the meeting where  the decision was made to close the centre reveal: \"There is significant risk that the capital financing will not be secure for a replacement facility.\"\r\n\r\nWe are petitioning to demand that funding is found to repair the roof of the main swimming pool and to ensure the survival of this historic and vital community resource.\r\n\r\nMore information about the campaign to keep Atherton open can be found at www.notsponsored.co.uk.",
