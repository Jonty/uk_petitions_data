I want us all to work together to put a stop to the unfortunate events where youths are using knives and guns to violently attack or threaten others. I want offending youths to be sent to a marine training camp or something of equal discipline instead of prison where they are disciplined and worked hard. Where their mindless behaviour is not tolerated, where they are taught to behave like real men instead of the animals they have become. Prison is no good for these people, the government don't understand, it adds to theses offenders street credit to go to prison, it makes more people scared of them when they get out. Something has to be done!!",
