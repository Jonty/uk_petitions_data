        "additional_details": "I've tried to buy tickets for concerts but work during the day so find it difficult to get to a phone or pc to get them. It angers me then that within minutes of the gig tickets going on sale that touts have them listed on ebay at up to 10x the face value which i find very very wrong. I'm not against them making money for their time in purchasing them and I feel that eBay needs to put a limit of no more than 100%  of the face value of the ticket as the maximum that can and should be paid by someone. I want the government to introduce a ticket pricing policy for internet auction sites.",
