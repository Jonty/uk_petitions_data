        "additional_details": "The Climate Change Act is confused, counter-productive and economically damaging. It is costing \u00a318billion per year for the next 40 years.  It is adding hidden green stealth taxes to our gas and electricity bills. It makes energy too expensive and has pushed 5.5 million households into fuel poverty.  Jobs are also at risk in our energy-intensive industries. This Act will increase the price of food, clothes and travel. Britain\u2019s unilateral action on the climate is futile gesture politics, because the UK accounts for less than 2% of global CO2 emissions. This Act has never been democratically tested.\r\n\r\nThe Government must:\r\n\r\nrepeal the Climate Change Act,\r\nstop the Green Investment Bank,\r\nstop the Renewable Obligations,\r\nstop subsidies to wind farms and solar energy,\r\nstop the Carbon Floor Price.\r\n\r\nFor affordable energy Campaign to Repeal the Climate Change Act.\r\n",
