This is meaningless and serves only to disguise the fact that nothing is actually being done.  It should be deleted from Government language.  I suggest that in its stead MPs and members of government departments in future \"investigate and resolve problems\" and that the problems should be specifically identified. Let those who are, at least theoretically, empowered to look after our interests do something specific rather than \"address the issue\".",
