        "additional_details": "The Rainbow Ark Animal Sanctuary has been providing a home to over 400 rescued animals for the last 20 years from all over the United Kingdom. In recent years it has been fighting a battle with debt which resulted in a repossession on the 29th January 2014.\r\n\r\nThe issue of animal welfare is increasingly being debated by the general public. Rainbow Ark is the third sector in practice and is providing a public good. It is the Big Society creating ways to protect animals from harm in a time of economic downturn that leads to increasing amounts of animals being abandoned and mistreated.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like to ask is what support and funding has been available to Rainbow Ark? How does the government support the 'Big Society' or are we supposed to do it all ourselves!\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to ask government why Rainbow Ark Sanctuary was not supported. ",
