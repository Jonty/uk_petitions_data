        "additional_details": "This country promotes itself as a democracy and advocates democracy in other countries across the world, but it is not really one itself.  It is a Constitutional Monarchy.  This is held in place via weekly meetings with The Queen and The Prime Minister, and with Constant Ministerial Contact and influence by The Heir Prince Charles.  Also that The Queen must be met and give assent to a Democratically Elected Government. We petition that these meetings cease and that this Country becomes in reality a Democracy.  We want to be true Citizens not Subjects.",
