        "additional_details": "The people of the UK have had enough of seeing people convicted of killing innocent children and pretty much getting away with it. They get 15 - 20 years, which includes a roof over their head and 3 meals a day, which is all paid for by the taxpayer. Then when they get out they get a new identity and a new life. All this while the innocent childs life has been cut short and their family has to live with pain.\r\nWe want these killers tried fairly, but when proven guilty and convicted, they face death.",
