In pursuing the prosecution of Mr Chambers, apparently despite the contrary urging of staff within his department, Mr Starmer acted against the interests of the public, demonstrated extraordinary bad faith and a lack of understanding of the law.",

This was considered and progressed, however, at a later stage the DPP was advised that, as a matter of law, conceding the appeal would not be possible. This is because it was not possible because the key finding of fact in the case was a finding of the Crown Court, which only the High Court could overturn. The DPP accepted that advice and reluctantly agreed that the appeal had to proceed.\r\n",
