        "action": "Wage Gap - Increase prevention",
        "additional_details": "The wage gap between the richer and poorer workers, continues to increase. This is because percentage wage rises are always given \"across the board\". For example, a 5% rise on a \u00a350,000 salary, is always going to more money than a 5% rise on a \u00a315,000 wage. I propose, that the Government, regulates wage rises, so that a real money rise is given across the board to prevent the wage gap always getting wider. If you agree that the wage gap needs to stop getting wider, then sign this petition. Thank you. ",
