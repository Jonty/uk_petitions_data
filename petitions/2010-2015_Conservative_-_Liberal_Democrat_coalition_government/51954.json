Furthermore, take steps to protect us from PRISM and similar schemes and insure that no other Government, friendly or otherwise can steal our data.\r\n\r\nFinally, create a law preventing the sale of user data by third party companies or the storage of details by these companies once a user has ceased to have an account with that company.\r\n\r\nWe also consider the recent actions of GCHQ undemocratic and want a full inquiry into the nature of the storage of citizens details who are not deemed to be a significant threat to the public's safety.\r\n\r\n",
