It teaches that no opinion is sacred, all opinions can be debated and that there are many things that people will never agree on - and that's okay.\r\n\r\nWhat better way to immunise our children against ignorance, intolerance and extremism?\r\n\r\nTeach them the history of thought. Give them the tools to point out fallacies in what they're told. Encourage them to think for themselves and to reject illogical ideas.\r\n\r\nShow them that everything can and should be questioned, and how debate, understanding and democracy are the best ways of disagreeing.\r\n\r\nTeach them to fight ideas, not people.",
