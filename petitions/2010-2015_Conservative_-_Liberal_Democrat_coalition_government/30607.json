        "additional_details": "The national press has recently informed us that married Armed Forces members may be forced out of the Forces accommodation and made to find their own in an attempt to save \u00a3318m. Has the Government looked at the effect that this will have on the spouses and families that they FORCE to move around the country every 2-3years? Moving is something we expect as we know where we are going, we know we will have acceptable accommodation, we know we are moving into a community that understands us and where, when Forces members go overseas, we have support. Moving is tough enough without having to find your own home to move into. On top of which our Forces members risk their lives for our country and they shouldn\u2019t have to worry about where they are going to live if and when they come home. Will there be a pay rise to combat the prices of housing if you get forced to live in an expensive area. The Prime Minister promised legal military covenant but can't adhere to the one we already have.",
