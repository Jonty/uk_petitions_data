        "additional_details": "The A5 in Bedfordshire passes through the village of Hockliffe. This is the only village in Bedfordshire on the A5 that does not have a bypass. The village is now plagued with heavy lorries and cars passing through at speeds well above the 40mph stipulated. At rush hour the road is backed up for miles as traffic from Milton Keynes tries to go to Dunstable in one lane down from a dual carriageway further up. There needs to be a recognition that the village is home to many families and that the levels of the traffic through the village are unsustainable, getting worse and environmentally unfriendly due to wasted fuel. The village and the A5 would benefit from a by pass.",
