        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, petition HM Government to hold a debate in the House of Commons regarding the political status of the British National Party. As a country promoting multiculturalism, it is sickening to see parties like the British National Party, still being allowed to stand in the General and Local Elections. The desired outcome of this petition is to remove the status of Political Party from the British National Party.",
