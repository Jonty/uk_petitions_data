        "additional_details": "This petition is for the compulsory introduction and use of speed restrictors on Vans larger than car size, ie those of Transit and Sprinter size and larger.\r\n\r\nTogether with this introduction will be the automatic loss of driving license entitlement for anybody found to be driving such a vehicle without or with tampered or non working equipment.\r\n\r\nLarger PCV and HGV vehicles are already subject to speed limiters.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the introduction of such equipment, to be set at 75mph is to remove the excessive speed and consequent intimidation from such vehicles on our motorways and roads and to make the third lane safer for car drivers.",
