A lot of this goes on but this is is actually a criminal offence called ILLEGAL DETENTION.\r\n\r\nLets not forget about the 5,000 people that were wrongly sectioned due to the governments error.. http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/health-20126569\r\n\r\nMichelle is living in a rehab unit on a section 3 despite the dr admitting she dosent need to be in hospital! This is a criminal offence and id like the government to look at this issue again with a view to changing the criteria for detention under a Mental Health Section because at present too many people are being put on without fitting the criteria.\r\n\r\nWritten by M.Proby\r\n\r\n",
