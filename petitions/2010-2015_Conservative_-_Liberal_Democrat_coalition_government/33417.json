        "additional_details": "According to the Parental Responsibility Act, absent fathers/mothers have a say in the upbringing of their child/children; they can do this even though they pay nothing to the full custody parent for the upbringing of said child/children.\r\n\r\nI would like the law to be changed so that if an absent parent (with parental responsibility), who has agreed or has been ordered to contribute to the upbringing of his/her child/children, DOES NOT make regular payments, whether to the CSA or direct to the full custody parent, should lose their parental responsibility.\r\n\r\nI am not saying the absent parent should lose their access, as that would not be fair on the child/children.  I am just asking that they lose their parental responsibility.\r\n",
