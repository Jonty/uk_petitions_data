        "additional_details": "With the average turnout for UK general elections steadily decreasing and voter apathy becoming an increasing problem in the United Kingdom creating a 'None of the above' option on all general election ballot papers would allow sections of society that do not feel included by any of the mainstream political parties to have serious impact. This would encourage participation and force Politicians to take note of segments of the population that do not feel included. Give the voiceless a voice in UK politics.",
