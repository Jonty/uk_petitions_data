So, for example, vehicles from Germany would not be charged, but French, Swiss, Spanish & Italian would.   The tax could be run much as the vignette system used by the Swiss and run annually with a month's \"grace\" on either side (like in Switzerland)\r\n\r\nI'm certain that this would generate a nice income for the government",
