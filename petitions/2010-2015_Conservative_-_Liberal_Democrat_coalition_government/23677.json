        "additional_details": "The ABA & iABA state that boxers must be clean shaven before a fight. This is a violation of the Human Rights of the boxers as some religions such as Sikhism, Islam make it compulsory to keep a beard thus this rule deprives them of competing. Previously the rules stated that boxers of Sikh religion were allowed to box with a beard but since a few young muslim boxers wanted to compete and represent their country and nation (Britain) the rules change on the so called basis of health and safety, thus resulting in stopping many young talents of being wasted. Clearly there are ways around this issue which can include a certain type of headguard whichis to be used as is done with the use of a special mouth guard for boxers with braces, Braces being far more dangerous during a bout than a beard.",
