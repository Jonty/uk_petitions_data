        "additional_details": "When God said in the Bible \"a noose for a noose\" He was right. For too long sick perverts have been getting away with proposing public hanging in the UK.\r\n\r\nWe say enough.\r\n\r\nThe proposed punishments for some crimes are so horrific that the proper punishment for proposing this punishment is the death penalty. After all, with all that DNA science we now have, we can always prove all the time who has proposed a punishment for a crime, and then propose punishing them appropriately.\r\n\r\nSo, Government, will you ConDem us to more Brussels non-justice? Or will you finally publicly hang anyone who proposes public hanging for any crime? We propose this.",
