        "additional_details": "As a recent United Nations poll revealed, Brits are the most hard-working nation in the developed world.\r\n\r\nWith time most definitely of the essence, it seems only fair that we should be rewarded for our hard work.\r\n\r\nTime is something we cherish at London Living and we believe Londoners in particular are very short of the stuff. If the lack of sunshine and blue skies at this time of year isn\u2019t bad enough, having to work an extra day every four years can't be good for morale \u2013 especially in the midst of an economic recession which requires the workforce to be at their best.\r\n\r\nFebruary 29th comes around but once every four years, so why don't we use this rare extra 24 hours to do with it as we please? Time-strapped Brits would be treated to a well-deserved play day, to take the chill out of winter and carry us into spring.\r\n\r\nWant to make the leap year into a national holiday? Sign our petition and let\u2019s make it happen!",
