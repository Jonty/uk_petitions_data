        "additional_details": "Having previously stated this change will start in 2015 there should be no reason why those 4 million now due to miss out cannot be tapered into the new system just as women have been levered into a higher pension age.\r\nIf you now officially retire in March 2017 or earlier you will get \u00a3107 a week but if you retire after March 2017 you will get \u00a3144 a week - \u00a337 a week difference, this is totally unfair for women who now have to work longer missing out over 3 to 4 years of \u00a317,000+ of missing pension now those women are being targetted again by losing \u00a337 a week.  This is not just about women but all members of our society of pensionable age now.  Please sign this petition and maybe/hopefully will get back to the ministers to do something about this unjust",
