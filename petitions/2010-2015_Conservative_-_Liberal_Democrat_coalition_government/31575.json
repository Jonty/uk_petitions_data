        "additional_details": "Based on the highly expensive debacle that was selling of British owned gas, water, telephone and rail networks has had and is still costing us - we have major concerns about their future plans to sell Police services, NHS Services and now the roads. What else do they have planned? How can they ever think that selling public services to private companies who will underinvest and rape the profits benefit the British tax payer.\r\n\r\nThis petition is tell the British Government that we do not want any more of our British publicly owned services, infrastructure or any other publicly owned entity to be allowed to be privatised or even have a small element of a private company take key services under it's wing without a full house of commons debate AND a national referendum first. They do not have the right to work for us and yet sell our property or services without our permission first!",
