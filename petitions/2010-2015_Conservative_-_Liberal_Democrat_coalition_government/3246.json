A scale of charges could be done based on both complexity and the sums involved.\r\nThose who are literally broke will take the rest of their lives to pay it it off and the well-off who cheat suddenly stand to lose much they already have. The fear of losing all that previous wealth, as well as the shame of being convicted, might deter a few more people. ",
