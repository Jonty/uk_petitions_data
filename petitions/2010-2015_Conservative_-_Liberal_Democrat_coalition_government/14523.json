Where on earth is the government while large insurance companies are taken drivers to the cleaners whereas the sad fact is that their desperate dash to round up customers before competition does no matter what it costs is what really drives prices so high; in some cases for every \u00a3100 of your premium up to \u00a325 is passed on to price comparison sites and other admin work. I was told that my postcode in Manchester is the worst place in the country to live as far as postcode grading is concerned and yet less than a mile from my house there are properties with values of between \u00a32 and \u00a35 Million.  Some of these large companies are recording massive profit rises and handing out great lumps of cash to their workers; why? Because they keep pushing and we keep having to pay. Aren\u2019t you tired of being conned? I certainly am.   ",
