        "additional_details": "As we have seen in the recent riots, and has been stated in the press, we have moved into a 'me first' society. I believe this has come about because of the lack of intervention by parents, the lack of interaction between parents and their children, the lack of time available to parents to spend with their children. This is due to the financial constraints placed upon the household. Long gone are the days where a mother (Or Father) could stay at home and make do with one income. The cost of this to society is now becoming clear. We have youths that know what is right and what is wrong, but simply do not care. No-one listened to them as children, no-one was around, they formed their own opinions on society and the way to behave and EVERYONE is to blame for this. The government should encourage and incentivise parents to stay at home with their children. Set up a task force to investigate how this can be done.",
