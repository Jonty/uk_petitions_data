        "additional_details": "- The Cervical Screening Programme offers cervical smears to women, in England, from the age of 25. In Scotland and Wales smears are done from age 20.\r\n- Cervical cancer is a preventable disease. The smear test detects cells that are 'abnormal', which if left, could become cancerous months or years later.\r\n- Cervical cancer results from infection with the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV),a sexually transmitted virus.Young girls are starting their sexual lives earlier, hence increasing teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. Abnormal cells and cervical cancer are increasing in the under 25s.\r\n- These women are too young for a smear test and too old for the cervical cancer vaccine. But not too young to die!\r\n- The Government must make the cervical screening programme available to all women from the age of 20.\r\n- More info:  www.too-young-to-die.co.uk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
