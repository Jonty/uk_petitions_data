        "additional_details": "Over 14million people in England live with persistent pain, which can affect work, family and daily life.  The organisations responsible for setting standards of care for health and social care professionals should ensure that these professionals help people living with pain by asking about their pain, measuring it, recording it, treating it and managing  it at every opportunity\r\n\r\n People in pain may find it difficult to talk about it when they are with a health or care professional. Patients should be asked whether they are in pain, and how it affects their daily living.  Pain should be measured and the results record and included in a pain management plan which would include self-management.\r\nIf asking about pain was as routine as taking a temperature or blood pressure people living with chronic pain could be helped routinely and regularly to manage their pain and have it treated effectively.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n",
