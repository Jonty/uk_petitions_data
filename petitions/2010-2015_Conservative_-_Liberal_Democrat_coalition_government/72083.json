        "additional_details": "My brother was imprisoned for hitting a well known drug dealing bully, after this man had hit him first! We all thought honesty was the best policy and Dave admitted to what he'd done, thinking he would be given community service. Instead he was put in prison for a year, he has never been in trouble before and is a hard working taxpayer. We have heard so many similar stories since this happened and it really needs looking into, he is no threat whatsoever to the public so why is he in prison? ",
