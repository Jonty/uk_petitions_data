PEOPLE WHO FALL INTO THIS CATAGORY AND ARE BETWEEN THE AGES OF SAY, 16 - 45 SHOULD BE GIVEN UNPAID WORK, MADE OBLIGITORY. NO WORK, NO \u00a354. THIS WAY, THOSE WHO SHOW THEIR USE MAY STAND A BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING A PROPER PAID EMPLOYMENT. THERE ARE YOUNGSTERS WHO HAVE NO INTENTION OF FINDING A JOB. THIS IS ONE WAY TO STOP THIS ABUSE OF THE SYSTEM.",
