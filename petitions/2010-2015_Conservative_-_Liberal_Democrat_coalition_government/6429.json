It is good that UK opted out of EU\u2019s foreign & social policies, security, defence, taxation and the Euro currency. But consider the present advantages of UK being part of the EU includes (1) Being part of an economic blog whereby trade restrictions are minimal. This encourage trade (2) Mobile pool of workers with few restrictions in working in another EU countries, thus solving labour storage in some areas (3) EU countries using their combined economic and political influence to espouse their views and objectives to the rest of the world (4) Strengthening a common shared European cultural identity and prevent wars amongst EU nations (5) Easier travelling in the EU by EU citizens (6) Facilitates collaborative ventures in expensive projects (like building infrastructure, research, space exploration and manufacturing like airbus).",
