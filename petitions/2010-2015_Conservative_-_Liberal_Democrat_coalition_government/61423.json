        "additional_details": "Commuters travelling along the A666 to the M60-M62 (N & E) have to wait for traffic crossing from the M61 junction to M60 (W & S). During rush hour traffic this can cause very large tailbacks. Crossing traffic can be treacherous particularly when people adopt poor road sense attempting to get a better place in the queue to the M60 (W & S)instead of waiting patiently.\r\n\r\nI propose an underground tunnel interchange to drop below the M61 Junction joining to the A666 that those going to M60-M62 (N & E) can use to commute to work safely and without waiting (unnecessarily due to poor road planning) in traffic.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of interchanges are well documented as being integral to highway planning and developement. Please see to it that an interchange is included at this very busy section of the A666. ",
