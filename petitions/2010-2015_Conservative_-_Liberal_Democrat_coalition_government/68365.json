An email is sent back to say that the video is NOT breaking their community code, well the question I'd like to ask is who makes that code and why is such a poor code not being legislated?\r\nFamilies of the victims are faced with seeing their relatives in disgusting situations before the police have even had time to inform them, people make unjust comments and vile jokes and this spreads round the internet like wild fire. Where is the thought for the family and friends of that person? Where are the thoughts for the young children who may come across this?\r\nFacebook have no complaints department and are quite happy to just let this carry on. WE are not! We want the goverment to put tighter controlls on this, to ensure that this stops ",
