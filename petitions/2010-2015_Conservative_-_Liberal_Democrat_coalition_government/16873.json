        "additional_details": "This petition is seeking to reinvigorate the debate regarding the Universal Basic Income as a means of wealth redistribution within the UK. Basic Income is an allowance paid by the government to each citizen regardless of age, status, sex, race, or employment and has been suggested as an alternative to means-tested benefits. This petition however, does not seek to scrap our benefits system and replace it with Basic Income but instead to introduce it alongside our current system; largely to replace our current means of Income Support.",
