We remember the fallen who fought for their country, we should also remember the innocent children who suffer, or have fallen in the face of the most horrific abuse; those who fight for their own existence when they should not have to do so.\r\n\r\nThis should be a celebration, a solum reminder, and a clear message that we do not tolerate child abuse in the United Kingdom.",
