        "additional_details": "We are told that a minimum necessary amount per person per week  to live on is \u00a367.50. Yet couples claiming jointly receive \u00a3105.95 for both. \u00a320+ electric bill, \u00a310 gas, food expenses (no way to eat healthy) + phone, plus TV licence, plus water, plus school expenses and many others. We can forget entertainment and Xmas presents. No extra fuel money for non-pensioners. No chance to dress everyone at the same time, if at all. People are forced to face poverty and at the same time the job market is appalling. Couples are expected to survive on 30% less per head per week. It is impossible for couples (married or unmarried) to make a separate claim if they live at the same address. The allowance per person per week for couples must be increased to at least \u00a367 to ensure coverage of basic survival needs. ",
