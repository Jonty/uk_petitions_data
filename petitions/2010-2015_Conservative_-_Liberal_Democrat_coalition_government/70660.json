It can be horrible for the people around them and the person themselves.Some people find it so hard to cope and don't know what to do. This is when they turn to the mental health services for help, however due to the high demand of cases they are unable to help everyone.\r\n\r\nAround 10% of children aged between 5 & 16 have a mental condition, due to the cuts a high number of them never get help. If they are lucky they get put on a list to see a psychologist - but this could take over a year and by this time it may be too late for those suffering with no help.\r\n\r\nThe earlier mental health problems are identified in a person the quicker that person can learn to manage their condition, potentially saving lives.
