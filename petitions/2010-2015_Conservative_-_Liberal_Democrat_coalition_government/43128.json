        "additional_details": "The government are reducing public servants pensions, extending the age that they have to work before they can claim a pension that they have paid with their own money, wage rises with inflation have been frozen for 4 years yet fuel, energy prices food prices continue to rise and are now struggling to afford to live. It's about time someone independent like Tom Windsor is brought in to review the pay and conditions, pensions and claims for 2nd houses made by mp's, many mp's earn extra hundreds of thousands of pounds doing second jobs on top of being mp's like the prime minister said we're all in this together yet they have done nothing about their wages/ expenditure.
