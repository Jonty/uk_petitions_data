        "additional_details": "Hundreds of transport, rail and Home Office staff have threatened to strike unless paid a bonus for working over the Olympic period.  Most have secured bonuses for doing their normal jobs.\r\n\r\nArmed Forces personnel and police officers are not allowed to strike and yet many hundreds have had to be drafted in to perform security tasks during the Olympic period.\r\n\r\nMany of the Armed Forces personnel have served the nation in some of the most arduous and demanding combat environments and many are reported to have had post operational tour leave, holidays, honeymoons and other family activities cancelled.\r\n\r\nI petition the government to support the following recommendation:\r\n\r\nThat Armed Forces personnel and Police Officers, drafted in to fill G4S security personnel gaps, be paid a tax-free bonus of at least \u00a33,500 per individual.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your support.",
