        "additional_details": "The UK Government badly underestimated the number of migrants when eight eastern European countries joined the EU in 2004.  This is likely to be repeated when Romanian and Bulgarian citizens gain free movement from January 2014.\r\n\r\nThis will put enormous pressure on our schools, hospitals, social services and benefit system. There will also likely be a significant increase in organised crime, putting yet more pressure on our hard-pressed police force.  Evidence suggests that Romanians in particular are already responsible for a high percentage of ATM, copper wire and roof lead thefts.\r\n\r\nThe Government should expedite a measure to defer immigration of Bulgarian and Romanians until the result is known of the UK's 2017 referendum on the terms of our EU membership.",
