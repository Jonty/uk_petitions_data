        "additional_details": "We the undersigned demand that the United Kingdom Government should cease providing aid to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan until that country repeals its discriminatory blasphemy laws.\r\n\r\nNot only are blasphemy laws an affront to freedom of expression they are also a cause of religious discrimination and act to undermine religious freedom. In Pakistan such laws are used as an excuse to attack minority communities as a whole as well as individuals within such communities.\r\n\r\nPakistan is a member state of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The OIC played a large role in the making of United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution 16/18 that purports to be an instrument to promote religious tolerance. As such Pakistan should have no trouble abolishing its blasphemy law and treating all religions as equal within the borders of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.",
