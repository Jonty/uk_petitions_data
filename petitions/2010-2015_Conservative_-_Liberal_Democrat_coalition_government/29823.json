When there are Companies in the likes of China and Brasil serving populations of around 1 billion that simply arent nearly as rich.\r\n\r\nIt doesnt take a well renowned barrister to see that someone being charged \u00a350,000 for a years car insurance defies all known Legal principles.\r\nHow long before this reaches the hallowed European Court of Human Rights! Our only saviour from British Insanity!",
