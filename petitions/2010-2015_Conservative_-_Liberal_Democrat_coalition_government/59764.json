Half the rights means half of the responsibility. Avoiding commitmental to child support isnt responsible.\r\nMake avoidnt parents pay to use the system.\r\nRemoval of driving licences/passports/custodial sentences.Not informing of changes of circumstances is essentially fraud. Not providing for your children is Essentially Neglect.  They should be treated as so.\r\n\r\nThe c.s.a as it stands does not work. Charging resident parents to use the service simply will not work. Its time for change.",
