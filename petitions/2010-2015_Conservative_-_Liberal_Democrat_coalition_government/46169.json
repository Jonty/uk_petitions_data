If you don't find work after 3 months you are supposed to go home.\r\n\r\nSo if any benefits are being paid, this is down to either a) badly written UK law, or b) badly implemented UK law, both of which are the responsibility of the UK government, not the EU.\r\n\r\nSo why are UK tax payers funding the bill?\r\nIs it because of laws making them NO! It is a choice they have made which costs us billions per year.\r\nplease sign if you support and would like this issue to be addressed.",
