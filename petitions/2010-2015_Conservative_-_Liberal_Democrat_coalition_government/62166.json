It is completely unacceptable that when mortgages came down and rates were held at an all time low, FirstPlus actually applied a rate increase and at no point has it ever brought those rates down\r\n\r\nYet I suspect if rates were to rise in future, they would be quick to increase theirs\r\n\r\nCompletely unethical",
