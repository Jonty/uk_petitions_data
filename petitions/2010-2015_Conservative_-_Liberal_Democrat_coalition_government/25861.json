Rather than fixing these items the user should be able to tailor his/her  requirements online with the contract price varying.\r\n\r\nAfter all, how many customers want 1200 minutes, unlimited texts and 500 Mb?  It should be perfectly possible with computerised online systems to give the customer more control and hence choice.\r\n\r\nSo all customers wanting less minutes, a finite number of texts and selected Mb download would be in control rather than having his/her options constrained by mobile phone companies.\r\n\r\nSuch customer choice could well result in contract prices being more affordable when tailored to customer needs.",
