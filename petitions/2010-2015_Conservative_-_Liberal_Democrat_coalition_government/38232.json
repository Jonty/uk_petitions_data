Specifically:\r\n\r\n1) Householders allowed to use whatever force they deem necessary against intruders who have broken into their home and remain within their home\r\n\r\n2) Victims of crime not to be arrested in the wake of an intrusion where they have had to defend themselves by force (interview and statement under caution instead)\r\n\r\n3) In any other circumstances where violence is used against a criminal under provocation or self-defense (for example in the street) the law must be rebalanced\r\nfar more in favour of the victim.",
