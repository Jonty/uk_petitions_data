I used to live in Southend-on-sea, Essex for 8 years, and I found bus fares to be a real chore as they are all different, which made keeping track of my money difficult.\r\nI propose a nationwide Oyster card, with the same properties as a current Oyster card:\r\n11-16 - Free travel with a 'Zip' card\r\nStudents - Student card with discounted fares\r\nRegular - Pay for the card, and top it up at shops, train stations etc.",
