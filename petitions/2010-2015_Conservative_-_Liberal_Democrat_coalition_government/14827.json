It is simply unsustainable.\r\n\r\nGiven the huge numbers of economically inactive youth and falling job prospects as a result of international labour markets becoming more open, it is time to take stock of what we have and reward those who do not perpetuate the problem.\r\n\r\nPeople who choose not to have children will not increase the burden on the state through welfare payments, education, NHS, prison costs etc. Not to mention the catastrophic strain that an explosive population increase is having on the planet\u2019s natural resources.\r\n\r\nWe no longer need to encourage people to have children though tax and benefit incentives, we need to do the opposite.\r\n",
