There should be a bill to create a standard National Specification for Creme Eggs or otherwise insist on the restoration of the standard that the County expects both in terms of size and shell content.\r\n\r\nThis petition may well be thwarting a Soviet other Nation's plot to undermine the spirit, culture, morale or economy of the Nation with this dire action.\r\n\r\n",
