        "additional_details": "Replacing real grass with a synthetic version of the same derived from the oil industry, is a poor environmental decision.\r\n\r\nThere is currently no restriction on the use of artificial grass (AG) for environmental reasons. I have noticed a great increase in the number of properties where the whole rear garden has been covered with AG.\r\n\r\nThe use of AG flies in the face of sustainability. In addition, AG reduces wildlife habitats and absorbs a great deal of heat energy from sunlight, adding to heat absorption by the earth (and thus \"climate change\") .\r\n\r\nUse of AG has a cumulative, usually non-reversible negative impact on the environment.\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few AG companies making very large profits. Do the maths.\r\n\r\nCome on UK, lead the way for the EU to follow, before it's too late.",
