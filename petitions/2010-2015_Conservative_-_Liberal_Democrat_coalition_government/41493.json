        "additional_details": "I would like this Government to change the legislation for the Child Support Agency(CSA).At the moment it allows everybody who is a single parent to make a claim,which if the absent parent doesnt pay and is actually absent this is fair enough but this system is terribly unfair for parents who are involved with their children as it works based on a blanket set of rules.The CSA takes money from people that cannot afford it and I believe the other parents circumstances should be taken into consideration when working out financing from the ''absent'' parent. At the moment, people use to CSA to 'get back at' ex partners and the CSA do not account for the fact that many people go on to have new families and in turn financially, it ruins lives because they then cannot afford to support their new family, or even themselves.",
