The pursuit of Classical subjects also fosters an appreciation of philosophy, politics, histroy, drama, religion and language structure.\r\n\r\nThe government should aim to install the teaching of Classical Studies, even at a very rudimentary level, in schools to improve the breadth of education provided and also to dispel the elitist tag that it has been unfairly given.",
