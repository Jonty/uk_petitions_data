This is because no-one knows if there are slivers of glass or small stones in the tread of the tyres.  Also, no-one knows where the wheels of the pram have been whilst outside.  Also, shoes should not be worn in a pool area for the same reason as for prams.  If these rules were brought in, it would stop people from cutting their feet and therefore, ending up with infections.",
