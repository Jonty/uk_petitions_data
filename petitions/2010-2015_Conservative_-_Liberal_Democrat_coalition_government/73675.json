The reality is very different.\r\nDartford has probably the worst deliberately designed bottleneck in the UK caused by extracting toll charges in order to cross the Thames.\r\nWhat do you get for paying tolls? - Daily and lengthy jams, increased pollution levels, huge economic cost in missed appointments, wasted fuel, late deliveries, and excessive wear and tear on brakes and clutches.\r\n\r\nWe need to say no more! Remove the Dartford Crossing Charge! ",
