        "additional_details": "I call upon the Government to stop paying subsidies to rail companies that are paying dividends to their share holders, rather than spending their profits on improving their services. If all the profits of these companies are being spent on improvements, and subsidies are still needed, fair enough, but not when share holders are receiving dividends, and directors enormous salaries.  If we are paying 6 billion in subsidies, surely it would be better to nationalise the railways! I therefore call upon the Government to cancel these subsidies until the companies concerned start ploughing their profits back into the railways",
