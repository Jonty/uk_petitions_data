        "additional_details": "Leicester City Council bosses are planning cost-cutting changes to supervised play sessions for youngsters.\r\nThe current deals mean organisations are paid for the upkeep of play areas as well as the actual supervision.\r\nA member of staff at one scheme, believes funding is to be cut by a third.\r\nThe schemes are valuable to communities, they already rely heavily on fundraising and donations. Todays children get slated as gaming couch pototoes. Yet funding is being cut to schemes that get children active in a safe enviroment.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease stop the planned cost-cutting changes to supervised play sessions.\r\nAs the \u00a3910,000 currently spent on supervised play at 10 locations across the city, is money well spent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
