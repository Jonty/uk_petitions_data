        "additional_details": "I believe \"Sir\" Norman Bettinson should have his Knighthood removed. He played a very big roll in the cover up after 96 Men, Woman and Children needlessly lost their lives during the Hillsbrough Disaster. As we are now and always have been very aware of this was due to the wrong decisions being made at the wrong time but what was to come in the day's, week's and month's after only made the Grief of the Disaster more unbelievable. The cover up grew more and more. Mr Bettinson it has been proved played a very big roll in that cover up. He does not deserve to keep his knighthood. Justice for the \"96\" YNWA Never forgotten x",
