        "action": "Call to reopen Okehampton-Tavistock Railway",
        "additional_details": "This Petition recognises the plan to reopen the rail line between Bere Alston and Tavistock.\r\nHowever this leaves 15.5 miles between Tavistock and Okehampton. This is a useful diversionary route and would help to increase capacity between Exeter and Plymouth. With only a few modifications at Bere Alston and Yeoford only a single track need be laid between Tavistock and Okehampton enabling an hourly service in each direction. This would be money well spent. I call on the Government to invest in this proposal, possibly with the help of Private Finance",
