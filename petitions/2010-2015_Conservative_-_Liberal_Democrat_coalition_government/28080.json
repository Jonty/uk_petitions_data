Expoitation by foreign companies must not be put above the sanctity of British graves irrespective of the historic importance of the wreck and commercial value of the cargo.\r\n\r\nIt is scandalous that the British Government should allow this desecration of British graves.  British lives from whatever period in our history are of greater value than any cargo or museum artefact.",
