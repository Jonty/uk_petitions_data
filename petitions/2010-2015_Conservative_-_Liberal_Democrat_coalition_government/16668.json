        "additional_details": "I believe we should not be punished if we need to smack our children. As a last resort we should be able to slap a child's legs or bottom as should teachers.\r\n\r\nTodays children need discipline and at times it needs to be tough. Children these days have no respect for thier Elder's or Teacher's as they know they cannot do anything. Im not talking about beating a child, but a smack if needed should not leave the Parent worried that social services are going to take action.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to see smacking legal again for Parents and Teachers then lets sign this petition and please pass it around Facebook. We have gone too soft in the last 15 years and kids need to learn respect. This Nanny State has become too Politically Correct and needs a good dose of Common Sense.",
