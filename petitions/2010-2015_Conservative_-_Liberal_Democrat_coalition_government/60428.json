Families on benefits get:\r\n\r\nOver 900 a year per child as a pupil premium - our local school use this for uniform, school trips, one to one tutoring and many other benefits.\r\n\r\nFree school meals\r\n\r\nAccess to charities and discounts, free milk etc\r\n\r\nLoads more\r\n\r\nWe are \u00a34 poorer per week before working costs such as travel than if I stayed at home with my children whilst hubby worked yet we do not get pupil premiums and help from charities. My children will miss residential trips I can't afford whilst non working families have them paid for by a pupil premium.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned beg the government to put more in place to help working families too.",
