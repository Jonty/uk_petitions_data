        "additional_details": "The present system of charges levied on Small Businesses for their Uniformed Business Rate\u2019s is totally unfair to small businesses, as the one man band shop, - say that of a baker or shoe repairman, has to pay the exact same Business Rates, as that of the multi-chained companies, like Greggs the Baker\u2019s, Clark\u2019s Shoes or Boots the chemist, - as businesses only get \u2018relief\u2019 according to the rateable value of the property.  So how this presently works-out, on your typical high street, you will, or I should say, you should or one might of once have seen \u2013 small one man band businesses in one shop and right next door to a multi chained conglomerate, such as those companies just quoted above, and whom are paying the very same business rates and rents as the one man band, this can't be fair, and would like the government to take some action in regards to this matter.
