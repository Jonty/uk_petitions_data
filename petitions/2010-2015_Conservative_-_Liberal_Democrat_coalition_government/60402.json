If you don't stop doing that Mr Cameron, this will be the final nail in your coffin. You WILL be placed on trial, at some time in the future, on a charge of treason.  That is an undertaking the people of this land WILL NOT renege upon, unlike you who has kept only one promise throughout your tenure and that was to succour foreign murderers and to fund their activity worldwide on any and all occasions rather than look after your own people.",
