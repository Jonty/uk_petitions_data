Make them work, make them clean up the mess, make them rebuild the communities which have been broken by them. Have them on a curfew order to remove their freedom these are punishments that also free up prison cells. I also feel fines should be harsher, bigger fine in the pocket will stop more people and it can also help the country financially.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Maximum-punishment-for-all-offenders-involved-in-the-riots/197125650347853  I have plenty of support on Facebook and its growing.",
