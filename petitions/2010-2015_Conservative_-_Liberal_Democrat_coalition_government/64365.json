        "additional_details": "We need to keep Selby alive and this wonderful North Yorkshire market town needs help.  Scrap car parking charges and get the Town bustling again. The local council can do it in Tadcaster so why not Selby, it seems daft that visitors are passing through simply because it's too expensive to stop. Lots of local businesses are now suffering and even closing. The local council gets an outside contractor to issue parking fines, abolish these and let us park free legally and safe and get Selby back up and running. ",
