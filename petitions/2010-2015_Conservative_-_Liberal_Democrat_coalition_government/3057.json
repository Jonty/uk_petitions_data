        "additional_details": "Island residents are heavily penalised for living on the Islands of the UK.  Ferries are very expensive and should be free for residents of the UK islands.  Predominentaly the cost of living is higher for island life yet salaries are mostly half of that on the mainland.  Having to pay excessive ferry fares to access mainland is unfair.  Fares are especially excessive and should be free when most ferry routes are EU subsidised life line services.",
