        "additional_details": "This petition is calling on the government to remove local authority\u2019s powers of issuing Parking Tickets (PCN) using any form of CCTV equipment. The only exception is for tickets issued to drivers using or parking on Bus Lanes. All other parking fines (PCN) can only be issued by police officers or traffic wardens.\r\n\r\nThe CCTV equipment in our towns and cities should be used to protect the local people by recording criminal activates like theft, muggings, murders, burglaries etc and not put people out of pocket for minor parking offences.\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition and help get our local governments to use the CCTV equipment in out towns to protect and serve the people and not fine people for parking offenses.\r\n",
