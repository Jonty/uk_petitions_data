Using this example, in the last 5 years I have paid in excess of \u00a36k National insurance. During a recent five month period of unemployment my \"contribution-based\" Jobseekers allowance paid me \u00a3130 per fortnight. So I received \u00a31300. Housing benefit totalled \u00a31500. So where did the other \u00a33200 go? How is anyone supposed to survive on \u00a365 a week, when by this example they are entitled to \u00a3225? So why do we pay out such a big chunk of our wages? I am fully aware and under no illusion that by the time I retire there will be no state pension available to me. The direct.gov website states this payment is to see people through times of hardship. Its a time of hardship. Jobs are short, wages are dropping, the cost of living is increasing and current fuel prices mean we are paying to work.",
