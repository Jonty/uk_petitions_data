        "additional_details": "Why does the government think that spending millions on the worst 120 families in the country is a complete waste of money, as most of it will go to hiring consultants and theorist to design the programme.   If those millions of pounds were given to local communities in the form of schools, youth service, family centres.  The money could then be spent on focusing on children who are showing signs of not engaging, providing parenting classes, giving young people extra help so that they can engage with learning and most of all give young people hope that they can improve their lives. Youth Centres are closing down, staff numbers are falling.  Yet the government wants to focus on the worst 120 families.  Just wasteful, headline grabbing news.",
