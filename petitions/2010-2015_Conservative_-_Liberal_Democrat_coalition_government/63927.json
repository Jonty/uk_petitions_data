The CPS is a lawyer and the evidence suggests that her plan is to hugely enrich lawyers to the extreme during her tenure.  The public MUST be reassured that lawyers are not working for each other in their taxpayer funded posts when they should be working for the people who pay their salaries.  The ONLY way to do this is through a public inquiry where the examining board consists of taxpayers, who are most adversely affected, as opposed to lawyers and politicians, who are least affected.",
