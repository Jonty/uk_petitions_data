        "additional_details": "The bail conditions assigned to Mr. Assange are draconian and inappropriate - many elements thereof are strikingly similar to those faced by accused murderers and convicted rapists. Aside from the fact that the charges potentially facing Mr. Assange (he has yet to be formally charged) are insubstantial and potentially politically motivated, keeping him under house arrest for such a lengthy period of time (seven months and counting) is a chronic injustice and must be addressed.",
