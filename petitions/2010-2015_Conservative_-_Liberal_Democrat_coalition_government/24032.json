        "additional_details": "Once again the Severn Bridge  tolls are to rise by 30p from 1st January 2012 to \u00a36 for cars. Small goods vehicles and small buses will have to pay \u00a312.10 - a 60p increase - while heavy goods vehicles and buses will pay \u00a318.10, an increase of 90p.\r\nIs there no end to the misery that these tolls bring on a daily basis to regular users who need to cross the bridge for work and business purposes. The bridge takes away a huge %age of my earnings every month and business users are being drawn away from the area because of this extra cost that will pull their profits right down. Its about time these tolls were of a sensible amount. Its all very well saying that these tolls help pay for the upkeep of the bridge but surely thats what road tax is for, after all it is a road! SO STOP ROBBING US!!",
