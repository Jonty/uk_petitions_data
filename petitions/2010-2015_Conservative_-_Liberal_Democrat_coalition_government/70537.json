It devalues the whole purpose of any punishment .\r\nIf there is a set term for, say, ABH or robbery, then having also committed the same crime upon another person, or  the same person, at either the same time or at another time, then there must be a separate term served in prison for each separate crime.\r\n\r\nNew Sentencing Guidelines must be given to stop Courts giving Concurrent Sentences.\r\n\r\n",
