        "additional_details": "Has the CSA failed in their 'duty of care' or their purpose? Have they caused you hardship because they have not acted upon the information that you as a single parent have given them? The Government need to look at cases of 10 years plus or cases that throughout their time have been referred to the Ombudsman and offer compensation to those who deserve it!! They are a law unto themselves and there is so much red tape. It really is a Government Department that needs looking at. It does not consider the emotional distress it inflicts upon single parent families who really do need the help and it appears to take so much from those who are willing to pay. Individual circumstances are essential and must be treated as such.",
