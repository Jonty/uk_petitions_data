        "additional_details": "Our benefit system is one of the most generous in the world, that attracts hundreds of thousands of immigrants each year. Yet according to Children in Need, 1 in 5 families in the UK live in poverty with many unable to provide their children breakfast.  If Child Benefit was changed to food and clothing vouchers there should be no hungry children in the UK and the benefit would be going directly to the children and not the parents.",
