I was scammed out of \u00a3400 for goods I never received.\r\n  I was told by police that there's nothing I can do other than report it to the London fraud office.\r\nMy bank told me there's nothing I can do as I willingly sent the money over via bank transfer.\r\n\r\nBasically I have been told that the person that took my money and didn't send the goods has done nothing wrong and it's my fault.\r\n\r\nThis has to change, as I read story after story of these scammers getting away with this as there's no justice system in place to sort this issue out.\r\n\r\nIf somebody stole from you in the street it's a crime. If somebody scams you online it seems to be okay. It is not. This has to change. Sign and share to be heard. ",
