        "additional_details": "Corrupt foreign \"goverments\" which steal charity funds/resources intended for local people - need to be rooted out. There needs to be a strong will from the International Community (with our UK government pushing for this).\r\n\r\nThe UN requires a presence on the ground and needs to be involved in the \"dishing out\" of funds to local people/ventures - to help produce local jobs.\r\nThus helping to stem the tide of asylum seekers.\r\nAll public & private money raised in the UK should be SENT TO THE UN - (freeing up UK Admin & work required, saving money) and administered by the UN as a collective organisation - together with the money raised by other countries. This should be backed up by UN military to enforce correct distribution.\r\n\r\nNet effect is help towards solving asylum seeking issue; a reduction in UK public money sent overseas; & privately raised charity money redirected internally to other very important causes.\r\n",
