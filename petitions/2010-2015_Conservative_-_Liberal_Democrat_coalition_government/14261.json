        "additional_details": "I propose an extension of the current stamp duty holiday for properties under \u00a3250,000, which ends in March 2012. The property market is still stagnant and needs this incentive to continue to not only help ignite the property market but also help struggling First Time Buyers who in the current economic market are already finding it increasingly difficult to raise the money to buy their First Home. By keeping this to properties under \u00a3250,000 we will be targeting this relief to the lower threshold of earners who are more likely to be struggling to raise a deposit. ",
