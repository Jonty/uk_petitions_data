        "additional_details": "Reduce the standard working week to four days (Monday-Thursday).\r\n\r\nThe additional day of rest will lead to increased productivity during the four working days. I do not believe the economy would suffer from this action. It may even improve because people will work more effectively on the four working days, with more energy and creativity as a result of being happier and well rested. People would generally be happier which will have a positive impact on society more widely. The additional leisure time will encourage greater family engagement and provide people extra time to take part in charity or community work. There may also be health benefits. Ultimately we shouldn't be living to work - life/work balance needs to be addressed.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to see this happen please spread the word. We need big numbers for action!",
