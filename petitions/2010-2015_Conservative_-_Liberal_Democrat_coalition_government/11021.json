        "additional_details": "In view of recent rioting in major cities it is clear harsher punishments are required to deter people from committing these type of crimes in the future.  This petition proposes the following:\r\n1) Introduction of chain gangs so those convicted are made to repair damage caused plus are visible to all.\r\n2) Reintroduction of the birch for those convicted.\r\n3) Mandatory custodial sentences regardless of criminal history.  Minimum should be 2 years and maximum at the judges discretion.  Those found guilty of assaulting the public and police need to be dealt with particularly harshly.",
