        "additional_details": "The 2008 coinage design is visually offensive and sexually explicit to the point of obscenity. I would like the government to revert to the pre-2008 coinage.\r\n\r\nThe new design is cleverly contrived and features a phallus. When the all coins are arranged in their proper form, the shield design can be seen and it is clear that an obvious phallus has been incorporated into the Irish harp.\r\n\r\nThis phallus is not a traditional part of the harp of the royal shield. The present coat of arms has been designed by a college graduate.\r\n\r\nThe design is obscene and offends the dignity of everyone in the country.\r\n\r\nBritannia on the 50p was a popular coin and a symbol of this country. Britannia is a symbol of Britain. Taking this symbol of Britons away from the people in favour of some amateurish modern art fiasco is just a form of persecution.\r\n\r\nI will also start a petition that calls for criminal charges to be brought to the perpetrators of this monstrous act of cultural vandalism.",
