Provision shall be made within the Act to remove the obstacle of wealth and property being hidden behind 'front' family members or offshore mechanisms. In keeping with current legal principles in certain circumstances, the Investigated Person shall not have the right to silence without inference of guilt, and refusal to co-operate with Investigators questioning shall be an admission of guilt before the courts.
