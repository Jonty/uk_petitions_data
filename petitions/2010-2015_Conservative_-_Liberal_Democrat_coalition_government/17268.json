        "additional_details": "The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) has been refused a classification by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) because of its explicit content.\r\n\r\nThe film will be released in the USA on October 7, 2011 and has already been released in Australia. It is a British film and we understand its content but why should other countries get to see it and not us in the UK? Passing the film with an '18' certificate would be perfectly plausible.\r\n\r\nWe want the film released in the United Kingdom either via a Blu-Ray/DVD release or even in cinemas nationwide.\r\n\r\nThe efforts by the British crew who worked hard on the film should be praised and the film should not be withheld from the British public. The public understand that some scenes may cause distress but it is simply our choice whether we watch the film or not and those who want to watch it should be allowed to do so.",
