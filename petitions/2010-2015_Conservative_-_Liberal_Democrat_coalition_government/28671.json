As Mr Poots, his department and the hospitals are public bodies, and are given the position of trust by the people of Northern Ireland, it is unacceptable that the Northern Ireland public be denied access to this means of lawful examination and understanding surrounding the tragedy. The people of Northern Ireland therefore request a Public Enquiry into this incident.",
