        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the creation of a statutory requirement for all company directors employed in companies with a turnover greater than \u00a35million and employing more than 50 staff to be required to do annual CPD to ensure that they are up-to-date with regards their skills, and that they are competent to carry out the duties required of a company director. This would help ensure that stakeholders and shareholders interests would be looked after, and that directors would be sufficiently skilled. The CPD courses could be run by the Institute of Directors (IOD) and several UK business schools to ensure quality and a focus on real business/organisational needs. ",
