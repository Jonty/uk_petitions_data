        "additional_details": "Bsl has not worked in the Uk. All it has acheived is the killing of innocent family pets, causing misery to familys some resulting in suicides, not targetted unresponsible dog owners and put tremendous pressure on the tax payers purse.  When these dogs targetted have done nothing wrong but fell into this catogory.  These dog have caused no threat to society and done no wrong.  Bsl doesnt tackle the problem of uncontrolled dogs due to bad dog ownership &  criminalises innocent dogs. All it has done has seized family pets that lived with families for years because of the way they look.Doesn't help to tackle the cause of the problem of uncontrolled dogs and only criminalises innocent dogs that have done nothing wrong , the  majority of which lived happily with a family for many years, but are taken away and killed purely because of how they look. End Bsl sign the petition",
