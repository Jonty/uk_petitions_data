In my humble opinion it looks horrendous and will have a significant impact on traffic movement at the junction with the main road, feeding back past the surgery.\r\n\r\n To look at the plans, please go to the Wyre B.C. planning applications site and look up the reference 14/00457/FUL. I think it is still possible to send in comments, so I shall be looking up the Government Inspector's comments on the area around the junction. I hope that as many as possible will also express their opinions. The two people who have commented so far have made some valid comments.\r\n",
