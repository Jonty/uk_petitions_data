        "additional_details": "The government has permitted mass immigration to occur by signing treaties and through the drafting of certain laws which make deportation difficult. The Government must do everything possible, including repealing whichever laws and withdrawing from treaties necessary to reverse the damage done to the country through mass immigration permitted by the previous Government, and restore the country's demographics as close as possible to the ethnic makeup of the country that was evident in 1992. Laws are to be written which permit mass deportation to take place unhindered by lengthy and costly legal processes.",
