No.\r\n\r\nBy public places we mean: parks, bus stops, outside hospitals and anywhere on the streets.\r\n\r\nIn the long run passive smoking kills because smokers have made the choice to inhale life threatening drugs, but people who have made the choice not to are still getting affected\u2026how is this fair?! Smokers are worse than burglars so if the government can protect you from them why can\u2019t they protect you from smokers?\r\n\r\nWe just want the government to ban smoking in all public places so innocent people don't get harmed. So please, help us and everyone else and do something about it before it\u2019s too late and sign this petition.",
