        "additional_details": "I propose an enhance military service, where both boys and girls aged between 16-18 years old leave school and are conscripted into the British Army. Here they will go on a 26 week course, where they will be taught to change oil in cars, fuse a plug, personal hygenine, basic first aid.\r\nThey will go on physical exercises where they learn team building, map reading, fence building, and so on. After 26 weeks, they move to self defence, plumbing, electrics, painting, computer skills, and other trades.\r\nFinally for their final 52 weeks, they will specialise in an area of work they want to go into, but under strict military supervision, plus lots of physical exercise. They will be paid a wage while serving in the army and this can be used to pay for education or given as a lump sum, when they get a mortgage and act as a deposit. It will not be given as cash.\r\nThis regime will ensure that EVERY child leaving the service will have the skills needed in life.",
