This results in large numbers of people NOT voting and an ever decreasing number of votes needed, to allow unwanted parties into power.\r\nI would like to see on the Ballot paper the following. \"NONE OF THE ABOVE\", to be added to allow people to vote and show their displeasure with the parties seeking election.\r\nThis is done in many Countries and has resulted in a more active election and it also shows the Balloted parties that the public is unhappy and NOT apathetic.",
