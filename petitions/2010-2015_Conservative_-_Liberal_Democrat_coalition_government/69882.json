        "additional_details": "It is time to recognise that the only long term solution to keeping the UK together is for the UK government to move around the UK, spending, say, 5 years in each constituent country's capital. How many times did the SNP refer to the 'Westminster Government' during the 'Yes' campaign?\r\n\r\nTo provide regional focus, assemblies in each country can remain (and a new one will be required for England) but no longer will there be pressure for them to be constantly strengthened. Let's face it, devolving more powers to the assemblies may appease nationalists in the short term, but greater devolution only brings each country a step closer to independence.\r\n\r\nWhy has nobody mentioned this obvious solution in the post- referendum debates?\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and put pressure on Government to make this happen. With this proposal we'll really have, and most likely will always have, a United Kingdom.",
