        "additional_details": "I want to bring in an animal licence. The licence must be purchased for the price of \u00a335 before buying any animal then adding any additional animals will cost \u00a35 per animal. For people already owning pets / animals they must apply for a licence within 3 months of the new licence scheme coming out. The licence covers all animals including aquatics and exotics (aquatics at a price of a maximum of 10 fish per application \u00a35). In order for people to keep the licence animals (that can go to a vet or a vet can visit them) must see a vet for a health check on a yearly basis at which time they can renew that animal on the licence at a renewal fee of just \u00a32. For full terms and conditions plus a full overview please contact nicola01986@hotmail.com\r\n",
