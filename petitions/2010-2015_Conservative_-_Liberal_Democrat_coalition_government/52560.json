FN should be reinstated to the curriculum as a key significant political and humanitarian influencer of her era.\r\nGiven the significant contribution made by FN to nursing education and professionalism and her wider influence on public health and the treatment of the families of troops serving their country, it is critical that her actions and influence are taught as an inspiration for future generations.",
