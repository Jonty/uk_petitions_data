        "additional_details": "There are far too many people in positions of power these days, who are striking deals for personnel gain with no consideration for the people at all they are representing. People are suffering in all aspects of life in the UK and things are getting worse by the day. MP's are failing with simple decision making and they need to be made accountable for their actions and treason would be the only way to sort this shambles out. Examples of shocking decision making - 2 wars started in search for weapons of mass destruction, this will effect generations for decades in the UK? Lockerbie bomber Mr Megrahi's release, this is the biggest slap in the face ever to the victims relatives and justice. If you are powerful you need to be accountable for your actions and the decisions being made, this is just not happening in the UK",
