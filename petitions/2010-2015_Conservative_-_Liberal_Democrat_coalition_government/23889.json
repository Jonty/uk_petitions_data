The Government is proceeding with rationalising the number of MP's, but I ask, what need is there for County Councillors? What purpose do they actually serve? We have very gifted and highly qualified Local Government Officers, but their work is very often undone by generally unqualified retired people with no actual specific knowledge. Local Government Officers often spend many years gaining qualifications to serve their local communities best, but then have to report to Councillors who can overule all of their work instantly without any experience or qualifications. This must stop for the good of our Country. Removing ALL Councillors from their posts and allowing qualified Government personnel to carry out their duties will save our Country a vast amount of money.",
