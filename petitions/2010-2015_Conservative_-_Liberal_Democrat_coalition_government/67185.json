        "additional_details": "This petition is calling on the Department for Education to alter the KS1 National Curriculum to incorporate more education about female figures in history.\r\n\r\nThroughout KS1, children are taught about Romans, Tudors, Ancient Egyptians and World War 2, however, little emphasis is placed on women in these time periods such as Queen Elizabeth I, Cleopatra, Boudicca and the many women who served in the military.\r\n\r\nTo help combat inequality, and give children more to look up to other than Kings, Soldiers and Footballers, young girls in particular would benefit from learning about vital women's history (such as the Suffragette movement, sporting heroes and other icons like those mentioned above).\r\n\r\nBy changing the curriculum to incorporate detailed education about female historical figures, this would bring a balance to children's early education concerning how both men AND women have contributed to history and society.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to support change and equality.",
