        "additional_details": "The college of North east london in Tottenham is being forced to shut down in order to save 5.7 million pounds. Without this nursery,  I would not have been able to go to college as I have 2 children, meaning the cost for an outside nursery would be extortionate. Without them, I wouldn't be at university today. This nursery has an outstanding ofsted inspection and is full of first aiders. I call for someone to do something about this because without that nursery,  I highly doubt people will find the motivation to go to college to create a better life for themselves! ",
