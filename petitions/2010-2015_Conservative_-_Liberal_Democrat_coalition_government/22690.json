This is obscene when fuel tax is going up 8p a litre next year, when pensioners fuel allowance has been cut by 25% from \u00a3400 a year to \u00a3300 a year, and that our retirement pension age is going up to 67 years. This is our money, and it should be used for the people of this country, wether it be schools, hospitals, or the safety of this nation. In fact a lot of this aid goes to reasonably well off countries such as, India, Nigeria, who have a large oil export market, South Africa, and the list goes on. Charity is meant to begin at home. Let's start it now.",
