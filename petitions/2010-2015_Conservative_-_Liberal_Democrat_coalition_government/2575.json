Life should mean life in prison, 10 years should mean 10 years!\r\nThe GOVERMENT as a whole need to have a fresh look at the entire justice system and stop making excuses such as prison over crowding. Build these super prisons!\r\nYes it will cost to build and house these offenders but crime will fall massively, eventually passing on a saving to the tax payer. Victims will again have faith in the justice system.\r\n\r\nDo these offender who break into your house, steal your car or assault you, need a TV in their cell?\r\nShould they be allowed out into the public domain as long as they return in the evening? What sort of punishment is that!\r\nI call for the government to revamp the justice system taking into account the VICTIM\u2019S views\r\nLess offenders on the street = less crime, it's simple?\r\nLet's debate weather prison should continue to be a holiday camp or place that is feared by offenders.\r\n\r\nPlease support this petition and make a difference\r\n",
