        "additional_details": "Four Parish Councillors from the village of Preston in East Riding of Yorkshire submitted statements to the Standards Committee of East Riding of Yorkshire Council knowing them to be false during an investigation into the behaviour of one of the Parish Councillors, who had aggressively attacked a resident during a council meeting, the attack was entirely unprovoked.\r\n\r\nThe false witness statements of these councillors created an equality of opinion by reversing the roles of the aggressor and victim and thereby succeeded in preventing the councillor facing any disciplinary action.\r\n\r\nThe actions of these councillors have brought our Parish Council into disrepute; an independent investigation is needed to restore the good name of Preston Parish Council.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails are on \u201cPreston Parish Council Problems\u201d please Google it.\r\n",
