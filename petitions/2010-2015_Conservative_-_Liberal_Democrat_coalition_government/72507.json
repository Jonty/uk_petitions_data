        "additional_details": "Since the ban on smoking in public buildings, the UK has been plagued with the unpleasant site, smell, and mess caused by smokers congregating outside buildings to smoke.\r\n\r\nThis causes offence to those entering and leaving buildings, and to building owners who are faced with this ugly site outside their otherwise clean, tidy, and welcoming premises.\r\n\r\nIt is now virtually impossible to enter an office building, a railway station, a hospital, or other public building without encountering this blight, it is virtually impossible to find a table outside a pub or restaurant which isn\u2019t occupied by smokers, and often difficult to find a bus stop, or other gathering place free from smoke and it's associated debris.\r\n\r\nWe, the signatories of this petition, ask the UK Government, to amend the law, to prohibit smoking within 10 meters of any building entrance, and at places where people gather.\r\n",
