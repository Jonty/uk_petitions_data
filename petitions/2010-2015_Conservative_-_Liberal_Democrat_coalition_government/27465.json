However just as provisional car drivers have to show the required competence to drive to begin with, so should drivers show they still have the required skill to continue to drive on the roads in Britain today. That is why the undersigned request the government look into the matter of a 'skills' update test from the age of 70 to show that a car driver is medically and technically proficient to maintain their licence to drive.",
