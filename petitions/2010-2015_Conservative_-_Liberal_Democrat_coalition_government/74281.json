        "additional_details": "I would like the government to consider giving tax relief to people who take out private health insurance. Private health insurance takes pressure off the already overstretched NHS which benefits everyone.\r\nAt the moment the government actually taxes people more for having private health insurance which, to me seems to be the wrong way round.\r\nI believe that if there was tax relief then this would encourage more people to take out private insurance and therefore benefit the whole country by taking pressure off the NHS.",
