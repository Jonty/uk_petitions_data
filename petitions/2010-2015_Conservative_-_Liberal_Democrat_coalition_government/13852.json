If you are an unmarried partner, regardless of the duration of your relationship, these rules do not apply. The UKBA considers unmarried relationships durable and significant enough to issue a visa in the first place. No woman should stay in an abusive relationship because of her immigration position. This is a lacuna in the law and it needs to change. ",
