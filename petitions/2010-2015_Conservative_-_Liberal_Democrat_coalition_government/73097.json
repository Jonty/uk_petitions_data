        "additional_details": "I'm calling for a footbridge to be built at Bilbrough Top Services on the A64 between Tadcaster and York, a flyover was built a number of years ago for safe access to the services by road traffic but its simply too far for people to use to cross the few meters from the eastbound services to the westbound services, the number of pedestrian fatalities here is shocking and urgent action needs taking.\r\nIf the footbridge could be built around the Little Chef/Travelodge area this would allow people to cross safely at a location where most people at present must cross by foot over a 70MPH dual carriageway, once a bridge is constructed a wire safety fence can then be added in the central reserve to stop anyone crossing by foot, we cannot stand by and let this keep happening, please support",
