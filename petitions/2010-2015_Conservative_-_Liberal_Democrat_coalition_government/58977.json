        "additional_details": "Whaling is nothing more than a sick and cruel activity. It has no purpose in the 21st century world and should be stopped now. The general purpose is that the British Government should put more increasing pressure onto the Japanese government about it's illegal whaling activities. If Japanese don't respond then the British government should send vessels to stop their illegal activities.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese are exploiting a loophole in the International Whaling Commision (IWC) 1982 ban on commercial whaling by claiming that they do so called 'scientific research' but no sufficient evidence have back up the Japanese claims.\r\n\r\nJapan must be made to understand:\r\n\r\na) the precarious state of the oceans' ecosystems today brought on\r\n   mainly by overfishing and whaling;\r\nb) the invaluable part whales play in keeping the oceans healthy;\r\nc) why humans depend for survival on a healthy ocean; and\r\nd) a healthy ocean overrides short-term profits from killing whales.\r\n",
