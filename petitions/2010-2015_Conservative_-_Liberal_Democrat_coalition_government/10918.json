        "additional_details": "On Dec7 at a close vote for a \u00a39K fee cap The Higher Education White Paper was unwritten. It was unclear that: many bodies would set \u00a39K fees; \u00a39K fees are to be part reallocated as fee waiver to others; Scots &Welsh would opt out; & Students may have over \u00a350K final debt with no \u00a3100K graduate gain for many. Government can't give current 2012 applicants details about early repayment, on how institutions use & spend fees, & until Sep2012 Key Information course by course. To bring in the new fee system there must be legislative change i.e. for early loan repayment penalties. Subject to parliamentary time a Higher Education Bill will be brought to Parliament in 2012. We propose Government does not implement the \u00a39K fee cap until: 1.Parliamentary time is given for full debate & vote on The Higher Education Bill that changes the primary legislation & in light of new detail that this includes a second vote on a \u00a39K fee cap. 2 \u00a39K applicants get the information the Government says they need ",
