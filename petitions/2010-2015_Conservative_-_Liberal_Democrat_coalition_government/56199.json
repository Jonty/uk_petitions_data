        "additional_details": "There is a major problem faced in London buses which is directly related to the behaviour of the drivers.\r\n- A great fraction of London Bus drivers start the vehicle before the passengers have settled in their seats or found a pole to hold on from.\r\nThis behaviour of the bus drivers poses a major hazard for the passengers with high likely-hood, due to the frequency of these behaviours, and highly dangerous consequences that may result to major injuries including broken bones, musculo-skeletal disorders and even death.\r\n\r\nThis is unacceptable, especially for the capital of one of the most Health and Safety compliance-friendly countries.\r\n\r\nThis petition aims to urge the Department for Transport to re-visit the regulations for the driving behaviour of London bus drivers.\r\n",
