Much confusion however is being caused by seemingly 'public' spaces, most notably open-air retail spaces, turning out, in fact, to be private land.\r\n\r\nI propose a change to our laws whereby, should a private land owner develop their land as a retail environment, then, for the purposes of public debate, freedom of speech and public access, the land be designated as public space.
