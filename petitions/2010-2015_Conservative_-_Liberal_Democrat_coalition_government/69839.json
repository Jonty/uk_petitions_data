        "additional_details": "Many cycle paths have been created, often at considerable cost, to provide a safer alternative to busy main roads for cyclists and, more importantly, to reduce the significant congestion cause by cyclists who would otherwise impede smooth traffic flow.  Despite this, a significant number of cyclists continue to use the roads instead of cycle paths; and invariably ignore traffic lights and other aspects of the Highway Code.  Motorists, who pay road tax, do not have the choice of two roads to use and neither should cyclists, who pay no road tax and are also uninsured in the event of any accident they cause.  The law should be changed to mandate cyclists to use cycle paths, and / or cycle lanes, where \u2018installed\u2019 and make it a road traffic offence for non-compliance.  Roads for road tax payers, cycle paths for cyclists.",
