However, elected governments tend to deviate from their manifesto pledges.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I suggest all political parties must outline courses of action in their manifesto, regarding every imaginable issue that affects any member of society, regardless of how many people it affects. This must include issues raised by any member of the public. It should outline when any potential changes would occur if the party were in power. Parties should implement their policies on schedule, without fail. Should they wish to deviate from a pledge, the electorate must ratify these changes. Under a potential coalition, a new manifesto should be created that doesn\u2019t infringe on policy promises expressed in the two parties\u2019 manifestos. If this is not possible, another election should occur, as no party would be obligated to commit to any course of action.",
