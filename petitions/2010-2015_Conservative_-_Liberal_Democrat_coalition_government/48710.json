        "additional_details": "The Department of Health said 90 per cent of prescription items are prescribed free. Many people do not have to pay, including schoolchildren, pensioners and the unemployed.  So It won't make much difference if the rest of our prescriptions are prescribed free as well!!!\r\nAs well as this all UK taxpayers pay the same rate of tax. It is absolutely unfair that free NHS prescriptions are available to citizens of Wales and Scotland but not to those people who are  living in England.\r\n  Also from the 1st of April prescription costs have increased yet again from \u00a37.65 to \u00a37.85.\r\n\r\n Lets put an end to this and get free NHS prescriptions for everyone in England and stop paying ridiculously expensive  prescriptions that are only getting more expensive!!!\r\n",
