        "action": "Reduce VAT on Veterinary Treatments and Medications",
        "additional_details": "Since the recession started after the banking crisis in 2008 and further measures by the chancellor like increasing VAT to 20% have caused the number of pets like cats and dogs to be abandoned by their owners leading to Rescue Centres unable to house and look after abandoned pets.  Some Councils and Rescue centres are putting down health pets because they cannot afford to house these abandoned pets.\r\nThis petition would reduce the level of VAT from 20% to 10% or 5% on all medical treatments and medications provided by Veterinary Centres, Pet  hospitals, PDSA, and RSPCA medical treatments centres to help reduce the amount of pets being abandoned and help Rescue centres cope with the demand of unwanted pets.\r\nThe VAT cut on Veterinary treatments a year less than \u00a340 million and the cost of looking after abandoned pets will be reduced on Councils and charity organisations like the RSPCA.\r\n",
