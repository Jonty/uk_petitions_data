Based on this track record, Government agencies lack the capability to keep UK citizens data truly private. If HMRC go down this road of selling anonymised data, it is only a matter of time before additional information is supplied by mistake or maliciously to these third parties.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned, petition Her Majesties Government to stop this sale of UK taxpayers data taking place by any Government department or agency.",
