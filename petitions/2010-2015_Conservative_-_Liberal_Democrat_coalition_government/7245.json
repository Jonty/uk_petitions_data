Currently innocent citizens are losing their homes, their livelyhoods, their local community. In a civilised society this can't be acceptable to allow innocent people suffer at the hands of criminals.\r\n\r\nPolice should be allowed to use batons, tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons, tazers, dogs, etc. whatever means necessary against these criminals without question and without disrepute later in order to protect innocent residents and businesses, and deter criminals from acting out.",
