        "additional_details": "I recently visited my local MP and during the course of the discussion it became clear that for the nation to become truly sustainable to avoid the effects of fossil fuel dependency, there would have to be a declaration of a national emergency and the suspension of parlimentary elections.  He felt unable to raise the issue in parliament himself so I thought I would raise the issue here.\r\n\r\nSeveral calories of fossil fuels (some estimate around 9) are burned for each calorie of food we eat.  Fossil fuels are running out.  Our food reserves are very low, as are our own natural resources, so we are risking food shortages in the future.  Our skills are not suited to a sustainable way of living.  We may even be too overpopulated for sustainable farming to feed us, and probably have too few trees to maintain sustainable firewood.\r\n\r\nSuspending elections is a big step - but what are the alternatives?\r\n",
