They are not marketed with the days of the week showing and so for older people, it is very easy for them to take more than one dose as they can become confused as to whether they have taken them or not, and there is no way to tell.  Given the high toxicity of these drugs it should be mandatory for manufacturers to put the days of the week on packaging.",
