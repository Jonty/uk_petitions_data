        "additional_details": "Deborah MacKay was awarded \u00a3705.000 by the NHS Litigation Authority after they failed to spot Spina Bifida in her unborn son Calum. The money was to care for Calum until he was 10. Sadly Deborah had to then grieve the death of Calum when he died aged six.\r\n\r\nThe NHS Litigation Authority is requesting \u00a3375.000 is refunded to them basically cause her son failed to reach the age of 10. This will result in Deborah losing her home.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned request the the Heath Secretary personally intervenes and waives the request of a refund.\r\n\r\nDeborah had a child who was very ill which no doubt would of been very hard for her. Then to lose her son is heartbreaking, but to then have the indignity of the NHS Litigation Authority to ask for 375k back and take her home is grotesque.\r\n\r\n",
