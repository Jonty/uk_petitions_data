        "additional_details": "Over the past few decades there has been a significant minority of youths who have failed to learn respect and behave responsibly.\r\n\r\nThey have created mayhem in the classroom, been antisocial on the streets and recently we have seen them riot and loot our cities creating fear and destroying the businesses which keep our fragile economy afloat.\r\n\r\nTherefore we propose the introduction of compulsory summer camps for troubling youths where they learn army style discipline.\r\n\r\nThe mission of this policy is to restore discipline to our classrooms, improve the educational experience for teachers & students while restoring lasting order on our streets.",
