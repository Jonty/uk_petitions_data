I do not understand why we need it to be light at 4am/5am waking us all up in a morning when we could have extra light on an evening after work.I dont think changing the current time situation in winter makes any difference. So why cannot we put the clocks forward 2 hours instead of one, but leave winter as it currently is . This would solve Scotland dark mornings problem but give everybody extra leisure time on an evening ",
