        "additional_details": "The 50cc/30mph restriction on 16 year old bikers might seem like a good idea to protect them, however being forced to go that slowly means that more die from being hit by overtaking vehicles than would die as a result of being able to ride fast enough to keep up with the traffic flow.  If they were allowed 100cc bikes with a top speed of 60mph and maybe the same 100kw/tonne power to weight ratio that all other learner riders have (or slighly lower) then they would be able to keep up with the traffic as opposed to being knocked off their bikes into ditches and killed by overtaking vehicles.",
