        "additional_details": "Sign this petition if you would like to see the Government give Police forces more powers to deal with violent disorder, which recently has stemmed from public protests in UK cities. I would like to see the Police using water cannon, baton rounds, tear gas or other non-lethal incapacitants more often, as these methods are used in many other democratic Countries around the world. I believe that everyone has the right to protest peacefully but I am tired of seeing the Police unable to intervene more directly to protect the public and property when protests turn into riots.",
