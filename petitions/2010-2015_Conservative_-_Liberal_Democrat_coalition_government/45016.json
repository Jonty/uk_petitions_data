        "action": "Ban of e-cigarette advertising on British TV and media",
        "additional_details": "Today I saw the first British advert for E-Lites electronic cigarettes\r\n\r\nThe validity of electronic cigarettes has not been proved and though the product contains no tar or tobacco, the addictive element is still present (Nicotine). This is contained within the vapour that the product vents through normal usage, thus exposing other people to the hazards of nicotine. In the same way that cigarettes release invisible toxins and unhealthy elements into the air for others to passively smoke, the same can be said about e-cigs and these e-lites.\r\n\r\nThe allowance of e-lites (and any potentially future cleared adverts) could be seen as a socially and morally acceptable standard for smoking in places where smoking is not allowed or accepted (cinemas, food establishments, place of employment).\r\n\r\nThe 1965 Act for the ban on tobacco products being advertised should be brought up to date to include tobacco and e-cigarette products.\r\n",
