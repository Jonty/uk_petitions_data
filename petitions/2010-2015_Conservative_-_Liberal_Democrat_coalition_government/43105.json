        "additional_details": "BCC (British Chambers of Commerce) research has suggested that a third runway at Heathrow would create 65,000 new jobs and provide a \u00a321 billion boost to the struggling UK economy, all financed by private sector (BAA).\r\n\r\nEnvironmentally, a third runway would cause no increase in worldwide emissions. The new BRIC routes are now being taken up by other hubs instead, such as Schipol (Amsterdam) Charles De Gaulle (Paris) and Dubai International Airport (where no of flights set to overtake Heathrow by 2015). Furthermore, the holding patterns needed due to overcrowding of London's airspace (due to a lack of capacity at Heathrow) actually mean more emissions and noise.\r\n\r\nWe ask that the government immediately give a green light to a third runway, an issue that is essential for the UK's prosperity in an increasingly competitive world.\r\n\r\n",
