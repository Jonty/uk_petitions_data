        "additional_details": "For too long, our money has been invested in private banks with predatory lending policies, who conjure money from thin air via so-called derivatives as mortgages and loans. Instead of investing public money in private banks, all money raised in taxes, fines, council tax or any other public funding should be invested in a public bank, created by the UK govt, and incorporated as a Ltd company, under FSA regulation.  Branches should be in every UK city, town, village.  This bank should attract investment by allowing private investors to save and  make their funds available for loans that favour SME's and homebuyers.  The interest raised should be disbursed through a combination of dividends to private investors and re-investment.  The bailout money lent to the private banks should be repaid to the public bank with interest starting immediately from the time the public bank is incorporated and established.
