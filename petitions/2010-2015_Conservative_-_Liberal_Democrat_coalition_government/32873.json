        "additional_details": "This petition calls on Her Majesty's Government to abolish the planned changes to Sunday trading laws around the Olympic and Paralympic Games. These potential changes will have a huge detrimental effect, to not only small businesses, but workers themselves. Workers in this country are, and always should be entitled to have a day in which, if they so choose, they can spend their time away from the workplace. This is of great importance to the overwhelming majority of shop-workers in this country and these proposed changes would severely effect these workers morale. Shoppers already have 150 hours a week in which shops are open so the UK is very much open for business.",
