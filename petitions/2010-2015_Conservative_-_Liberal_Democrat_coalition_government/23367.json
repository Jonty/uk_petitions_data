        "additional_details": "Merseyside Police are being forced to cut an expected 800 police officer jobs and 1000 civilian staff jobs due to government funding being cut by 20%. Merseyside Police is hit harder by this reduction than most other forces in the country. Merseyside Police need to maintain at least 4000 Police officers to do their job efficiently  and protect the public in Merseyside.  If these cuts are made  it  will   leave the  law abiding people in Merseyside with a reduced Police Force.The people of Merseyside deserve to have an appropriate Police presence on its streets and we call on the Government to stop these cuts.",
