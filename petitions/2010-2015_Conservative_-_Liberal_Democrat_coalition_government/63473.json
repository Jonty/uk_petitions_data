She voted for the Bedroom tax for anyone in social housing who had an additional bedroom and yet was claiming benefit, public money, for her own empty bedroom. This was a deliberate act and as a result she should be sacked and prosecuted as would happen to any member of the public if they acted in such a way.  ",
