I fail to understand why convicted murderers and sex offenders are not evicted. I wish a debate in the house and a law passed that if any person in social housing is convicted of a crime they and their families are evicted the same as those involved in the riots.\r\n\r\nThis would be fair, what is good for one is good for another.",
