        "additional_details": "As a teacher with experience in state education I firmly believe that the most important step towards helping children from all walks of life is to reduce class sizes. Children don't need multi million pound buildings, they need attention. They need someone to know who they are and genuinely care about them. Teachers do not need new government schemes they simply need less children in the classroom. Money must be spent employing more teachers if we are to close the ever widening social divide. I have spoken to a large number of normal, hard working classroom teachers and they unanimously agree. Please consider this as it is genuinely what the children of this country need. ",
