It was a horrific event, fought for no purpose, and saw the deaths of 10,000,000 people, one-tenth of whom were British soldiers, sailors, and airmen. Remembrance of it should not be nationalistic or patriotic or a celebration but an international memorial event where all countries who fought come together to remember those who died for the sake of the vanity of the politicians.",
