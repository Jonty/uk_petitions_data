No planes, trains or automobiles. No factory machinery thumping away. No noisy builders. No lawnmowers. No neighbours music. No working. No DIY. No TV or radio. No air-conditioning humming away. No phones. No doubt you have your own thoughts or suggestions. Can you imagine what it would be like? How peaceful it would be? I'm 54. Any possibility of this even reaching the discussion stage before I shuffle of this mortal coil? Please? Pretty please?  ",
