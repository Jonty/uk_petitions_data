        "additional_details": "We are campaigning for key workers in the UK to receive an higher salary because we believe that they deserve it for the jobs that they do. These are the people that fight for our country, protect our country and look after the people in our country and care for their safety. These are also the people that teach us everything that we know as without key workers in education, none of us would even be able to read or write to a relevant standard. There are some key workers that put their lives on the line for our country and there are others that saves lives in our country, and in the majority of cases these people earn less than people who are personal trainers and bin men? This is why we are campaigning to make a change for the key workers to receive a well-earned incerase in salary.",
