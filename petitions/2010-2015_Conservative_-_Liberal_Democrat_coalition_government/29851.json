        "additional_details": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is an organic compound used in a wide variety of products, mostly plastics.\r\n\r\nVarious studies have linked BPA to prostate and breast cancer, while another showed it can affect brain function in lab rats.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it can lead to an increased production of insulin. If there is too much insulin created, the body can become 'immune' to its effects - leading to weight gain and type 2 diabetes.\r\n\r\nA 2009 study on Chinese workers in BPA factories found that they were four times more likely to report erectile dysfunction and reduced sexual desire than workers with no heightened BPA exposure.\r\n\r\nIt has already been banned in Canada.\r\n\r\n",
