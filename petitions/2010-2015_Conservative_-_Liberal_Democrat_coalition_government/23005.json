This is aimed at rolling-back and denying the public any ability to initiate Parliamentary Debate on issues affecting them.\r\n\r\nWe consider the current threshold of 100,000 signatures is already too high; the proposals to raise the bar even higher would be indicative of contemptuous Government keen to sever and isolate itself from the electorate.\r\n\r\nWe urge the Government to maintain not only e-petitions, but promote other forms of interaction between itself and the public.
