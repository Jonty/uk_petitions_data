        "additional_details": "Paul Dacre is the Head Editor of the Daily Mail and also publishes articles in the same newspaper. These articles particulaly \"One Cannabis Joint can cause schizophrenia\" (winner of the orwellian prize i.e the award for most scientific errors in one report.) The PCC are meant to keep journalist from breaking their ethical code and from lieing for their own personal gains. As head of the PCC Paul Dacre controls what is and is not allowed to be published in tabloid newspapers. This is an obviously never going to work as Paul will not and can not judge himself on equal terms to other journalist and he has already proven that he will write what he wants. This Petition is to remove him from his throne of power and have a fairer more pointful commision to keep on eye on journalists",
