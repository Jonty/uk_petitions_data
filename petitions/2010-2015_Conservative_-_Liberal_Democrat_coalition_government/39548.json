Or entitled to the Queen Elizabeth Cross Award equally to their families, of Killed Civil Emergency personnel too.\r\nWe now call for this error by the British Government to be corrected, as a joint military and police family.\r\nAlso there should be a new award created for Wounded-in-Line-of-Duty too, maybe called the Prince of Wales Cross, for all members of the Armed Forces and the Civil Emergency Services.\r\n",
