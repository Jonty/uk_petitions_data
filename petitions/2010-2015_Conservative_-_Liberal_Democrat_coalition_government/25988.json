        "additional_details": "Compulsory 15% (at least) pay cut & economy based pay freeze  for Councillors & senior council management. Use only government premises for their meetings. NO taxpayer funded meals . No \"allowances \"  ,salaries are generous enough to cover \"expenses\".  Cut unneccessary , expensive meetings & journeys through use of video conferencing, email, etc. No \"consultancies\" after \"Golden Handshakes\".   Less frontline staff & reduced vital services, should mean appropriate economies at the \"top end\", too. Change to Voluntary Councillors , like they used to be. No acceptance of salaries linked to private sector management argument, someone would always be willing to do a good job for these levels of renumeration.",
