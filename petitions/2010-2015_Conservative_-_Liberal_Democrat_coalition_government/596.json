Prison does not work for 2 reasons, it is too easy and too short. It's easy to bring down crime rates, just make burglary legal, which it almost is. Make the sentence fit the crime. 2 years for carrying a knife - 5 years for a gun. 2 years minimum for burglary. 5 years minimum for aggravated robbery. etc. Give time off and privileges for good behaviour but remove automatic sentence reduction. Take away facilities denied to God fearing folk, such as snooker tables gymnasiums, study courses etc. They are there because they transgressed. Build more prisons and prison ships if necessary. All foreign criminals to serve their sentence at their governments expense.",
