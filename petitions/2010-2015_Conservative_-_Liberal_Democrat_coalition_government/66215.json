        "additional_details": "Parked cars on the left hand side of The Nurseries by employees from local businesses in the area results in having to drive in the middle of the road. When residents are turning onto The Nurseries from side roads, visibility is zero as owners are dumping their cars too close to junctions with no consideration for other road users and creating a dangerous environment for children and pedestrians, drivers and cyclists. We need to act NOW before there is a serious accident.\r\nThis petition is to have residents only permit parking introduced for the main thoroughfare as the measures introduced by the Highways Agency a while ago has failed.",
