        "additional_details": "If someone is charged with an offence, they should be granted full legal aid, regardless of circimstances, wealth or poverty. This is because it is the CPS, and not the defendant, that has decided to press charges at the cost of the taxpayer. The defendant has no choice whatsoever so he/she should not have to foot the bill for his/her defence, appeal and any other costs. This will also help to discourage vexatious or pointless convictions that are not in the public interest where a community sentence or caution would suffice.",
