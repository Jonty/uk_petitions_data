        "additional_details": "A signing of this petition is to show opposition to an expansion of Lydd airport. There is already an RSPB centre near the currently small airport and expansion would force the birds to be \"controlled\". We therefore ask the government to take action to prevent such an expansion which would impact negatively on the local wildlife and community.",
