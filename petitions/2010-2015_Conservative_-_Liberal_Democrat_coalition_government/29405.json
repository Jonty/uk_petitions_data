        "additional_details": "Should the age for driving be reduced to 16 in the UK?\r\n\r\nAs part of our citizenship, we have to come up with a campaign. Our group has decided to do a campaign on changing the driving age to 16. We have a lot of advantages and some disadvantages. We are emailing you to see your points of view across this point. We have also emailed our Local Newspaper to ask for permission to post an article.\r\n\r\nWe have done research and asked most of our year on what they think, our results show that the teenagers of today want to start driving because bus fare is really expensive and our Colleges aren\u2019t just around the corner.\r\n\r\nWe would really like to hear your point of view and hopefully in the end we can change the driving age.\r\n\r\n",
