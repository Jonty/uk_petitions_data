        "additional_details": "I believe that anyone who has power, authority or influence over the NHS should have to use the NHS and not be allowed to use private health care as an alternative. If they are not using the NHS for their own or families care, and waiting as Joe Public does, they are out of touch and distanced from the reality of the state of the NHS and will never be in the best place to lead the NHS. If this seems unfair that a government minister can't nip off to Harley street on the quick, then consider that if one wants a job which has any control or influence over the NHS, one should consider whether to choose that job in the first place or opt for another job where private medical care is allowed.  The action I want the government to take is to ban all who have any control or influence over the NHS ( such as ministers,mp's NHS and trust managers at all levels) from using private health care instead of NHS when needed.",
