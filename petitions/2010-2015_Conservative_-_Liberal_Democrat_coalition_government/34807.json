        "additional_details": "During the last several decades, successive too-liberal Governments have continually failed to protect the overwhelmingly law-abiding, long-suffering United Kingdom Public, by their apparently uncaring failure to legislate for meaningful, deterrent, salutary sentencing and/or deportation of serious, violent, uncaring, reckless, desperate criminals, who will stop at nothing to gain their own, selfish ends.  Repeated Public demands for Royal Commissions on Justice and Protection of the Public, have been sidelined and ignored.  Far too much attention has been applied to the Human Rights of such Offenders - than to those of the multi-thousands of actual Victims of Crimes.     The signatories to this Petition therefore demand that in all cases in which a penalty of 3 years imprisonment or more is prescribed by (New )Laws - including those which carry Deportation, the penalties should be enshrined in those laws as Mandatory - viz: Trial Judges' discretion is revoked, null and void.",
