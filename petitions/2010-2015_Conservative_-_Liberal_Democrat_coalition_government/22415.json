        "additional_details": "Forest House Psychotherapy Clinic, part of the Psychological Therapies Department based at Thorpe Coombe Hospital, has come under threat of closure in the latest round of NHS cuts. Forest House provides longer-term psychodynamic psychotherapy and has an excellent reputation for treating a cohort of particularly troubled patients for whom other shorter-term treatments have been insufficient. The closure of the clinic has been proposed with no consultation of patients, referring GPs, consultants, or members of the public. If the proposal goes ahead, Forest House could be closed in early 2012 leaving hundreds of vulnerable people without access to vitally important services. We need urgent action from the Government to ensure a fair and lawful consultation process. Those who sign this petition demand a fair consultation, and show their support for psychodynamic psychotherapy remaining part of the treatments on offer by the NHS. ",
