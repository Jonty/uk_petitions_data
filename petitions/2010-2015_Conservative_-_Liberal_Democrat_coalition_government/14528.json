        "additional_details": "Since 2005, the Package Travel Regulations has been under threat from the advance of travel providers who claim they sell component holidays and therefore sit outside obligations imposed by the Regulations.  We call upon the Government to recognise that UK Consumers spend a great deal of their disposable income on holidays and deserve full Consumer Protection when the holiday product fails to deliver its promises.  We also call upon the Government to unilaterally stop the practices of so-called DIY holiday providers to evade their obligations and strengthen the guidance of what constitutes a 'package holiday'.  We also call upon the Government to strengthen the Package Travel Regulations and to work closely with the EU Commission & Parliament to ensure that the new Package Travel Directive is fit for purpose - being fair to Consumers and Industry alike.",
