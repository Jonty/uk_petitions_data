This is wavered on Islamic accounts as it is against their religious beliefs in relation to Sharia Law.\r\nI think it is unfair that we are discriminated against due to our religious beliefs or lack of certain beliefs.\r\n\r\nHere is a quotation from \"The Telegraph\"\r\nWhile many will have to pay up to \u00a380 a month if they go into the red, Muslims were told they would escape the charges. The document said: \u201cWe are removing the monthly overdraft management fee of \u00a36 from our Islamic Account, Islamic Student Account and Islamic Graduate Account. So, if you use an unplanned overdraft on these accounts, there won\u2019t be any charges.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis kind of religious discrimination needs to be reviewed promptly as it is unfair and lacks equality.
