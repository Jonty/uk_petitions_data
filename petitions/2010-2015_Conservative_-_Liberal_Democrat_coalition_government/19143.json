        "additional_details": "Higher speed means:  1  much higher fuel use, which means more costly driving for individuals and higher emissions.   Are goverment concerns about the environment just lies?  2  more accidents and more serious accidents.  True, car and road technology have improved, but reaction times for drivers have not improved at all.  3   you don't just raise the maximum speed, it also raises the average speed of all cars, and makes it harder to drive at slower speeds, like 65.  4  more stop-start traffic flows, which may actually result in more jams and end up not cutting travel times at all.\r\n\r\nFinally, ministers say police can't enforce the speed limit now so it's better to raise it.  What on earth makes them believe it will it be any easier to enforce at 80 than at 70?\r\n\r\nThe environment will definitely suffer more.\r\nAccidents will definitely increase.\r\nAnd all for the sake of cutting average journey times by a few minutes.\r\nLeave the National Speed Limit as it is.",
