        "additional_details": "David Crompton should be held accountable for the poor policing in Hexthorpe in Doncaster, Page Hall in Sheffield and Eastwood in Rotherham. High levels of immigration into these areas has resulted in social issues that South Yorkshire Police are unwilling to deal with appropriately. We also believe that David Crompton should be held accountable for the recent abuse scandal in Rotherham. He should accept that his mismanagement of South Yorkshire Police leaves him no alternative other than to resign from his post. ",
