Should they not be allowed to dress in shorts or trousers?\r\nIt would be less homophobic to allow gay boys to dress in skirts and study with the girls. Likewise gay girls should be able to wear shorts or trousers and study with the boys.\r\nMany pupils in our schools are gay or transexual, should we abandon homophobia in our schools and change with the enlightened times and let pupils decide?\r\nThis topic is overdue for discussion.",
