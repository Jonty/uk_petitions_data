        "additional_details": "This petition is for the rights of disabled children not to be euthanised.  Back in October this year, a mother was allowed by a court to starve and dehydrate her disabled daughter to death. The daughter was not on life support and was not likely to die of natural causes any time soon.  We petition to government to protect these children and change the law so that a disabled child cannot be put to death, and that food and drink should never be withdrawn from them with view to ending their lives prematurely.",
