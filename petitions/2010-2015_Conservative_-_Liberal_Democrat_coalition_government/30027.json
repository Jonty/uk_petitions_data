        "additional_details": "All Surrey bus services within the M25 should be transfered to TFL ownership. Currently the Surrey bus services within the M25 are not subsidised, and are expensive / infrequent.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are many bus routes run by TFL that go far beyond the M25 boundary (81 to Slough, and 465 to Dorking being just two). This means people in places such as Walton, Weybridge and Chertsey are are at a disadvantage, because of having to pay far more to use the bus services - hence they are not being used. Increased public transport usage is surely a priority for the government - and this would be a good starting point for thousands of people in and around the surrey M25 boundary.",
