        "additional_details": "Blackberry messenger is commonly misused and abused for pornographic and inappropriate conversations by children under both 18 and 16.\r\n\r\nBoys as young as 12 are sending pornographic images of themselves to girls aged 12 and under and requesting sexually explicit images be sent to them by girls they have added on there contacts.\r\n\r\nIt is not only young boys responsible for this, adult men are also pretending to be young boys to trick and manipulate young girls into sending them images of them selves.\r\n\r\nI ask that the Blackberry Messenger service otherwise known as BBM be restricted to the use of those aged 18 and above and no longer be available to minors.",
