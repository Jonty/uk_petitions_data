        "additional_details": "We believe that Fireworks should only be sold for public displays to people who have a license for such displays. Public displays should be limited to set times of year such as the week before 5th november and new years eve. The general public should not be able to purchase them from shops or on the street and if caught in possession or selling should be fined. Over 1000 people in Essex alone suffered injuries last year, placing extra pressure on emergency services. By restricting days displays are allowed it allows pet owners to keep their animals safe.
