        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom should consider taking/buying back all shares in water, gas, electricity, rail and road and any other need to live utilities, these should not be in the hands of private shareholders but owned and operated by the state and along with a re-envisioned national bank service run at a profit with all the profit being re-invested into the welfare of the nation as a whole. Currently we struggle each month to pay a few, often foreign national shareholders a profit from the entire population of the UK this is profit which could be used to recreate our industries, support our education and NHS, even fund our armed forces. There would be a much lower UK deficit if we were not churning out profits for private individuals from something we have no choice but use and which we once owned.",
