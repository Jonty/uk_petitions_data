        "additional_details": "BBC3 gets more viewers than BBC4. The fact that the BBC intends to make it an online service is laughable. What about those with no or limited internet access? To the general public it looks like the BBC are pandering to the minority of high brow viewers rather than listening to the majority.\r\n\r\nBBC produces some of the best home grown comedy and drama and with good investment, it can continue to do so.\r\n\r\nWatching things on catch up internet channels is ok but its annoying if your internet speed is not perfect and makes you want to swtich off (we all HATE the 'loading' bit!)\r\n\r\nWe love watching old episodes of Doctor Who, Family Guy, Eastenders, Torchwood, American Dad, Gavin & Stacey....to name a few.\r\n\r\nI propose the governrnment listen to us and close down BBC 4 instead. Extend the hours of BBC 3 transmission and put their programmes on BBC 3 during the daytime. This way you get 2 channels for the price of one.",
