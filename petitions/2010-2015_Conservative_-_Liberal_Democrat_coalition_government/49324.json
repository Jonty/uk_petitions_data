        "additional_details": "We the undersigned want the current legislation relating to acceptable noise levels at work to be changed to protect workers' hearing.\r\n\r\nWe want people who work in noisy environments  to be protected. The current legislation does not protect employees' hearing and hearing loss caused as a result of exposure to noise at work is still on the increase.\r\n\r\nWe want the Government to review the legislation and reduce the actionable noise levels. We want employers to take action to protect employees hearing. We want heavier penalties imposed on employers who don't protect their work forces' hearing.\r\n\r\nHearing loss is permanent. It is irreversible. It is a serious problem. It gets worse over time. One in 6 people have a hearing loss/deafness.\r\n\r\nIf the Government doesn't make changes now more people will have a hearing loss. ",
