        "additional_details": "Pretty self explanatory, our a&e departments are full of drunks every evening. Not only does it place a huge strain on resources, but it poses a risk to hospital staff and costs the NHS a fortune. I propose that a simple, fixed fine of say \u00a3100 be imposed on anybody that has to attend a&e as a direct or indirect (e.g. broken bones) result of intoxication. Not only will this act as a deterrent, it will also help recuperate some of the costs of treating these people. These fines would not be difficult to implement, and would make a large difference to crowding in a&e departments. Its a no-brainer, why hasn't this been done already?",
