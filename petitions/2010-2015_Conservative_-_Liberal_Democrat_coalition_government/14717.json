        "additional_details": "Everyone I know and can think of had a major addiction to Bernard Matthew's Turkey Twizzlers, no matter how much they dripped with fat. I know it's ridiculous to bring them back in that state, but a similar product with less fat and more nutrition with a similar flavour would be feasible surely? There are more important issues, but I've seen women on internet pregnancy forums in 2010 wishing they were back. We haven't forgotten the taste, and it would be nice to have them back.",
