This will allow nature to co-exist and provide a clean sustainable generation programme.The construction and development can be aligned to what can be afforded and is well within current human capabilities. Nuclear hazardous waste is not produced nor is it dependant on wind or wave action the advantages far outweigh the use of fossil fuel. I commend it to the country and seek your endorsement. ",
