        "action": "Allocate funding to improve rural mobile telephone network coverage",
        "additional_details": "Many rural areas currently experience weak, intermittent or absent mobile telephone signals. This impacts upon the lives of village and rural community residents and hinders small business in rural areas.\r\n\r\nThe government funding made available in recent budgets to upgrade superfast broadband infrastructure in rural areas has been extremely beneficial and will see many rural areas soon receiving an equal service to that in urban communities.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned therefore ask that funding is also made available to upgrade mobile telephone facilities so as to provide better coverage for rural communities.",
