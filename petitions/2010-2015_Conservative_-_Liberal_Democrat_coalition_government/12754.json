        "additional_details": "For to long energy companies have had a free reign on the UK market making vast amounts of profits while being unregulated. I own a company that supplies low energy solutions and we keep an eye on actual raw fuel prices. The price of fossil fuels has fallen dramatically because of the global downturn, so why are the big six energy companies in the UK allowed to increase prices when the actual price of producing energy is around 15% lower. This is a scam and the Government are scared of these mighty companies. We need proper regulation linked to actual fossil fuel prices. Thses companies are greedy and are taking advantage of the public without oposition from the government its about time it was stopped.",
