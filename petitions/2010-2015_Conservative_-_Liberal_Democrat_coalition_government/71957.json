        "additional_details": "As it stands, the National Planning Policy Framework is causing despair and anguish in many communities across the UK.  Planning applications are being granted, either by railroaded councils, or more usually, on appeal, citing the NPPF presumption in favour of development where either the borough council has not yet adopted a Local Plan/Core Strategy, or it is out of date, or does not demonstrate a 5 year housing supply to meet (alleged) demand.\r\n\r\nSince it takes years to write and conform, consult with the community on, approve and adopt these more detailed local planning documents, there is no easy answer and any presumption in favour of development results in the NPPF document being heavily biased in favour of the developer.\r\n\r\nWe petition the Government to QUICKLY remove this wording from the legislation, allowing each application to be judged fairly on its actual merits, rather than being biased in favour of the developer.",
