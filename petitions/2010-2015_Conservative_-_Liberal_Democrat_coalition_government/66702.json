        "additional_details": "The proposed 2015 introduction of SIA Business Licensing will in its current form impact harshly on the finances of sole traders/operators and micro business's. The charges should reflect individual turnover and not per head of employee/contractor. We agree that the British Standards should be implemented but as it currently stands the system you wish to impose will restrict and hinder small companies and promote larger firms thus reducing employment opportunity.",
