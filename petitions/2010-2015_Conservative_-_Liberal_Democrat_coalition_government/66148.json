        "additional_details": "The culture secretary Sajid Javid has decided to unceremoniously drop the \u2018additionality\u2019 rules surrounding the funding given to the Arts Sector by the National Lottery through the Arts Council. This now means that Lottery Funding can be used to fill the gap left by the cutting of government support to the arts.\r\n\r\nWhen the lottery was established the funding given to the arts council was for special projects, capital building that could otherwise not have happened and training programmes which are beyond the norm in the public sector. Now the lottery funding (which has done some amazing work through grants for the arts) will be channelled away as the government and minister reduces the support that the Arts and Artists get from central government through general taxation\r\n\r\nIt is the aim of this petition to have the \u2018additionality\u2019 rules reinstated to insure that the funding from the lottery remains a source of funding for projects that would not otherwise happen.\r\n",
