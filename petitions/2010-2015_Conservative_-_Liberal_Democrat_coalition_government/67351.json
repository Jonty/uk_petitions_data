        "additional_details": "The current situation at any event is that there is no form of formal vetting in place for stewards, traders, etc. Security are DBS checked to the basic level, which doesn't list child protection flags, unless the person was charged and sentenced.\r\n\r\nIn order to protect young people, and people who may be made vulnerable through the use of substances, we petition the gov't to bring in legislation which means to work, whether paid or voluntarily at a licensed event the person must be enhanced DBS, and any person with child protection/exploitation markers present be refused the opportunity to work at an event. Persons with other charges should only be allowed to work at such an event once their employer has signed an executive acceptance of risk and this is lodged on their employment file.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this petition would be to reduce the chance of exposure to predators to vulnerable people, when the predator holds a perceived position of trust.",
