Those who want additional insurance can do so through existing insurance companies. and those who drive most would pay the most.\r\n\r\nIt would mean that everyone would have basic motor insurance including younger drivers and the less affluent so that those not at fault in an accident are covered and the police do not have to spend time checking on the uninsured.",
