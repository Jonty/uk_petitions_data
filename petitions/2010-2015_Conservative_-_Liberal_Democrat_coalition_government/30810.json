This exists because of the historical precedence of the Monarchy in matters of State in the past, this should not exist today.\r\n\r\nThe State should belong to the people of this country and any matters of state should be done in their Name.\r\n\r\nPoliticians have retained this system for their own ends, but it places the State and goverance of this country in an undemocratic and fragile position.\r\n\r\nScotland will devolve this arrangement.",
