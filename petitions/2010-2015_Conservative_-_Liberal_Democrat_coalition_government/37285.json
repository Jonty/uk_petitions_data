        "additional_details": "Dumfriesshire and Galloway are historically, geographically and socially two distinct areas. The demography and needs of the two areas are different - Galloway has a very fragile and almost entirely rural economy, whilst Dumfriesshire has a number of larger towns and a more urban economy. When the two areas are viewed together as a single region, the relative affluence of Dumfriesshire tends to mask the poverty of Galloway.\r\n\r\nThe two areas are currently administered by a single Regional Council, based in Dumfries and dominated by Dumfriesshire councillors. This means that Galloway is underrepresented, and is largely ignored in policy making.\r\n\r\nIf Dumfries & Galloway were to be split and administered as two regions, this would highlight the plight of Galloway, increase our eligibility for EU funding, and allow the adoption of recovery policies that aren't necessarily appropriate to the whole of Dumfries & Galloway.",
