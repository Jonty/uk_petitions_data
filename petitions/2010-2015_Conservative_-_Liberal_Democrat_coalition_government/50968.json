As British born citizens, with family history for many decades in Great Britain, we are saddened our forefathers died for such liberties to be taken by the elect and select who don't like us or our country and willing break our laws, flaunting it in our faces and taking the lives of our friends and family as a pinch of salt to rub in our wounds. Make a start by removing the known offenders and let their own homelands deal with them. Zero tolerance for anyone who comes here and commits a crime, give respect to this nation and deport them immediately. ",
