        "additional_details": "Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems (CGMS) should be funded by the NHS, everyone with type one Diabetes  could benefit from one of these systems as it measures glucose levels every few minutes and displays it on a screen, it also shows trends and alarms the person wearing it when glucose levels are either going too low or too high, this can prevent both short term complications (for example Diabetic Ketoacidosis, comas and seizures) and long term complications, ie, amputations, blindness, stroke.\r\n\r\nThe CGMS could give more freedom to the wearer by giving them more confidence and help them learn to deal with exercise and food as it becomes easier to spot trends. With this in mind I ask you to provide funding to people in need of CGMS or perhaps offer grants to Diabetics from low income families so that they can have the same health care opportunities as people with a high income who are self funding these devices.",
