        "action": "Revise in immigration and human rights laws",
        "additional_details": "The prime minister of Australia speech about immigration laws is just and should be intergrated also into our society. We are losing independance and identity at an alarming rate. Human right's as it stands now is so twisted that anyone from outside this country has more rights than the british citizen. I think its only right that myself and my fellow Britons retain our rights and freedoms and not to be scared of speaking out to what is a clear injustice of our human right's laws. The purpose of this petition is that any foreign national should abide by our laws and respect our beliefs and anyone that doesnt speak english or has working skills should not enter the country should until they obtain these skills.",
