        "additional_details": "The riots that have hit the UK are likely to be repeated time and again by this lost generation of youths. We cannot afford to reduce any police funding. We must increase it.\r\n\r\nThe HS2 rail links to the North are going to shave no more than 20 minutes off a journey. This will have no impact on business at all as it will not encourage more people to travel. Journey times are already good. We are a small country, we do not need high speed rail.\r\n\r\nInstead, divert the billions budgeted for this project into improving current rail links and divert the remainder to front line policing on a roughly 30/70 split. This would make a visible and useful impact on people's lives.",
