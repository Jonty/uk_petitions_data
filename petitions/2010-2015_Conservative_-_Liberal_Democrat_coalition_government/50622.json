        "additional_details": "The death penalty needs to be brought back. One, it would save people having to suffer the trauma of the prisoner being released. Two, it would save the country money. (\u00a340,000 a year per prisoner). We need justice, we don't want to go down the route of other countries where the prisoners sit on death row for twenty years, with a roof over there head and three meals a day. It needs to be instant, sentence undertaken when convicted. Mistakes shouldn't happen, especially when we have numerous ways to prove the individuals committed the crimes.",
