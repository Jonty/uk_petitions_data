        "additional_details": "Urgent action is needed to prevent the exploitation of performers from the act of having to sell tickets for performances in order to get or secure a gig.\r\nVenues and promoters are taking advantage in order to guarantee a minimum audience attendance. Performers of all musical types are expected to not only perform but also sell tickets in return for a small percentage and in most cases no fee at all for actually performing. Re-regulation and perhaps a new promoters license would stop this situation of taking advantage of talent. To often an established name will get paid on the event line up to draw the punters in and the performers are left to sell tickets on the basis of this and their names on the event line-up. Also on occasion the event can not be a success which leaves everyone un-paid and often with out recourse as the promoter has no financial bond set in place with the club or artists to ensure payment.\r\n\r\n",
