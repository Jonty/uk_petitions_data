        "additional_details": "Taking EMA away from teenagers in low-income families is short-sighted at best and callous at worst. Only cocooned politicians could imagine this isn't going to hit the poorest families the hardest. EMA covers college-related outgoings for the whole year - books, tools, travel, food, incidental expenses - that poor families will struggle increasingly to afford. EMA is probably the best idea the Labour Government ever had - it supports poorer families unobtrusively and even-handedly whilst dually keeping teenagers focussed on actually getting their qualifications.   A re-think is needed in Westminster ~ EMA deserves to be reinstated.   NOW.",
