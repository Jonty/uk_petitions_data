Can only claim what they would be entitled to in their own country. If their Country pays nothing then that is what they will get here.\r\nThe Billions we as a country would save could help keep our armed forces. Police, fire brigade and nurses. At the necessary levels with the correct training and equipment for them to do their jobs properly, to protect us as a nation and reduce the debt that we are in.\r\nThis would then lead to food, fuel, housing and other products coming down in price. Allowing the people of the country to start spending.",
