Most cyclists today are irrisponsible and still cycle on the roads with no lights, hi viz vests and dark clothes. How much do these (what should be) items cost? A lot less than a life!!\r\n\r\nAll i would like to see is a law to be past that cyclists cannot ride in the dark unless 1. They have adequate lighting and 2. They wear a hi viz vest.\r\n\r\nCyclists who don't adhere to this should be given on the spot fines with their bike being confiscated.\r\n\r\nYou can't drive your car at night with no lights so why should cyclists get away with it.\r\n\r\nLet's do something about this before more cyclists get killed on our roads.",
