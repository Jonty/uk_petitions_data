        "additional_details": "We the supporters of this petition call upon Sheffield City Council to scrap their plans on the demolition of the Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield.\r\nThe Don Valley Stadium has been the Home Ground for the Sheffield Eagles RLFC for 22 years. Earlier this year Sheffield City Council decided to demolish the ground as it is 'Not Used Enough'.\r\nIf the ground is demolished, the Eagles will be forced to leave Sheffield and find a Home Ground somewhere else. This will take away Sheffield's Rugby League pride and thousands of fans will have to leave the city to see their team play. THIS MUST NOT HAPPEN!\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and help keep the Sheffield Eagles in Sheffield!",
