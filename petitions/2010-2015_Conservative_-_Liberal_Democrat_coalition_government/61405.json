        "additional_details": "The law of succession should be changed to be in line with Europe so that children cannot be disinherited. This would protect the millions neglected by errant fathers who subsequently marry and choose to disinherit children from previous relationships. It would stop gold diggers from cleaning up when they find some elderly divorced man. This would also provide some security for the enormous number of divorcees (particularly women) who find themselves having to rent a room in a house after divorce as they cannot afford to rent a flat, only to be not be provided for by their parents in the future as they are not a benenficiary in their will.",
