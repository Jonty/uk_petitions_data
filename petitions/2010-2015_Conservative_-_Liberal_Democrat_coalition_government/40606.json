The Scottish government want to limit the right to vote in the referendum to residents of Scotland. Doing so denies the right to vote, on the future of their nation, to the hundreds of thousands of Scottish voters living in the rest of the United Kingdom, Europe and elsewhere. The British government should insist that all Scots are given the right to vote in such a historic and momentous referendum. ",
