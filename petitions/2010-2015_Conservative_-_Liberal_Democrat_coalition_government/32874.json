It does not stimulate growth especially in times of recession and financial crisis'. Cut backs and job losses means less money being spent on consumerism and so less money being collected and going to all kinds of TAX revenues.\r\n(or suspend the Austerity measures temporarily until the end of the financial crisis' when economies may have a chance to return to reasonable growth).",
