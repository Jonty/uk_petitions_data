No specific person for contact. Workers moving around departments, so no continuity. Not getting phoned back, after leaving messages. No out of hours services, advised to go to A and E. Discharge from mental health hospital ward, when still unwell, leading to re admittance. Very little after care, even though still un well. No regular checks when starting to recover.\r\nBasically the government need to step up and provide the services needed, instead of stretching the ones already in place.\r\nPlease sign and support, you never know if one day you may need help or someone you love will.
