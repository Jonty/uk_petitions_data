        "additional_details": "The right of 'freedom to speech' is being misused. This film  provokes hatred & violence by hurting Muslims. It defames the religion & followers of Islam. Giant web companies like Google and You tube have lost their moral & social duty by rejecting the removal of this film in the name of their policies and freedom of speech. This film violates blasphemy law and freedom of religion to British people. Therefore, we demand the removal of this film from internet. If we cannot do this, then government should ban access to you tube and other websites in this country till this film is not removed. In future, strict law should be made by government to avoid such clashes between freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Freedom of speech should not become a reason for animosity in the society. We believe that by doing this UK will achieve its goal of being a just and tolerant society. ",

ISPs have contracts with their customers called good practice Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs), which they have recently strengthened, about what may be hosted on their servers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, complaints about a particular website\u2019s content should first be directed to the site\u2019s manager. Most AUPs already contain a general clause which allows ISPs to remove sites or content which contain offensive or objectionable material, even if it is not illegal."
