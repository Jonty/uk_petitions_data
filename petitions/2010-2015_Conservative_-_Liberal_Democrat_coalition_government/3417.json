        "additional_details": "Most alcohol drinks do not include nutritional information (or ingredients) on their labels. This makes it hard for people to understand the calorific and other information about these drinks.\r\n\r\nInclusion of such information may help to reduce excess drinking as alcohol contains about 7 calories per gram and therefore lower ABV drinks have less calories. Furthermore, many such drinks are high in sugars which consumers are often not aware of.",
