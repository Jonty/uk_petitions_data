        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, request that the Government introduces legislation to outlaw the use of animals for promotional purposes in retail environments. In recent years, there have been a number of instances of shops, particularly at Christmas, using a variety of animals to draw customers in. This has included penguins, reindeer and huskies in shops and shopping centres. These are stressful environments for humans when busy but it is worse for animals which are unaware of what is going on, forced into alien situations, often having travelled for hours in the back of vehicles to get there. We believe that this cruel and unacceptable.",
