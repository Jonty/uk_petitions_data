        "additional_details": "Funding for research into Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy\r\n\r\nWe are petitioning the Government for extra funding for research to find a cure for DUCHENNE.\r\n\r\nDuchenne is a catastrophic, progressive muscle wasting condition which results in muscle degeneration and eventual death.\r\n\r\nMost children are wheelchair dependent by age 12. Other symptoms include abnormal bone development that lead to skeletal deformities, including curvature of the spine. Once the muscles deteriorate it's harder for the children to move. They lose the ability to speak, eat, and breath, eventually they are paralysed.  Duchenne is affecting families all over the world and Duchenne can happen to anyone!!!\r\n\r\nAdvances are being made and with help from the Government we could put Duchenne in the history books where it belongs.\r\n\r\nPlease help us PETITION THE GOVERNMENT for funding for RESEARCH into this terrible condition.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\n",
