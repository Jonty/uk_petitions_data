        "additional_details": "We believe that it is unfair on current year 12 students to change the education law regarding modular exams in 2014 during their course. This puts stress on students as, when they signed up for certain modular A Levels, they were unaware that the course was going to change. As a result, many students have opted to drop out of core modular subjects such as maths.\r\n\r\nTherefore we want the modular law to be lifted until the following year where the current year 11's will be aware of the changes when making their A Level choices.
