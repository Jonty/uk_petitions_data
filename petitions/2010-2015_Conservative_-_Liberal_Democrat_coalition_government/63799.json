        "additional_details": "With the recent rise in tuition fees, many students feel studying at university is an expensive venture that isn't truly reflective of the value of their degree. Universities should charge students in accordance to the value of their degree. So for example a humanities degree such as Politics should charge students less than a Bio-medical science degree. Why is it that the fees are the same for all subjects when the equipment/resources used and the structure is different? The government needs to put measures in place to make sure the fees reflect the true value of the degree that students are studying for .",
