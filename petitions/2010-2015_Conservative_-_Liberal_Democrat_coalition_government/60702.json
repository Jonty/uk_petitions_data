        "additional_details": "Legislators has with this latest \"Ban Smoking In Cars When Children Are Passengers\" proposal shown again that they are not afraid to legislate where they should educate and in doing so erode your civil and individual liberties.\r\n\r\nI am a non-smoker, have never even tried it, but I am worried where this type of legislation is taking us. Next, I expect it will be illigal to feed children sausages that are over a certain fat percentage.\r\n\r\nAlthough Oscar Wilde got the year wrong in his story 1984, I think he will be right about the content. Is that the sort of country we want to hand over to our children?\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to make legislators employ some common sense and to discuss this most severe issue in the open.",
