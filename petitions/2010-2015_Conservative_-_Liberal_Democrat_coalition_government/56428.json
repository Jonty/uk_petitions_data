        "additional_details": "We the undersigned request that Ed Davey, Secretary of State for Energy & Climate Change be removed immediately from this position.\r\n\r\nEd Davey is no friend of the poor or fuel impoverished.\r\nHis insistence on \"fighting like a\"tiger\" to protect wasteful green levies and windfarm subsidies, keeping them in place while people go hungry or cold demonstrates that he is ideology driven, caring little for the people these policies impact on.\r\n80% of the public want green taxes removed, Ed Davey is therefore against the majority of public feeling and acting undemocratically.\r\nEd Davey is unfit to hold his position, the policies he pushes forward are enemies of common sense, matters of science and public good.\r\n\r\n",
