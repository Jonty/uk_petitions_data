        "additional_details": "Besides the fact 940 staff and 170 agency workers and their families are affected by this, the government has let nearly 700 years of Naval shipbuilding tradition and expertise cease to exist. Portsmouth shipyard continues to deliver state of the art warships which project the Royal Navy's renowned global status.\r\n\r\nBritain would lose world-class expertise in military shipbuilding. What makes this even worse, is Portsmouth shipyard is the last naval shipyard in England. Whilst eradicating England's ship building capability, the Scottish vote for independence in 2014 could see Scotland (which will house all of the UK's naval shipyards) exit the union. This would then leave the Royal Navy with no domestic ship building capability, having to outsource future ships from other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nI call on the government to review this action and to negotiate with BAE systems to keep the Portsmouth shipyard open.\r\n\r\n\r\nMatt Willmott",
