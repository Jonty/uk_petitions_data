        "action": "Opt-Out of upcoming European cigarette legislation",
        "additional_details": "The European parliament has voted to ban cigarettes being sold in packs of ten and to place a ban on the sale of flavoured cigarettes including menthol. This is being done to stop young people smoking. It will be implented in 2016.\r\n\r\nHowever this will not be effective. Young people will still find money to buy packs of twenty. If anything it might encourage them to commit crime. Also this and banning cigarette flavours infringes on the right to free choice of exisiting smokers.\r\n\r\nThis is a gross invasion of the rights of smokers and further evidence that the EU Parliament is trying to take away our rights and a is threat to our freedoms.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, request that the government either stop this legislation from being passed or block it from taking effect in the UK",
