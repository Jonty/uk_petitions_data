        "additional_details": "I am asking the government to lower the legal gestation age for abortion which is currently 24 weeks ironically the same gestation that a medical professional will fight to save a babies life. A babys heart begins to beat at 5 weeks and is fully formed by 14 weeks, aborting a child so late UNLESS for medical reasons is inhumane and barbaric. Please lower. ",
