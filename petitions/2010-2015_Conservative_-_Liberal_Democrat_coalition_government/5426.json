        "additional_details": "The UK has for many years required car drivers to park their cars between two parallel lines. This is in direct conflict with the natural flow of parking which usually requires a turn to the left or right. It also takes longer as drivers often cannot get into a space the first time and it increases carbon emissions as drivers rev their engines on a low gear whilst manouvering into position. This petition is about introducing diagonal parking to align with the natural flow of driving into a car parking space.   ",
