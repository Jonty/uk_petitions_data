        "additional_details": "Current legislation does not recognize assistance dogs as \"working dogs\" and therefore assistance dog charities has to pay VAT on their food. This costs each charity in excess of \u00a3300,000 per year. These dogs work 24 hours a day and literally transform lives. Under current rules the greyhound industry does not pay VAT on food for racing dogs. Guide Dogs, and other charities that provide assistance dogs which help people with disabilities, do not however receive an equivalent tax break.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
