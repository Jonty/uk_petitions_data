        "additional_details": "Request that the energy watchdog investigates the pricing strategies of Gas and Electricity in the UK, and the profit margins made by the 6 major suppliers. There is reasonable suspicion that when market forces beyond the control of the UK forces energy prices upwards that the 6 major energy suppliers pass these costs to the consumer at the earliest opportunity. When market forces beyond the control of the uk force energy prices down, these reduced costs are not passed to the consumer.  Petition raised to try to get the pricing policies investigated to ensure fair play to the consumer.",
