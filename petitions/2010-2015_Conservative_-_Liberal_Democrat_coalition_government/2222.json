Please sign this petition to help all children and all parents maintain a normal family relationship after separation and divorce as is the right of all under the EU Human Rights. Help the Government enforce that law in the UK and across EU Countries. Help prevent parents from kidnapping their own children. Help me love my child again and be reunited with my British daughter.",
