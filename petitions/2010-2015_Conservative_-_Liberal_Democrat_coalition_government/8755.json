        "additional_details": "We petition the government to change the law(s) which currently prevents vigilantes putting themselves in harm's way to protect people, property and businesses from criminal activity for fear of being convicted of criminal acts themselves. The law as it stands prevents ordinary citizens from intervening when a criminal act is about to take place, or is in the process of taking place, for fear of being charged themselves with offences such as assault. The Police cannot prevent or solve all crimes, often have to wait for crimes to be committed to make arrests because of the evidence-led legal system in force, and then regularly fail to obtain convictions because of legal technicalities. Vigilantes should therefore be incentivised to fill the breach. Prevention is better (and cheaper) than cure.",
