        "action": "A petition to criminalise religious intimidation",
        "additional_details": "This law would mean religious people are unable too bully/manipulate/scare members of the public into joining their religion. If someone was found to be using religion to scare and upset people, then they could be eligible for a fine.\r\nAlso, it would prevent Jehovah's witnesses from pressurising members of the public into joining and prevents preachers from preaching in public places such as underground trains which I have experienced in the past.\r\nI have set up this petition after suffering a case of religious intimidation myself. I do not believe it should be legal for someone to upset or scare others like this so this is why a law should be in place so justice can be served.\r\nThis law does not occur to debate and can only be used when one decides to make a complaint.",
