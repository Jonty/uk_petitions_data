        "additional_details": "Trampolines in gardens are becoming the biggest reason for dispute between neighbours in the UK. The very nature of this 'toy' causes loud screaming and unruly behaviour by it's users.\r\nRestrictions need to be brought in to control the positioning of these items so they are not in a place whereby the privacy of others is invaded. Restrictions also need to exist to prevent use at unsociable times. Parents of children on Trampolines must be forced to control and limit the amount of noise that neighbours are subjected to.\r\nYes, they may just be children, but we shouldn't all be made to suffer just so they can enjoy themselves! Adults have rights too!",
