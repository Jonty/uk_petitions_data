Why make citizens who already struggle with mounting debts pay to stay in their job? This simply isn't good enough when scotland, and remainder of UK cries out for carers of all kinds, and now, even in this age of austerity, we're made to pay out for a piece of paper, telling our employers we're ok to work. Get it sorted. ",
