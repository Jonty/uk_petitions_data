        "additional_details": "We call upon the Coalition Government to reconsider the implementation of Part 5 of the Legal Services Act 2007. This will allow, for the first time, commercial organisations to be the majority owners of firms providing legal services, creating Alternative Business Structures (ABS). Alternative Business Structures will threaten the viability of the high street solicitor, reduce consumer choice, and threaten the independence of legal advice and services. ABS are untried and untested. We call upon the Government to have a further public debate on ABS, delay its implementation and to protect the independence of the British legal system. ",
