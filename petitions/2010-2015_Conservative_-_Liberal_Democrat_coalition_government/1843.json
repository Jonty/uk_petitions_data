        "additional_details": "We have all the nuclear bomb material we need made from the Uranium 235 and Plutonium reactors, So we can now catch up with others like China, India and Japan who are trying to develop reactors that make full use of Thorium.\r\nThorium is massively more abundant than Uranium 235 (possibly 3000 years of global supply) and is safer to work with plus it produces considerably less dangerous waste when used in a molten salt reactor.\r\nMolten salt Thorium reactors were developed in the 1960's at Oakridge National Lab's we could have gone that route then however you can't really make nuke's from this type of reactor which is not an issue today as we have too many nukes now.\r\nDo some research on Thorium reactors for yourself.\r\n\r\nSign this petition if you want the government to make investments into developing Thorium reactors.
