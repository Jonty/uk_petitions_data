        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the CPS to investigate British Publisher Harper Collins and its subsidiary Collins Bartholomew for the anti-semitic, intolerant, racist, hostile and inciting act of removing Israel from some versions of its World Atlas on the grounds 'that including Israel would have been \u201cunacceptable\u201d to their customers in the Gulf and the amendment incorporated \u201clocal preferences\u201d' despite Israel being recognised by all pertinent international bodies including the United Nations. There is no place for legitimising racist, religiously intolerant or disparate geo-political views in publications purporting to record currently existing States and borders. Further, this decision by a British based company may extend beyond intellectual dishonesty into serious breaches of law having singled out Jews for uniquely disparaging treatment.",
