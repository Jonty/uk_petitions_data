        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the retention of the HS1-HS2 link. Originally, one of the 'benefits' of HS2 was to make it possible to travel from the North and Midlands to Paris without changing trains. This benefit has been removed courtesy of cancelling that link. This move penalises the North and Midlands, as if these areas haven't been penalised enough over the last 50 years or more. This is favouritism towards London and the South East again, as they have connectivity through HS1. Areas outside the South East should be treated as equals and not as inferiors, and we want the full benefits of HS2 up North, and that means retaining the link. It seems to be money no object for the South East, given Crossrail, so if Crossrail is affordable, then so is the HS1-HS2 link.",
