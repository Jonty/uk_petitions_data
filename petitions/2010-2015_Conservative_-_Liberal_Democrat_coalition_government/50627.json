        "additional_details": "Drumer Lee Rigby of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers was brutally murdered in cold blood in Woolwich on the 22nd May 2013. He faced impossible odds of survival against determined and hysterical fanatics hellbent on carnage and mayhem. He fought their attack alone and unarmed.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister called him a \"brave soldier\" and said, \"The people who did this were trying to divide us. They should know something like this will only bring us together and make us stronger. This country will be absolutely resolute in its stand against violent extremism and terror. We will never give in to terror or terrorism in any of its forms.\"\r\n\r\nDrummer Rigby's death should not be in vain. He should be posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for bravely facing such a brutal and fatal attack alone and unarmed. Such an award would be symbolic of his bravery against the odds and Britain's resolve against terrorism, which will never be broken.",
