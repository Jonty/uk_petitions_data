        "additional_details": "In 2013 there were 765 deaths involving heroin and morphine in England - a sharp rise of 32% from the previous year. Many of these fatalities could have been prevented by the use of Naloxone as an intervention - this is a safe and effective prescription medicine that can reverse the effects of opioid overdoses.\r\n\r\nThe ACMD and WHO have recommended that Naloxone be made more readily available, but the government currently have no intention to do this until at least October 2015. There is nothing stopping them from bringing that date forward and saving people's lives. This petition calls on them to do just that.\r\n\r\n(Scotland and Wales both have national programmes which are successfully reducing the number of opiate overdoses in those countries, hence this petition relates specifically to England).",
