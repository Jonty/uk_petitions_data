It is viewed by nearly a million people each week and will be replaced by repeats.\r\n\r\nWhen the BBC waste so much money, moving to new premises in Manchester, making training videos that resemble The Office, sending its top news anchors all over the world to cover stories that add no value to the story, reports of waste of 80 million pounds a year through poor management etc etc, I think they ought to look at savings here rather than cutting perfectly decent shows.",
