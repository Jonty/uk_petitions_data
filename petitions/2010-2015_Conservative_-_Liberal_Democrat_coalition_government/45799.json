        "additional_details": "The government is neglecting people who have been living in England for more than half of their lives. These people are classed as 'overseas' student though their parents pay taxes in the country. The government should assess or allow the university and student finance to assess case, thus looking at their circumstances before making a decision on whether they qualify for student finance or 'home' student fees. The immigration law set say those with discretionary leave should not be entitled student finance because they have applied for asylum should be looked at again, as in some cases discretionary leave is granted to those who do not qualify for leave in any other category and it is in their best interest to be permitted to stay. This mean that they have the access to benefits but they government would rather they not get the education they deserve but stay on benefits? Surely that doesn't make sense! Same case applies to me and both my parents are British citizens.",
