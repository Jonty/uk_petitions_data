        "additional_details": "At present Council tenants are treated as second class citizens in relation to home owners. This has shown its ugly face, in evictions from council homes after criminal offences, when the same offence would leave home owners still having somewhere to live. In a civilised society, this kind of social apartheid should not exist. This Government, is now showing its complete misunderstanding of this situation, by promoting this kind of prejudicial and discriminatory thinking. Many Council tenants, can't even choose how to pay their water charges any longer, because they are included in their rent. Sign this petition, to make EVERYBODY in the UK equal! ",
