        "additional_details": "Legal Aid protects and helps the most vulnerable in society.\r\n\r\nIt is not just for defending criminals, but helps those with debt, housing, employment and immigration issues (amongst others). Legal aid provides everyone access to justice.\r\n\r\nThe government consultation on legal aid cuts recieved 5,000 replies. Of those replies 3% supported the cuts.\r\n\r\nThis petition pleads that the government uphold the rule of law and doesn't just end legal aid cuts, but increases the legal aid budget.\r\n\r\nJustice is priceless. Let our government show that to the world.",
