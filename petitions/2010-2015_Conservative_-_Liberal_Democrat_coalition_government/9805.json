        "additional_details": "As we have seen from the recent rioting in the UK, there is no respect for law and order or fear of punishment, because people no longer believe that there is effective punishment in this country. Most of the rioting  and petty crime seems to be caused by teenage \"hoodies\". All these people care about is being feared and respected by their friends and peers so, I propose that the only way to effectively punish them is to take away that respect and make them look foolish.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to bring back public stocks, which they can be locked in for a day in their communities, with their crime on a board over their heads.\r\n\r\nPhotos should be taken of them and posted on social networking sites. This will take away their dignity, make them a laughing stock and give the public a chance to tell them what they think of them. This solution is quick, cheap and I believe potentially very effective. ",
