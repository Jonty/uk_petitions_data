We need to ensure that future generations are being educated on different ways to express their feelings!\r\n\r\nWe are all aware that everybody in this world is unique in different ways. We can't all be exceptionally gifted at academic subject, such as science and maths. If we were all talented at these subjects then the employment rates would decrease even more.\r\n\r\nThe Government are adamant to continue cutting funds and creative subjects altogether.\r\n\r\nWe have the power and responsibility to make a positive influence on the future generations and their well being. Let's stand up for what's right and make a change! ",
