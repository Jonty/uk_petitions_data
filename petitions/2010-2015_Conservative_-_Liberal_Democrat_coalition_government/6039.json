He has also only spoken in 2 debates in the past year.\r\n\r\nConstituents of MPs such as Mr Brown deserve parliamentary representation.\r\n\r\nTherefore we petition for a mechanism to be introduced whereby an MP is deemed to have resigned if they do not regularly attend parliament.\r\n\r\nI suggest something along the lines of either participating in less than 50% of votes or a continued absence of more than 10 consecutive days as being considered a resignation (with an exception for medical grounds)",
