        "additional_details": "Having recently set up a housing and social committee for Highfields Road, hinckley and surrounding area's it has been brought to our attention the frustration the residents of Highfields Road, John Street and surrounding streets face due to the out of date parking restrictions that still line the streets from when the factories on John Street were still in business and they required the single yellow lines that run the length of John Street for deliveries. These cause residents on both roads mentioned and others close by unable to park close to their house. We are proposing the council remove these single yellow lines now that they are no longer required. Many thanks for reading.",
