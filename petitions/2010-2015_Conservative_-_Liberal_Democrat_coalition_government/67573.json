However, In the UK we don't really have a national day to celebrate being British and we very much should have one.\r\n\r\nMy request is that we create a National Holiday on May the 1st when the Treaty of the Union came into effect and for it to be day that we celebrate being British.\r\n\r\nIn order to retain the number of productive days and not hurt the economy, it may be an idea that this National Union Holiday replaces  a bank holiday that occurs around that time.\r\n\r\nAll in all, by signing this petition you agree that there should be a national holiday that is dedicated towards being British.",
