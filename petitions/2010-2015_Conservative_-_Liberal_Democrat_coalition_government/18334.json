        "additional_details": "The rail operaters are not being fined or otherwise reprimanded for bad service as they have targets which are too easy to achieve. I want the regulators to toughen up the targets. For example, I would like to see regulations which state that a train is considered late if it has not arrived within 3 minutes of its due time. I want the 'major' cities on the journey to be the points at which lateness is recorded rather than the start and end destinations. And so on.",
