They, with others, have stopped Oppressors, rebuilt society, and are feared greatly by the enemy. Why, then, have regiments been severly cut by the Government? Men, and Women, who would fight to the death for their country, friends and others having their jobs stolen and way of life ruined, because of mistakes made by others? Why are they the ones to carry the burden of people who think of no-one but themselves, and their second homes?  We are an Army, not a Defence unit! Stop these cuts!",
