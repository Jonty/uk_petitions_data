        "additional_details": "In light of the increasing evidence that the Independent Police Complaints Commission, at the highest level, is deficient in competence and deficient in honesty I ask that the Home Office abolish the Independent Police Complaints Commission.\r\n\r\nLike its predecessor organisation, the Police Complaints Authority, the IPCC is failing to create genuine accountability for Police misconduct.\r\n\r\nThe IPCC, for example, systematically fails to investigate many cases of \"serious corruption\" by the Police. Given that, what useful purpose does the IPCC serve? A less incompetent and less dishonest replacement is needed.",
