        "additional_details": "Doctors take the hippocratic oath before receiving their qualification.  It has been suggested that a similar oath be taken by graduates in the sciences and this has been taken up some universities (e.g. Totonto).\r\n\r\nHowever, it is questionable that doctors and scientists pose the biggest threat to humanity and the planet - at present this role appears to be played by those in the financial sector.\r\n\r\nWith fairness in mind, it is proposed that a necessary condition of being granted ANY tertiary educational qualification is for the recipient to declare an ethical oath.\r\n\r\nAs an example, see the Toronto University oath.\r\n\r\nSee also Sir David King's 'University Code of Ethics' for researchers which could easily be extended to cover all disciplines.",
