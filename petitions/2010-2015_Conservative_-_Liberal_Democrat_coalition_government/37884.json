        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned Petitioners supported Tony Nicklinson's wish to die with dignity by seeking help from a doctor to take the final steps to end Tony's life because he could not end his life without help due to the extent of his disabilities. Now that he is no longer fighting for this we continue to support anyone who finds themselves in a similar position to Tony.\r\n\r\nWe support a change in the law to the effect of allowing a Doctor to end the life of a person with a terminal illness or 'locked-in syndrome', without prosecution.\r\n\r\nThis has been challenge in the High Court, where it was decided that only Parliament could make the necessary change.",
