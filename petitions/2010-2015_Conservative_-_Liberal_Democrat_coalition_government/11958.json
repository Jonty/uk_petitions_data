Housing benefit and jobseekers allowance should be calculated together and divided by the National minimum wage and divided by 20 working days per month. Hours per day then would be calculated. Claimants would then be required to attend work teams under a Supervisor and carry out Community based work. If somebody decides not to turn up, they would lose benefit for the days they did not attend.",
