        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call the Government to intervene to save the beds ward at Chase Hospital in Whitehill and Bordon, and that the ward be retained in future proposals for regeneration of our superb local hospital.\r\n\r\nThe town is one of the UK Government's Four Ecotowns  and is set to double in size to become the largest town in East Hampshire. It will need beds more than ever.\r\n\r\nCurrent proposals will see the closure of the ward and rehiring of beds from a nursing home 7 miles away in Liss, until an 80 bed private nursing home can be built in town, from which beds can be commissioned.\r\nThere is no guarentee that such a facility will be built here, once the ward is closed we fear the beds will be lost for ever.\r\n\r\nOver 3000 signatures have already been collected to save our beds\r\n\r\nWe call on the  PCT and those in power in the NHS to think again.\r\n\r\nPlease support our campaign for urgent action.\r\n\r\nThis is a community campaign open to all.\r\n\r\n\r\nCnty Cllr Adam Carew\r\n",
