        "additional_details": "Force all UK mobile phone operators to allow their customers to automatically roam on each other's networks, when they cannot get a signal on their own network.\r\n\r\nThis simple change would vastly increase the likelihood of always being within reach of a mobile signal, without duplicating coverage in low-usage areas, which is expensive for operators, or installing more masts, which are often unpopular with local residents.\r\n\r\nModern phones work on all networks and roaming on foreign networks has been available for decades, yet domestic customers are restricted to a single network.\r\n\r\nNetworks can cross charge each other for roamed calls, and settle outstanding balances on a monthly basis. This must be at zero cost to the customer, as this would provide a financial incentive to encourage networks to improve their poor coverage in areas where demand from their customers is particularly high, and the network consequently has to pay more roaming fees to the other networks.\r\n",
