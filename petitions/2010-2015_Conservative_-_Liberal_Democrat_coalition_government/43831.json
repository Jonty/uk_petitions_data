Cars pollute, destroy the scenery, take up more parking space than bikes too. Also, active transport is the real way to help the country's declining health by integrate activity into daily life. There's space on most A-Roads without land acquisition to build proper segregated cycle tracks. This investment will save the country a lot of money, both on a personal and national level.\r\n\r\nMake bike lanes, not bus lanes.\r\n\r\nMy full argument is below.\r\n\r\nhttp://2wheeledcommuter.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/a-roads-should-accommodate-properly-for.html",
