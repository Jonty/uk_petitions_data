We need to act now against terrorists before more innocent people are killed!\r\nWe don't need to constantly defend Muslim communities if they have nothing to do with radical Islam in the first place, its obvious they have nothing to do with it. Farooq Murad Secretary General of the MCB has spoken out against these terrorist far more than the Prime Minister would ever dare! We have had enough of weak leaders and need someone who is willing to do whatever is needed in this time of need. Please sign this petition if you are fed up with nothing ever being done!",
