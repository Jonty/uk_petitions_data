        "additional_details": "Bob Martin UK is a product that is dangerous to animals yet is still being sold in all stores! Customer feed back of the product tells us of deaths of their pets and vet bills for illness which should not be happening for a product being sold in stores? This is a violation of rules and regulations is it not?\r\nTherefore i am asking the government to support this petition 100% and remove this product from stores. It is dangerous and is a cruelty case towards animals!!",
