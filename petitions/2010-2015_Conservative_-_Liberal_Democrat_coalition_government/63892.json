        "additional_details": "When somebody has served a ban for drink driving and has shown this was a one off mistake why should they be excluded from certain jobs and have their international travel conditions treated as if they are a terrorist or on-going danger to society. People make mistakes in life surely they should not serve a whole life sentence. Whilst I can accept drunk and behind the wheel of a car being a severe issue, the current drink drive level would fail most people after a glass of wine during a meal. Breathalyzers are notoriously inconsistent yet the post conviction impact for a driver can be catastrophic. Surely there is a point when they should be able to rebuild their lives accepting they made a mistake. ",
