        "additional_details": "After the recent tragic death of Cameron Cash on Saturday 22nd September 2012 and fears of road safety building as the new Moorside School site looms, I feel that the issue should be addressed with the possiblity of a bridge built over the current subway between the two schools.\r\nLocal residents have known for many years how danerous the East Lancs road is. As a parent of two children one of which has been completely devasted by the loss of Cameron as have all at Moorside.\r\nI have started this petition to gain as much support as possible in the hope that a foot bridge can be constructed to save more of our childrens lives.\r\nTo help in the fight to bring this to the attention of the people who can help this become a reality and stop any further accidents. Please sign the petiton below. Many thanks for your support.",
