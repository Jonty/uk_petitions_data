Many women are told they will probably feel sad for a few days and are unprepared for the overwhelming guilt and sadness they feel, sometimes for the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\nAll clinics should ensure women are offered one to one counselling before an abortion to ensure this is the right choice for them and that they are made aware of the potential for post abortion stress syndrome.\r\n\r\nPlease log onto http://postabortionstress.webs.com for more information on PASS.\r\n",
