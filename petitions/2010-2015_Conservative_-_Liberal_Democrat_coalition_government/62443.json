        "additional_details": "The traffic that travels from Huddersfield Road to turn right into Shaw Road has an existing RH filter lane but no individual green light for RH turn only. The oncoming traffic has one and I feel that both directions could operate one at the same time. Currently in peak times one car per green light can sneak through as the lights turn to red. If a 10sec filter was trialled, I predict 6/7 cars could pass easing congestion at a very busy junction. ",
