Every school child from kindergarten onwards till GCSE stage should be taught and assessed in a formal subject about Good Citizenship and Responsibility. The curriculum should include proper discipline, suitable role models and goals in life, responsibility, joys of hard work, being courteous, considerate & helpful towards others. This is an antidote against being confused, directionless, lacking aims and ambitions in life, lacking moral fibre & discipline, influenced by friends/peers who commit crimes and abuse drugs & alcohol, being anti-establishment, rude, rebellious, treating life as a big joke, etc.  ",
