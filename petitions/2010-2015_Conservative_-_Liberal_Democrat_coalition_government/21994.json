        "additional_details": " The advert slogan is Happy End Of The World. Not only is it saying the world will end next year but it also shows a man building an ark! As someone who is already apprehensive about 2012 and a christian it disturbed me to see it blatantly advertised on TV! Thankfully my children did not see it but no doubt it will soon be picked up and passed around the schools. Do we really need another reason for our children to fear the world they live in? Here is a link to the advert, also viewer comments (most of which mirror my concerns) http://www.lynxeffect.com/uk/lynx-videos/LYNX_2012_AD",
