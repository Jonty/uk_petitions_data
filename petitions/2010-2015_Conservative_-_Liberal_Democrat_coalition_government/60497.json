        "additional_details": "The Access Strategy of Doc M currently states regarding wheelchair access to downstairs toilets in new dwellings that: \"it is not always practical for the wheelchair to be fully accommodated in the WC.\"\r\n\r\nThis is an unacceptable double-standard. So able-bodied people have greater rights of privacy than wheelchair-bound people??!! In that case, remove all WC toilet doors from new build cloaks and see how quickly, especially the female population will make an outcry! Wheelchair-users are a minority but we have a human right as equal as any man.\r\n\r\nThe building regulations must change. Giving wheelchair users access to a toilet is a great leap forward but that leap will not be finished until the closing of a door behind them is included.",
