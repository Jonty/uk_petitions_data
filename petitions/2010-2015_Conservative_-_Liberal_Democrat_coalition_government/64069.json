        "additional_details": "I believe that every person should be entitled to the right of a basic state funeral. The Government ought to put in place provisions to allow for NI contributions to cover the cost of a basic funeral. Currently, the average cost of a burial is around \u00a33,914 while cremation fees \u00a32,998. Of the money spent by the state for public benefit over our lifetime, this is such a fractional amount that could make a huge difference to families who currently struggle to pay their bills, let alone an unanticipated expense like funeral costs for a relative who dies unexpectedly.\r\nIt would make a tremendous difference too many people if a capped amount of our NI contributions was allocated to be spent on a basic 'state' funeral, particularly in such times of financial hardship.\r\nWe not only deserve dignity in life, but in death also.\r\n",
