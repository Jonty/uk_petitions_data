        "additional_details": "I am under no way condoning what he did. Rape is a horrible and terrible thing to happen to anybody.\r\nWhether it be violent, under the influence of alcohol, a man or a woman, it shouldn't happen it to anybody.\r\nChed Evans was arrested for this crime. He was found guilty and sentenced to serve a prison sentence.\r\nUpon his release, he is expected to sign a professional contract to play football again.\r\nThere has been a petition started to ban this from happening. With people afraid that he might be seen as a negative role model for youngsters.\r\nI happen to strongly disagree to this. He has served his time. He has been punished for the crime committed.\r\nWhat he does with the remainder of his life is nobodies concern.\r\nWe should encourage people to integrate back into society, earn a living and pay their own way after being released from prison. NOT discourage it.\r\nI hope this petition is seen a positive thing, and not a negative campaign.\r\nLet Ched Evans play football.",
