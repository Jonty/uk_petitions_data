        "additional_details": "business people at the moment can use any well known fast food place for office space for a few hours (no charge)...one whole table is often used by one person for hours with a laptop, briefcase, filofax, phone,notebook and of course a coffee.  if fast food places where forced to implement a \"business area\" and a tax of 50% on anything they buy.. it would bring in millions weekly for the economy. it would be an area of fast food places that business people would prefare too as its less noisy and more private. business people make money using fast food places for office space so the 50% tax would not be opposed without good reason. Most business people can claim it as expenses.",
