        "additional_details": "Councils must stop classing DLA as income when assessing people for bedroom tax.\r\nDLA is not included in any other instance as income and it is unethical to take it into account when assessing for bedroom tax, as DLA is granted to people for their illness, not to pay rent.\r\n\r\nMany people are left without their mobility cars and unable to afford items for their health related issues, such as affording care.\r\n\r\nIt is wrong of councils to be taking it into account as part of peoples incomings. It's morally wrong. You are taking money away from people who are ill and need that money for their illnesses.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister promised disabled people would be taken care of and not suffer because of the bedroom tax, yet many are suffering, unable to get help.\r\n\r\nWe need councils to stop taking DLA into account, and the Prime Minister to look into why councils are not using the fund he promised would be there to look after the disabled.",
