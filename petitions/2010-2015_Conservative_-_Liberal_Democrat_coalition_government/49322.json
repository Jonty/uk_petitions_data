        "additional_details": "There is sufficient evidence to support serious concerns over the continued use of Neonicotinoids affecting the health of the UK bee population.  Neonicotinic residues can accumulate in pollen and nectar of treated plants and represent a potential risk to pollinators.\r\n\r\nThere is major concern that Neonicotinic pesticides may play a role in recent pollinator declines. Neonicotinoids can also be persistent in the environment, and when used as seed treatments, translocate to residues in pollen and nectar of treated plants. . Despite these uncertainties, Neonicotinoids are beginning to dominate the market place, putting pollinators at risk.\r\n\r\nBan the use of Neonicitinoids immediately!",
