        "additional_details": "Every day  I hear people state they cannot afford private rent, and that landlords are getting greedy in asking for unrealistic rents. I propose the government enforce limits that may be charged for private rent based on the size of the property, its location, and the availability of social housing in that area i.e. If there is no or little availability of social housing then private rent must be made cheaper. Then it is proposed that limits are stabilised in that rent cannot increase at a rate higher than that of inflation.",
