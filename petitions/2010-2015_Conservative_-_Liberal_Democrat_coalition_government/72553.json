        "additional_details": "The 'Black Friday' sales and similar promotions need to be regulated. The stores need to sign up to an agreement where they can prove that they can provide adequate private security to ensure that order is maintained throughout the sale and regulate numbers entering the store at one time on a first come first served basis. If they cannot then the application to apply for the sale should be rejected. This will prevent the awful scenes we have witnessed on the TV and internet and perhaps avoid a tragedy.",
