        "additional_details": "This petition is being set up in opposition of and to stop the building of even more homes in our village area this time using the much loved used and loved Long Marston Airfield.  The building of homes on and loss of this site would not only have a severe and dangerously damaging impact on the village infrastructure along with that of the other small surrounding villages especially with the huge number of homes already built/being built in the area but mean the end to much loved events that attract visitors to the whole Stratford-upon-Avon area from across the world such as The Bulldog Bash and Global Gathering therefore meaning long term it will also affect the whole districts industry.  STOP THE BUILDING OF EVEN MORE HOMES AND STOP THE LOSS OF A MUCH LOVED AIRFIELD!!!!",
