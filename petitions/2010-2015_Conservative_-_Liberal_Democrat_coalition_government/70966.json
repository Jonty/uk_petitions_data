        "additional_details": "This video game's one and only premise is to kill innocent people for the sake of pure hatred. It has no other goals or motives other then to promote senseless murder as fun and acceptable. Dangerous media like this when played by unstable individuals is sure to cause acts of terrorism in society when re-enacted and mimicked by them. I ask that you watch the video in the link and I'm sure you will come to the same conclusion. So called 'entertainment' like this must be stopped not only does it cast a bad shadow over video games and create a false ideology about the industry as stated it can also have far greater implications for us the public.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrX7G-1xPLs",
