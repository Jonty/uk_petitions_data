        "additional_details": " In recent months, there has been a number of issues on insufficient and prejudiced reporting (for example Dale Farm, NHS cuts and Jimmy Savile abuse allegations) that have led many to question the structure and accountability of the BBC.\r\n\r\nCurrently, recent coverage of the attacks led by Israel on innocent civilians in Gaza have seen the BBC doing a great job of detailing the effects felt by counter attacks on Israel but for some reason the Palestinian people don't seem to get any mention at all. One would expect news coverage of victims on both sides, especially considering that one of the Palestinian victims is the 11 month old child of a BBC news reporter.\r\n\r\nThis petition is calling for the abolition of the BBC TV licence. If we can no longer expect the BBC to provide fair, inclusive and unbiased coverage and reporting then there is clearly no longer a justification for the existence of a BBC license fee.\r\n",
