        "action": "Change the definition of an 'on time' train",
        "additional_details": "Despite poor service, train companies constantly hide behind flawed statistics to justify their performance.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition requests that the definition of an 'on time' train is reviewed in the best interests of paying passengers. The general public are frustrated, dismayed and fed up of being told that their rail service provider has an excellent punctuality record, despite running 5-10 minutes late every day.\r\n\r\nPublic performance measure (PPM) measures the number of trains reaching their final destination 'on time'. On time is defined as within five minutes for regional and London and South East trains, and within ten minutes for long distance trains.\r\n\r\nI propose that the definition of an 'on time' train be reduced to within two minutes for a regional service and within five minutes for a long distance train. Train service providers will then be more accountable for and truthful about the level of service they are delivering to long-suffering, highly-charged passengers.",
