        "additional_details": "Critical thinking should be taught to students from a young age with a similar priority given to it as to english, maths and science.\r\n\r\nAs has become increasingly clear on internet discussion boards and other media, there is often a gross lack of analytical skills in both children and adults. This is displayed through use of logical fallacies, willingness to disregard data and other logical errors.\r\n\r\nDuring my education I was only taught Critical Thinking for one year at one lesson a week during 6th form because I was considered exceptional compared to my peers. The majority of students received no lessons in it. I find this unacceptable.\r\n.\r\nCritical thinking is hugely important in our society ranging from deciding which food to buy in the super market to voting for politicians. It worries me that people are making these decisions based on poor logic as it affects not only them, but their society in general.",
