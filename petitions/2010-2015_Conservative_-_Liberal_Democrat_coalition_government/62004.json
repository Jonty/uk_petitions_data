It MUST BE then that any costs arising out of any illegal activity by them MUST be borne by the individuals involved.  Bankers must NOT be kept immune and protected from the consequences of any criminal activity by being able merely to pass on the tab to the taxpayer.  Bankers have cost our society far too much, and brought our society down far too deeply into the gutter, already.  NOW IS THE TIME FOR THE TAXPAYER TO MAKE A STAND AND PUT A STOP TO IT.",
