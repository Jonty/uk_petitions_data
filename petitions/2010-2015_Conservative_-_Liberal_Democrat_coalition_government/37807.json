        "additional_details": "We need to replace the current National Anthem which only celebrates and concerns one person i.e. the current Monarch, whereas we need an anthem which celebrates and commemorates the whole Nation. This was illustrated during the London Olympics, when the winning athletes received their medals praising the Monarch, when we should in fact be praising the Nation from which the competitors originated from.",
