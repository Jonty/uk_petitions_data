        "additional_details": "This Act introduced very recently is un-democratic and is not in keeping with ideals of free speech and right to protest. The two aspects in particular are the banning of protestors from certain areas of Parliament Square and Westminster. The Government has no right at all to say where people can or cannot protest against anything. It is limiting the freedom of individuals. It is un-democratic and is not in keeping with any ideals of a modern, democratic society; especially when it is a peaceful protest as the recently removed protests/encampments were. The Government should repeal that particular aspect of this Bill and offer an apology to those removed, whom have had their rights infringed upon.",
