Because these are small companies and are not subject to Audit, their employee/Director withdraws these monies as and when they want and choose to declare what they like by filing and declaring understated income and overstating expenses. They decide to close down these companies and open another without any challenges if they think they have overdone it.\r\n\r\nWhat can government do?\r\n\r\nNot to make \"contracting\" tax avoidance type of employment compared to PAYE.\r\n\r\n1) Limited Company to be allowed where the company employs certain number of employees.\r\n2) There should be withholding taxes on the payment to these professionals.\r\n",
