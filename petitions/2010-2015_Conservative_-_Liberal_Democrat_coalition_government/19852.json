        "additional_details": "The historic streets of Soho are being destroyed by the sheer volume of excess traffic speeding down its narrow lanes and streets.    These character packed streets are being choked to death by rat-running through traffic.  Soho's streets need a reallocation of space away from speeding traffic to pedestrians and shoppers.  It's visitors to the area who are key to its success - the area gains nothing from being a rat-run.\r\nWe need pedestrian priority works, speed restrictions, sensitive traffic calming, pavement widening.
