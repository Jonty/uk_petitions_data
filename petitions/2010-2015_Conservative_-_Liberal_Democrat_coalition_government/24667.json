        "additional_details": "Switch government employee pensions over to private pension schemes so that all future government employee contributions are made directly into these schemes and all government employee pensions are paid out of these schemes. This will stabilise government contributions and will ensure non-government employees are not paying to subsidies these schemes to their own detriment. An alternative approach would be to top slice government pension schemes and use the money to make up shortfalls in private schemes, thereby bringing private pension pay-outs more in line with the public sector.
