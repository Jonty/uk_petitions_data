        "additional_details": "ESH Developments, Nathaniel Lichfield & Partners are submitting a planning application on 28th feb 2014 to create a massive housing complex and supermarket.\r\n\r\nThis will attract strangers to our peaceful village which means more traffic, our local run businesses will go out of business because of the supermarket! Wild life will be disturbed or killed to make way for this complex to take place.\r\n\r\nWe want the government not to let this go ahead, we like our village the way it is.\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition to stop this from happening!!
