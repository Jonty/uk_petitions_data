        "additional_details": "Petition to reintroduce compulsory two-year military service for all 16-26 year-old citizens of the United Kingdom. To help address the disaffection prevalent in our society. The petition calls for a programme that will give youth a sense of self-respect, respect for others, teamwork, discipline and vocational training that can give them a head-start in a career that is of value to our society. This petition also calls for the government to consider the possibility of including the emergency services in this programme. This petition does not call for national conscripts to be sent into frontline military conflict but to provide homeland or local community support.",
