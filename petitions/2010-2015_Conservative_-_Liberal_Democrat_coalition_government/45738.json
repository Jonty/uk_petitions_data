        "additional_details": "The Commonwealth is a loose charter that at its fundamental heart encourages international human rights and freedom of trade. Being as it is no longer necessary to be a British past imperial colony/protectorate (ie Mozambique and Rwanda) it sustains little to none of its old imperial heritage. It is also no longer necessary to require HM Queen Elizabeth as head of state, which is why Ireland refused in the first place to enter in 1949. In the interest of continued positive relations and building upon the Good Friday Agreement, I believe it would be logical and beneficial to put towards the Commonwealth the possibility of re-inviting the Republic of Ireland to join this global organisation.",
