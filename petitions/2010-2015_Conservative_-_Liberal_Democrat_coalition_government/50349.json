We are also being blackmailed into signing agreement to pay for example Islington Council charges are \u00a350,000 to \u00a360,00 per unit. Why are we giving away our hard earned sweat for councils to build housing.  This should be the responsibility of government.  We pay our taxes and business rates, we are not getting any contributions towards our rates or taxes. This will stagnate development and hit the small private sector hard.  Is government aware of this stealth taxes!!!  ",
