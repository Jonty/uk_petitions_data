        "additional_details": "This petition is to lobby the government to look into the way in which BSkyB aquires sports and charges high fees to the public to go ahead and watch them.\r\n\r\nOver the past decade, Sky has aquired a number of sports including F1 rights, cricket, football & rugby. It is getting to a point that no other broadcaster can compete with the goliath that is Sky, and much of the general public cannot afford the excessive fees that the company charge to sign up to their services. This needs to be looked into to preserve the freedom of Britains love for sport.",
