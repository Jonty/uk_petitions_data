If they are then the process is faulty, and the Government by commissioning this and failing to regulate it, I would argue, are acting Ultra Vires (beyond their powers).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/28/man-starved-to-death-after-benefits-cut\r\n\r\nMake the change. Sign to open a Judicial Review into how PIP is being implemented and governed.",
