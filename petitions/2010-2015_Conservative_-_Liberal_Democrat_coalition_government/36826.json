        "additional_details": "The deposit required for candidates who wish to stand in the elections for a Police and Crime Commissioner  is \u00a35,000. This is far too high. The deposit for a candidate in a Parliamentary election is only \u00a31,000.\r\nThe deposit is onerous and restricts election to those who are rich or have the backing of a large and wealthy political party. That is unfair.\r\nThe deposit should be no more than \u00a3500 maximum and there should be an alternative of providing a list of 300 supporting voters instead, to deter frivolous participation. Those who can show 300 supporters should pay no deposit.",
