        "additional_details": "Recently Cheshire Fire Authority agreed to close the local Fire Service 999 Control Room & support a sub-regional control center, involving 4 NW Regional Fire Authorities.  We as a collective fire control, with the FULL SUPPORT of the FBU are opposed to this closure in 2014.We believe there will be no operational, technological, political or financial advantages, BUT LOSS of Local autonomy, local knowledge and a considerate drop in standards of service.  If this goes ahead, it will be to the detriment of Cheshire County and its communities.  WE CALL ON THE CHIEF FIRE OFFICER, MEMBERS OF CHESHIRE FIRE AUTHORITY & other COUNCIL MEMBERS to reconsider and keep the local Fire Service Control OPEN!",
