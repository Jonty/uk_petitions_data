I don't carry these around with me, as they are too precious to lose or be stolen. At 16 you can buy a lottery ticket, and go and see certain films in a cinema, but there is no way of proving your age unless you have your passport/birth certificate. I want the government to issue a card to everyone at and above the age of 16, with their photo, name and D.O.B to prove age, because a National Insurance card isn't classed as I.D.",
