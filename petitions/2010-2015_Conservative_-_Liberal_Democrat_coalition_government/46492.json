'Cover Up House' is becoming a more fitting name for the place.  It cannot, therefore, be right that these people are above the law and cannot be sacked or removed from the House of Lords REGARDLESS.  THIS IS STILL A DEMOCRACY (despite the efforts of Nick Clegg) AND THE PEOPLE DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON THE PROCEEDS OF THE PEOPLE'S WORK THROUGH THE TAXES THEY ARE OBLIGED TO PAY OVER TO THEM.  If it needs a change in the law then that should be made to happen by the fastest possible means - our political undesirables have demonstrated that they can introduce laws quickly, look at the Iraq war AND the Afghanistan debacle.",
