        "additional_details": "BBC Radio Suffolk is an essential and innovative part of Suffolk's Culture. The afternoon programmes, in particular the Lesley Dolphin Show, explore the county in depth - its culture, history, personalities and traditions. It showcases and represents all that is best about the county and I'm sure has a significant role to play in Suffolk's economy. It's too valuable a community resource to compromise by \"sharing\" with other areas. The Government should step in to ensure that the schedule is not compromised by BBC cuts.",
