        "additional_details": "Since the introduction of the smoking ban there has been a dramatic increase in pub closures. Working men's clubs have been hit badly too.\r\n\r\nThe ban has damaged local communities with thousands of people deciding to stay at home instead of going out. Let's be fair. Tobacco is a legal product. In Britain ten million adult smokers contribute \u00a310 billion a year in tobacco taxation alone. It\u2019s only right that they should be accommodated in some public places. If the government doesn\u2019t want adults to smoke at home in front of the children or litter the streets, they should be allowed to smoke in some licensed premises. Give landlords and customers a choice. We want the smoking ban amended so licensees can choose to provide a separate, well-ventilated smoking room for adults who wish to smoke. Let common sense prevail. A modest change in the law is all we ask.",
