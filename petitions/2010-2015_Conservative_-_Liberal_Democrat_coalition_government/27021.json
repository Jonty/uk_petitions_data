        "additional_details": "The Gurra Rufa fish (used in foot spa\u2019s) are needlessly dying a slow and painful deaths through ammonia or nitrate poisoning and overfeeding, caused by insufficient knowledge of fish keeping. Animal Welfare Act 2006 states animals must have: A suitable environment - A tank where the fish are disturbed constantly is not suitable. For a suitable diet-Dead skin is not a suitable diet for fish, over feeding is bad for their health. To exhibit normal behaviour patterns-Behaviour is a survival technique due to hot temperatures and lack of mineral content. To be housed with, or apart from, other animals (if applicable)-Overcrowding, there are too many fish kept in foot spas. To be protected from pain, injury, suffering and disease-Suffering from poor living conditions overfeeding leading to disease. Please sign my petition, the majority of the guidelines in the Animal Welfare Act are being broken and hundreds of fish are suffering and dying needlessly right now.",
