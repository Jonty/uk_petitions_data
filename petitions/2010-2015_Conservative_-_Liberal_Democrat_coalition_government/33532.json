This petition is for access to kept clear for cars leaving OR ENTERING a garage or driveway. Insurance companies now dictate whether you can leave your car parked on the road and, if they say you must garage your car overnight, you are in contravention of your insurance leaving it parked on the road even though you cannot physically park it on your property. I would like the government to give the police or another relevant body the power to confiscate cars left blocking residential garages / driveways if there is a complaint from the resident, and with the power to award 3 driving points and a fine for parking without due consideration for others.
