        "additional_details": "I am issuing this petition today in the hope we can change the view people have of Chronic Pancreatitis, and allow those who have a diagnosis the chance to apply for a Blue Badge.\r\n\r\nChronic Pancreatitis is not 'just having abdominal pain' it is a highly debilitating condition with many other complications.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be consistency within DWP. By this, Disability Living Allowance/PIP should either be awarded for the disease or not. It should NOT depend on who assesses the application. It is a FACT some are receiving DLA whilst others have theirs refused. It is unethical to award some and not others. Whilt we acknowledge others may have differing severities and other conditions, this is NOT always the case when the decision is made.",
