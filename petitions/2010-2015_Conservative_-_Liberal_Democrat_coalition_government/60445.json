        "additional_details": "At present there is no requirement for private landlords to be referenced. All the emphasis is currently on assessing whether a tenant will be a good tenant. They have to be referenced, credit checked and have their finances scrutinised. Yet there is nothing to ensure whether someone would be a good landlord. Does the landlord repair and maintain the property as he/she should and in a timely manner? Does the landlord allow the tenant to enjoy the property without interference? Does the landlord address safety issues as he/should? Does the landlord undertake all his responsibilities as per contract and law?\r\nThe answers to these questions should be available to a tenant before they agree to rent a property as a tenant could find a perfect property only to have it ruined by an interfering or negligent landlord. In some cases tenants lives have been placed in danger because of landlords responsibilities not being adhered to.\r\n",
