        "additional_details": "The current system of paying the unemployed to sit at home achieves nothing - JSA should be replaced with a job guarantee, paid at 90% of the minimum wage (to avoid wage inflation) with 35 hours a week of guaranteed work, set hours and 5 weeks of paid holiday each year.\r\n\r\nThe work could be found either by insourcing previously outsourced unskilled and semi-skilled work, or by work on new infrastructure projects, or by requiring attendance at basic skills training sessions for literacy and numeracy.\r\n\r\nJSA currently costs \u00a35bn a year:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/08/uk-benefit-welfare-spending#zoomed-picture\r\n\r\nThe cost of effectively tripling it would be \u00a310bn - the same figure that was considered so negligible as to make the 50p rate not worth the effort.",
