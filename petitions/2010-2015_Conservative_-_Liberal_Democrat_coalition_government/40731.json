        "additional_details": "The TV licence generates \u00a33.5 Billion a year for the BBC. Part 4 of the Communications Act 2003 gives the BBC the powers to collect taxes in the form of the TV Licence.\r\n\r\nThe BBC has proven it no longer acts in the interests of the taxpayers but for its celebrities and executives. This is the behaviour of an immoral large PRIVATE corporation.\r\n\r\nIts long over due and time to remove the powers of the BBC to charge taxpayers for the right to own a TV. \u00a33.5 million is far too much to be paying the BBC in a recession. The BBC is not fit for purpose and should raise funding from other means. ",
