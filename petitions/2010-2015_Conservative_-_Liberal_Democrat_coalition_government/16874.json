This means that firstly we are able to independently confirm that duplicate names haven't been entered to boost the total, secondly dodgy or offensive names can be challenged and possibly pruned, and thirdly any celebrities that endorse a petition are visible.  Public figures are paid money to endorse or advertise an assortment of items - their association may be the main selling point.  So, why not for a moral or social benefit?  They are normally happy to sign petitions without any financial inducement - simply according to their own conscience.  There is a Ghurkha petition on this site - did Joanna Lumley sign it?  We don't know.  Anyone lucky enough to get Ms Lumley's support on a petition, will likely get the MPs running for cover or new underwear. ..",
