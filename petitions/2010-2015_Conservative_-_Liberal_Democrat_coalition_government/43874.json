Infertility isn't a choice; we can't help having fertility problems. It's as if we are being punished for something that's out of our hands as long as you\u2019re in a committed relationship.\r\nI would like all couples to have at least 1 Round of IVF on the NHS, Regardless of age etc\r\nMake IVF treatments Free for childless couples,  raise proper awareness once and for all,\r\nI would like the government to stop the prisons offering this a life cannot be swapped for a life and for them rule that all PCT's must give 1 try of IVF\r\nLets stop this lottery once and for all ",
