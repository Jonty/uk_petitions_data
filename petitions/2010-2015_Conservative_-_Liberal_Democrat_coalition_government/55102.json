        "additional_details": "Opposing the proposal for 120+ dwellings to be erected on Land to the rear of Old Coppice Side, Marlpool, Heanor, Derbyshire,  DE75 7DH.\r\n\r\nThis is green belt land and part of it is a playing field and football pitch.  There is no requirement for further housing in this area and especially in the proposed location. The local schools are full to capacity, the road structure cannot cope with the traffic, there are already insufficient jobs and the safety of children playing will seriously be diminished.\r\n\r\nThe local council appear obsessed and blinded by money coming in rather than representing their local people and their wishes.\r\nThis cannot be right and must be addressed!\r\n\r\nYour signature on this petition is ultra important to even gain an audience with the powers that be.\r\n\r\nThankyou in advance,\r\n\r\nThe residents of Marlpool.",
