Every week, decisions are handed down in the nation's courts that beggar belief. Common sense does not appear to be a strong-point where British justice is concerned. In light of this, is it wise to have a judge (Mr Leveson) alone dictating the way forward for our hard fought (over 300 years) right to freedom of expression? I think not! At  the very least we should have a independent panel with no political, legal or government connections in any way, to consider the issues.",
