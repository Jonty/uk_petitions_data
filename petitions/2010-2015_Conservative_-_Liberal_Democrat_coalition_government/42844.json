        "additional_details": "Council houses should house working people as well, just becasue people work should not mean that they are not entitled to help from the Government seen as the working people are those putting money back into this country.  Even if you do work over 16 hours a week this does not mean that you can afford the high rates of private renting.  If is frustrating to see immigrants not only given housing before us but also help from the local councils when there are English/British people struggling as well.  Put English people first, we are the ones putting money back into this Country and getting nothing in return.  The amount we are paying for private renting could be going on mortgage repayments but then there are no 100% mortgages avaible.  Do something for those that DO WORK!! We need the Government to help those that do work and pay taxes.  ",
