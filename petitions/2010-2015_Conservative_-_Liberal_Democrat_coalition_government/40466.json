Look at him!\r\n\r\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img802/2498/eboue1.gif\r\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img268/8932/eboue2.gif\r\n\r\nSometimes at night I dream of him. I wake up in a cold sweat, flick on my TV, expecting him to be there. He is never there.\r\n\r\nThis has to stop.\r\n\r\nI know I am not alone. Many others have told me that they too are thinking of our best ever right-back, forced into exile in Turkey like some semi-talented miscreant giblet. What did he do to deserve our scorn when all he wanted was our love.\r\n\r\nChange starts here. We want the government to exert pressure on all English Premier League clubs to sign up Eboue. It's clear from his modest but steady return of 3 goals in 31 games that he can still do a job at this level.\r\n\r\nCome on, England! Bring back your prodigal son. Unless he's happy, of course, in which case leave him be.",
