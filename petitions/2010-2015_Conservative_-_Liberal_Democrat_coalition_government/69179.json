        "additional_details": "Islamic State have recently issued a credible threat to execute a British hostage after their brutal execution and murder of an American citizen. Several European nations have already had their nationals safely returned to them by Islamic State - thanks to their ransoms being paid by their respective governments. Britain's absolute refusal to do this for  its own citizens costs lives. If this policy isn't reversed then we will likely lose another life to this barbaric group.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call on the British Government to everything in its power to secure the release of British hostages, including the paying or ransoms in order to save lives.",
