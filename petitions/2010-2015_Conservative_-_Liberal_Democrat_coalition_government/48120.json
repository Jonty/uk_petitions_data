Mostly since the last war they have come to join what they consider to be the best military force in the World  Yet when they need to renew a passport for active service or duty overseas, unlike their British National comrades they have to pay the cost of the passport fees. MOD should pay the cost.\r\n\r\nThe biggest honor to these non nationals for serving in our forces would be to offer them British Nationality after serving for 6 years. Because they have served our Queen and country and have been willing, to put their lives on the line to protect our nation.\r\n\r\nThere should be no fees and it would be up to them to accept British Nationality if they so wish.
