        "additional_details": "We call upon the UK Government to call a halt to the increasing number of crimes committed in our country by immigrants, particularly those including the exploitation and abuse of our children as seen this week in Oxfordshire and recently in Lancashire. The Government, above all else, has a mandate from the electorate to ensure our streets and homes are safe for our families. This petition calls specifically for 1st and 2nd generation immigrant families to be deported without question and without the right of appeal as soon as they are found guilty of these, or any other, crimes in order to a) protect UK citizens, and b) prevent racial discontent in the future.",
