        "additional_details": "Iain Duncan Smiths Department have withdrawn Job Seekers receiving Unemployment Benefits if they do not prove they are using On Line Internet Search Engines.\r\nThis is a cynical attack on those of which there are many who have no Computer skills or indeed the aptitude to undertake such tasks. Many have no regular access to the equipment. The payments withdrawn should be reinstated and back paid with interest immediately. What may be a better alternative is that Job Centre Plus must find 3 reasonably suitable vacancies per month for those seeking employment.Failure to do this should be added to a league table of failing Job Centres and published quarterly.",
