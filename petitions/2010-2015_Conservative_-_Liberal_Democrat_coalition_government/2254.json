This would resolve the current issue posed by the \"West Lothian question\", whereby Northern Irish/ Welsh/Scottish MPs can vote on exclusively English concerns, but English MPs cannot vote on exclusively Northern Irish/Welsh/Scottish affairs.\r\n\r\nThis also offers a more practical, common sense alternative to an English parliament, which would prove more expensive both in the short and long term as well as create more elections when many voters are already apathetic or feel there are too many levels of government already.",
