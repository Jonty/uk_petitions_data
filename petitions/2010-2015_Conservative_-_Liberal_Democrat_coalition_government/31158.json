There are more CCTV cameras per person than almost any other nation on earth.\r\nNow the government is planning to cast its intrusive eye over online activity, phone calls and text messages, all under the guise of an anti-terror law. Hyped up by the Olympics.\r\nThe only other place in the world that has this much control in China.  We cant just let them take away our rights for privacy. Terrorism has allowed the Government to revoked our rights. Terrorism is the justification for this but it will be abused.\r\nCopyright Infringement with the UK signing\r\nACTA will be the main goal.\r\n\r\n",
