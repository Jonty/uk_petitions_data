We are in a crisis, many MP's are in \"safe seats\", they are parachuted there by the party leader and may not reflected the views of the Constituents, but are elected because they have the Party name next to theirs.\r\n\r\nA primary system would make MP's no longer accountable to the party leadership, but to the people. The USA successfully introduced this, we should apply the primary system here. ",
