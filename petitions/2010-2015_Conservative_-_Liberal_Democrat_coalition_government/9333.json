        "additional_details": "We, the public, petition the government to introduce a three strikes law. If an offender commits three serious criminal offences, after being given two separate chances to reform by the courts, they should automatically receive a sentence of life imprisonment without the option of parole.\r\n\r\nOver 80% of the public believe that prison sentences are too soft, and frontline police officers are demoralised by our revolving door justice system. Taking into account the burden that continually releasing repeat offenders places on the Police, the CPS, Legal Aid and the victims themselves, life imprisonment in modern purpose built prisons is a cheaper option than the current system.\r\n\r\nOnly a society which protects the rights of victims of crime against repeat offenders can claim to respect human rights. A society that allows a weak and ineffective justice system to operate against the will of the people is not a just society at all.\r\n",
