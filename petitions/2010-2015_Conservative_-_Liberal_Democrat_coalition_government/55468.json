        "additional_details": "I'd like the government to legislate a limit on the ratio of the salaries & benefits of the highest to lowest paid employees of any company. Currently, boardroom salaries & benefits skyrocket whilst the salaries & benefits of the lowest paid employees rise at a rate usually at or below inflation. Placing a limit on the ratio of salaries & benefits between the highest and lowest paid employees will lead to company profits being shared more equitably. I propose that a review be carried out, in order to establish the range of ratios currently in operation, before setting a maximum, which would then be reviewed periodically, perhaps even by the general public through means of a multiple choice referendum.",
