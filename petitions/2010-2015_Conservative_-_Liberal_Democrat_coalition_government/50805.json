        "additional_details": "The Deanes School has been told that it is facing imminent closure due to the financial viability of the school since its government funding for a new school fell through.\r\n\r\nTwo neighbouring schools have been asked to co-operate and assist finding places for nearly 800 kids, putting there own infrastructure under severe stress.\r\n\r\nThe Deanes School was recently inspected by Ofsted and recieved a \"good with outstanding\" status, and is home to many outstanding teachers.\r\n\r\nNot only that, 60% of students live nearby and walk to school and 95% of current students will have to travel an extra 4 miles to the nearest other school.\r\n\r\nIt is a good school that has been embroiled in financial mis-management stemming from a change of government. Help put a stop to it and show local government how much the area needs this school.",
