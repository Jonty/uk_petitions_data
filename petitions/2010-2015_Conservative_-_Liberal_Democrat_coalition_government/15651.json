In the process of dividing Ireland against the will of the majority of Irish people and denying to Scotland and to Wales the voice in the conduct of affairs they are entitled to the present Union of the British accords to the Capital City of the English disproportionate Power, Status and Benefit.\r\nBritain as a Country with a separate Constitutional and Legal Identity of its own should therefore no longer exist. It is a Device not of British Design but of English. If it continues to exist at all it is only as a geographical notion and historical curiosity that it should. In any worthwhile and proper Union of the British the only Countries that should exist are England, Scotland, Wales and a restored and reunited Ireland.",
