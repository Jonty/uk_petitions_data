        "additional_details": "Many chronic pain sufferers have found relief from manipulation when even Medication, Injection, Acupunture and Physiotherapy hasn`t work. As part of a Chronic pain group i know many of us have only had relief by paying private for Chiropratic Adjustments regular. This means we can get rid of addictive tablets and most of us i truly believe will be able to get back to some kind of work and normality. Our country does a lot for drug users but are creative addicts out of Chronic pain sufferers and creating more health problems after yrs of addictive medication.",
