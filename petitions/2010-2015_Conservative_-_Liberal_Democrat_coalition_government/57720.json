Too many cyclists are skipping red lights and cycling on the pavements.\r\n\r\nFor too long officials, ministers, devolved politicians and militant-cyclist groups have had an almost exclusive access to the media, leaving pedestrians and drivers voiceless. They blame the space, they blame the drivers, the politicians blame each other. It is time to blame those responsible for these dangers - the cyclists themselves.\r\n\r\nNew laws need to be introduced to\r\n\r\n- TREBLE fines for cyclists on our pavements\r\n- TREBLE fines for jumping red lights\r\n- Bicycle-abusers bikes should be confiscated, melted down and the cost of this passed on to them in addition to the fines.\r\n- Minimum punishments for cyclists should be equal to those of drivers.",
