        "additional_details": "-HS2 is very unpopular and will not contribute to helping 99% of people in the UK\r\n\r\n-HS2 is costing the taxpayer 40-50+ Billion\r\n\r\n-The government has signed a deal with the Chinese and French to build nuclear power plants.\r\n\r\n-Energy bills will eventually increase and all the profits will be leaving the UK.\r\n\r\nJust ask yourself this question- If the government can raise the 40-50bn needed for HS2 surely it makes sense to sideline this project now and become the majority shareholder in Hinkley Point. Helping securing our nation's power supply, allowing greater control over supply costs, helping generate income to fund HS2 type projects in the future if we need them.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of everyone who signs this petition- we demand that the government scraps HS2 and re -allocates the funding to secure the future of our nations energy infrastructure.
