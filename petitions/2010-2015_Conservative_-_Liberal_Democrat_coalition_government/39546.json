        "additional_details": "I want the Government to force people who receive unemployment benefit to do mandatory community work, this way they have a job routine and it would be easier for the unemployed to acclimatise to a new job when they find one. Also they would think that the money they receive in unemployment benefits is not worth the job they are doing and they would therefore renew their efforts to find a job and are more likely to accept any job that comes their way.",
