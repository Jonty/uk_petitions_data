There is nothing wrong with companies ,Banks for example,  to make profits, but these profits can not only be attributed to very senior directors. All employees of large corporations should benefit from the success of that corporation. There should be rules that ensure that a maximum % variance is imposed between the top and bottom earners of a company and that bonuses and salaries, therefore wealth,is more evenly spread between employees within a company.
