        "additional_details": "All dogs will be microchipped by 2016. This petition is to prevent the growing numbers of unwanted dogs being taken to pounds across the UK.  All registered owners or keepers must be prosecuted if they fail to collect their dogs from pounds even if the dog has been rehomed.  Pounds and rescues are simply overwhelmed with the sheer numbers of abandoned dogs.  There are no provisions by Government to fund this.  Instead, the dogs are either saved by overwhelmed rescue centres or put to sleep for no reason other than their owners wouldn't collect them.  It is time that these people were held more accountable and the launch of the legality of the chip can be used to aid this.",
