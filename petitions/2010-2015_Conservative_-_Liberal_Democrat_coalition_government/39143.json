        "additional_details": "I Truly believe that Nursing homes should have more surprise inspections and undercover inspections as with experience in working in a care home when the managers know that an inspection is coming up they put who they believe are there best care workers and clean the place. To which is not there day to day environment or standards. I have witnessed terrible things and feel so strongly about this I have tears writing this. Please consider our elderly or disabled in care home right now and how they are feeling. They feel as though they have to keep quite about how they have been treated as people threatened them. This is vulgar behavior which unfortunately i have witnessed but I was only 17 at the time and felt so overwhelmed and scared I felt as though I couldn't say anything. I truly believe it is the only way to see the absolute truth and give the people in our care the best possible life and care!",
