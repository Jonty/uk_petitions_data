        "additional_details": "It is staggering how many people you see using a mobile  phone whilst driving.  I presume very few of them get caught too, so by installing cameras into traffic lights - a time when many offenders feel tempted to use their phones whilst waiting at a red light - people driving through or pulling away when the light goes green and using a phone will be caught on camera doing so and can be prosecuted.\r\nUnemployed people can be used to sieve through footage in return for their benefit if need be and rewarded for every offender they find, to ensure they actually check it.",
