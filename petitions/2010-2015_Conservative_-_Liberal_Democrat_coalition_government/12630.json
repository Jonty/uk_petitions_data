        "additional_details": "Give the historical authority figures in our society their powers of discipline back.\r\nAllow parents, to smack disobedient children, allow teachers to reprimand children in their care, allow the Police to exercise their role in being proper law enforcers. Correct the bizarre and often stupid political correctness that has pervaded it's way into our society. THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO! Our children, our future, need direction, focus and discipline. Allow society to forge these youngsters into decent members of society who have earned their rights, instead of the 'disassociated youth' that seem to demand respect without the realisation that if they don't respect others, no-one will respect them.",
