        "additional_details": "In my experience the current state of education within Secondary Schools and Further Education Colleges is poor. This is due to the a significant number of students not wanting to continue to study and therefore feeling the need to interrupt the lessons, which prevents those who want to learn from learning. To increase the length of education to the age of 18, will only lead to the increase of interrupted education and therefore decrease the amount of passes achieved by students. To prevent this happening a person should only be in compulsory education till the age of 16.",
