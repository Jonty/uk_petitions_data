        "additional_details": "The Grand National might be a spectacle that captivates the British public, but for me it simply serves as a reminder of the absolute disregard for animals and their welfare which some humans seem to have.\r\n\r\nFor too long, the cruelty of the race has been blithely ignored by the horse-racing authorities and the race-going public.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn\u2019t be like this. Sport, after all, is meant to be an uplifting activity, reflecting the quest for excellence and heroism in competition. But there is nothing remotely inspirational or heroic about forcing horses to gallop round a dangerous course at high speed and risk sustaining painful, even fatal falls.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing like the same concern for horses\u2019 welfare shown in the National. The deaths and injuries to the animals seem to be regarded as, at best, nothing more than inconvenient\r\n\r\nBan the race & stop the cruelty !!\r\n",
