        "additional_details": "I believe people deserve a break from taxes during the holiday time. During November anyone making less then \u00a325000 per should should only pay 50% tax during the month of november on there basic pay. This will help people celebrate the holidays better with more money to pay debts, treat themselves & family. Doing this would boost the countries moral around a tough time of year for most people.\r\n\r\n",
