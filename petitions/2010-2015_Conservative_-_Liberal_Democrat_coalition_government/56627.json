The judge publicly agreed with the jury\u2019s verdict and warned the NHS Counter Fraud Service, now known as NHS Protect, to think \u201clong and hard\u201d before bringing a similar case to court. The trial cost \u00a31.5\u2009million and the total cost to the NHS was estimated at \u00a33\u2009million.\r\nA GMC panel later admitted there had been a \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d in the way it had handled her case.\r\nThe NHS should be investigated for what supporters called a 'vendetta'.",
