It is pushing the Sumatran tigers to extinction, which means that these beautiful species will no longer be alive.These tigers live in the rainforests of Indonesia, which also means that trees and greenery will be cut down Which means that these beautiful species will no longer be alive.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to look closely at the types of indigents shampoos are sing and how they can affect the environment and our world less. It is our world and we are the ones doing harm to it so we can also be the ones to stop.\r\n\r\nVisit this site to find out more:  http://dirtysecret.greenpeace.org/ ",
