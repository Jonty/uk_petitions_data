        "action": "Stop the use of UCAS Points tariffs on graduate employment opportunities",
        "additional_details": "This petition is to stop employers using UCAS Points tariffs on their graduate employment opportunities. UCAS points tariffs on graduate employment opportunities means that a student   with a first class degree but with average to poor A Levels or equilent cannot apply for a quarter of graduate jobs which now ask for 260-340 ucas points. These tariffs also prevent students who entered university through less traditional means from applying. This shows employers have a lack of trust in the university system to provide a certain quality level of graduates. ",
