        "additional_details": "There should be a fair and representitive cross section of society (Peoples Panel) who decide which issues arising from the e-petition site are put forward for discussion once they have reached the required amount of signitures. No MP's should be allowed to interfere with the process, as they have in recent years proven themselves to be far from 'honourable' or trustworthy. All matters approved by the Peoples Panel, must be given proper time within the house and any petition that recieves over 5 million signitures of support must be, without exception, issued in the form of a referendum for the nation to decide.",
