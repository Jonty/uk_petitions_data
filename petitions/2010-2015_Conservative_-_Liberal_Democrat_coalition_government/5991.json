        "additional_details": "The UK government has an inconsistant policy on job advertisement. Some central government positions are advertised via the internet, some are advertised via newspapers. Why does it not all go through a central government website? This would ensure more people see the advert, costs are cheaper as the government already has an internet presence and it will reach a greater range of people. It will also make it easier for people to apply for job to the government as there will be a central point.",
