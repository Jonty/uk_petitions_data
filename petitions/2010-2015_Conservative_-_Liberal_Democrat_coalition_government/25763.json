I feel that any mobile camera vans/speed gun sights should display clear sign posts on that road (when in operation) to keep motorists safe from any danger and to reduce speeds on our roads. Obviously that is their primary purpose for being there and not to generate revenue for the government. Us as motorists feel that without these signs clearly displayed with plenty of notice, we feel at danger and also tricked.\r\n",
