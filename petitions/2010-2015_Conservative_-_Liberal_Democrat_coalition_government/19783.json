        "additional_details": "The stigma attached to mental health needs to be abolished, many people do not feel like they can open up about their mental health problems, they'll have a 'Label' attached to them, they will be judged or treated differently. This shouldn't be the case! Some people are more understanding nowadays, but many people are ignorant about mental health because they simply don't know anything about it.\r\n\r\nWe need more Government Campaigns de stigmatising Mental Health, more education for young people in schools about all mental health illnesses, more advertising about  mental health services so that a wider variety of people can/will access them. More understanding in the workplace and no job discrimination.",
