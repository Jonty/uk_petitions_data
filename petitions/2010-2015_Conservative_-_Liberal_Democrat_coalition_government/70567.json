        "additional_details": "I believe that the scrapping of the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) in 2010 was a grave error.\u00a0EMA allowed students from some of the poorest families to access Further Education, and its abolition has had a hugely detrimental impact, hitting students particularly hard.\u00a0We believe that the government should reinstate EMA, which would require only a modest investment, to broaden access to education and to benefit the economy as a whole.\r\nBy signing this petition you agree to the following:\r\nI, the undersigned, call upon the government to bring back EMA (Education Maintenance Allowance) so that the young generation of age 16+ can excel in their education and live better lives.",
