British Police have been introducing new and improved ways of reducing crime. These improvements have been unsuccessful, so due to this, we have seen a larger crime wave spread across Britain for many years. If all police personel were carrying some sort of fire-arm, we personally think that crime in Britain would be significantly reduced.",
