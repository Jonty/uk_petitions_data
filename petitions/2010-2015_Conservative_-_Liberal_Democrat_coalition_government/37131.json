        "action": "\"Always Look on the Brighter Side of Life\" to be new National Anthem of all of the UK",
        "additional_details": "After the tremendous national unity shown during the Olympics it is clear there a mood of national optimism and pride in the air. Sadly there were parts of the UK who felt unable to support the current National Anthem which tends to alienate non-royalist, atheists and the Welsh.\r\n\r\nThere is one song the words of which were sung with huge enthusiasm by the crowd at the closing ceremony of the Olympics that I propose would be perfect as our new inclusive and optimistic National Anthem. That song is \u201cAlways Look on the Bright Side of Life\u201d.\r\n\r\nSign this if you are optimistic about our country and support this.\r\n",
