We are all worried about the spiralling cost to the planet due to energy usage etc.\r\n\r\nWhy are the big names allowed to trade 24/7? In the grand scheme of things, does it really help to be able to browse the isles of the ever more expensive mega supermarket, that you have to drive to, at 1am in the morning? Would life be better if less people were out driving to supermarkets after 8pm? Would your town be a quieter and more peaceful place if hordes of teens didnt hang around the all night grocery store? After all, there is only so much money to spend regardless of how long you are able to spend it.\r\n\r\nLet the local stores service the local community but ban the big businesses from decimating your spirit.",
