        "additional_details": "Too many members of Parliament come from middle and upper-class backgrounds, have wealth behind them and have private educations. As such I propose that representation in Parliament ought to reflect the population of the UK. For example, if only 5% of the population is upper-class then ONLY 5% of Parliament should be upper-class and come from wealthy backgrounds. If 80% of the country is in lower social classes then 80% of MPs ought to come from a lower social class.\r\n\r\nI believe this will create a more equal and fair parliament as the voices of the lower-classes (the majority of the UK) need to be heard more than they currently are.",
