        "additional_details": "There is no need to abort a healthy child for social circumstances as she/he can be taken into care. However screening embryos in order to indentify carriers of crippling genetic diseases prior to implanting IVF embryos OR during early stages of pregnancy (like less than 13 weeks old) is an ethical & worthwhile cause. Abortion should only be performed for identified incurable crippling genetic diseases of embryos or to save mothers\u2019 lives; NOT for convenience, social circumstances or innocuous psychological conditions of patents. Abortion on embryos should also not be done for innocuous curable characteristics like the colour of hair or for clef lips. Human embryos less than 13 weeks old are a group of cells without consciousness. Therefore abortion should preferably be done for embryos less than 13 weeks old. However due to the series tests needed to support the medical grounds for abortion, it may not always be possible for an abortion to be much less than 24 weeks of pregnancy.",
