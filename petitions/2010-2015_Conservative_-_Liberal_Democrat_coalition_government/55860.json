        "additional_details": "this e-petition is aimed at allowing the many pressure groups views of certain issues to be taken into account by the British government, this would allow them to express their concern and not fear that their view is being made invalid by the current coalition government that is in power at this current time.\r\n\r\nthis would make life easier for many pressure groups, like Greenpeace to get their point across to the political side of decisions that are being made. this petition would allow the pressure groups more time to help the cause they are committed to as well as influencing the government to help them out as best they can",
