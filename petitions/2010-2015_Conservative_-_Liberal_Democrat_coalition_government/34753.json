Currently available therapies for patients with cystic fibrosis only address the consequences of the disease, not the underlying defect. Clinical studies showed that Kalydeco improved pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis patients with the specific G551D-CFTR mutation.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis paragraph is taken directly from the EMA Press release of 25th May2012.\r\n\r\nKalydeco has been approved and prescribed in the USA since February of this year and has been found to have outstanding results in preventing further lung damage in those with the G551D mutation.
