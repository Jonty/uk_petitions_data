I have young children and too many times, when we believe we are watching a programme suitable for family viewing, something of a sexual nature  is included.  I do not want my young children exposed to inappropriate material.  Broadcasters should take more care about what is televised for family viewing.  If it is inappropriate for children it should not be broadcast before 9p.m.",
