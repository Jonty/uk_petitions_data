        "additional_details": "We call on Parliament to legislate so MPs can be legally bound by their constituents on how they vote in the Commons.  Democracy means \"the rule of the people\", not simply to have elections, and so our system should not allow \"electoral dictatorship\" where MPs can vote how they like once they are in office. With a petition of at least 50% of electors signed by an MP's constituents requiring them to vote yes or no on a particular motion and all related constituents would be able to control voting through their MPs and this would enhance the quality of our democratic society.",
