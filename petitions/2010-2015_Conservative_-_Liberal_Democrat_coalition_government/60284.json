Over the last few years, nurses have had to cope with a pay freeze at the same time that the cost of living has increased massively. An above-inflation increase from \u00a3100 to \u00a3120 a year would be a shockingly unfair move for the NMC to make.\r\n\r\nRegistration fees were raised from \u00a376 to \u00a3100 last year, and a further rise to \u00a3120 would be an increase of almost 60 per cent over two years.\r\n\r\nThe Government should intervene to stop this daylight robbery.",
