        "additional_details": "Reconsider MOD's decision to scrap the Sea Harrier fleet and aircraft carriers in favour of the new aircraft carriers which were due to be commissioned by 2015/16. This is now expected to be 2020, another catastrophic failure on the governments behalf. With 8years until these carriers are due to be commissioned (assuming all goes to plan) we may experience many oversea threats and with no sea-air protection for our navy. There are Sea Harriers in storage at RNAS Culdrose, even tho a small fleet they should be cheaper to maintain and would also reinstate a british icon. Further more also consider the possible purchase of the India Sea Harrier Fleet in 2014.",
