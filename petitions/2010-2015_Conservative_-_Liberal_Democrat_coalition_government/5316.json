It is not uncommon to see individuals spend money they can not afford to feed their drug like habits.\r\n\r\nThis needs to stop and the current stance in encouraging gambling through TV advertisement and other forms is not worth the revenue it generates.\r\n\r\nRecord numbers of bookmakers are opening on our high streets for a reason.",
