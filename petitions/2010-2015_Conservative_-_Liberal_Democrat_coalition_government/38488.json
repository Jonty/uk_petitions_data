        "additional_details": "We are 15 year old twins who are doing this e-petition for our mum and other people who are being forced to go through the same medical assessments. The government are doing these medical assessments for the registered disabled to see whether they are eligible to work or not. Our mum can't work under any circumstance, due to her having arthritis, fibromyalgia, IBS, polycythemia, diabetes and insomnia just sitting at a desk for 10 minutes will create so much pain. Also having to sit in front of a panel will just be too much for our mum to cope with as she also suffers with anxiety and depression. Overall these medical assessments will just be too much for our mum mentally, emotionally and physically so they need to be cut and stopped.",
