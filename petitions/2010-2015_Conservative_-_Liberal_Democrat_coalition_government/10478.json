        "additional_details": "In response to the recent riots across England, i think it's clear national service, at the very least, must be considered as an answer. The teenage thugs we see roaming the street that have left education and are unemployed would also benefit with some much needed discipline. This would also make Britain feel like a safer place to live.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to generalise teenagers and say they're all undisciplined yobs that display anti-social behaviour, it is in my opinion only the minority. The media likes to focus on the negatives but i think the recent riots across England is more than enough of an argument for national service to be considered by the government as a response.",
