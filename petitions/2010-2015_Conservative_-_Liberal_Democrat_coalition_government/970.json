Now as they are in breach of contract shouldn't the other channels who also bid to provide free to view coverage now be able to re-tender for the duration of the contract?\r\nIs there not a State Aid issue here because the BBC is now giving away some of its contractural rights without tendering them?\r\nWho is to say that Sky is the best value for money solution if there's been no tender. It's public money that is now - without a tender - being redistributed to the private sector - and that conflicts with every EU State Aid rule going.",
