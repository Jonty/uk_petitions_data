        "additional_details": "This ex-Naval Officer has done more for the advancement of Naval Aviation than many other recipients of awards over the last 65 years, and yet he has received no official recognition from this country in the form of a personal honour or award. Not only has he set records that other, more prosperous, nations cannot equal nor emulate, he has the intellect to be used in the interrogation of very senior prisoners of war in the 1940's. He has engendered the respect of at least three more generations of Royal Naval personnel, from AB's to Admirals. In short this man is as great a legend as any other honoured aviators  and yet is less recognised by his national awards committee than many personalities engaged in less arduous but more eye catching activities.\r\n Please give recognition to our REAL heroes who can inspire the nation to do what they can for the NATION.\r\n",
