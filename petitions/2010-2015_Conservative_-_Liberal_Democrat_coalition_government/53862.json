We believe that either every student nurse should get the highest amount of NHS bursary, or a full student loan should be offered to us.\r\nIt is also disgusting that the NHS expect our parents to pay towards our university expenses even if they cannot afford to do this.\r\nAll student nurses will relate to this situation and will understand that action needs to be taken in order for nursing to be a feasible option for students in the future.\r\nA change needs to happen.",
