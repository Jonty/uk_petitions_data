An estimated 1.6 million are kept as pets. However, research has identified them to be the MOST neglected and cruelly treated of all pets:  http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/media-pr-centre/news/1032_unhappy-bunnies\r\n\r\nSOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE! We must take action to reduce the widespread suffering of domestic rabbits. This must begin with changing the public perception of rabbits as \u2018cheap\u2019, \u2018easy\u2019 and even \u2018disposable\u2019 pets. In reality rabbits are sensitive, intelligent animals with complex needs. They can live in excess of ten years and deserve similar status/protection as the UK\u2019s dogs and cats.\r\n\r\nWe need to challenge the unacceptable common place attitude of \u2018it\u2019s only a rabbit\u2019. We believe that this should start by the government introducing a code of practice for the welfare of domestic rabbits.\r\n",

In addition, the Pet Advertising Advisory Group (PAAG \u2013 a group of animal welfare, veterinary groups and animal keeping interests) have produced standards for internet and classified publications that advertise pets for sale which will help to make more people aware of how to purchase and keep rabbits as required under the Animal Welfare Act 2006\r\n\r\nThis e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.",
