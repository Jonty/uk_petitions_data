The difference could be enough to cause learning difficulties in children who already had a lower IQ.\r\nTheir study \u2013 which analysed 27 previously-published papers \u2013 is the first to confirm that fluoride affects the intelligence of children.   The differences were significant, say the researchers, and could have a substantial impact on learning disabilities, especially in those at the low end of the IQ spectrum.\r\n(Source: Environmental Health Perspectives, 2012; published online: http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1104912).",
