        "additional_details": "Isle of Wight run businesses are suffering and tourism is dying, mainly due to one factor...our Island ferries. In recent months they've been charging just under \u00a3300 for a return ferry! I believe a road tunnel is what the Island needs to bring people over and help the Island survive. We have a beautiful Island and I honestly do not believe that a road tunnel (dependant on design) would NOT ruin the Island. I know of many people that now have to commute to the mainland for work as wages are lower on the IOW and there are not as many career opportunities.Tourists are put off by ferry prices and bad experiences, they might come once but why pay \u00a3300 for a ferry when you can holiday on the South Coast without that crippling cost!  Please join this petition. NOW it's time to think of the future of the Island and make major improvements for the residents and visitors. ",
