        "additional_details": "Carlton Avenue / Broadhey Romiley Stockport is a well used 'rat run' for vehicles avoiding the traffic calming measures at the bottom of Sandy Lane. Vehicles regularly reach excessive speeds in both directions (up and down). There are double parked cars at the bottom third and a blind hump half way down.\r\nI am very concerned as many parents (me included) walk their children to Romiley primary school along this route.\r\nThere has been two surveys commissioned over the past 5 years (The most recent being just before the road was resurfaced - its even quicker now) but I don't feel an average speed check gives a representative assessment of the dangers of this road.\r\nI would like to make this road 20mph. Ideally make the road one way or add speed restriction measures (humps, chicanes) as appropriate.",
