        "additional_details": "When the electorate go to the polls to elect a new government or local council, we are casting our votes democratically without scrutiny by anyone, and without anyone knowing who we are voting for.\r\n\r\nNot so in parliament. There is intense scrutiny in which way members of parliament vote. Whether they are voting with the government or party, and which way they are expected to vote. This is not democracy, this is coercion to vote the way the party wants a member to cast their vote.\r\n\r\nIn this day and age of electronics we should have an electronic form of voting which is a secret to everyone. Each member could be given an electronic voting device with just two buttons, one for yes and one for no.\r\n\r\nEach will press the respective button on the device, only once would be allowed, and cast their vote electronically, saving a huge amount of time and expense. A huge screen in the chamber could then, in real time, electronically record the amount of votes for or again each motion.",
