        "action": "The Legal Right to 2Mbps Fairly Priced, Minimum Broadband Speed in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "The UN recognises the importance of universal access to broadband to support human rights. Finland passed a law in 2010 to make it a legal right to have access to 1Mbps, with a commitment to improve that to 100Mbps by 2015.\r\n\r\nIt is widely recognised that adequate broadband is essential for commerce, healthy living, social interaction, education, and human rights.\r\n\r\nThis petition asks that anyone in the UK should have a legal right to a minimum of 2Mbps broadband speed, with a commitment to 50Mbps minimum by 2015 for all.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, providers should not be able to charge customers full price for receiving a lesser service than the maximum advertised, with a sliding payment scale introduced to reflect a lesser service when it occurs. e.g. if a customer receives 2Mbps and can only connect on a minimum package of 16Mbps then the customer should only pay one eighth of the monthly fee.\r\n\r\nNo customer should be discriminated against due to their location.",
