This would serve the folloing purposed. 1 ) Limit visual pollution of land heritage sites by wind farms.\r\n2) Ensure a steady flow of renewable electricity from these sites/farms. When the wind stops blowing the under water tidal turbines can provide electricity to the grid and when the wind does blow surplus remewable electricity could be provided to the grid from the wind turbines on top! A winner all round!",
