        "additional_details": "After watching the panorama special on 'I want my baby back', I felt hugely sorry and upset for the families that have been affected and ripped apart from false accusations. As a mother myself, I could not even contemplate the thought of someone accusing me of hurting my own flesh and blood let alone taking him away and having him adopted and him never seeing his parents again all through lack of investigation of doctors, social services and the family court system. I want to petition that adequate blood tests are preformed to check for low vit d and all the necessary blood tests and medical investigation and any other possibility for the injury BEFORE the decision taken for the child to go into care. I also want this information heard and taken into account when these parents are put through the family court system.",
