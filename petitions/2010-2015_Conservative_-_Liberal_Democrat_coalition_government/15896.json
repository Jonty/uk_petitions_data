        "additional_details": "This is a petition to get the Oyster Card Scheme extended to Welwyn Garden City. The reason for the extension is that lots of people commute from Welwyn Garden City and surrounding towns commute into London, the oyster card is also cheaper and quicker then a conventional paper ticket. The Scheme has also been extended to Grays in Essex 1 (this was due to a petition )\r\n1= Source - Brookmans Park Community Forum http://www.brookmans.com/forum/index.php/topic,2366.0.html",
