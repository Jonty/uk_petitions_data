It only allows terrorists and criminals to get away with whatever they want because anything done to punish them is an abuse of their human rights.\r\nThe whole ideal of what a human right is has been seriously abused in the UK.\r\n\r\nCriminals, murderers and terrorists negate their human rights when they do what they do.\r\n\r\nA proper Bill of Rights enacted for the British public that protects our ancient rights is long overdue.
