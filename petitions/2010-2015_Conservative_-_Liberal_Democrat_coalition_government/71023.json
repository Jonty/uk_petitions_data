        "additional_details": "With more and more sharia law propoganda appearing in our towns and cities i feel that us as united kingdon citizens need to prevent sharia law coming into the united kingdom. Over the past couple of years more and more notices relating to sharia law have appeared on our streets and online telling us britiains that we can no longer do the things we can and have been doing for hundreds of years in certain areas because the area is now covered by sharia law. One instance was a lady in london who was beaten by muslims for simply not having her legs covered walking down the street of which muslims are now claiming to be covered by sharia law. There has also been videos posted online from muslims telling us that soon our country GREAT BRITAIN will become sharia and there is nothing we can do to stop it. I feel that we need to prevent this from happening before it is too late.",
