        "additional_details": "The high rate of fuel duty impacts on everyone.  It increases production and delivery costs for all kinds of goods and services.  Even non drivers are affected by higher public transport costs and higher prices in shops.  I wish there to be a debate on the merits of a temporary cut in this duty, at least until the cost of crude oil comes down.  Then the duty can be re-raised when the overall cost has come down to a manageable level.",
