Philip Hammond MP, do not think the Armed Forces are important to the citizens of the UK.\r\n\r\nThe Government say they are not as important to the voters of the UK as Health or Education. Therefore they feel they can cut them as they wish.\r\n\r\nWe need our Armed Forces TO KEEP US SAFE, we expect them to lay their lives down for us and this is how we are treating them.\r\n\r\nIf you care about our Armed Forces,  please sign NOW.\r\n",
