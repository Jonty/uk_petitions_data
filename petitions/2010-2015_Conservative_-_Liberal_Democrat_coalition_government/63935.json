        "additional_details": "I ask for your support now in submitting a formal complaint to BIS, using their own government policy against them, on how to conduct a 'fair and transparent consultation process'. The apprenticeship reforms technical consultation stated only 80 employer responses from the July consultation had been received, when I know over 1600 employer views had been submitted from 4 provider sources - these were only counted as 4 responses! The impact of the Apprenticeship reforms will undoubtedly affect apprentices of the future in our community. As the NEET figures rise, these reforms will have a devastating impact on the number of new starts in 2016. It is clear there is a common trend across the country that many employers feel the same way, but the government chooses not to listen.
