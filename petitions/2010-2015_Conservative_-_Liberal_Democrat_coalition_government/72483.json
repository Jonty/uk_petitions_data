        "additional_details": "We, the signatories, urge the British Government to condemn Israel's Nationality Bill which defines national rights as belonging only to Jews, removing  rights from one fifth of the population who are not of the Jewish faith. The Bill also proposes to make Hebrew the only national language, de-listing  Arabic as the second official language. We therefore call on the Prime Minister to indicate strongly to his Israeli counterpart that to pass such a measure would be anti-democratic, would not be supported in any way by the UK, and would lose Israel much support around the world.
