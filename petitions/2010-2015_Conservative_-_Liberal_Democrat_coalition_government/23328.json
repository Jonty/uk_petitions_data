        "additional_details": "People with already diagnosed mental illness are being subjected to unnecessary and harmful interviews in order to claim ESA.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the opinion of someone's NHS mental health professional is not taken into account when being assessed for ESA. Interviews are often conducted by ATOS emplyees with no or inadequate knowledge of mental illness leading to many rightful claimants being rejected under this system.\r\n\r\nIf one is able to complete the paperwork, the waiting time for interview, the interview itself and inevitable appeals process are extremely stressful and lead to an increase in mental illness symptoms such as extreme anxiety and sometimes suicidal thoughts.\r\n\r\nAll this when simply checking with their current mental health professional would have proven their case and protected them from harm.\r\n\r\nIf a new system is not introduced, it will inevitably lead to an increase in homelessless and suicide. This issue simply cannot be ignored any longer.",
