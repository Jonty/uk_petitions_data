It insists up to 50% of services users are not being charged anything at all.\r\nBut charging up to \u00a315 to visit a day centre will be a step too far for many older people, who will now also have to pay for the five annual trips they go on each year. That is on top of the \u00a320 they already pay to the centre for their accommodation and travel on the outings.\r\nPensioners get free bus passes regardless of their ability to pay and get the basic state pension, regardless of how much money they have in the bank.\r\nWhy should day care services be any different?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
