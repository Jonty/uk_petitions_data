        "additional_details": "Between the months of September 2012 and January 2013, 100 wild boar are to be culled in the Forest of Dean just when their numbers are starting to stabilise after being culled and poached to alarmingly low levels.\r\nCombined with natural deaths, poaching, RTA's and legal shooting by landowners, if this cull is not stopped it will once again reduce the population of boar in this area to a critical level.\r\nNo evidence has been provided by the Forestry Commission to back up their estimation of boar numbers, which is critical where wildlife management is concerned.\r\nPlease help give the wild boar a reprieve so that their numbers can fully stabilise over the next twelve months, by signing this petition.",
