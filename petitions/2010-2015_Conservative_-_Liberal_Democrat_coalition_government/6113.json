        "additional_details": "Most people who enjoy a nice, cold glass of Diet Coke, Diet Pepsi or any diet drink in fact, will not know about the deadly substance that they are actually taking. Aspartame is a controversial sugar substitute used in all diet drinks that has been known to cause MS, blindness, spazms, seizures, headaches, depression, memory loss, tumors and even death. The substance is also known to be deadly to diabetics and increase our craving for carbohydrates, which eventually causes us to gain weight. So the fact that it is used in diet drinks is questionable. Please sign this petition if you want the government to ban this deadly substance as it is slowly killing the many people who use diet drinks.\r\n\r\nWider reading:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartame\r\nhttp://aspartame.mercola.com/",
