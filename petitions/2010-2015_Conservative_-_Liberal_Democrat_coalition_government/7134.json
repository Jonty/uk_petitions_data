        "additional_details": "after previous incidents and the recent riots in london,i have always wondered why the police have not used water cannon's,.as seen in european countries it would be a effective method to disperse crowds. as lets face it no ones gonna hang round soaking wet and it would make it easier for police to identify these trouble makers if coloured (dyed water was used) i hope that people will sign this petition to show that we have had enough of our country being ruined by these muppets",
