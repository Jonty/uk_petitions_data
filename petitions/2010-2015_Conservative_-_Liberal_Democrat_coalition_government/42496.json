        "additional_details": "The reason that Savile happened at all is directly because the BBC kept quiet and nurtured him in his predation of children.  The recent statement from the BBC indicates that lessons have NOT been learned and they intend to keep the truth from the people who will be most adversely affected by its withholding.  The TV Licence Taxpayers funded this investigation and report and NEED to be protected from the actions of the BBC in their succouring and supporting of perverts abusing children so WE MUST BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE FULL REPORT to be able to ensure the safety of our children.  If this is not to be then the TV Licence Tax Scheme needs to be cancelled and the Board of Trustees of the BBC can run it as a commercial enterprise in competition with other TV programme producers without using taxpayer pounds in the continuing conduct of their criminal activity.",
