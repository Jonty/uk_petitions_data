Everytime a jobseeker signs on he or she must specify evidence showing that he or she has attempted to seek work. Jobseekers are obligated to register for any \"training\" to better their job prospects.\r\n\r\nA new way for the job centre to stop paying money to the claiments is to impose a sanction on there pay. it has been documented in the guardian news paper that workers were TOLD to sanction 3 people per week to save money for the tax payer!\r\n\r\nlets stop these unjust sanctions and help people on job seekers by finding them work. not by taking there money of them and forcing them to commit crime to survive!!!",
