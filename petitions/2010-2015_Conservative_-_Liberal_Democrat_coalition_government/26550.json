Also with the option of PSA checks annually on request to your GP from the age of 30.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of an early National screening programme would save tens of thousands of lives every year and I believe would save the NHS millions.\r\n\r\nProstate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK. 37,000 cases are diagnosed each year.\r\n\r\nI dispute the European findings that this would cause more harm than good and request further research and investigation to be implemented and analysed.\r\n\r\nMost cases go undiagnosed and are often not caught in time to cure or treat efficiently. Causing financial strain on the NHS due to higher cost methods of treatment that need to be implemented for advanced prostate cancer and the spread of secondary cancer.\r\n\r\nSave lives and grant this application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
