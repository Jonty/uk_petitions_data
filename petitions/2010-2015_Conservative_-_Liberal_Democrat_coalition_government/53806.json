        "additional_details": "Train operators are abusing there power. For commuters there is no alternative but to take the train, there is no other viable choice as the government has introduced congestion zone charging, not provided/created sufficient road networks and car parks for the commuter and the price of fuel is to high due to tax.\r\n\r\nThe average commuter is not getting a rise in salary sufficient to cover these price hikes, therefore families are getting squeezed.\r\n\r\nYou have a responsibility to protect you citizens from exploitation which is what is happening here.\r\n\r\nWhat do I propose:\r\n1)Stop train companies increasing train fares, may them reduce them.\r\nHow:\r\n1)Tax them based on there increases.\r\n2) Stop the development of new train infrastructure, the system works as it is. The average commuter does not care about shaving 10 minutes off his journey if he can barely afford to pay his bills.\r\n3) Don't renew there contract unless they can guaranty they can reduce fairs.
