        "additional_details": "The transfer of housing ownership from the public sector to the private sector has resulted in increased demand for social housing. Furthermore it is not in the long term interests of this country to build on the dwindling green belt or to change the social fabric of this country by mass importing migrants.\r\n\r\nSolution: The delivery of housing benefit should be made conditional on the payer making a future claim on the property for the amount of the benefit. Where the benefit claimant is an economic migrant who does not own the property (or any other occupier), the DWP should send notice to the ultimate owner informing them their property is being used for social housing, consequently where a mortgage is still held, this again will result in a restitution order being issued and recorded by the Land Registry.",
