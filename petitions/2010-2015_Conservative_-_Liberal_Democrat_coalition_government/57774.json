        "additional_details": "Whilst our kids are trying to get changed in swimming pools' changing facilities, they are also being exposed to the image of grown ups walking around stark naked near them. Such neglect leaves an open door for criminals and gives them the freedom to carry out some of their immoral acts. Many of these children's parents are not aware of this ongoing problem, they give their trust to the pool manager and the school principal when they send their kids for swimming lessons. We request that:\r\n1. Adults must not change or shower at the same time as kids using the same facilities.\r\n2. When children use changing rooms, they should be supervised by a member of staff.\r\n3. If a child feels uncomfortable changing or showering in public then no pressure should be placed on them to do so.\r\n4. The use of mobile phones and/or photographic equipment should be prohibited within areas where children and young people are changing/\r\nshowering.\r\n",
