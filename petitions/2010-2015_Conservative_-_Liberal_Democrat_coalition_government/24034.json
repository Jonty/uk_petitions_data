For example:\r\n\uf06c \u00a33.5bn could be raised every year with a permanent tax of 50% on bankers\u201f bonuses higher in excess of \u00a325,000\r\n\uf06c \u00a34.5bn could be saved every year by reversing the government\u201fs cut in corporation tax to levels lower than the US or any other G7 economy\r\n\uf06c \u00a34.7bn could be raised every year by a 50% tax on incomes over \u00a3100,000\r\n\uf06c \u00a35bn could be raised every year with an Empty Property Tax on vacant properties\r\n\uf06c \u00a310bn could be raised every year by reforming tax havens and residence rules to reduce tax avoidance\r\n\uf06c \u00a314.9bn could be raised every year by using minimum tax rates to stop reliefs being used to disproportionately subsidise incomes over \u00a3100,000\r\n\uf06c \u00a320 to 30bn could be raised every year by introducing a Major Financial Transactions Tax on UK financial institutions\r\n",
