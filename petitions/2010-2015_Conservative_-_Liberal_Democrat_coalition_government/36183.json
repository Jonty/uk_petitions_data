        "additional_details": "April Fools Day is widely recognised & celebrated as a day when people play practical jokes & hoaxes on each other.In the last 20 years we have become a boring nation with increasing attacks by politically correct language being ever widely used in our public & private lives.Comedy & entertainment-a great British invention-has become stifled.We are more stressed & anxious than we have ever been resulting in serious health issues.We need a release & a day for freedom & ingenuity.On April 1st there should be an amnesty on all laws relating to defamation & political correctness-apart from those encouraging violence.We need to lighten up as a nation & freeing Brits from the shackles of pc'ness just for one day will encourage greater integration & understanding, as well as providing healthy entertainment in public via TV, film,internet,the media & privately by letting the public be themselves.The birthplace of the English language & every UK citizen needs this Non PC Day freedom urgently!
