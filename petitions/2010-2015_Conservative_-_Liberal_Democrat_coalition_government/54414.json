        "additional_details": "As of August 2013, the UK has committed some \u00a3348 million in relief funds for Syria. From the 7th largest economy in the world, and whilst corporations are dodging billions in tax every year, this cannot be seen as sufficient or acceptable. The United Nations estimates that the number of refugees of the Syrian civil war is close to 2 million. For these refugees, disease, hunger and thirst are rife, as well as a lack of sufficient housing for those affected. We therefore call upon the UK Government to expand its logistical, material and financial support for relief operations aiming to help provide for the needs of the refugees and victims of the Syrian civil war.
