        "additional_details": "Any peer convicted of a crime or found guilty of breaching the public trust should automatically be stripped of their honours immediately.\r\nMP\u2019s found guilty of fraud or cheating the public should be forever barred from holding ministerial or cabinet posts.\r\nIt is clearly a disgrace, embarrassment and an affront to public decency that we have convicted criminals sitting in the Houses of parliament. It is no less an affront that cheats and fraudsters sit alongside them; I am thinking here of Baroness Uddin, Jeffery Archer and David Laws as examples, there are many others.\r\nIf we are to scrutinise and punish the behaviour of members of the public such as Fred Goodwin surely we should subject members of the houses of parliament a more vigorous scrutiny and a sterner application of justice.\r\n",
