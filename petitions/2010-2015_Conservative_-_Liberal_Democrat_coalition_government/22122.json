The UK is an island that seems to be a magnet for people from all over the world who appear to think it is the land of milk & honey. It is not!\r\n\r\nOur force members should be trained in all areas of border control to re-create healthy boundaries for the UK. The way that our forces are currently used is a dinosaur that needs to be addressed to ensure that they are being used effectively. The navy should patrol our shores, the army should protect our borders alongside the Border Agency, our special forces should be used to infiltrate any terrorist organisations & the RAF should protect our skies.\r\n\r\nIt's time to stop interfering in the world & start looking after our own. We can be Great again.",
