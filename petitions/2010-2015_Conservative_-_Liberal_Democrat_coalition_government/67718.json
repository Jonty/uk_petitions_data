        "additional_details": "Toy (Somboon Phungamdao) is a 50 year old Thai national who wishes to remain in the UK with her husband Nick and dog Dayna. They have been together for 2.5 years and lived in New Zealand before the UK. Her visa applications were refused and she was told to return to Thailand and acheive an English certificate (which could take a very long time) before re-applying. She has nowhere to live in Thailand and should rent whilst studying. She attends English classes here every week and is striving towards the certificate. Her husband works offshore provides for Toy and pays his taxes. They both own their house outright, do not claim benefits, do not have criminal records and have a happy family orientated social network. The Home Office suggest that Nick & Toy relocate to Thailand. Nick lost his brother in a bike accident there two months ago and neither want to relocate. Please sign this petition so the Home Office see sense allowing Nick & Toy to continue their happy life's and education.",
