        "additional_details": "I would like to raise a petition for all People working Offshore on the various oil and gas platforms within UK waters to get their Petrol/Diesel at cost price.\r\nThis is due to the fact that these people spend half of their lives in the middle of the North Sea in all weathers missing out on seeing their families grow up.\r\nie, Missing their child's first steps,words,Xmas and Birthdays, So we can provide the country with what it needs.\r\nI also believe that this would also be a good thing to encourage more people to get involved in the industry as we are now experiencing a skills shortage in this field.\r\nThe only benefit to working Offshore is the salary however the offshore workforce are also in the higher tax bracket therefore a tax relief on fuel would be beneficial to ourselves and also the economy as the the monies would be spent elsewhere.",
