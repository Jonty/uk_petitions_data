        "additional_details": "I would like to see the burning of national flags made illegal in Northern Ireland.  I find the blatant display each year of erecting and burning the Irish flag deeply insulting and intimidating.  It says to me there is no place for you here.  It is also teaching young unionists hatred from birth right through to adulthood.  Endless numbers of huge bonfires are erected in locations that are in full view of nationalist communities.  If this is not a breach of peace then I don't know what is.",
