This reprimand will be shown on any enhanced CRB check until that person is 100 years old.\r\n\r\nI ask the government to disclose reprimands from any CRB checks in the future as it has led to people retaining a \u201cblack mark\u201d against their name even though the minor crime they committed could be from an extremely young age (where stupidity is the most likely reason behind the offence). This \u201cblack mark\u201d gives that person a unfair disadvantage upon applying for certain jobs.\r\n\r\nI would be very grateful, for those that agree, if you could spend a few moments signing this partition.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.
