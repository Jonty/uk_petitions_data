        "additional_details": "As you all know the funding for the ema budget no longer exists as David Cameron has cut this fund and will be stopped in September. Before he was elected he promised EMA would be more or for students to have free bus passes as well as \u00a310-\u00a330 a week for our supplies and travel. Since he was elected he has done the opposite and got rid of all our benefits. Our protests weren't enough to bring it back, lets hope this petition will.\r\nBRING BACK OUR EMA!",
