As well as unwelcome, 'cold-callers' seem to receive our numbers without our permission, which is an invasion of our privacy. Businesses should be made to declare how they acquire our numbers. This issue has grown significantly in recent months, and many people receive such calls on a daily basis. This must stop.",
