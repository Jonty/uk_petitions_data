Loans prior to that, the government can change as they wish, including sell the loans on to other companies, who would increase the interest rate to make more money.\r\n\r\nVote to not lift the cap of 25 years from student loans repayment, and to not increase the interest rates of what students have to pay back.\r\n\r\nAnyone earning \u00a325,000 or less, would be paying the students loans and interest off until they die.\r\n\r\nStop trying to sell the student loans elsewhere, and deal with the supposed loss of up to \u00a335bn. And take what was originally contracted and signed for.",
