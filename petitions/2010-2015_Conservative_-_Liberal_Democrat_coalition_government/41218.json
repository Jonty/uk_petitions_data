        "additional_details": "The English Baccalaureate is the latest attempt to raise standards in education and has woefully failed to recognise the need to develop a broad education. There is such a strong link between creativity and science, music and maths, self-expression and intellectual growth; science and arts need each other to flourish. To restrict a child\u2019s imagination, their access to Creative Arts, will STEM (pun intended) our economic future.\r\nThe English Baccalaureate is, in its present form, short sighted, divisive and stifles creativity of all forms. Creativity is essential for entrepreneurship, intellectual development and developing a well-rounded, well-educated student who can go to university, start a business and be successful. Our finest minds have a broad base from which to develop before they specialise. Put back Drama, Art & Design and Music. Do we really want to cut off our students at the knees before they\u2019ve even learned to walk? ",
