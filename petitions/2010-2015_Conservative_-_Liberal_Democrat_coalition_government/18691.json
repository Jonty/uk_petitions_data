        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition to end the systematic attack of working class and poorest people in our country. We didn't cause this mess so why are we hit hardest ?. The bankers caused this mess but are still rewarding themselves with huge bonuses whilst our idile government turns a blind eye and passes us the tab. Why is the government reluctant to introduce RobinHood tax on bankers transactions rather than attack people's hard earned pensions ?. This is a NO confidence in the Con-Dem government. We are supposed to live in a democracy with freedom of speech, so let's see if this petition goes out.\r\nPlease sign and share with friends and family.",
