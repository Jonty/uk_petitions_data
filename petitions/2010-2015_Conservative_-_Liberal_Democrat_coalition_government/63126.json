If I was Prime Minister I would have capped immigration to just thousands per year regardless if more leave.\r\nIf the UK population goes down, that is good as it will ease the strain and may also have less crime.\r\nAnd also only allow highly skilled immigrants (that are fit to do the jobs that the Brits cannot). That is what Canada and Australia do.",
