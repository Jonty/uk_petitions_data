        "additional_details": "Norman Lamb acknowledges that there is a lack of equality in A&E services for mental health patients, but the situation is getting worse with psychiatric wards being closed.\r\nThere are no adequate A&E services provided by the NHS for the mentally ill. For help you need to call the police which usually results in sectioning, lock up in a prison cell and even jail. While in police custody the 'patient' receives little medical assistance, is locked in a cell, and is punished for being ill. This is against Article 5 of the Human Rights Declaration \"No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\".\r\nFortunately this is not the situation for those needing A&E for a physical condition. They will see a triage nurse and receive prompt medical treatment.\r\nTherefore I call upon the Government to immediately end this discrimination of the mentally ill, and to stop their torture by forcing  them into police cells or jails rather than psychiatric wards.",
