The Eurozone is in crisis and now Germany and France are proposing financial governance of the Eurozone from Brussels which is only a short step away from fiscal union and only then requires one small further step to USE.  Before this final step is reached the UK will begin to feel pressure to be included.\r\n\r\nTo make the feelings of the people known to the Government a referendum should be held now on the simple question \u201cdo you want the UK to be part of further EU integration?\u201d\r\n",
