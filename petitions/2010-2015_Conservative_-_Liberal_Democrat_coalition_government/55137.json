        "additional_details": "The UK foreign policy position towards its approach to UN and the Syrian Crisis should be debated in the house of commons.\r\n\r\nThe Syrian crisis is a complex, multi-actor conflict and proxy-war. The UK should debate whether to (1.) seek a UN resolution on Syria that initiates a peace process on the basis of a cease fire via UN impartial negotiators, (2.) divide the country into autonomous regions, (3.) deploys a multinational UN peacekeeping / stabilisation force to enforce the cease fire, (4.) move via a Syrian led peace process towards either a federated democratic country, independent states or mix thereof. The UK should also debate the desirability of an additional UN resolution deploying a separate multinational force to (1.) investigate, identify and arrest war criminals regardless of side - see below, (2.) a special force to identify and defeat the terrorist elements.",
