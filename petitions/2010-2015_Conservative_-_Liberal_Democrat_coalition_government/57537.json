        "action": "Scotland should not keep the Pound if they vote for Independence",
        "additional_details": "In 2014, Scotland will hold a referendum on whether or not it should stay united with Britain. Alex Salmond wants to leave Britain, but to keep the British Sterling Pound; he wants to have his cake and eat it.\r\n\r\nHe wants to leave Britain, without Britain having any say on this enormous change that will affect EVERYONE IN THE UK, while keeping the financial benefits of such a union. An independent Scotland with a British Sterling Pound could risk Britain's own financial stability and economic future. This change affects everyone in the UK, and we in England and the rest of Britain have not been consulted. Either Scotland should leave Britain and have their own currency or join the Euro, or they should stay united with Britain and they can keep the pound. It is all, or nothing.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you agree that if Scotland vote Yes to Independence, then that should be total independence, and they should NOT keep the British Sterling Pound.",
