        "additional_details": "Many parents have opted to take their children out of state education and place them in private schools. In so doing they are releiving the tax payer of the cost of education despite often having paid years of Tax to the state. This petition proposes that the state contribute the amount that would have been spent on a child's state education towards their private education, with parents only having to pay the top up to reach the agreed fee. This would provide much higher standards of education to many more children, boost private sector education, which is highly efficient. The treasury would benefit from increased return of private sector tax, unlike state schools which only use tax resources. Standards of education would be greatly lifted and the burden on the taxpayer offset. It is only fair and reasonable to expect the government to fulfil its educational commitment to every child.",
