        "additional_details": "I am a working mother of 4 and have had a domestic worker for past 5 years. I would not still be in work today had I not had a domestic worker to take away the pressure of dropping and picking the kids from school/childminder, making sure they have something to eat etc. This allowed me to spend quality time with my children, work late, attend meetings and conferences as required without feeling anxious about my children because I knew they were being taken care of in their own home by someone who understood my culture. It took away the pressure of feeling that after a full day\u2019s work you have to rash home to cook, clean, iron etc. Taking away the domestic workers visa has limited the choices of working mothers severely and is an infringement on the right to choose the care you need that is appropriate for your children, family and circumstances. Some of us will have to give up work because we can\u2019t attend that important meeting or conference. ",
