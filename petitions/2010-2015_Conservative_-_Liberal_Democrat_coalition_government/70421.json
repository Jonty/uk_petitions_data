        "additional_details": "This is a Campaign to stop the \"scrapping the Human Rights Act 1998\"\r\nThis latest Conservative Coalition Government has done much damage to the UK voters confidence and indeed the political system as a whole.  Changes to the Welfare State and threats on the NHS are just two of the major areas that have real cause for concern. The British Public has felt pride in the fact that we have a Human Rights Act.  If the public feel that decisions are wrong or against standards that are a fundamental human right, then we have the right to call for accountability and justice within our own judicial system or failing that to go to the ECHR to view the issues presented to them. Britain needs to feel protected against governmental decisions that create inhumane conditions for the public they serve. ",
