And the proposed reform bill retains 12 \"Lords Spiritual\".\r\n\r\nActive membership of the Church of England is a tiny fraction of what it used to be, and there is now a massive diversity of religious belief in the United Kingdom. The Bishops can no longer claim to speak for the nation's moral character.\r\n\r\nBut representatives from any religious organisation can surely have no place in a modern legislature. They have no legitimacy; they're not elected, they have no special expertise or experience and they represent only a very narrow section of society.\r\n\r\nFor a modern upper chamber, for a more legitimate House of Lords, it is time to throw the Bishops out of the House of Lords.",
