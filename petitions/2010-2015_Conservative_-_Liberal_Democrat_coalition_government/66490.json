        "additional_details": "I am writing to express my concern about the mosque that is to be built in Astley Bridge Bolton on  Canning Street, i believe the Mosques is being catered for over a 1,000 people. Not only is this going to be an eye sore for all the community that lives in the area. I think the tax payer\u2019s money can be spent on better things. It\u2019s fair to say that we have over 40 mosques in Bolton all in the BL1 BL2 and BL3 area at what point is this going to be unacceptable for people to just build things anywhere they want without the community being informed before the plans go ahead.",
