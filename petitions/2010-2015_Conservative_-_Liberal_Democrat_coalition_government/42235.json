        "additional_details": "We believe that the Sharing Languages, Sharing Cultures Project is a cost effective way to guarantee that hundreds of children, from all sides of the community, in the South Down area learn together and also learn languages. In the last 6 years over 1500 pupils have come together to receive weekly shared language lessons. Without financial backing from the Department of Education these school collaborations will end in June 2012.\r\nShared education and early language learning are two very positive priorities of the Department of Education. We would ask for your signature in support of our petition for funding to mainstream the provision we have proved to be so effective and easily replicated throughout Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to sign our petition requesting the Minister of Education, John O'Dowd, to mainstream and fund our Sharing Languages, Sharing Cultures programme.\r\n",
