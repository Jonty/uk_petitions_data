        "additional_details": "We the undersigned urge the British Government to put pressure on the European Commission to discipline any member state that imposes clothing standards on motorcycle riders. We view any such requirement as an expression of prejudice against motorcyclists and a barrier to the free movement of people within the EU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to the current proposals on mandatory high visibility clothing being considered by some member states, we consider this to be ill advised and na\u00efve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe challenge the speculation that high visibility clothing will reduce accidents involving motorcyclists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe question the right of motorists to hold driving licenses if they are incapable of seeing a rider and motorcycle unless clad in high visibility clothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe challenge the logic that imposes unreasonable requirements on the victims of accidents in order to accommodate the failings of those who cause them\r\n",
