        "additional_details": "I am writing to ask that the UK Government look into the methods currently being used by many UK airlines to recruit professional commercial pilots.\r\n\r\nMany UK airlines are offering all manner of dubious 'sponsored' or 'bonded' training schemes to would-be pilots under the pretence of them being considered seriously for a job afterwards. They take these people on, take their money from them (\u00a3100k+ on some) taking their money and yet arbitrarily refuse to employ them afterwards.\r\n\r\nThey usually avoid signing any contracts directly between themselves and the candidate so that there is no recourse to the law for the candidate when the airlines refuse them a job.\r\n\r\nIt is deeply unfair practice which I believe should be covered more carefully by improved contract and employment laws. As far as I am aware, there is no law to prevent such chicanery. But there should be.",
