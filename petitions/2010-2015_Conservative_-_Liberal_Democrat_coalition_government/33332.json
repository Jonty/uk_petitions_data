        "additional_details": "When a company lies about its service, it is liable for this and quite rightly faces some form of discipline. This action discourages lies in business through legal fees and compensation, as well as a black mark on their reputation.\r\n\r\nWhen a citizen places a vote, they put their trust into the hands of the candidate. However, many promises made prior to elections, go unfulfilled post election. Most of the time this 'false advertisement' will never be greeted with any disciplinary measures, despite the need for truth often being far greater in politics than with corporations.\r\n\r\nThis kind of lie makes a mockery of our democracy. It becomes a perpetual cycle, whereby politicians seem to deem it to be standard practice. We deserve the right to trust, because unlike corporations, we don't get to shop around until the next election.\r\n\r\nBy signing this petition, I believe in my right to truthful politics and a system that deals fairly, should this right not be met.\r\n",
