        "additional_details": "A National Day to fast and prayer needs to be called as soon as possible in accordance with Yahweh (our Father in Heaven) so He will answer his people, including Her Majesty The Queen and Her Government.\r\n\r\nOur Father makes it clear to His people (Isa58:6-8) we need to fast to loosen the band of the wickedness, undo heavy burdens and let the oppressed go free (like Egypt) and break every yoke. Only then will light break forth like the morning and your health.. And importantly, steps must be taken to allow every subject to defend the poor, widows, homeless and fatherless, not through governments nor charities but themselves.\r\n\r\nWe, the people, must pray and fast to Yahweh else we shall be destroyed by Yahweh, similar to Sodom.\r\n\r\nSodom was destroyed, not mainly due to homosexuality, however it's unrighteousness - not protecting the poor and needy. As our Heavenly Father reminds us in Exodus 22:22-24 - You shall not take advantage of any widow or orphan (fatherless).\r\n",
