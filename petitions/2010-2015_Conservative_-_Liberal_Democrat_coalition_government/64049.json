        "action": "Remove the religious worship requirement for maintained schools",
        "additional_details": "Today, in 2014, government maintained schools in the UK are still legally required to perform group worship. This is, in the 21st century, an outmoded tradition that allows the state to unduly interfere in the private and religious lives of children attending state-maintained schools, and which is not appreciated by many parents.\r\n\r\nModern Britain is diverse and contains people of many faiths and no faith at all. Our state education system should reflect this by not imposing the tenets of any faith on children. Children must be able to find their own spiritual or religious path in life, without undue interference in their education.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for an immediate consultation on the removal of maintained schools' obligations to perform group worship.",
