        "additional_details": "MPs should be issued with a compulsory charge card, similar to the proposed \"benefits card\", which they can only use at certain approved outlets for the purchase of items essential to their work, which they would previously have claimed on expenses.\r\n\r\nThis is because they have shown time and time again that they cannot be trusted to spend taxpayers' money wisely or sensibly.\r\n\r\nRestricting them to essential purchases such as stationery and travel will enable their purchaing to be tracked more effectively and will prevent them squandering our money on duck houses and moat cleaning.\r\n\r\nIf it's good enough for benefit claimants, it's good enough for MPs. Welcome to the real world. ",
