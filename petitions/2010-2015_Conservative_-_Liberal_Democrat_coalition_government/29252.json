I believe that this needs to be debated as questions should be asked as to whether they would be able to carry out their role on the FA Board impartially, given there main and jobs at a professional football club.  Given the power that FA Board members have at there disposal they are in advantageous position to make favourable decisions that would certainly benefit their individual football clubs, or at the very least the image of their football clubs and its player.\r\n\r\n",
