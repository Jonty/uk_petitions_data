        "additional_details": "The government is allowing industry to break the law with regard EMC & EMF law. It has been told wrongly that wind power is an alternative. By that industry.\r\nWhen the MOD complain about their RADAR being effected the government ignores them.\r\nUs humans and animals are being exposed to huge levels of radiation that are off scale. When experts measure output with a noise meter. Not an electrical meter. However I have been told that wind & other divices work on nuclear energy. They effect the T-waves in the heart causing heart attacks & strokes also cancer.\r\nThe MOD knew back in the 50's that people were electrically sensitive or microwave sensitive.\r\nVanishing Bee & other insect populations are being effected. The government makes excuses.\r\nThere are other means to make power. Out of human & animal waste (channel 4).\r\nThe water companies make gas out of human waste to run the sewage plants. With more than enough left over.\r\n",
