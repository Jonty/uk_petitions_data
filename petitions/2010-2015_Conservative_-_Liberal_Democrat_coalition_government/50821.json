        "additional_details": "Every year pets are mistreated, abandoned and neglected by people who failed to research their needs and accept their responsibility for the animal and its welfare. Furthermore, many animals are put through pregnancies in poor medical condition and for profit. The homes the babies go to are not checked and the cycle of neglect runs on. If a person wants a pet and wishes to take responsibility and care for that pet they should have no problem being the registered owner. Similarly people who breed should take the commitment seriously enough to gain a licence. Please help our animals by making people take responsibility.",
