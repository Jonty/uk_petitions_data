        "additional_details": "After this winters record rainfall, flooding and closure of the B478 Playhatch to Sonning Road, twice, I think it is about time that a by-pass east of Sonning-on-Thames to provide an extra Thames road crossing and relief of traffic through the village was brought to the fore again. My suggestion, for what its worth, is a normal two lane highway from somewhere near to the Wee Waif roundabout, A4, across to the A4155 Henley to Reading Road by the old chalk pit just up from the Flowing Spring P.H. Hopefully this should only attract local traffic that is currently using Sonning Bridges and not pull in extra traffic from the North and South of the river as a crossing from the Northern end of the A3290 might. Some of this road should by put on pylons as it passes over the floodplain to alleviate any problems with a new road causing even more flooding.",
