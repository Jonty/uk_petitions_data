        "additional_details": "Inspiring a generation was the Olympic moto. Less than a week after the games have finished the government relax the law on how much land a school has to allocate as a playing fields, making it possible and easing the possibility that land can be sold off. Without these playing fields future generations will lose precious facilities to enable them to take up sports of many kinds and have somewhere to play and be children. How does the government think this is going to help solve anything as once its sold and 'developed' we can't get it back. This is ours to decide on what we want to do with it and the government must remember they are accountable to us. I urge you to inspire a generation by signing this epetition",
