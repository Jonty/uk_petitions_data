        "additional_details": "This petition asks for the creation of a list of university courses which are core to the improvement of society which are protected from the \u00a39000 fee limit. By creating a 'protected list' of these subjects that the state will provide funding for, the total outgoings are limited, yet the benefit for the wider society, who would ultimately pay for the courses, is maximised.\r\n\r\nExamples include medicine, the pure sciences, mathematics, engineering and law.\r\n\r\nWithout these courses being open to the very best students, as opposed to those who can afford them, then our development as a society will stall.\r\n\r\nThis will encourage the best students to apply for these degrees, which will result in more specialist teachers, an increased number of scientists improving our research base, and an improved ability to provide technology and services on the world stage.\r\n\r\nThis petition proposes that these protected courses are charged at the previous rate of approximately \u00a33,450.",
