These could then be used for convicted civil riot demonstrators, (both sexes) for 6-9 month punishment periods. This re- training period could then lead to a further automatic 2 year `new `National Service' or`Support Service' to our Armed Forces in troubled locations around the World, in which this Nation is involved. Additionally, payment for this new Punishment & Re-Training , should only be at the minimum wage level or current unemployment benifit levels",
