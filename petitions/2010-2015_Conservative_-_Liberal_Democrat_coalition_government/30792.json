        "additional_details": "This petition is the same as one that has already been closed.  Although the original petion is now closed it actually relates to the current period and most people would like to raise this matter now as the stamp duty holiday ends on the 24th of March. As a result of the stamp duty holiday overpriced properties have had their prices brought down to about \u00a3250,000 to encourage buyers.  \"The property market is still stagnant and needs this incentive to continue to not only help ignite the property market but also help struggling First Time Buyers who in the current economic market are already finding it increasingly difficult to raise the money to buy their First Home. By keeping this to properties under \u00a3250,000 we will be targeting this relief to the lower threshold of earners who are more likely to be struggling to raise a deposit.\"",
