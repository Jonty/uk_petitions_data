        "additional_details": "Within the Greater Manchester area, there is a small town named Radcliffe and it is in desperate need of regenerating. At the moment we have a brand new market, with No cafe facilities, a large patch of wasteland between the market and the derelict bus station which should, some time in the future have a huge shopping centre built on and a new bus station which should be completed sometime in February/March 2015, though hasn't started yet. I urge ALL local people whom visit or know someone who lives/works in this area to seriously consider signing this petition and getting the central Government & TfGM to get their fingers out and provide us with much needed funding NOW!",
