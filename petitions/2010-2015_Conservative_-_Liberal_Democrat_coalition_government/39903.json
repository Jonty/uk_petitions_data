        "additional_details": "We want a debate into the Re Introduction of the Death Penalty for Convicted Child Murderers and Pedophiles\r\nThe Justice System in this county is proven not to be working.  It is neither a punishment nor is it a deterrent to prevent offenders from acting out such vile and brutal acts against our most vulnerable members in society.  Rehabilitation has proven time and time again not to work especially in the case of pedophiles\r\n\r\nWe strongly believe that the law is not on the side of the victim nor the law abiding citizens in this country.\r\nThe threat of a \"walk to the gallows\" is the only way to change the behavior of these evil people.The death sentence provides relief to society, to relatives and also to prison budgets.\r\n\r\n",
