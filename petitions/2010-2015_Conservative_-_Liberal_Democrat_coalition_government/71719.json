        "additional_details": "In the UK we use a voting system called First Past the Post to elect MPs. This system works by the candidate who receives the largest number of votes gaining a seat, even though in a constituency more people could have voted for someone else if you combine votes. This is very unfair as many of us do not receive an MP representative of our views or in proportion to the votes of constituents. In 2005, Labour formed a majority government because of this fact whilst only receiving 35.3% of the vote. This must stop as millions of people are not gaining the representation in Parliament.\r\n\r\nAlso FPTP leads to safe seat constituencies in which one party wins year after year and anyone who doesn't support this party gains no representative they wished for.  Sound Familiar? Well I can imagine it does, because in about 400 of the 650 constituencies in the UK this is the case.\r\n\r\nWe need a new voting system that actually allows for the government to be representative of votes.",
