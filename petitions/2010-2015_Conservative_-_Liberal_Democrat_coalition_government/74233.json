To change it to \u00a33.55 per day for every day the temperature is zero or below, payable every 4 weeks.\r\nSo in effect someone entitled to cold weather payments would get \u00a33.55 for every day whereas at present if in a 28 day period there is 6 days a week of zero or below the claimant gets nothing if day 7 is 1 degrees or above. Make it fairer to claimants to be paid for each day it's zero or below ",
