The community would like to create an e-petition to keep the skeleton team of Neighbourhood Officers at Hawkesley Community Centre. The nearest neighbourhood office is Northfield, for the elderly, vulnerable adults or children that may need to use the neighbourhood office for signposting to other services the impact of not having local services could be catasphropic for the local community service users. The aim of the e-petition is for Birmingham City Council to take action to keep this service available. The Hawkesley Advice and Information Service provides advice on housing and benefits services, they signpost to other services and they offer valuable support to all the members of Kings Norton Community. With all the government welfare changes taking place many elderly and vulnerable people are going to benefit from keeping such a service within the community.",
