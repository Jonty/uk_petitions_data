        "additional_details": "Many NHS staff are being \"re-organised\", so that NHS trusts can downgrade them and pay less.\r\nHMG claims that this is nothing to do with them.\r\nIf downgrades are not by HMG design, they would appear to be a result of unfair \u201cprocesses\u201d put in place by trust execs.\r\nThe government doesn\u2019t even trust these people to run the NHS. They are trying to hand control to our GPs instead.\r\nWhy should we trust \"trusts\" to be fair?\r\nWe are currently crucifying our bankers for \"dodgy\" processes, so why not NHS execs who abuse the trust we place in them?\r\nThis petition calls for a debate of the following:\r\nCan HMG collect NHS info to calculate the following totals?\r\n- Workers already downgraded\r\n- Workers at risk of downgrade today\r\n- Further workers likely to be downgraded\r\nCan HMG investigate the fairness of these re-orgs and downgrades, allowing the \u201cdowngraded\u201d to make their voices heard?\r\n ",
