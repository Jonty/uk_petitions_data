        "action": "should ucas provide funding for over 50's who own their own property and have savings?",
        "additional_details": "Currently higher education for those over the age of 50 is not means tested , thus allowing these people who have worked all their lives and who own houses and have savings and other resources to receive funding through UCAS in order to have their fees paid and living expenses , also they qualify for council tax relief for being a student . Is this fair on the young in our society who battle to get fundng ? Should the person say aged 55 take up a 3 year degree course and gets funding of around 30000 pounds , when they finish studying they only have 12 years in which to pay off any loans , is this not creating a black hole in government spending? I propose all those over 50 who have resources do not receive funding and will be liable to pay all fees in full if they wish to take up further education, i further propose that all payment should be made retrospectively back to 2008 when the current financial crises began.",
