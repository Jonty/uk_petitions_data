        "additional_details": "A recent amendment to  the health and social care bill at clause 163 allows foundation hospitals to use 49% of their hospital beds and theatre time for private patients in order to raise revenue. This will mean consultants spending more time with private patients and less time treating NHS patients.Ths will hugely increase waiting times for NHS treatments and operations. In short it is privatisation of the NHS by stealth. If you believe healthcare should be given on the basis of need not the ability please sign this petition and contact your MP or the secretary of State for Health Andrew Lansley and demand clause 163 be changed.",
