An organisation that has such a significant influence on the life of a school, it's staff and community should be open to scrutiny. Inspections and inspectors  are often criticised due to a lack of rigour and objectivity and this is not made available to the wider public. The government should allow Ofsted complaints to be subject to the Freedom of Information Bill",
