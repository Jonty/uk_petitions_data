The 2011 census cost \u00a3480 million pounds because it was far too complicated, which is possibly the reason so many people did not fill it in.\r\nThe 2011 census consisted of 32 pages, and included lots of information that was not the responsibility of the census enumerators, but the DWP.\r\nMany people who study genealogy know that the information on the 1911 census is enough for a census.\r\nAny other statistics can be gleaned from the DWP or the NHS.
