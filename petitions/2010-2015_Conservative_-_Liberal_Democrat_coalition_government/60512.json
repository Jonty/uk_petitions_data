Thousands of people and businesses face financial ruin, vast areas of land may never recover. The financial assistance currently being offered by the Government is a paltry sum when compared with the vast amount money which these areas need. The Foreign Aid to rich countries like India should be suspended and the money used to assist the rebuilding of the infrastructure in these areas and the lives of the inhabitants.",
