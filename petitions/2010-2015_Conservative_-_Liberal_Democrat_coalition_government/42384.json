        "additional_details": "Please bring back incandescent light bulbs.\r\n\r\nThe low-energy replacement are useless and give off very little light.  They last no longer than the old incandescent light bulbs and they give off harmful levels of UV radiation.  They produce no heat, thereby causing people to use their heating more and thus creating no energy reduction.  They are dangerous to people with restricted vision as they can't see properly in rooms lit by low-energy bulbs.\r\n\r\nEnergy prices go up by a higher degree than any saving we supposedly make by using the low-energy bulbs so we are effectively paying more for a sub-standard service.",
