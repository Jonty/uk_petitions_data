        "additional_details": "The current system of Penalty Fares is the reverse of the normal \"innocent until proved guilty\" British justice system. This leads the way for the Train companies to entrap commuters into paying penalty fare where they are not guilty (eg faulty ticket barriers or incompetant staff). The Penalty Fare scheme should follow the traditional \"innocent until proven guilty\" mantra and this is what I propose. Even a \u00a320 penalty fare, when incorrectly issued, can be unaffordable for some and is entirely inappropriate.",
