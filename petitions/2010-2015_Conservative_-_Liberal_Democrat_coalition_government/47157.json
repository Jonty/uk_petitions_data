        "additional_details": "Following yet another fight in a bar within Houses of Parliament it is time that the licensed bars are closed down. As this is the second time the same person has been involved in violence on the premises it is obvious that anyone can use these bars and It is not only  a health and safety issue. More alarming is the lack of security that allows anyone to enter bars.  They are unnecessary. Across the UK businesses have banned the consumption of alcohol in work places. It has been proved that concentration and productivity lessens when alcohol has been consumed. People in Government departments should have clear heads and anyone who is unable to go through the day without taking alcohol needs to be spoken too and possibly replaced. When financial restraints are encouraged running bars for MPs and their staff are a luxury that cannot be afforded. ",
