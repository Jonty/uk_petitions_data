        "additional_details": "We believe that the county of Northumberland should become part of Scotland where we have a shared history and culture.\r\n\r\nThe Institute for Public Policy Research North says \u00a32,700 is spent per person in London on transport projects compared with \u00a35 per head in the north-east of England.\r\n\r\nBy joining Scotland we would instantly see an increase in public spending and investment per head of the population. Better representation and access to the benefits currently enjoyed in Scotland such as free university education and free prescriptions.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that Scotland voted \u2018no\u2019 to independence, so this is not an argument of belonging to a new independent country but merely moving our political administration boundary within the United Kingdom. There will be no need for passports or changing our everyday lives and sporting allegiances. Most of Northumberland is north of the R. Tyne which is approx 80 miles from Edinburgh and 480 miles from London.\r\n",
