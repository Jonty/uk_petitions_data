We can choose who we want to supply these services based on our choice and view of each company.\r\n\r\nWhy then if we can choose our energy provider can we not yet choose our water provider. I should be able to choose who supplies my water and if they dont deliver on the promises i can go elsewhere. As it stands I have to make do.....even if you can never get through to them, the prices are way too high or they mess up the billing.\r\n\r\nThis must change ASAP. It can be done Its just that the water companies and OFWAT are digging there heels in.",
