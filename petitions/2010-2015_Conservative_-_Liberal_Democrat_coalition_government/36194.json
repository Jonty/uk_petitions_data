        "additional_details": "financial assistance to help home owners caught in negative equity after purchasing a home at the height of the market before the crash. Most mortgage companies now only seem to lend up to 90% LTV and if caught in negative equity you can't move or sell leaving house prices to fall and or people being forced to hand the keys back to the mortgage lender due to personal situations. This partition is for the government to assist by covering the amount the home is in negative equity (if not excessive) and allow up to a 10% deposit on the next property property via a low rate loan paid back over an affordable set term. This doesnt have to be on a brand new property it should be allowed on all properties even requiring modernising also. This allows cheaper homes which are currently being held up by negative equity to be released, helping first time buyers also. This would assist in restarting the housing market.",
