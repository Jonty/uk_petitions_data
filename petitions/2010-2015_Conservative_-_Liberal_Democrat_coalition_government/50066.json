        "action": "Campaign to overturn the closure of Essex House by Lloyds Banking Group",
        "additional_details": "On Thursday 9th May, I along with 850 other employees of Essex House were told without warning that we will loose our jobs in December. We were told a decision had been made by the bank not to renew the lease on Essex House. The employees effected by this decision believe it is completely unjustified and should be overturned. If you agree, please sign this petition and share it with your family and friends. Southend-on-Sea Borough Council says, \"We are appalled that Lloyds Banking Group has chosen to communicate this large loss of jobs with the Council only once it has made its decision. We understand that Job Centre Plus were not informed at all of this news, which I find almost breathtakingly poor communication given the circumstances.\" Lloyds Trade Union says, \"We are calling upon the whole Southend community \u2013 customers, politicians, council, businesses and the media to join us in vigorously opposing the closure of Essex House.\" ",
