The government will not take their passports away if they only have a british passport.\r\nThey will effectively be able to come back here and either enjoy our freedoms or try to take them away.\r\nTheir choice to go and fight now we must pressure the government to stop them returning, even if it makes them stateless,,  Their doing not ours.
