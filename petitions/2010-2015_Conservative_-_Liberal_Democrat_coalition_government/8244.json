What the outlook for future generations?\r\n\r\nIt's time the government played more of a hand in ensuring that children are brought up on the right side of the law and with respect for their elders and authority.\r\n\r\nI say send mum or dad jail for a couple of weeks if their child commits an offence.\r\n\r\nThis would cut youth crime, and make for a better future generation.",
