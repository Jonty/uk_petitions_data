        "additional_details": "George Osbourne told the Commons in October:\r\n\r\n\u201cBritain will not be putting money into the bail out fund either directly or through the IMF\u2026 the IMF exists to support countries, it does not exist to support currencies. The IMF contributing money to the eurozone bail out fund, no; Britain contributing money to the eurozone bail out fund, no. That is Britain\u2019s clear position.\u201d ...................................................................................................................................................................\r\n\r\n        We have since learnt that we are to fund the Eurozone bailout. The UK never joined the Euro and many of us pointed out the dangers of the euro at the time of its creation. The signers of this petition want the government to stick to its pledge and not give any further money to Eurozone bailouts, including indirectly through the IMF.",
