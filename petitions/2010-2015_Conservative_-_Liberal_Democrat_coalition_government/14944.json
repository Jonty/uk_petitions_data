        "additional_details": "I am appalled that mother's are allowed to legally inject Botox into their daughter's faces both here and in the USA - some as young as 8 years old! This practise it is not only immoral - but also child abuse. This dreadful behaviour MUST BE MADE ILLEGAL\r\nIn the USA the Bill to Ban Botox for minors (A3838) is on the government\u2019s agenda - advancing in the US Senate to become LAW. Shouldn't we in the UK not do the same? YES Children do not have wrinkles! Children\u2019s skin has not yet finished growing!\r\nMother's are unaware of the potential injury they may inadvertently inflict.\r\nMost mother's are not specifically medically trained in the procedure and do not know the location of the muscles in their child's faces the muscles. Therefore they are potentially injecting blindly! WORSE STILL - Out of date or banned Botox substitutes are available on the Internet and may be used to save money!
