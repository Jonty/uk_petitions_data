        "additional_details": "The drugs company, Genzyme (part of Sanofi) have decided to stop the production of a already licencened drug for leukaemia. This has been known for 20 years that it is very effective in the treatment of the debilitating disease MS.\r\nAs a sufferer of MS, And a mum of 2 young children and I work as a nurse, and would like to continue to do so for as long as I can possible. 3 very high professors from Bristol, Wales, and Plymouth, have also written to the secretary of state to spare the company from hiking the price up by 20 times to licence it for the use of MS. This drug has also already made its money the first time around for leukaemia and should not be allowed to play with peoples lives like this!\r\nI for one am honered that I have been eligible to receive this treatment, as only 400-500 in the uk have been able to have experienced this chance to lead a better life! Please sign this petition to allow many more sufferers the chance to get a better chance of leading a normal life.",
