        "additional_details": "The UK has by far the highest rail fares in Europe and one of the worst rail networks.\r\n\r\nWe have been continually told that more investment is required to improve the rail network but after years of increased investment nothing is improving.  It clearly isn't working.\r\n\r\nThe Government and rail companies need to work harder with what they have got.\r\n\r\nAll rail fares should be frozen until agreed improvement targets are hit and then any further rises must be agreed on a performance related basis.\r\n\r\nInflation busting rises during a period of financial austerity is immoral at best and bordering on criminal at worst.",
