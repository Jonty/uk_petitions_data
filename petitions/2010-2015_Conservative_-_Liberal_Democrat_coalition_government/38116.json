My daughter has cysticfibrosis and needs a double lung transplant too.\r\nI would like for the schools to teach in there biology lesson about cysticfibrosis and think that teaching children about the subject will also help, they may then pass this information to parents.\r\nwhat i want the government to do\" make it mandatory to have everyone on the donor list\r\nand provide funding for cftrust to raise awareness through the media tv papers etc ",
