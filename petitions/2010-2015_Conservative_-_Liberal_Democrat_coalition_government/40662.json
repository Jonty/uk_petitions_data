Children should be given the maximum protection by responsible adults at a time that they will need it the most. I would like the government to consider letting social services into the premises of privately run boarding schools and to extend the coverage of CRB checks to the whole of the UK and not just England and Wales. This is after discovering that a teacher that was convicted of abusing boys may have managed to re-enter the education system. I also feel that concerned parents should have the right to access to list 99 should the need arise. ",
