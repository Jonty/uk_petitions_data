        "additional_details": "The A14 is vital to our economy and must be up-graded to motorway class along its entire length from Felixstowe to the M6 and M1 at Cathorpe. There must be no toll. This is vital infrastructure to support exports and the health of the British economy. It is vital to East Anglia and the East Midlands. We want jobs not tolls. We want a green economy, not vehicles burning fuel waiting to pay tolls. Invest in our future and build a motorway-class road along the A14 route free at the point of use.",
