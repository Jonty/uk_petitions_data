        "additional_details": "Under Section 77(1) of the 1988 Copyright, Designs and Patents Act the author of a copyright literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work  \u201chas the right to be identified as the author or director of the work\u201d in certain circumstances.\r\nUnder section 79(6) of the act the law states that the right to be named as author does not apply to \u201ca newspaper, magazine or similar periodical\u201d.\r\nUsing this loophole newspapers frequently take freelancer copy, some of which has taken much time and effort to source, research and write, and publish it under a different name - usually one of their own staff members.\r\nI am asking for a change in the law whereby if a journalist asserts their right to be named as the author of their work, the law protects that right.\r\n",
