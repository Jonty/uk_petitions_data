        "additional_details": "In 2012 alone, 230 people died and thousands more were injured or seriously injured in drink-drive crashes, ruining lives and costing over \u00a3800 million.\r\n\r\nThe government spends millions of pounds warning of the risks of drink-driving. Information already exists to help people understand how alcohol affects their ability to drive safely. However, it\u2019s only provided in detail to those convicted of drink-driving.\r\n\r\nAs providers of court mandated drink-drive courses, Swanswell often hear \u2018If only I\u2019d known then what I know now, I would never have got in my car after a drink\u2019.\r\n\r\nEducation is key to helping people understand the risks of drink (or drug)-driving. But Swanswell believe it should be compulsory for everyone, and completed before a driving test can be taken \u2013 not after people have been convicted of drink-driving.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned ask the DfT/DVSA to introduce compulsory drink/drug education before driving tests through short courses, paid for by the learner driver.",
