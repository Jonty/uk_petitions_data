        "additional_details": "If you are, like me, fed up with teachers taking strike action and unsettling our children's education, please sign this petition.\r\n\r\nYet again, another strike about pensions, working conditions and having to work to retirement age is to take place next week. Not only does this disrupt our children's education, it means that hard working parents have to take annual leave; unpaid leave; or find alternative child care provision, potentially at the risk of further cost to the parents. Teachers won't need to worry though as they will already be off work.\r\n\r\nI think that teaching of the next generation should be protected against the ongoing and incessant striking by teachers and the unions, after all, what is more important than preparing our children for adulthood.\r\n\r\nIf nurses, police and other emergency services cannot strike because they are essential, why not teaching of children up to the age of 16 years of age???",
