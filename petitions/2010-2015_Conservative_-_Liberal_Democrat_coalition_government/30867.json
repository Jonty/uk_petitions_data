        "additional_details": "I would like to Government to adopt a long term strategy on the management of Type 1 Diabetes for all children. This strategy should automatically offer funding for all children who are diagnosed to allow them the opportunity to move to insulin pump and sensor management with full funding. Effective management at an earlier stage will pay dividends in later life and reduce significantly the long term costs of illness and medical management for complications of Type 1 diabetes in later life. This should supported through children\u2019s diabetes medical teams, but with full funding available when needed.  Please support this petition and make improvements to our children\u2019s future with diabetes, through proactive management and not reactive management.",
