        "additional_details": "Instead of prison, causing tax payers extra money, people convicted of lesser crimes related to the riots should be made to do community service to repair the damage. They should also have to pay fines that are used to repair the damage.\r\nPeople (shopkeepers etc) who's property has been damaged by rioters should be able to submit their claim and this will be assigned to offenders.\r\nFurthermore those who's actions require a prison sentence should also be required to participate in the clean up on a day release programme from prison.\r\nFurthermore rather than a set number of hours of community service, offenders should be given a task with clear directions and their community service is not finished until the job is completed properly.\r\nBasically you break it, you fix it.",
