        "additional_details": "For 16 years school-kids as young as 11 were groomed, coerced, controlled, beaten, abducted, drugged, trafficked & terrorised in the most sadistic way, with guns, knives & petrol, child-rape & gang-rape.\r\nThe police, the upper echelons of social services, MPs, the council & it's officials, Shaun Wright you all sold out these girls. Your hands aren't clean, you betrayed the town to avoid juggling a political hot potato.\r\nThe CPS, you failed in your duty. You failed school kids, parents, Rotherham & justice itself.\r\nEach of you is culpable. You allowed large scale sadistic torture & child-rape. You are all reproachable. Yorkshire has looked at you all & you are all found wanting.\r\nThose girls deserve justice. They deserve the men who terrorised them, beat them, gang-raped them & doused them in petrol to be brought to condign justice, to be licitly punished for their crimes.\r\nJUSTICE FOR THE 1400.\r\nThose girls are Rotherham's daughters, Yorkshire's daughters & they are due justice.",
