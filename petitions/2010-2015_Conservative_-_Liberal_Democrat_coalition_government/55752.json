        "additional_details": "As illegal workers are growing, the government should derive a system in which all businesses that are looking to employ people can do immigration, right to work and other legal checks from their own computers.\r\n\r\nEach business should be registered and all workers that come for a job interview, the managers can search them. If they don't have the right to work or remain in the UK, then the system should allow managers to flag the person up so UKBA can investigate. Also by the click of a button the police should be called to the business address and arrest the person on suspected breach of immigration law.\r\n\r\nThis will save businesses from fines and will ensure that they are legal. Also, we can cut down on illegal people. ",
