        "additional_details": "This petition calls on the Government to change the term \u2018income tax\u2019 to \u2018Social Investment Payment\u2019.\r\n\r\nWe need to change the way we think about income tax.  For too long it has been seen as a necessary evil, a portion of our incomes which we part with reluctantly. Rather, paying tax is a good thing.  Through it we contribute towards an incredible range of services and facilities which we could never otherwise afford: schools, hospitals, transport systems, sporting facilities, theatres and art galleries, street lighting, parks, community centres \u2013 the list goes on.\r\n\r\nNow is the time to start changing the way we think about our contribution towards the cost of these services and facilities, and use the term 'Social Investment Payment' rather than 'income tax'.\r\n",
