        "additional_details": "As a British citizen, Lewis Hamilton has the opportunity to lift a race trophy to the tune of the British national anthem, yet he resides in Switzerland for what one can only assume to be tax reasons, on the \u00a370million contract he is reported to be on until 2012.  This petition calls on all tax dodging sports stars to be required to use the national anthem for the country in which they have decided to pay tax.  Ergo, the next time Mr Hamilton wins a race, it should be the Swiss Pslam that he hears, not God Save the Queen.   ",
