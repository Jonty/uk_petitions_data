        "additional_details": "The Department for Work and Pensions has introduced emergency legislation to reverse the outcome of a court of appeal decision and \"protect the national economy\" from a \u00a3130m payout to jobseekers deemed to have been unlawfully punished.\r\nThis is all just to prevent a payout to those who have been unlawfully made to work for free. The new bill would also put a stop to any potential claims for the national minimum wage, which could otherwise be due to those who spent weeks working for no pay at high street chains such as Tesco, Matalan and Argos.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition quickly to stop this going through.",
