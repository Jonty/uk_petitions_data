        "additional_details": "HMS Dragon sailed into Portsmouth for the first time on 31 August 2011. For the first time in recent history the bows of a Royal Navy Ship are adorned with red dragons, much like the figure heads of old on ship's like HMS Victroy, standing her out from the rest of the Fleet and drawing much admiration from the public. These Dragons have already become very popular with the Ship's Company and members of the public, with many feeling that the 'Dragon Spirit' and ethos lives within her dragons.\r\n\r\nThese dragons are sadly set to be removed so that HMS Dragon looks like any other Ship. This would be a loss to the people who have worked so hard to bring the Ship into the Fleet and would also remove something quite unique from the Royal Navy. There is no other Ship like this in the world!! Why remove something that is instantly recognisable, everyone in our country can be proud of and rest of the world can be jealous of?\r\n\r\nSAVE THE DRAGONS!!!!! ",
