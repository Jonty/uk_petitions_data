        "action": "Improve required labelling of fish and fish products",
        "additional_details": "In the United Kingdom, actual fish that are sold have to be labelled with the species, catch area and catch type (at sea, inland, or farmed).  However, FISH PRODUCTS ARE CURRENTLY EXEMPT, including fish pies, fish in breadcrumbs, fish in sauce, fish fingers, canned tuna, and prawns that have been both peeled and cooked.\r\n\r\nConsumers are increasingly concerned by the issues of overfishing and bycatch, but the current legislation does not force retailers to give us enough information to make meaningful purchasing decisions.\r\n\r\nWe ask the government to extend the required labelling:\r\n- to remove all exemptions to the current regulations, so that all fish products are labelled both with species, and where and how each component fish originated.\r\n- to show the exact catch method (i.e. purse seine, dredging, longline, pole and line, etc.)\r\n- to distinguish between farmed fish that were hatched/bred in captivity, and those that were caught wild and then fattened/matured in captivity.",
