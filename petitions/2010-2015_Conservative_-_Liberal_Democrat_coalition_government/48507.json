        "additional_details": "We all suffer or know someone who suffers from Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES), this is a rare condition. It occurs most frequently following a large central lumbar disc herniation, prolapse.Review of the literature indicates that around 50\u201370% of patients have urinary retention on presentation with 30\u201350% having an incomplete syndrome. The latter group, especially if the history is less than a few days, usually requires emergency MRI to confirm the diagnosis followed by prompt decompression by a suitably experienced surgeon. Every effort should be made to avoid CES with its more favourable prognosis becoming CES while under medical supervision either before or after admission to hospital. The degree of urgency of early surgery in CES is still not in clear focus but it cannot be doubted that earliest decompression removes the mechanical and perhaps chemical factors which are the causes of progressive neurological damage.If left this can lead to permanemt neorologial problems.\r\n\r\n",
