        "additional_details": "I believe long term unemployed should not have a right to vote due to the fact they are not actively contributing to the economic situation we all know it can be very difficult to get laws passed in relation to benefits due to the fact that many voters are benefit claimants. So we have the unusual and counterproductive situation of parties pandering to unemployed persons. This should not be considered unethical as the right to vote can be reinstated purely by rejoining the tax paying work force,  as taxpayers surely we and only we should decide where the money goes?  If we remove the right to vote from long term unemployed ie persons with no wish to work,  we can start putting the country back on track in a way which benefits the economy and the workforce ",
