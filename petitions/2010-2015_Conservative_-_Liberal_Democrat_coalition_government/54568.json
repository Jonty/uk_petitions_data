However, the census record is the only place where you can locate ALL family members including those below voting age.\r\n\r\nThe electoral roll is a good tool, but extremely limited.\r\n\r\nPlease add your names to this petition to make Government ministers reconsider their proposals.\r\n\r\nThank you ",
