        "additional_details": "At the moment all left hand drive HGV vehicles entering  the UK do not pay any taxes whatsoever to use our extensive road network. However any UK heavy goods vehicle entering into Europe is expected to pay tolls for any country that they pass through.\r\n\r\nThe Government is missing out on this additional revenue. HGV's cause a considerable amount of wear and tear to our road network, particularly those weighing over 40 tonnes. Not to mention the accidents caused by these left hand drive vehicles, particularly to cyclists.\r\n\r\nSign up to this petition today and get the Government to review the amount of revenue they could generate and how some of this revenue generated could contribute towards road safety.\r\n",
