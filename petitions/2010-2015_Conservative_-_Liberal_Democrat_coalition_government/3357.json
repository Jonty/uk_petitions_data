        "additional_details": "Allowing the administration of corporal punishment - i.e.lashings, public stocks etc would cost much less than prison. Seeing criminals punished would restore victims' faith in the justice system which is at present far too soft.  Fines are not paid, community service sentences are meaningless - criminals have to have really hurt people before they go to prison - which is for too short a time, and does not rehabilitate them as it is a holiday camp to them.  The fear of swift but proportionate corporal punishment would reduce reoffending and protect decent law abiding people from louts, thugs and the like.",
