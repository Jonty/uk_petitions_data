        "additional_details": "Petition against HGV (above 7.5t) access from the A1 J45 through the small villages of Collingham and Pool In Wharfedale. Access to destinations are available via the A64 and A59/A658 from the A1 Junctions 44 and 46, HGV drivers and owner companies use these small roads simply as a cut-through, navigating narrow areas and sharp, blind bends, these small roads are not designed for HGV's and are being destroyed as a result, when the A64 and A658 are much more suitable to HGV's. There are a number of schools also on this route and HGV's cause an unnecessary risk when there are much more suitable routes for simply a few extra miles and a few extra minutes to the Drivers.",
