        "additional_details": "London\u2019s bus service carries around half of all bus passengers in England on a network of some 700 routes. A further 17 million passengers journeys are\r\nexpected on the buses in 2012/13, bringing the number to more than 2.3 billion, a level not seen since the 1950s.\r\nWith 20 bus operators in London, each earning on average 5% profit margin, this makes a total profit of 100%. That means London Buses costs twice as much to run than if Nationalised and run by TFL. The tax payer is not getting value for money.",
