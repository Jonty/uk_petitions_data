It should be a noticeable cut (ie not 1p / 2p) that would be swallowed up by the petrol companies.\r\n\r\nThe effect should be that it would lower transport costs, and this in turn would be passed onto the consumer who would start making purchases.  Their own costs would also be reduced.\r\n\r\nThe cost of this reduction would be borne by the increase in VAT revenue from new purchases.",
