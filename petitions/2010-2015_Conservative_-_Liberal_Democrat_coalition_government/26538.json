To be fully trained on how to deal with aggressive behaviour and how to calm a building aggressive or confrontation situation.*All door supervisors should wear high visibility jackets inside and outside licensed premises.*Compulsory CCTV monitoring in large pubs/clubs to create 'the big brother effect'. *Tougher sentencing for drunken violence related attacks (Full sentences to be completed/ no early release for good behaviour or if plead guilty)*kicking and stamping during an assault should be an aggravating factor when sentenced. Only in extreme circumstances should imprisonment be avoided.\r\n",
