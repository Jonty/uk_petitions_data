The Government should state clearly to their Argentine counterparts that the sovereignty of the Falklands Islands is not, and never will be negotiable until the people there wish to relinquish their rights as British Citizens. The Government should also note that, our American allies should - if the 'Special Relationship' means anything - respect and recognise British sovereign territory as well as British Interests.",
