LIFE SHOULD MEAN LIFE without release. Human Rights campaigners say that ALL PRISONERS should have a chance for release and should have a release date .. Why not scrap LIFE sentences altogether and comply with human rights and give these murderers and child rapist sentences WITH a release date. Say 500 years for Child Murder with eligible parole in 250 years. This would satisfy Human Rights campaigners ... Our government should listen to the public that democratically elected it to govern us. SOFT SENTECNES should be a hing of the past. ",
