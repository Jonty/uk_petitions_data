        "additional_details": "Make Gospel End Village A463 safer for pedestrians and road users. ie: double whitelines, traffic calming, clearer 30mph signage, speed camera's, cycle lane and warnings of horses/cyclists due to the amount of riders on this road. Traffic travels through the village above 30mph which is a busy, popular route with walkers, cyclists and horse-riders accessing Baggeridge-Country-Park and Penn-Common. Through the rocks by The SummerHouse there is a narrow footpath on a blind 'S' bend, heavy traffic pass very close to the pavement at speed.Either side of the 'S' bend is straight so the traffic is already travelling at speed. There have been fatal accidents in the past on this road . Many riders don't bother to report near misses due to lack of reg.no of vehicles and evidence. Many more incidents occur on this road that are not reported. ",
