Presently around 200,000 embryos are aborted every year in UK (about 500 a day). Clearly far too many. Watching an abortion is like watching an execution. Abortion is a serious and private affair and should only be performed if it is declared to be for the health and safety of the mother or in the best interests of the foetus (like embryo\u2019s crippling genetic or severely malformed physical condition).  Embryos should NOT be aborted on financial grounds, innocuous psychological social circumstances of parents or for the convenience of parents, as healthy babies can always be adopted or placed in care. Embryos should not be aborted for characteristics like the colour of hair or for clef palate. ",
