The idea was first introduced to save on fuel costs by increasing the working hours available in daylight.\r\n\r\nBST currently starts on the last Sunday of March by which time it is getting light by 6:00am. It would be far better to have that extra hour of the daylight in the evening which would reduce electricity usage. Additionally it may encourage people to be more active by enjoying the additional hour outdoors.\r\n\r\nI therefore propose that we should do what USA did a number of years ago and start BST from the second Sunday in March.",
