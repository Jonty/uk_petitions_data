What makes their frustration even greater is the poor condition of the roads and the poor standards of public transport, particularly in rural areas.\r\n\r\nThe government should commit 100% of revenues raised from fuel duty to be spent 100% on transportation infrastructure. Not one penny of duty should fall into general taxation and be allocated (wasted) elsewhere.\r\n\r\nPeople will NEVER use public transport if it continues to be outdated and inefficient compared to using a car.\r\n",
