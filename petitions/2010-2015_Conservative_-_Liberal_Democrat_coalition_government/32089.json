In the UK, there is no formal state system to reward 'bounty hunters' for finding and detaining offenders who have jumped bail or committed similar acts as there is in the USA. Introduce and reward Bail Bondsman and Bounty Hunters and it would free up police time (which are already over-stretched) It would produce more jobs and reduce crime significantly. Bail Bondsman should have only the information they need to arrest. It would also help victims of crime continue their lives knowing that justice has been served and not live in fear.\r\n",
