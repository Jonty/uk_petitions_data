        "additional_details": "It has been announced by the DWP that they are going to close all on site CMG children's nurseries at Leeds, Newcastle, Plymouth, Hastings, Falkirk and Birkenhead.  The parents at all these locations are both upset & shocked at the decision that has been made, considering we as civil servants are told, by our government to trust them, that if we go back to work they will help us, support us. Departments that where swallowed up by the DWP where told, stay with the DWP & even though you have further to travel & more expense, we have on site childcare facilities for you, for the DWP then to remove them! These nurseries and the staff are a major part of our children's early years development, we trust them, know them, feel safe with them. We are not asking, we are begging the powers that be at the DWP on behalf of our children, please keep the nurseries open! They are too young to have a voice, we and you are their voice, please help us stop the closures. ",
