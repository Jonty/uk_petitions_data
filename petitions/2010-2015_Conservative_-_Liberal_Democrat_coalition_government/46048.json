        "additional_details": "Mandatory iodised salt would provide an entirely cheap, easy and effective way of preventing iodine deficiency - the primary cause of hyperthyroidism - which affects tens of thousands of people nationwide, up to one percent of the adult population. Such a change would have a positive impact on health, costs to the NHS, and benefits to the economy through reduced loss of working productivity.\r\n\r\nMost salt sold in the UK is not currently iodised and availability of it is low. Requiring salt to be iodised would redress this and bring Great Britain up to standard in this respect with other areas of the world. ",
