        "additional_details": "It is staggering to think that, in these days of sexual equality in all aspects of life, our male royalty still \"leapfrog\" their female siblings in their right to the throne.  This is outright sexism at the highest level and should be abolished.  At present, the first born child of the Queen (Prince Charles) is male, and his first born child (Prince William) is male, therefore those in immediate line to the throne would not change.  This long overdue change of law needs to be carried out before Prince William has children of his own, particularly if his first born child is female.  Our current Queen is proof, if such proof is needed, that females can, and will, rule this country as well as any King.",
