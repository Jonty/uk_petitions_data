        "additional_details": "Make open prison's safer for the community! Over the past few years, more and more prisoners are absconding from Catagory D prisons, This is due to the fact that security in these prisons is lacking and it is so easy for them just to walk-out. Being a member of a community that lives next to an open prison, the statistics show an alarming amount of absconding numbers building up, with one prison last year seeing over 70+ absconders. Due to the increasing numbers of offenders absconding, prisons are becoming more and more crowded, because of this, this means that higher catagory prisons are forcing higher catagory offenders down into the lower catagory prisons!
