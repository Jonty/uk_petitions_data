Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.\" (see Romans 1:26)\r\n2> \"In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.\" (see Romans 1:27)\r\n\r\nThe petition intends to oppose legalisation of the unrighteous same sex marriage ceremonies in churches.\r\n(Read scriptures from Romans 1:16-32)",
