At the end of mealtime washing up, rince out the above before storing.\r\n\r\nToo many people cannot be bothered recycling and would not be encouraged by resuming weekly general waste collection, in fact quite th opposite.\r\n\r\nThe Government should use the \u00a3250,000.00 to educate people to do more recycling or, pay off some of the country's debt and decrease the interest being paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
