        "additional_details": "I want the government to completely wipe peoples criminal records if their offences have not caused themselves to be sentenced to prison & they have not been in trouble with the police for 10 years since their last conviction.\r\n\r\nBetween the age of 17 & 18 i ended up with 2 assaults & criminal damage on my DBS. My father committed suicide when i was 17 & it affected me.\r\n\r\nThese offences are not me, and never was me. I was going through a hard time and now i'm still going through it because of the DBS.\r\n\r\nWe have grown and learned from our mistakes so please stop letting people judge us on our past mistakes.\r\n\r\nSTOP CRIMINAL DISCRIMINATION\r\n\r\nThank You.",
