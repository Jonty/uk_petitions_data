        "additional_details": "In the UK when it is necessary to employ a nanny the parent or \"employer\" is treated as such and must pay the nanny's tax.  This is taken from the parent's NET pay after their tax. So this is double/triple tax as the parent pays the nanny's income tax, national insurance and employers national insurance.\r\n\r\nThe law requires you to:\r\n\r\nHave Employers Liability Insurance\r\nRegister as an employer\r\nSet up and operate a PAYE (Pay As You Earn) scheme on your nanny's behalf\r\nKeep tax records on her behalf\r\nProvide your nanny with regular payslips\r\nProvide her with an employment contract\r\nPay regular income tax and National Insurance Contributions\r\nPay employer's National Insurance Contributions\r\nSubmit a Full Payment Submission (FPS) to HMRC every time you pay your nanny and an Employer's Payment Submission for months where you do not\r\n\r\nThis e-petition is to allow parents to pay the nanny from their gross salary or from \"source\" this is done in places such as Australia.",
