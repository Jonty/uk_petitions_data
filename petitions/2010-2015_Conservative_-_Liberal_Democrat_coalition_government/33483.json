Before they paid about \u00a3900,000,000 in tax to help pay for our Schools Hospitals etc. Now they pay very little but still get their money from the people in this country. This means that every person in this country has to contribute \u00a315 or so more in tax. This is totally unfair. This law would also get rid of offshore tax havens.",
