        "additional_details": "This petition is to have 2 speed bumps put in Ladyfield Road, Chippenham, Wiltshire.\r\n\r\nAs a result of many people breaking the speed limit on this street, there have been numerous collisions with parked cars, other drivers and many cats being ran over and killed.\r\n\r\nIf 2 speed bumps were to be put down this street it would effectively:\r\n\r\n- Decrease the amount of collisions with parked cars\r\n- Decrease the amount of collisions with other drivers\r\n- Decrease the amount of cats and other animals being hurt/killed\r\n- Decrease the risk of pedestrians being hurt/killed\r\n\r\nI believe this is an urgent and important problem that should not be ignored. We should not have to wait until a person is seriously injured or worse before we take action.\r\n\r\nSo please sign this petition and make our roads safer. ",
