There currently is no zebra crossing or any suitable crossing or lights across the busy A267 Tunbridge wells to Mark Cross road.\r\nWe should fund a Crossing to allow safe crossing for all children at Frant and for all residents of the village.\r\nDespite some local residents requests the council deems it too costly. I would appreciate any support for this important issue because I do not think we should wait for an accident to take action. Thank you ",
