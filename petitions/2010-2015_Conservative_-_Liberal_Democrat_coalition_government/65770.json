        "additional_details": "By singing this petition you are asking for the British government to issue an official apology for it's involvement in the 2003 coalition invasion of Iraq.\r\n\r\nSome studies suggest that up to 460,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the war under the pretext of International security, through false claims of Weapons of Mass Destruction.\r\n\r\nBritain's involvement in this war has made the world a more dangerous place for us all, and although an apology cannot change the past It can help show the people of Iraq that the British public never supported and deeply regret our involvement in the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
