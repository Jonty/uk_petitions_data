        "additional_details": "Like many Local Authorities, Camden Council strives to be an excellent employer. Last year Camden was accredited as a London Living Wage employer and has been an active campaigner in encouraging other employers to pay a living wage in the Capital.\r\n\r\nCamden believes that zero hour contracts are a blight on Britain\u2019s workforce. The use of such employment practices is particularly widespread in the private sector provision of Adult Social Care within local Government where 90% of contracts fail to guarantee working hours or basic employment rights.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call for the Government to immediately outlaw the use of zero hour contracts within the care industry and launch an urgent formal inquiry into aspects of employment law to stamp out this archaic practice by all employers.",
