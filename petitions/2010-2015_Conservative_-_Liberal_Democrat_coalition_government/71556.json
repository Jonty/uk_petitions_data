It is unacceptable and undemocratic that too often the fees of implementing IT are wasted on commercial software, when open source solutions exist, and equally that public structured data arising from IT should so often either not be available in a structured form at all, or else only in an inappropriate or barely usable form, such as using PDFs for lists, instead of making available the underlying data.\r\n\r\nGovernment should legislate to ensure that wherever reasonably possible throughout said institutions open source software and open data standards are employed.\r\n",
