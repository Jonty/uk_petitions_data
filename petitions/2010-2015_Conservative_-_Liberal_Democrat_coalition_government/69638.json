Alfred defended his kingdom against the Viking attempt at conquest, and by the time of his death had become the dominant ruler in England.\r\nIn 1892, the famous German Church Historian Rev. Professor Dr.J.H. Kurtz called King Alfred the greatest and noblest of all the monarchs England has ever had.\r\nWinston Churchill called him the greatest Englishman ever, yet this Legend of England has never had a day dedicated to his memory for all his people to celebrate and remember his achievements.\r\nBy signing this petition you agree that October 26th should become King Alfred The Great Day In England.",
