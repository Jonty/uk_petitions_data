        "additional_details": "Economic commentators predict a rise in the number of homeowners defaulting on their mortgage repayments leading to an increase in home repossessions. It is totally immoral that those who brought about the economic crisis have it within their power to dispossess people of their homes.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the introduction of legislation outlawing of home repossession by mortgage lenders in cases where the property is the primary residence of the mortgagor.  Such legislation would not apply to secondary residential properties, for example those purchased with the intention of letting them for rental income [\u201cBuy to Let\u201d].\r\n",
