        "additional_details": "We would like to UK Government to make a statement of support for members of the religious group known as Bah\u00e1'\u00eds in the country of Iran, currently they are persecuted with cemetaries and holy places being demolished and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed youth being denied places in further education. Even worse than this is the fact that their faith is not recognized even though it is the largest minority faith in Iran. Their leadership is systematically persecuted and have been executed in their hundreds. Iran accuses the Bah\u00e1'\u00eds of being a political movement when in reality they are a faith that emphasises the unity and equality of races, religions and genders. We would like for the Government of the United Kingdom to issue a statement of condemnation towards the Iranian Government and pressure the nation towards allowing Bah\u00e1'\u00eds their basic human rights.",
