        "additional_details": "Michael Gove is undermining the education system that we know by implementing ill thought out initiatives with speed and with little consideration for the long term effects.\r\n\r\nHe is attempting to return to the system of education that was familiar 40 years ago, rather than move towards a more positive future for education.\r\n\r\nHis decisions have already ruined many children's enthusiasm for education and will continue to do so unless his new 'initiatives' are checked or he is removed from office completely.\r\n\r\nChildren aged 15 and 16 are having to take as many as 27 exams THIS YEAR within a 2 month period! Not only is this incredibly stressful for those being examined, affecting their psychological and mental well being, but it will also damage future children's enthusiasm for schooling and will cause them to resent the system they're in, resulting in more truancy, and disruptive behaviour within schools.\r\n\r\nPlease, sign this petition and make learning fun again.\r\n#timetogogove",
