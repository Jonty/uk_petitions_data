        "additional_details": "In 2014, EU border restrictions for Bulgarian & Romanian nationals will be lifted allowing them \"free movement\" within the UK. This will give all newcomers from these countries full access to health, education & welfare facilities.\r\n\r\nOpen border immigration policies of the last decade mean services are already stretched. A sudden influx from these two countries could stretch limited resources too far. With cuts and austerity, the additional burden would be impossible to bear.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to maintain immigration restrictions for these two countries and put the people of the UK before the damaging policies of the EU.",
