It would appear that these channels buy the rights to a limited number of films and programmes and then repeat them again and again over the year.\r\nAll of the Channels solely on Freeview receive good advertising revenue and it cannot cost that much to introduce new films and programmes, The situation needs to be properly regulated and controlled and the public given a fair cross section and new programmes to watch.",
