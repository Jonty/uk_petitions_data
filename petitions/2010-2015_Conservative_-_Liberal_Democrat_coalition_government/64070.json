Esther was intelligent, funny, caring and a true friend to so many who hearts are broken without her now in their lives.  Esther was just 17 when she died.\r\n\r\nEsther was killed in a road traffic accident involving a young driver with limited experience, but he had purchased a new car days earlier and was unfamiliar with it features and capabilities.  Esther had accepted a lift after an evening at work.  The driver, due to unfamiliarity, lost control of the car.\r\n\r\nThis was an accident that could have easily have been prevented and would have saved the life of my precious daughter, if the driver had knowledge of the features and capabilities of his new car.\r\n",
