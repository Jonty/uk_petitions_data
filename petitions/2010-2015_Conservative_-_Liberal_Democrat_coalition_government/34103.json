        "additional_details": " Kildwick and crosshills station was opened in late 1847 it is about two miles from both Cross Hills and Kildwick, is now the nearest station to all five villages. ]\r\nSome former railway buildings have survived in this area, although they have been sold for other uses, but a signal box which stood beside the level crossing was demolished following the resignalling and electrification of the route in 1993\u20134. There is a former railway goods yard on the southern side of the track between the bridge and the level crossing and this is now used as a depot for road repairs by the local council.\r\nThe station was closed on 22 March 1965[7] but the line remains in use for freight, express passenger and local passenger trains. It is the main line from Leeds to Carlisle and Morecambe. Proposals have been put forward on several occasions to re-open the station in recent years, but none of these have been successful thus far (due to funding problems). Is it not time to re think after 47 years\r\n",
