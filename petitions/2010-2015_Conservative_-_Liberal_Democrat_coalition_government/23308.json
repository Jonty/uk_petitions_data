I propose that as well as having a National Minimum Wage that parliament should enact legislation for a National Maximum Wage in order to curb corporate greed in the boardrooms of large corporations and excessive bonuses that are  paid out to Bankers and traders in the markets.\r\nAnyone who exceeds the set limit should be subject to penalties laid down by parliament and be subject to periodical review.\r\nThis i believe will go some way to narrowing the income gap between the rich and poor.
