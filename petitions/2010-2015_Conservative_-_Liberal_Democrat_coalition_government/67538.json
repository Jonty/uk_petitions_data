Treatment costs billions but there is NO cure; we can't even arrest the neurological decay! Professor Clive Ballard of the Alzheimer's Society says that there is \"a pitiful lack of investment\" in the necessary research to discover the biological mechanisms involved and develop effective treatment.\r\n\r\nPublic funding of research and development is skewed towards military projects: the military R&D spend is several times that of health. The government should progressively rebalance this spending in favour of peaceful research, not least to invest in our health.\r\n\r\n",
