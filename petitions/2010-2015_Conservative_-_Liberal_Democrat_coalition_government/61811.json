        "additional_details": "We petition the Government to discuss and debate the creation of a 'Commonwealth Union'. Even if the UK does not leave the EU it would be highly beneficial for the United Kingdom to establish a Commonwealth Union  with the following nations of which Queen Elizabeth is currently reigning Head of state for; Antigua & Barbuda,\r\nAustralia, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, St. Kitts-Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent & the Grenadines, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. The 'Commonwealth Union' or 'CU' should be largely based upon the EU and allow many of the same rights and policies, even an optional secondary currency (along side with a nation\u2019s main currency) for all members states. This would allow all citizens of these nations free emigration/immigration into one another also, with less detrimental effects than EU immigration given our cultural ties. The 'CU'  would also allow for free and easy trade and give several economic benefits also.",
