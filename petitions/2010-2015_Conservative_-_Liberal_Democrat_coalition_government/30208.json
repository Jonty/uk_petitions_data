        "additional_details": "Surely against the Code of Conduct\r\nThis type of outburst by an elected councillor against anyone, never mind members of the public, must surely break the council\u2019s Code of Conduct \u2013 something that Cllr Mazillius has been ordered to apologise for in the past.\r\n\"If you can\u2019t stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen and the trouble with a lot of these people, Chairman, is they can\u2019t stand the heat, they haven\u2019t got the guts, they haven\u2019t got the policies to actually think.\r\n\r\nThey think, \u201cOh I want to exercise real democracy and I\u2019ll offer myself\u201d.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m afraid chairman they are just cowards.\"\r\n\r\njust a snippet of this outragous speech. This elected person is in office to be your voice yet time and again he has a self centred outburst.\r\n\r\n",
