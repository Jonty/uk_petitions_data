Gambling is supposed to be fun but a lot of susceptible individuals can be dragged in and find themselves spending money they don't have. Eventually these individuals are in debt, majorly, and struggle to get out. I would like to see a reduction in the number of adverts associated with betting. It seems that over the past few years the number of adverts has increased exponentially. I believe the increase in adverts only serves to exploit us and as a result we will have a marked increased in gambling addiction. Another thing is that the number of gambling shops opening up has increased 10 fold. Every second shop you pass in a city is a gambling store. I would like to see a limit on the number of gambling shops in a given area. I would therefore urge the government to take the advice I give so that others do not get sucked into this like I did. ",
