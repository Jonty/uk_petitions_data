        "additional_details": "When does a 30 minute journey turn into a 60 minute journey?. When the peak traffic is littered with Refuse trucks, Tractors, JCB's and drivers making deliveries on roads that can just about cope at these times. I wish to propose a removal of these vehicles before 9am and after 5pm, so that a general commute to a place of employment can happen without constant inteference from unecessary traffic.\r\nThis would indeed be beneficial to the environment in the reduction of emmissions also from standstill traffic, whilst also leading to a less stressful outcome, possibly reducing the strain on future NHS cases. A little change going a long way.",
