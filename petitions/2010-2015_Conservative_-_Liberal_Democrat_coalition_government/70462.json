The site has enjoyed Conservation Status since 1996 and is adjoined by salt marsh areas with SSSI status and BSPB protection.The area also forms a free and open amenity for the greater area of N.E.Lincolnshire.Contrary to the NELC\u2019s statement that the site is un-profitable we would dispute this as the known incomes, both ground rent and council tax, currently contribute approximately  \u00a3650,000 per annum (plus VAT) to the local economy, with separate provisions for utilities and maintenance billing. The NELC has failed to produce detailed information to support their claims.\r\n",
