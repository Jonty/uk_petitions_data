        "additional_details": "The rate of most Rail Travel has increased by 62% in 10 short years and looks set to keep on rising.\r\n\r\nWe need to National our railway again and stop Fat Cats lining pockets with TaxPayers Money.\r\n\r\nThe Rail Network is a shambles and needs proper direction and improvement.\r\n\r\nThe Delays and overcrowding that this country has to put up with is ridiculous. Travelling by Train will be a distant memory for some if the prices keep on rising and unemployment will be exacerbated by poeple who are priced out of commuting to work.\r\n\r\nThis will cause increase in demand for benefits from able bodies citizens who have to leave work due to being priced out of travelling by public means.\r\n\r\nWhen will the Government realise that the more people that are priced out of Rail travel the more money the fares will go up in time making rail travel thing of the past and causing our Carbon Footprint to sky rocket as people turn to cars and motorcyles.",
