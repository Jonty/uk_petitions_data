Banning Referral Fees will not simply reduce claimants or costs of claims; it will simply change how these claims are received by solicitors. Claimants may have to rely on Advertising to decide who they choose to represent them.\r\n\r\nGovernment need to review who and how they have taken advice on this matter and consider the industry that has set up and regulated by the MOJ. There are many other options that have not been considered.\r\n\r\n",
