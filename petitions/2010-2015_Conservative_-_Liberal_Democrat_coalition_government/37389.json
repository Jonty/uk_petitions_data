        "additional_details": "Rather than allow The Bank of England to continue the current \"bank bailout out\" strategey, Government should come to an agreement with The Bank of England which allows the release funds (approx. \u00a3100 billion) required to fund the complete abolition of the VAT system. This would reduce the cost of all VAT-able products and services significantly, giving the public more available income (approx. \u00a32k p/a per uk adult) to spend, and reduce admin costs to both business and Government. the spending of this income will revive business and create jobs, thus increasing tax revenue.",
