I also believe a central point/website should be made accessible to missing pet and animal welfare groups who may be able to help bring closure to owners. The handling and communication between the public and any persons/council responsible for the uplift and removal of the remains should be professional with a sense of compassion.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue that needs addressed in many aspects",
