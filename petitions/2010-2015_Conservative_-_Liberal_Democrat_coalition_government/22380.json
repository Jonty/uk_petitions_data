        "additional_details": "New cars should not be allowed to be sold with narrow space saver spare wheels. A car designed to run on british roads have wheels and tyres designed for that purpose. To then have a powerful car on a motorway with three proper wheels and a pram wheel is dangerous and wrong. The grip is nowhere near that of a proper wheel. They do have a speed restriction but that means holding up fast moving traffic creating a potential accident.",
