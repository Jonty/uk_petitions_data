Hugging the middle lane! it makes me want to SCREAM!!!\r\nEveryday Whilst on the road I see errors made all the time, the Older generation are unfortunately the worst, they cause more accidents than are involved in and don't even realise it!\r\nWhy can't public Information ads be shown on TV giving information about road signs and the protocol when on a motorway, I am sure that most of us have forgotten more than we remember about the highway code, and I am sure a couple of ads during the course of the day would make a world of difference. Please sign this petition to make our roads safer and driving more enjoyable for all.\r\n\r\n",
