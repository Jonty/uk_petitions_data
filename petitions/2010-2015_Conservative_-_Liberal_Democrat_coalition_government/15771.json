        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition to ask The Parliament to review the law on police cautions. It is not right that a caution should stay on someones record for life, affecting potential careers and future. Everyone makes silly mistakes from time to time. What i do propose is that cautions should be deleted off a persons record after perhaps 3-5 years. So many people have lost their jobs due to the silly police cautions they received for the mistakes they done decades ago, out of anger, out of depression or any other reason.",
