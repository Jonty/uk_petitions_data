        "additional_details": "Given the recent coverage on the BBC about how the chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland should feel compelled to give back his bonus, we the undersigned would like the BBC to justify the salaries of all of it's staff that have an income of more than \u00a31.2million per annum. The Daily Star (on the 30th August 2011) estimated Jeremy Clarkson's Salary as Top Gear presenter to be \u00a32million and we would like the government to ask the BBC to justify why taxpayers are renumerating certain members of staff with taxpayers money, more than they do the head of the world's third largest bank.",
