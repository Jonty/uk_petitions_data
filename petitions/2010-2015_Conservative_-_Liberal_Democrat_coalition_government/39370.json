        "additional_details": "High gas and electricity prices are crippling our economy.\r\nThe \u2018BIG SIX\u2019 are regularly increasing prices at rates far in excess of the rate of inflation.  Price rises are attributed to increased whole sale costs, while profit margins continue to increase.  These companies are price fixing; they all withdraw fixed rate deals, then increase prices by a similar rate.\r\nThe cost of energy is placing people\u2019s lives in danger.  Families have to choose whether to eat properly or pay inflated energy bills.\r\nWith a further 10 % price increase on the horizon for both gas and electricity bills, surely enough is enough.\r\nTherefore, this petition calls on the Government to:\r\n1) Place an upper limit on the \u2018profit per household\u2019 for energy suppliers.\r\n2) Introduce legislation to limit the annual increase in price of gas / electricity to the rate of inflation.\r\n3) Set up a Commission to look at market competitiveness.\r\n4) Overhaul the ineffective energy regulator OFGEM\r\n",
