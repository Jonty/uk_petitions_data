        "additional_details": "As part of my Citizenship GCSE Courework, I have been asked to carry out research into a Citizenship issue that I think is important. I have chosen the topic of \"Is the Media a Tool for Terrorism\".\r\n\r\nDue to convenience and broad reach of social media platforms, such as: Youtube, Twitter, Facebook, etc. Terrorist Groups, like Isis and Al-Qaeda, have been abusing them to garner publicity and recruit overseas. For example, the 3 East London Schoolgirls who have flown overseas to join the Islamic State terrorist group.\r\n\r\nThrough this petition, I hope to not only raise awareness of this issue, but to help prevent things such as this occuring in the future. I suggest we take action, by removing/ blocking the videos online and by removing/ blocking the social media accounts that have been promoting the terrorist groups and their actions.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\nCameron Smith\r\nChatham Grammar School for Boys",
