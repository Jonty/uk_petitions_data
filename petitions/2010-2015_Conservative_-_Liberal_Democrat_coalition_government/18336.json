We now live in a world where the complete documentation of all actions taken by on-duty police officers is possible. While many officers record most of their interactions with the public, there are still many incidents that are undocumented and that result in a \"he-said-she-said\" legal situation. In addition to recording all interactions with the public, police forces must also readily and without resistance provide recordings upon request. These steps will help to re-establish trust in our police agencies.\r\n\r\n",
