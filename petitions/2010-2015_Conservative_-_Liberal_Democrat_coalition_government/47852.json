We, the people, are much better placed than him to decide which of the two statements regarding secularity of this country and whether or not the government is supporting or killing christianity is the correct one.  Give us an opportunity to convince Cameron that he is wrong- quickly, though, because he is most recently famous for changing his mind on everything he states in public, within 24 hours of saying it.",
