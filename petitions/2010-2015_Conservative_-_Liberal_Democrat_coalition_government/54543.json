Is this fair?\r\n\r\nAn abandoned spouse is stopped by the parents and even Police (if informed) from speaking to the other spouse if he denies to talk to deserted spouse. What can the deserted spouse do?\r\n\r\nThere are no laws in relation to marital desertion in the UK whereby the aggrieved party may approach the court for Restitution of Conjugal Rights.\r\n\r\nOur plea is that \u201cRestitution of Conjugal Rights\u201d should be the way forward. Give the deserted spouse a ray of hope!\r\n\r\n\r\n",
