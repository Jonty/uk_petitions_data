I say that we should stop publishing someone's religion in articles altogether, or we should publish them all. Why is it only when someone is Muslim that their religion enters into it? And no, I am not Muslim myself, I just see it as unfair.\r\nLet's get the media to stop inciting intolerance, by stopping them from using people's religion to encourage prejudicial views about them.",
