        "additional_details": "I would like for the Government to ban recruitment agencies advertising jobs that do not exist.  Not only is this illegal but it wastes Job Seekers time.  I have gone through the process of applying for a number of vacancies, completing application forms, spending money to attend interviews to then be told the job is no longer available and even worse being ignored by recruitment consultants because they know the job does not exist and do not want to be honest about it.\r\n\r\nHow can the government expect people to get jobs when companies and recruitment agencies are advertising jobs that do not exist?\r\n\r\nHow does the government expect people to keep up with montly payments such as bills, mortgages, when companies and recruitment agencies are assuring people they will always be work available when in reality there is no work available.\r\n\r\nI am not the only victim that has been tricked and lied to, this is wrong, it is not right and we need to put a stop to this once and for all.\r\n\r\n",
