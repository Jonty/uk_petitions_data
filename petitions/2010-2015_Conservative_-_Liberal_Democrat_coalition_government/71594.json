        "additional_details": "We call for more rigorous checks in animal welfare in terms of testing, entertainment and food production. We also call for harsher punishments for animal abusers.\r\n\r\nWhen animals are tested upon we call for the test conductors to apply for permission to conduct the test. The application must be sent to a panel for review. If the proposed experiment infringes upon animal welfare it must be denied, else approved.\r\n\r\nWhen animals are used for entertainment (racing, dancing, performing) we call for further regulation ensuring their safety and well-being.\r\n\r\nWhen animals are used for the production of food we call for stricter regulations on how the animals are kept and we expect infringements upon animal welfare (Inhumane Slaughter) to be punished.",
