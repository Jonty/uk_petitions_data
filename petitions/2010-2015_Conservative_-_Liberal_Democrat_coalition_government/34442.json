They design and build tall structures and large buildings such as multi-storey car parks, train stations, and even the Olympic stadium.\r\nWithout civil engineers we wouldn\u2019t have a constant supply of clean water, or sustainable energy to help us save our planet. Without civil engineers the world we live in would be completely unrecognisable.' -   Institute of Civil Engineer's - http://www.ice.org.uk/About-civil-engineering/What-do-civil-engineers-do\r\nAll Civil engineers have to work to what are known as British standards.\r\nIf Civil Engineer's have to work to British standards, given how many lives depend on they'r job's, why don't doctor's?\r\nWhy don't I receive a STANDARDISED HEALTH CHECK everytime I visit the doctors?
