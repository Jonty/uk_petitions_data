        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the creation of an educational rebate for students whose secondary school has failed to teach them to GCSE C level or above in English and Maths.\r\n\r\nThe rebate that should be given would be \u00a3100 for each subject that is not passed at a C grade, and would be no more than \u00a3200.  The money would not be a cash, BACS or cheque payment. Instead it would be an educational voucher to be used by the recipient on educational training at a government approved provider, such as an FE college. This would incentivise headteachers to focus their resources on raising standards in these crucial subjects and would help raise the employability of pupils, as these are the minimum standard of education needed to obtain a place on apprenticeship schemes,or  to serve in the armed services, or to work for any government department at even the most basic level, or by the very many local, regional and national businesses.
