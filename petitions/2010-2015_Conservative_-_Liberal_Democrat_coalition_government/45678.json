        "additional_details": "The rules around listing buildings should be changed to ensure that it takes into account mass public opinion.\r\n\r\nCurrently minorities of people are able to get listed buildings, that an overwhelming majority of residents in an area do not want protected.\r\n\r\nA prime example of this is in plymouth where despite overwhelming public opinion the civic centre became a listed building based on a minority request.\r\n\r\nI propose that the rules around this be changed to enable places to be protected based more on general public opinion rather than the opinion of a limited few people. This will not only allow more places to be protected but also limit the unnecessary protection of buildings which the majority of the local public do not consider worthy of protection.",
