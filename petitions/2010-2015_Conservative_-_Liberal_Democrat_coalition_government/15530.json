        "additional_details": "Our current income tax system is in dire need of simplification. I propose replacing this with a single flat rate tax for all.\r\n\r\nThe current system creates a psychological barrier for low earners: they work up to the tax threshold, but no more.\r\n\r\nAt the opposite end of the scale, having a 40-50% tax rate for high earners encourages those in this group to seek professional advice to reduce their tax bills: they exploit loopholes and end up paying less tax than the rest of society.\r\n\r\nBy its very nature, a flat-percentage tax system is fair to all: the more you earn, the more you pay.\r\n\r\nSavings will be made by reducing the cost of administering the system, and by closing loopholes, a greater amount of tax revenue will be collected.",
