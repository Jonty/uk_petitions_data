He is currently serving his sentence at HM Prison Wymott. Many see 'Ched's' Trial as flimsy,highlighting the fact that Former Manchester city Skipper Clayton Macdonald was released on the same charge.\r\n\r\n'Ched' due to be released in October is set to rejoin former club Sheffield United a descison which has sparked controvesy not just in Yorkshire but all, over the country.'Ched' has done his time and deserves a secound chance, he owes it to the fans of the club.People may argue that he isn't fully rehabilitated but after years of footballing experience this will not be a problem.\r\n\r\nI would like this to be understood by the Goverment and the Sheffield United board that this is what the fans want.",
