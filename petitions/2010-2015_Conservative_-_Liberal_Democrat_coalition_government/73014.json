        "additional_details": "We the undersigned would like Mr Nicholas Barber banned from all competitive association football matches, be they in league or cup competitions, domestic or European.\r\n\r\nNicholas has never witnessed an away victory in favour of Newcastle United despite attending many. As he is 26 years old we feel that he must be having a negative influence on results and his banning from games would benefit tens of thousands of people. ",
