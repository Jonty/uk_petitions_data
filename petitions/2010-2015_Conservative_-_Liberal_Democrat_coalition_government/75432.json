        "additional_details": "As an HGV driver, I am disappointed in low wages on offer for our skills. We are the backbone of the UK economy, with a massive responsibility to the rest of society in respect of road safety and keeping the shops supplied. Our job is a difficult one. Drivers are forced to work long hours to make ends meet. Stress levels and health problems are higher than other occupations. We feel that we are not appreciated at all. The government should legislate on minimum wage for HGV drivers. We should be paid at the rate of at least \u00a310 per hour plus overtime.",
