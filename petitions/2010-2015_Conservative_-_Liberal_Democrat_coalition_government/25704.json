Children need more rules and less rights to enable this society to become a safe environment again.\r\nAs the laws stand at the moment, our head of state and government want us to parent with our hands tied behind our back, if we change these rules, children can be kept safer, and antisocial behaviour will be able to be dealt with and alot of taxpayers money that is being spent on unruly adolescents could be saved. (i.e police, social services, schools, hospitals and court time.)",
