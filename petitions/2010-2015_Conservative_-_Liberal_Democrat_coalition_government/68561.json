For the sake of convenience of the Common Travel Area, it is proposed Ireland would be included. One must of either have had citizen since birth of one of the aforementioned countries, or if acquired by naturalisation, they must held citizenship for a period of no less than 10 years. There will be no recourse to public funds.\r\n\r\nThese three countries share a long history, ancestry, culture, language, rule of law, trade, and values. All these countries have exceptionally high quality of lives, and advance economies that would benefit from reduced immigration controls.\r\n",
