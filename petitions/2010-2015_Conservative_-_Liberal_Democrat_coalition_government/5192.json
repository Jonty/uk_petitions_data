There needs to be a clear distinction when referring to future housing development, as to what is 'social housing', and who affordable housing applies to.The term \" Affordable Housing\" is vague and misleading, giving the impression that this housing somehow benefits those on low incomes and can hide the woefully inadequate levels of social housing and housing that is affordable to those on low incomes.",
