        "additional_details": "Britain is proudly a multi cultural country and yet our public holidays remain largely religious celebrations. It is time we had a public holiday along the lines of Thanksgiving in the US to celebrate our common beliefs and shared community. The 2012 Olympics clearly demonstrated what we can do when we come together and an annual celebration free of politics and religion would be a recognition of our multi-culturalism in the 21st century. We call upon the government to introduce an autumn public holiday along these lines.",
