        "additional_details": "We call upon the government to provide funding to reinstate the annual fireworks display in Victoria Park, East London, which was cancelled by Tower Hamlets Council in 2011.\r\n\r\nVictoria Park's fireworks display was generally amazing, with excellent access for disabled people and enough room to move. It attracted people from all over East London. In 2011 it was cancelled on cost grounds in favour of a smaller display in Weaver's Fields.\r\n\r\nThe large event made a large number of people's lives a little bit better by providing highly enjoyable family entertainment. It was accessible, with good humoured themes created by local cultural groups. In short, it was thoroughly British.\r\n\r\nFew events can claim to provide so much bang for so little buck. Please restore it to the calendar",
