        "additional_details": "We disagree with David Cameron's proposal to block the UK's ability to access pornographic content over the internet  by making the bill payer opt into allowing the internet to accessthese kinds of sites. Teenagers all over the UK depend on the ability to download pornographic material discreetly without their parents knowledge and so this proposal is absolutley ridiculous. The goverment should take action and stop David Cameron forcing this action through.",
