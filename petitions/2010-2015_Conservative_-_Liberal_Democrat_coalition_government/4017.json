The primary intent would be to serve the 4 regional airports, viz: Heathrow / Luton / Stansted & Gatwick, there being branch lines to each of these locations.\r\nSpecifically, this would (potentially) relieve the motorway of countless numbers of vehicles daily and would provide the travelling public with a a safe and reliable means of accessing these destinations.\r\nSuch a scheme would have significant environmental benefits.",
