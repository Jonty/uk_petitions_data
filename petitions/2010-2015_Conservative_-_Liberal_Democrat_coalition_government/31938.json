        "additional_details": "David Walliams has committed himself, not just admirably, but heroically, to so many charitable causes; he has swum the English Channel; he has swum the Thames; he has swum the Strait of Gibraltar; he has whole-heartedly participated in 24 hours of panel shows; he has cycled the entire length of Great Britain. As well as being one of our nation's best comedians, he has also done more than most people of his age to earn such recognition. We urge Her Majesty The Queen to bestow a knighthood upon David Walliams because very few people have contributed so much to such worthy causes.",
