        "additional_details": "Time and time again I hear of court cases finding people not guilty because of failings of the jury. Every job and position are vetted to make sure the individuals are suitable for that position. So why are juries often made up of people that are anti police, racist, or individuals that just do not care and do not want to be their! There is too much shacking of heads from police and victims when a case ends in a not guilt verdict. The jury is the fabric of justice in this country, but need to be look at because some members of the public just do not care, so PLEASE can parliment look at how members of a jury are vetted to ensure British justice is the finest in the world.",
