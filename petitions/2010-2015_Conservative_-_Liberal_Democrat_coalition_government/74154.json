        "additional_details": "I would like the government to make education on equal rights, mental health and rape culture compulsory in all schools in the UK. It scares me how people are leaving secondary school as uneducated on real world problems as they started.\r\n\r\nThere are too many false facts about mental health that filter their way through every year of school life leaving terrible lies in impressionable children's heads.\r\n\r\nI recently did a presentation on equal rights and gender equality in school and one of the comments I received was 'but you just cant stop men from raping women'. If people were educated on subjects like this from a younger age we may be able to lover the amount of rape victims, stop sexist thoughts and the discrimination of people due to their gender. This is what people need to fight for. ",
