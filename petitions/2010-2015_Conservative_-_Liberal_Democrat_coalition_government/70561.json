Too many cyclists don't seem to know the rules of the road and as a result end up in accidents with other road users. The should have to take a test and if the pass the test they should receive a badge or certificate that they can attach to their bike to show that they have pass the test and are allowed to use the roads. This will result in less accidents coursed by cyclists who do not know the Highway code.",
