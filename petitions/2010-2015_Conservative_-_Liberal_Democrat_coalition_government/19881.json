        "additional_details": "Lending at over 30% to be made illegal. All banks to pay 100% of bonus payments plus 100% of all staff benefits over \u00a3250000 annually, into a \"social bank\" or division, which will lend to disadvantaged/disenfranchised/non-qualifying people largely \"as of right\" within certain parameters, to replace the peripheral lenders. This is not a tax, simply an allocation of capital which the banks should even make money out of this. Further, it should be mandatory that any UK bank will open a bank account and grant a debit card to any UK citizen. All current lending at in excess of 30% rates should be repaid by the newly created bank funds (fully, as of right), thereby replacing >30% rate loans with ones from reputable lenders. Most appropriate way to balance the bonuses with those with most need. Removes parasite lenders. Protects the most vulnerable.",
