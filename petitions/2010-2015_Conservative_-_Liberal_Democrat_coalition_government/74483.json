        "additional_details": "This petition is to highlight the discrimination that occurs in the workplace in regard to Tattoos and Body Piercing. Instances include trivial comments and jokes, to employers threatening employees with termination of employment.\r\n\r\nBody piercing and Tattoos have entered the mainstream of society and also have a spiritual significance to people from all creeds and backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThe proposer believes that people should be employed on their abilities first and foremost, as a positive work environment provides for greater productivity and motivated employees. Therefore, employees should be protected from abuse, victimization and discrimination.",
