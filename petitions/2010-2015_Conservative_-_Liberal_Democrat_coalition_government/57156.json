        "additional_details": "Murray McCheyne is a boss, the whole nation should be given time out of regular working hours at full pay to celebrate the man, the myth, the legend.\r\n\r\nMurray was born 34 years ago, on November 15th 19seventyoreightysomething. He grew up, rapidly becoming awesome. Not a lot else is known about the man, as such we need a national holiday to respect him and raise awareness, it should include something about hockey and superheroes and tesco garages should have 'Murray Day' sales. We'll call the day Murray Day, that is a good name.",
