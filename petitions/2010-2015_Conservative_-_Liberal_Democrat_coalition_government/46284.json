        "additional_details": "Lupus is a crippling disease that debilitates its sufferers, it is an autoimmune disease where our antibodies attack our bodies and our organs. Lupus is a complex and poorly understood condition that affects many parts of the body and causes symptoms which can be life-threatening. There is currently no cure for Lupus, but there are different medications that can help relieve many of the symptoms and prevent progressive organ damage. With good levels of support from friends, family and healthcare professionals, many people with Lupus learn to manage their condition effectively.  Lupus sufferers struggle every day with various other ailments/illnesses i for one have hughes syndrome and the mounting medical prescriptions i have are ridiculous and very expensive. I would like the government to look at free prescriptions for lupus sufferers with immediate effect\r\n",
