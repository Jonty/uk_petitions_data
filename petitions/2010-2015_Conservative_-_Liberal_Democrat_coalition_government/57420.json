        "additional_details": "Currently, all businesses are feeling the squeeze - especially SME's.\r\n\r\nIt therefore seems ridiculous that small and medium sized businesses cannot pay Corporation Tax in instalments, and spread the amount out through the year - something which large businesses already CAN do.\r\n\r\nSurely it makes more sense to make it easier for smaller businesses to budget their monthly cashflow by allowing them to pay a smaller amount monthly or quarterly, than to force them to find one big lump payment each year?\r\n\r\nPlease ask HMRC to open up instalment payments for Corporation Tax to ALL businesses, not just large businesses, and allow very small SME's to pay monthly if necessary.   This would probably also reduce the number of early business failures when the owners suddenly realise they potentially have a large lump-sum only bill to pay.",
