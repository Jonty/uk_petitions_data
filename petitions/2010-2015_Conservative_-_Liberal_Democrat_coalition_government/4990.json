I propose that this situation should be reversed and all sentences handed down should be served in full. If the prisoner fails to exhibit \"good behaviour, or remorse\" the sentence should be increased by fixed increments up to a maximum of double the original sentence. This would be determined at prison tribunals which would be cheaper to administer than the courts.",
