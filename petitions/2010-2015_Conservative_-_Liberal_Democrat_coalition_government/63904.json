        "additional_details": "Born in the UK, David Pountney moved to the US to marry his American wife Cindy.  An only child, he now needs to return to the UK to look after his elderly mother and father as their health is declining.\r\nCindy was turned down for a visa by the UK Border Agency because she had no income in the UK and a third party contribution is no longer accepted.  Since then,  a judge has ruled in their favour saying  that Cindy had received enough support \u201cback home\u201d to warrant their return in accordance with human rights regulations.\r\nBut they have now been advised that the Home Secretary is appealing the Judge\u2019s decision, having already informed the MEP Gerrard Batten that she would do so, without any consideration of the legal basis of the Judge\u2019s decision.\r\nWe ask that she drop her appeal as this is only warranted if the judge has made an error of law. It is our belief that no error has been made.\r\nPlease sign with us to ask Theresa May to re-consider her decision and to revoke her appeal.\r\n",
