        "additional_details": "The combined housing provision of Local Authorities and Registered Social Landlords (e.g. Housing Associations) now provides no more UK homes than the Private Rented Sector.\r\n\r\nGiven that the UK Private Rented sector has matured significantly since the Housing Act was implemented in 1988 many landlord and tenant groups feel that a review is necessary.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of over 1 million Private Rented Sector landlords and over 4 million tenants living in their properties I ask you to set up a working committee to look into issues affecting this huge sector of the UK economy.\r\n\r\nAt the macro level the issues are:-\r\n\r\n1) Increasing supply of safe accommodation whilst containing costs and the balance of supply and demand\r\n2) Dealing with criminal operators and providers of substandard accommodation\r\n\r\nMore details and discussion at http://www.property118.com/index.php/solving-the-housing-crisis/31803/",
