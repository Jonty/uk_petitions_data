        "action": "Against Scottish universities charging top level fees to British citizens but not Scottish or other member EU citizens who will pay nothing.",
        "additional_details": "We wish for the government to discuss a move to prevent Scottish universities discriminating against English, Welsh and Northern Irish citizens. By charging those students top level fees but allowing Scottish and other member EU citizens to learn free of charge is an infringement of an individuals right to education. Understandably, free university tuition is not feasible to all, therefore all students should be made to pay lower fees and not discriminate between the states of the UK. United Kingdom suggests unity between all its member states. A Scottish citizen is entitled to the same as an English citizen. Therefore, why should an English citizen not be entitled to the same education within Scotland.",
