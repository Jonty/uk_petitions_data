        "additional_details": "Chinese Lanterns are let off to float uncontrolled into the night sky with no thought of the consequences when they land.\r\nFIRES: Roofs have been set alight, crops have been destroyed, a fire at a recycling plant saw 11 firemen injured. Chinese Lanterns damage businesses and lives alike.\r\nANIMALS: Livestock have been known to eat the remains of burnt out lanterns, causing severe injuries and even death, once again fatally-birds/owls are getting caught up in the wires.\r\nUNNECESSARY ALARM: Chinese Lanterns are wasting valuable resources, mistaken for flares and UFO's that's better spent time of our coastguards and police gone.\r\nLITTERING: Once these lanterns fall from the sky they are litter. If you were to drop the lantern in a town centre you would be fined for littering.\r\n\r\nPlease ban the sale and use of Chinese Lanterns in the UK\r\n\r\n100,000  signatures needed- please sign ",
