We can not afford to lose the Fire Station leaving us 10 - 15 mins away from the nearest engine, SECONDS COST LIVES!\r\n\r\nSadly there is a proposal to CLOSE Porth fire station!! Leaving the Communities of Porth with the nearest fire Engine as far away as Tonypandy or Treforest Please help us spread the word, and also have your say. Ask for any further information..\r\n\r\nSome of you may not be aware but due to the public sector cuts and the fire review cover being carried out, South Wales Fire and Rescue Service have made a proposal to permanently close Porth fire station.\r\nThis will leave no fire cover within the porth community. We now have until June to get as much support and backing from within our own community to show and prove to them how much we not only want but NEED to keep porth fire station open!!! please help us spread the word and gain as much support as we can.",
