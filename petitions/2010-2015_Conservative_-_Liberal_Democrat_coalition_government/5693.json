        "additional_details": "The government should introduce financial sanctions against leaders of businesses that have to be bailed out in the future.\r\nPremise: Too big to fail encourages businesses to accept more risk.\r\nThe Deterrent: Directors and senior managers of bailed out businesses will have a large proportion of their bonuses, pensions and salaries seized by the state after a judicial review that considers their culpability and ability to re-pay.\r\nEffects: (1) The directors and senior managers will feel the pain of failure and pressures them into reducing risks. (2) May make them demand higher wages to compensate for the risk -  indicating that they don't have confidence in the business, encouraging shareholders to apply pressure to remedy the situation. (3) Companies may move abroad to avoid the deterrent, signalling low confidence and prompting shareholder pressure. (4) British businesses, held to this standard, will be trusted more than those in other jurisdictions, boosting shareholder value.",
