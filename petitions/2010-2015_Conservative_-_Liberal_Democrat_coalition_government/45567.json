Therefore by raising awareness of past events we hope to get speed cushions on the road.\r\n",

Road safety measures on particular parts of the local road network are the responsibility of the appropriate local authority.  You may wish to resubmit your e-petition, so that it asks central Government to urge the local authority to take action.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you don't say where Armadale Road is.  We believe that there are ten of them in Great Britain (although three of these are in Scotland, and since you are taking GCSEs rather than Scottish qualifications, we assume you aren't in Scotland).  To encourage people to sign your e-petition, it would probably be helpful if you said where in England you are."
