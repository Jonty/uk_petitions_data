        "additional_details": "This year the government will generate \u00a310 million through VAT on Sports Supplements.\r\n\r\nBy 2050, in the same period, the NHS will squeeze \u00a350 BILLION (a year) on medical care linked directly to\r\nobesity. 1 in 2 of us will be overweight. Pasties & Jaffa Cakes? They\u2019re fine. Protein Shakes, taxable?\r\n\r\nLazy, short sighted Politics, by lazy, short term Politicians. Far too scared of keeping their jobs today, to make meaningful decisions for tomorrow, our future generations depend on these decision made now.\r\n\r\nHealth and fitness ARE NOT taxable commodities. The way we look, feel and treat ourselves is not at the discretion of any politician.\r\n\r\nWe want 100,000 votes to take to Westminster, to revoke the tax on sports nutritional supplements.\r\n\r\nThe nations health crisis needs addressing before its too late. This is just the beginning.",
