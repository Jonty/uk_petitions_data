        "additional_details": "Many homes are getting separated for the introduction of the benefits cap because before the introduction of benefit cap, some people found it difficult to have their three square meals per day. Husband and wife are getting separated because the Government did not created any job out there, no affordable homes and the councils are forcing people to very expensive houses which prevented people from working and prevented them to live a better life. The council also are not helpful. The work programme workers also are keeping people off work because of their self centred attitude. The government was bringing family together before  but now you are separating the family now because people have to go out and found cheaper accommodation and there is no any in London. So we have to go outside London and look for cheaper houses. ",
