        "additional_details": "At retirement age, it should be mandatory for pensioners to retake their driving tests.  With an ageing population the number of vehicles on the road has increased and many older drivers have not taken a test in 50 or more years.  A standard driving test would ensure that those motorists meet the eye sight requirements as well as the knowledge of the highway code.  Start with the oldest drivers first.",
