        "additional_details": "Getting a job should ultimately NOT depend on your GCSE results. I believe work based performance and how well you enjoy/ are good at a particular job should determine whether you can succeed in your chosen career or not.\r\nI know I am not alone when thinking this is wrong. I am sixteen years old, I am obtaining passing grades, all except for one, Maths. My chosen career was to become a criminal barrister, I obtained an A in my law exam, but because I am not capable of obtaining a C in Maths I can not follow my chosen career choice. I am MORE than capable of studying my chosen subject like THOUSANDS like me, who cannot succeed in their chosen career because of ONE fail grade at a subject they just cannot understand and because of lack of teaching aid.\r\n\r\nThe law needs to be reformed now.
