We demand that Social Services departments are ordered not to use this phrase. Instead concentrate on the children who are suffering from Sexual and Physical Abuse. To assist disadvantaged families until their individual issues and needs are eradicated. To stop targeting adults who have been through the care system themselves as easy targets. To use only expert witnesses that are familiar with the families and have been selected by the families. To not infringe on the right to privacy ,  during child protection core assessments using social services staff , that construct false positive assessments . Life story work to be completed by the birth families. Not Social Services. All children in Local Authority care to be allocated an independant advocate such as VOICE . Not one of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
