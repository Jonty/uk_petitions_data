        "action": "Vote Rochester and Strood out of Kent",
        "additional_details": "Following Ukip's Mark Reckless winning of the Rochester and Strood by-election, this petition calls upon all the good people of Kent who are against racism and xenophobia to vote Rochester and Strood out of the county of Kent. The Garden of England has no place for the thugs and racists which make up the Ukip party, and with recent as of yet uninvestigated  reports that Eltham-born Mark Reckless has long-standing connections with Stephen Lawrence killers Gary Dobson and David Norris, this petition aims not to alienate the people of Rochester and Strood, but simply highlight Mark Reckless' hidden racist agenda and past, and to send out a strong signal that all of Kent is united against racism.",
