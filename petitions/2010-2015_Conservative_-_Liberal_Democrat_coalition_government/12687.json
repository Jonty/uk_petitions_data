        "additional_details": "At present there is ZERO exposure of any of the ATAXIA's in your local Dr's surgery. A simple leaflet on a pin-board is all thats required. Its absence is counter-productive to its awareness, which will eventually lead to its control or even cure.\r\n\r\nAtaxia is one of the worst conditions that can affect anyone. It is Rare, Neurological, incurable, untreatable, life-limiting and inexorable in its progression. Unfortunately, we don't know enough about it to do anything about it. Awareness of this terrible affliction is the primary key to making any remote inroads towards control/cure. By signing this e-petition or visiting www.ataxia.org.uk you are making an enormous contribution towards the satisfactory conclusion of a most arduous and noble medical endeavour.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks and keep smiling :)\r\n\r\n ",
