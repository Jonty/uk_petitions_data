        "additional_details": "Currently Ponderosa Rescue Kennels and Cattery in Castleford, West Yorkshire are rehoming both dogs and cats without carrying out any form of home checks or even asking for identification. Unfortunately this is just one of many and also applies to irresponsible breeders who are happy to hand over animals without knowledge that they are going to suitable homes.\r\nThe animals are not being properly assessed to evaluate what type of home they are able to live in let alone if there are any behavioural problems that new owners should be made aware of.\r\nThis petition is to put pressure on any individuals rehoming animals to change their policies in order to safeguard not only the welfare of the animals in their care but also to ensure they are placed in suitable homes with informed owners.",
