Whilst I am lucky in that I have a very supportive church providing greater care and encouragement, many who suffer are not and the prospect of a waiting list is likely to be daunting and potentially lead to a serious decline in their mental health. This at a time also when rates of suicide are sadly also increasing.\r\n\r\nWhilst appreciating that NHS resources are scarce, this petition calls on the Government to introduce a guarantee offering a full range of evidence-based psychological therapies to all who need them within 28 days of requesting a referral.
