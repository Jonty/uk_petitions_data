London riots and what triggered it also comes to mind.\r\n\r\nGuardian and London School of economics did survey in London and all other major cities where riots occurred through interviews and a Twitter poll and discovered a wide spread antipathy against Police.\r\n\r\nA camera recording their actions will make them more concious of what they do and give civilians the peace of mind that they will be treated in an appropriate and lawful manner.\r\n\r\nWe citizens and tax payers of UK demand that all Police forces in UK be issued with the cameras that record or send live feed of any incident they attend.\r\n\r\nThank you.
