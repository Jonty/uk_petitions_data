        "additional_details": "Discrimination is not allowed within the rules and regulations around student funding in the EU.  A practice, policy or rule which applies to everyone in Britain should advantage/disadvantage everyone equally. Students in England are at a disadvantage with the current \u00a39,000 university fee.\r\n\r\nEngland is out of step with Europe in terms of university tuition charges. Many EU countries offer substantially lower or free university education.\r\n\r\nEnglish students pay the highest tuition costs in Europe at \u00a39,000.  Welsh and Northern Irish students pay \u00a33,575, whereas Scottish students receive free tuition.\r\n\r\nStudent debt could be anything from \u00a30 to over \u00a3150,000, two thirds of which could be interest only. No-one, including senior people in government, can really claim to provide an accurate figure as loan terms and interest will change.\r\n\r\nSupport the petition - free or reduced university tuition fees, in line with the rest of Great Britain, for ENGLISH students.\r\n",
