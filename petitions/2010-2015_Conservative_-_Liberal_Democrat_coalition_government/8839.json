        "additional_details": "Government cuts on youth services have shown to represent a threat to our society following the recent events nationwide - the UK Riots.\r\n\r\nHundreds of thousands of young people throughout the UK are affected by the closure of youth clubs which have certainly contributed to the UK Rioting chaos we are recently faced with.\r\n\r\nRiots started in Tottenham, an area which is part of the north London borough of Haringey whose youth clubs were shut after the youth services budget was slashed by 75%, a cut of \u00a341m to the council's overall budget.\r\n\r\nWe are asking our government to reinstate funding to Youth Services in London, cuts need to be reconsidered and our youth needs to be cared for and not simply left on the streets, especially during times where unemployment figures are so high.
