There are too many rights for inmates and they have access to many illegal activities and substances while incarcerated. If soeone is jailed for anythig other than a minor offence, they should forego all but the most basic of human rights. They should also be forced to work to earn their keep. Like in America they should be forced to work building roads, schools, hospitals etc. This would reduce the burden on the tax payer and offer a sure-fire deterrent against re-offending.",
