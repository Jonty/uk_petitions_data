        "additional_details": "At present, an Employment dispute is considered by an Employment tribunal. There is then a right of appeal to the Employment Appeal Tribunal. Thereafter an appeal can be persued in the Court of Appeal and thereafter a further appeal to the Supreme Court thereafter  further appeal can be taken to the European Court of Human Rights.\r\n\r\nAll of the above appeal procedures take a lengthy period of time and cost a substantial sum employing solicitors and barristers.\r\n\r\nFurthermore numerous judicial officers are employed at great public expense\r\n\r\nAlternatively for other disputes there is the County Court/High Court, with subsequent appeals to the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nReform is needed so that there is one first instance decision with a right of appeal to a Court of Appeal and then the option of applying to the European Court of Human Rights.\r\n\r\nObtaining justice will become cheaper and quicker.",
