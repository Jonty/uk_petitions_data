        "additional_details": "When mums put a fathers name on a birth certificate they are unaware that they are signing away 50% of their parental rights.\r\nIn the case of 2 parents whom have the childs best interest at heart this is fine but there children with fathers names on their certificate who are distant and chose to never know them. If that child has thought someone else to be their dad all their life this will cause that child major grief when he sees that birth certificate.\r\n\r\nSome mothers put their partner at the times name on the birth certificate instead of the real father but it is impossible to then remove that partners name from the birth certificate without spending over \u00a3600 on a dna test. So this person has 50% of say in that childs life and would have to pay child maintanance unfairly.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to make it possible to remove a fathers name from the birth certificate aswell as a partners name without the cost of a dna test when its in the childs best interest.",
