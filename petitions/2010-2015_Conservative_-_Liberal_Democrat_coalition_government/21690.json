        "additional_details": "Northumberland County Council stopped the yearly Blyth In A New Light Fireworks display and fair because of cuts to public spending yet they can afford to re-surface Blyth main street only 2 years after the re-modernisation took place.\r\nThe Blyth In A New Light Fireworks Display brought visitors to Blyth from miles around. All of these visitors brought custom to the businessess within the town too. For my last point, since the council cancelled the Blyth In A New Light Fireworks display there has been a rise in incidents involving fireworks within the area. Bring back the Blyth In A New Light Fireworks display and save the tax payers money!",
