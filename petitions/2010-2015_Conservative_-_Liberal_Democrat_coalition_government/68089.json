Speaking and listening provide children with higher self esteem. Furthermore the year 11 are getting there in august will not be there results the government haven't included speaking and listening overall grade this unfair for the year 11 who left. I knew a student who did wonderfully in there speaking and listening but doesn't do well in course so he got a in speaking and listening but then d in his coursework and in exam he was predicted d so if the speaking and listening was still he most likely of got c or b as a teacher I guarantee that he got and overall and I am truly diss pointed with this government it doesn't take pupil interest in heart",
