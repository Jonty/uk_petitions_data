        "additional_details": "Signing this e-petition indicates to Government that the signatories have no confidence in the Current Nursing and Midwifery Counsils ability to undertake its primary role that is to protect the safety of the public and to protect the reputation of the profession. More importantly, it never has had. It has been doomed to failure from the start and action should have been taken long before now.\r\n\r\nFor Government to introduce non-nursing Chair and CEO in order to suggest that this will cure the problems of the NMC is both offensive and fanciful.\r\n\r\nI believe the Government should seek to scrap the NMC and look to the CHRE for advice on a systems that seeks to do no more than effectively regulate the fitness to practice of nurses with no other priorities.\r\n\r\nCosts could be saved by having only one paid professional member of the panal and the other members could be lay members who could perhaps become a specialist branch of magistrates.\r\n\r\n",
