        "additional_details": "This e-petition is to address the basic skills required by school leavers at the age of 16 to equip themselves with budgeting, earning money, managing money and paying bills without the need to borrow on credit cards, overdrafts or short term payday loans which are crippling a nation already in debt. Students should learn about earning money, the amount of tax they should pay on that and how to save and budget for necessities before they experience it to prepare them for an influx of income.",
