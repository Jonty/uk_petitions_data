        "action": "Encourage Energy Companies to invest in Fusion instead of Fission Reactors",
        "additional_details": "EDF have recently submitted proposals for several new fission reactors across the UK. Although fission produces large quantities of energy, enough to meet most of Britain's energy requirements, and the plants could be operational by 2020, they have overlooked another, better source of energy - Nuclear Fusion. The government should not approve the plans for the fission reactors and EDF and other energy companies should be engouraged to invest in the development of fusion power instead.\r\nFusion produces much more energy, and is not radioactive. The only waste products are Helium and other light elements. It is therefore much safer and much more environmentally friendly than fission, and also, the chances of a problem becoming serious are much smaller. Unfortunately, it still needs a lot of development, hence the need for funding.",
