This would represent a huge investment in our future workforce and avoid the crippling debts imposed on young graduates.\r\n\r\nIf it is not economically feasible to abolish fees completely, at least they should be capped at an affordable level of under \u00a33000 p.a.\r\n\r\nA government review should be carried out to review alternatives to the high fees in England, and how Scotland and Wales successfully manage to fund Universities without fees or with lower fees. The costs to society of the debt burden and reduced spending power of graduates should also be taken into account. ",
