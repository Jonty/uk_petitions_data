The criteria for these tests is nothing to do with building an inclusive society. What we test for (and abort) are those \"defects\" that are easy to test for - not those with the biggest impact. There should be a list of tests which the State should not have to fund, e,g. Down's Syndrome, Spina Bifida, where the children who do survive this state sponsored eugenics can lead happy and productive lives and gain qualifications that are beyond \"normal\" children.",
