The bus which serves this route is not a viable option for most as it can take an hour to reach its destination. Lewes is a thriving little town which attracts many people from all over the South East to sample some of the delights contained here. A link between Uckfield and Brighton which passes through Lewes would ensure the local economy would strengthen and grow. ",
