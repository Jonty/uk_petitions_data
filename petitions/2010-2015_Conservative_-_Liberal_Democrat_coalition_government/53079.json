        "additional_details": "Please do something to prevent Katie Hopkins voicing her hurtful, poisonous and defamatory opinions in the printed media and on television.  She is promoting an unhealthy attitude to women based on an unrealistic 'ideal' size, and is undermining the constructive work decades of women have put in to be established as credible peers in the world of business.  ITV's This Morning show no sign of regulating her comments and are currently simply enjoying the publicity generated by her spiteful outbursts.",
