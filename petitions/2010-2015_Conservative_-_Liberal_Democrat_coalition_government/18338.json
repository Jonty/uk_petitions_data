It is already not a crime to be naked in public and only lewd behaviour can lead to prosecution and rightly so. But when a naturist is hassled by the police who generally do not know the law regarding nudity it can lead to a lot of hardship for the naturist when really it should be the offended party who the police should be putting to rights. I ask for the introduction of new laws to fine anyone wasting police time because of their own extremist views.",
