        "additional_details": "This petition is to put a stop to Euthanising healthy animals. During recent months, dogs have had a lot of bad publicity in the press relating to attacks on adults and children. This is due to bad breeding and irresponsible owners.\r\n\r\n We need to make sure:\r\n\r\n > Checks carried out on potential owners\r\n\r\n> Compulsory pet insurance, in case an animal does escape, gets hurt or injured.\r\n\r\n> Keeping dogs on leads at all times in public will reduce the amount of escapees and attacks on other animals and people.\r\n\r\n> I would like to see dog licensing brought back alongside ownership papers. Then that way if an animal is sold on paperwork can be filled in.Just like we do when transferring ownership of a car.\r\n\r\n> Compulsory Neutering/spaying for all animals who are not owned by reputable breeders.\r\n\r\n> Dog and cat collars made compulsory with I.D tags.\r\n\r\n> Compulsory( DNA ) Micro chipping and tattooing for all cats and dogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
