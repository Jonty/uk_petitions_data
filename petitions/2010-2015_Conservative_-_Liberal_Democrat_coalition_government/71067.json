        "additional_details": "In 1915 it was decided that due to the shortage of munitions that women would be needed to work in the armaments factories to help with the war effort. By 1918 nearly 2 million women were working in industry 50% of which made munitions.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that 80% of all munitions made during WW1 were by women. Over 30,000 women were employed at the Royal Arsenal Woolwich, often working 60 hour weeks, and by the end of the war they had produced over 60 million fuses, 24 million shells, 40 million cartridge cases, 1.8 billion bullets and thousands of tons of high explosive.\r\n\r\nI believe a memorial should be located within the walls of the old Royal Arsenal, Woolwich in memory of their efforts. Soldiers have memorials as do sailors and airmen, but without the munitions workers (male & female) this war could not have been won.",
