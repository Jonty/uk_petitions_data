        "additional_details": "In May 2012, a number of internet service providers were forced by the courts to block access to The Pirate Bay and many associated websites. This is due to the courts ruling that they actively allowed and supported breach of copyright.\r\n\r\nMy point is this-it is legal for 1 man to buy a DVD, watch it and then allow his friends to borrow it. Yet when this is done online, it is illegal...why? This petition is therefor calling for The Pirate Bay and all similar sites to remain legal and free to use in the UK.",
