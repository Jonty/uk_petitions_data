It causes family brake-ups, server debt, poverty and heath issues.\r\nThe cost to the economy is far greater than smoking, and that\u2019s banned.\r\nGambling is as additive as drugs, alcohol, smoking etc, yet is allowed to be advertised before the watershed timings.\r\nThe way the gambling adverts are contrived are in such a way they make out that the player will win vast amounts of money, be able to go on luxury holidays, pay off debts etc.\r\nMany people will know of, or have heard of some poor soul who that has amassed tens of thousands of pounds of debt through gambling. Have lost their home, families, jobs, friends and more due to the unconscious addiction.\r\n\r\n",
