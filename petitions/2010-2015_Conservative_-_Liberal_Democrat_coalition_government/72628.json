        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call for a review of the treatment of people with Learning Disabilities and Autism in long term sectioning and padded isolation wards - on the death of Stephanie Bincliffe who died at 20 stone in possibly an isolation cell in a private mental hospital after 7yrs treatment. We call for imaginative, creative and person centred treatments to be utilised for the dignified care of these vulnerable individuals to the full. We suggest the development of community based \"expert\" facilities which resource skilled support staff. Huntercombe Group plc (Guy Hands owned) routinely pays minimum wage to many of its staff. At a cost of \u00a34000 per week to tax payer we expect immense care of these vulnerable and ill in our society with skilful solutions to complex behaviours.Stephanie was evidently failed in this way.We call for a change now and justice for Stephanie and others like her.
