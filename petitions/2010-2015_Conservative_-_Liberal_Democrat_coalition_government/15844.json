The solution is not more government and the solution isn't to revert to some form of communist anarchism either.\r\n\r\nAllow human beings freedom to solve their own problems and obtain true happiness through liberty over their bodies and property.\r\n\r\nAbolish all forms of statism such as:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Taxation - Including all forms of coercion and monetary fraud such as inflating a legalised monopoly currency.\r\n\u2022 State Monopolies - Including NHS, state police and infrastructure.\r\n\u2022 Market Distortions - Patents, copyrights, regulations, licensing, subsidies and tax as above. These market distortions aid the corporate aristocracy and harm everyone else.\r\n\u2022 Victimless crimes - It shouldn't be a crime to do anything which does not aggress against others.\r\n\u2022 Compulsion - No more forcing people to do things they do not want to do. Everything must be voluntary.",
