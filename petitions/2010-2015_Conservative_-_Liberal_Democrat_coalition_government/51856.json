        "additional_details": "Presently most banks and financial institutions issue debit/credit cards by default which are \"contactless\" enabled, meaning you pass your card near a receiver to make payments of up to \u00a320 at a time, up to \u00a350 per day or usually 5 transactions per day without any pin verification,  Financial institutions argue this is more convenient and more secure than cash.\r\n\r\nThe system has security issues such as payments being taken without your knowledge or approval.  There is also the possibility of your card details being stolen by anyone who can get close enough to your wallet with the right hardware and software to obtain and decrypt the information.  Consumers are not informed of these risks and are largely forced to use cards which allow anyone with the right equipment, direct access to your funds.\r\n\r\nWe should require financial institutions to not give out contactless cards by default, and require consumers to  opt in to receive them with fully informed of the benefits and risks.",
