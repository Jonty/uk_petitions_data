We, the undersigned, recognise that we already have a Bill of Rights in the UK - the Human Rights Act. This act protects every individual's right to freedom, to be treated equally, and to protection from slavery and torture.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to protect the Human Rights Act and ask them not to water down its contents and restrict these basic rights.\r\n\r\n",
