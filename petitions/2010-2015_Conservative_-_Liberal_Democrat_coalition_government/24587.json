        "additional_details": "If the Pensions Changes offered to Public Sector Workers are so good then the same pensions system should be used by Members of Parliament too. This would give MP's of all parties the opportunity to lead by example and prove that \"We Are All In This Together!\". This should include the increases in Pension Ages for all; Career Average Salary Schemes; MP's pensions linked to CPI instead of RPI; the closing of the current MP's Pension Provision and the opening of the new Provision in line with other Puiblic Sector Services such as the Prison Service.\r\nWe demand that MP's Pension Provision is identical to the pensions they wish to force on the Public Sector. MP's must remember that they are Public Servants too and should be subject to the same rules, laws and benefits as the rest of us! They are not a breed apart.",
