        "additional_details": "I want to petition that more powers are given to bank customers in regards to automated payments from debit and visa cards. For example a company can take a customers bank details for a regular automated payment and if a customer has an issue with the service of the company such as poor service or a scam the customer is virtually powerless to cancel any further payments. I have recently been a victim of this and have had funds taken out of my account and been powerless to stop it as the banks tell me its legal as i gave them the details  How can this be responsible banking practice if people then end up in debt because of these withdrawals and overdraft charges? This is a big issue as i have met many people who experienced this. Please lets raise this issue.",
