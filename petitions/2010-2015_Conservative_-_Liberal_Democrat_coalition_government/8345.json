In the proceeding riots, some areas suffered with fewer officers when they needed them most.\r\n\r\nAny district should be represented as a plaintiff, able to fund action by any means of collection, and compensation should be protected in a special community fund (a la 'The Big Society' / 'Localism') for development & investment.",
