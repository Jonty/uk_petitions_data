        "additional_details": "Every year millions of people wish to become a pilot. Unfortunately, however, due to the high cost involved - which on average is \u00a365,000 for training.\r\n\r\nI believe that pilots should in-fact be classed as students so they can be given student loans and student grants.\r\n\r\nOnce pilots are working they also pay into the system like every other person in every other sector.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, piloting is just for the rich, and this should be changed - especially with the up and coming pilot shortage in the next 10 years.\r\n\r\nWith a student loan, a pilot in training can pay partially from a student loan/grant, and out of their own pocket making it much cheaper. Once a pilot has been given a job, they will pay it back almost immediately due to the fact their starting wage is above \u00a321,000/year - this guarentees the government to get their money back.",
