First declare a six month amnesty for all unregistered addicts to register with a doctor, and providing them all with the Opiates they cannot function without, not substitutes. Whilst announcing that any person caught smuggling, selling or in any way procuring or providing them will face a life term of imprisonment, and assets taken from them to fund their imprisonment. The problem is here and is not going to go away, containment is the key, not fighting it, get rid of the need for it to be smuggled and then what will the point of doing so be. This is not admitting defeat, but will go some way to reducing so much of the strife inflicted on a fair amount of society, shoplifting, burglary's, theft, muggings and a host of other crimes committed against society and the legal minded members of Joe Public who have to bear the cost of it all in so many different ways.
