To do that work must be seen as a better option. I have no problem in ensuring that the nation's population do not go hungry and have shelter, however I am loathe to see taxes pay for alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, gambling, etc. Without cutting how much individuals can receive in benefits, payments could be made in the form of a credit card instead of cash. This card could not be accepted for certain items (as above). Those claiming benefits unnecessarily are more likely to return to work, whereas those claiming legitimately are not disadvantaged by cuts. ",
