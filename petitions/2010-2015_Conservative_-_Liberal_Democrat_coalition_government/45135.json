        "additional_details": "Plans for a high speed railway by 2032 have been given an expected budget of 30 billion pounds. This railway will pass in some places almost parallel to existing lines, destroying countryside, homes and heritage. The funding for this absurd endeavor to reduce journey times would be better spent in other more productive and practical areas of transport. For instance, imagine what a budget of 30 billion could achieve for an update of existing rail lines, the road systems or dare I even mention, renewable energy and eco-friendly transport. If there really is a recession on, let's spend our money wisely! ",
