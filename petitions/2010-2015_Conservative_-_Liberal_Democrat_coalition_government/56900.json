Their burnt out remains have caused death and injuries to livestock and wildlife. In the night sky they have been mistaken for flares and UFO's therefore wasting the valuable time of our coastguards and police.\r\nThey have been banned in other countries we need the same.\r\n\r\nPlease sign 100,000 signatures needed ",
