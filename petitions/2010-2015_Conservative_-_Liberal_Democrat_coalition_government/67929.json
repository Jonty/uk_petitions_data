The laws they have broken within the international court expands so far but yet they brush it under the carpet.\r\n\r\nWe need to see change in this world where we can live in peace no matter what religion or race or creed you are!\r\n\r\nThe killing of innocent civilians and Israel allies just agreeing that they are protecting themselves, just explain how innocent civilians are a threat.\r\n\r\nSign sign sign sign sign this has gone on too far and the British government need to realise this!
