        "additional_details": "I would like to suggest the idea of legalising Prostitution. Seeing as this form of 'business' is one of the oldest in history (and how it does appear to create a sustainable economy in the Netherlands) it seems like a good business idea to debate. Firstly, all the allegations of drugs or vulnerable people (that are associated with prostitution) could be controlled by proper Government Officials. Without wishing to sound heartless, if Prostitution was a legal and accepted type of Employment, more tax revenue would be made, it would create more jobs and the people in these jobs wouldn't be people illegally trafficed from abroad or, as stated, vulnerable people. And would it also lead to less sex offences, maybe? It's certainly worth debating and trialling surely?",
