        "additional_details": "This petition is to stop the work for a new asda store in Telford. Telford is over run with supermarkets and i feel we need more family attraction rather then a new supermarket when the one we already have is OK. If asda wont to expand then they can do it with the one we have already. I would to recommend that we have a water world built to accommodate children and adults of all ages, if not a water world then a sea life centre or a place like hoo farm . this will bring more people to the area crate jobs and will bring in profit.\r\n\r\n ",
