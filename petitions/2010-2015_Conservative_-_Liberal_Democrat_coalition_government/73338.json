        "additional_details": "If you carry out an internet search with, 'X-Factor' and 'money'; it doesn't take an internet genius to access numerous articles on the subject of the nation's favourite TV talent show and it's money making prowess.\r\n\r\nPhone votes, advertising rights and multi million pound record deals culminating in a would-be hopeful that gathers enough interest to frequently grab the Christmas number 1 spot.\r\n\r\nThis mega buck making model can also been seen within the charitable achievements of Comic Relief and Children in Need.\r\n\r\nThe internet has also allowed the crowd sourced funding era to emerge.\r\n\r\nTaking into account the above, my idea is simply as follows:\r\n\r\nCombine the above, proven models into a Crowd sourced Government funding service using TV, advertising and internet campaigns to pursue ideas that will benefit the nation.\r\n\r\nThis is a step towards the way we influence government. Not with protests but with opportunity. Please sign the petition and let's make our future,\r\ntogether.\r\n",
