Conditions are designed to protect local amenity and ensure acceptable development.  Once an unscrupulous developer becomes aware of the failure to enforce or control conditions, then they are able to evade them.  The government should be protecting the rights of neighbours and objectors to schemes where conditions have been imposed to protect amenity.",
