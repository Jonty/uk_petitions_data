        "additional_details": "Off road driving, stunts/wheelies, unnecessary revving, racing any clear run. Gangs of cheap modified scooters that sound like a go-cart racecourse.\r\n\r\nMy Hometown.\r\n\r\nPlanes, Emergency sirens, Refuse collectors appear to make less noise! All are vital.\r\n\r\nEvery time I hear an engine rev loudly I become anxious, heart rate spikes, anger and helplessness, unable to calm down until the noise stops, I\u2019m severely depressed by this issue, my home has become a hell.\r\n\r\nThis issue has become increasingly worse in the last ~3 years, I\u2019d say most offenders don\u2019t realise the harm they are causing, plus sound becomes dulled to them from the back of the vehicle, it travels away from them.\r\n\r\nI want the laws on loud exhaust reformed; Section 59 of the Road Traffic act has some powers, but not enough.\r\n\r\nLegal dBA of public vehicles reduced, i.e. -10 dBA.\r\n\r\nProduction dBA of new cars reduced.\r\n\r\nOn the spot fines for being a nuisance.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s an Environmental Health issues which affects many.",
