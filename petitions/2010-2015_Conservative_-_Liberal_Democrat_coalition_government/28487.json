Yet i know so many people who CHOSE not to work they drive new cars, smoke, go on holidays, to the pub etc.. out of our tax money. These people should have bills and utilities paid but then instead of receiving money receive food vouchers and mabey \u00a310 a week cash (so they can buy clothes) if people cant have luxuries like the pub and holidays they will want to work",
