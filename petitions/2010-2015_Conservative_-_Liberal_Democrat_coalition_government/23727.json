        "additional_details": "During World War 2, millions of Bengalis, then ruled by His Majesty's Government, died of starvation in a man-made famine.\r\nWinston Churchill's contempt for the natives of British India meant that Allied war needs were placed far above the survival needs of the empire's subjects. The exhaustive use of India's resources for the war effort combined with runaway inflation, forced export of grain, scorched-earth policies and inclement weather to create a famine that killed around 3 million. The British War Cabinet failed to send adequate and timely aid, and furthermore turned down offers of food aid from the United States, Australia and Canada.\r\nThe present-day British government must apologise for its predecessor's complicity in the deaths of so many innocent men, women and children.
