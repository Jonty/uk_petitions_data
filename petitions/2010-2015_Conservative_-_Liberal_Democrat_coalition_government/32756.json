        "additional_details": "This e-petition is put in place to remove all EDL protest marches from Britain.\r\n\r\nThe EDL as an organisation are corrupt and provoke wider racial hate opposed to their intentional ambition of stopping radical Islam in the UK. The EDL are provoking hatred between the predominantly white British people and those of Muslim faith. This, in turn has caused Islamic communities to voice protest of their own, leading to conflicts of protests and sometimes violence.\r\n\r\nThe government stands firm to all radically religious beliefs and therefore these groups are not needed here in the UK.
