Current NHS testing and treatment regimes are often inappropriate for chronic lyme disease sufferers, and many patients have to undergo expensive private treatment.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to:\r\n- Increase GP awareness of lyme disease, including chronic forms\r\n- Encourage doctors to follow guidance for the symptomatic diagnosis of lyme disease\r\n- Provide funding to find new methods of testing for lyme disease\r\n- Support the use of long-term antibiotics (one month+) when required for chronic cases\r\n",
