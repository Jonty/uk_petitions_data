        "additional_details": "Bristol - a great city in the South West of England, with great people, great history and a great vibe and culture.\r\n\r\nBut, what's not great? The transport.\r\n\r\nFirst Bus are the main bus operator in the city. Nothing wrong with that, but the fares are the issue. E.g. From North Common to the City Centre (a 7 mile journey), it costs \u00a33.10 for a SINGLE fare ticket. Over the severn bridge in Cardiff, it costs \u00a33 for a DAY ticket.\r\n\r\nWhy should we have to pay such high fares? It's cheaper to travel by car - and because it is, a lot less people are using Bristol's bus service, meaning there are more cars on the road, so there is a lot more congestion, and unreliable bus services for those who use the buses!\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned oppose the bus operators' high fares, and would like to see much more reasonable, and affordable costs to travel.",
