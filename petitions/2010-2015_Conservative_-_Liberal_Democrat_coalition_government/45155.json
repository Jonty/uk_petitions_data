        "additional_details": "The nature of our children is changing. The use of social networking is creating a culture of individuals void of responsibility who believe that freedom of speech is a freedom to harass and intimidate.\r\n\r\nAll under 18's should be held accountable for their posts and actions on social networking sites. As children and young people their parents should have a knowledge of the content that their children are posting into a public forum and therefore should also hold an element of responsibility for their children's actions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo ensure this The use of social media should be charged monthly until the age of 18 unless a parent accepts at sign-up full responsibility for their children's use. If a child signs up without parental knowledge that is not an excuse for the parent.\r\n\r\nI call on the government to implement this monthly charge on all social networking sites for Under 18's except where a parental responsibility form is agreed to.",
