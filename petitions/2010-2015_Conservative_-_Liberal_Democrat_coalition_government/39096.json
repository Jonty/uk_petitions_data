        "additional_details": "Prisoners are put in prison to be punished and to protect the public. Too many prisoners (probably all) are receiving extensive luxuries including free gymnasium access, access to Televisions etc.\r\n\r\nThough these are not actual luxuries and are what most people use anyway, these are luxury for convicted criminals who should be given the absolute most basic cell, food, and healthcare.\r\n\r\nNo prisoners should be able to receive training lessons, or get qualifications (especially not a degree). All prison restaurants should be scrapped (e.g. the Clink restaurant) and prisoners should made to serve their sentence as they did many years ago.\r\n\r\nI call upon people to sign this petition to persuade Her Majesty's Government and Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Justice to review prisons and to scrap all prisons luxuries.
