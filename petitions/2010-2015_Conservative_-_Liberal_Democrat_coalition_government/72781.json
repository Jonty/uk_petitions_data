It is quite possible to feed discreetly whilst in full public view.\r\n\r\nIt really is time to sort this out once and for all. We have all been babies, babies are the future. Their needs  and nurturing, must come before any persons inability to deal with their own immature sensibilities.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, it is in everyone's interests that the baby is fed -  a well fed baby is quiet, content and soon falls asleep causing the minimum disturbance to all around.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
