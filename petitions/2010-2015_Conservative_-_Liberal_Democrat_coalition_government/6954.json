        "additional_details": "I would like the Goverment to make the Law for Succession ofaouncil Tenancies to be changed from one to two. I have looked after my Father who had Cancer and now my Mother who has Alzheimers at their Council property since 2005. I have given up my job and my life and when my Mother passes away i will have to find new accomadation. This is ridiculous since my Parents have lived here since 1985. The Tenancy passed to my Mother on the death of my Father but when she passes away it will no longer pass to me as a succession has already taken place. I think this should change as there must be many British people having to move from a home they have lived in all their lives.",
