        "additional_details": "Distributed Denial of Service Attacks have been used recently by groups such as Anonymous as political protests. The participants are typically voluntary, and have not had their computers hacked into in order to take part. These attacks are seen as illegal. However, they do not steal any information, have a limited duration and serve mainly to attract attention to a cause. In this way the attacks are the online version of street protests. We call on the government to treat this form of attack as the street protest of the internet age, and not to prosecute those who take part in them.",
