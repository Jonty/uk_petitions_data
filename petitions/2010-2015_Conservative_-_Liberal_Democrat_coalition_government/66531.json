        "additional_details": "Take 1 is a long established community organisation set up as a registered charity based in Radford, Nottingham. We offer a variety of projects, courses and training programmes for disadvantaged young people and adults.\r\n\r\nTake 1 was previously based in a large warehouse. Facilities included 4 large classrooms, a training hair salon, barbershop, gym, dance/fitness studios, 2 recording studios, reception area, 5 offices and a large roller skating area.\r\n\r\nWhen the recession hit we made the difficult decision to downsize and move to our current building on Radford Road. This meant that we could no longer provide all of the services we did previously.\r\n\r\nWe are currently in negotiations with the local authority to find suitable premises. Please help us by signing our petition in support of us acquiring a suitable premises so we can continue to provide a variety of services.   ",
