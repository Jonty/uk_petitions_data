        "additional_details": "The current legislation is not wide enough to catch all those that fall outside of the existing legislation's remit.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the legislation, as it stands currently, allows for rampant nepotism to affect recruitment for jobs and housing; medial treatment, education, and many other issues which clearly hold back the greatest number in our society in favour of a powerful minority. We hope for real change not mere tokenism.\r\n\r\nIt would be considered a huge step towards equality in today's society and an even greater step towards civilisation, progress and redistribution of wealth because the way things are at the moment, really ought to be consigned to our history bin!",
