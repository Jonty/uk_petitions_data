        "additional_details": "There is no reference or allusion in the Koran to women wearing a niqab.\r\nHistorically, the veiling of the face was practised by many cultures before Islam and scholars say the adoption of its practice by Muslims was part of fitting into the society. Although the majority of scholars agree that hijab is obligatory, only a minority of them say that the niqab is.\r\nThe Government should refer to and respect the dominant interpretations of the Koranic Dress code for women and like other European countries, ban the Niqab.\r\nThis petition requests that the governments legislates to ban the Niqab as a minority religious practice that is not recognised by the majority of Islamic scholars and has nothing to do with Islam.",
