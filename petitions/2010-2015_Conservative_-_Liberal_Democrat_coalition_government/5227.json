        "additional_details": "Hgv drivers are amongst the most highly trained drivers on the road today. On a single lane highway hgv have to abide by a 40mph speed limit.\r\nI believe this increases the risk of accidents due to cars being able to do 60mph on the same road and frustration causing the car driver to take risky overtaking decision\r\nNo signs would need to be changed.\r\nI believe a speed limit of 50mph would be more suitable for the situation. This would be a maximum speed, truck drivers drive according to the environment unlike the newly trained car driver who believes that they must do 60mph at all times whilst on these roads. ",
