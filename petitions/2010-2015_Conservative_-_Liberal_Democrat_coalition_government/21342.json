In countries like Germany if you need medical assistance you still need E111 or equivalent and then you only get basic care and not full medical treatment. At the moment there are too many people from all over the world that look at the NHS as free medical treatment that has resulted in so call health tourism. Paying for medical insurance is not expensive everyone does it when they go on holiday to other countries, so by none UK Nationals having to pay for Medical Insurance would supply the NHS with a well needed source of income which in turn could not only save them money but help provide the necessary Doctors, Nurses and equipment.
