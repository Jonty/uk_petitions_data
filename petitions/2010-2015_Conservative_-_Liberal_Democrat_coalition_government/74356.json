        "additional_details": "Current shortage chef occupation eligibility requirements state; restaurant offering a takeaway service not eligible to recruit chefs from outside the EU. These chefs are a much needed talent from outside the EU. Ineligibility is damaging international Cuisine Sector. E.g. 80 seat restaurant, prime business serving customers in restaurant, wants to optimise sales, offers a takeaway service, the chef will still be cooking a customised meal. NOT ELIGIBLE.
