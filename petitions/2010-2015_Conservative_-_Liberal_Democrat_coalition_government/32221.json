        "additional_details": "In this era of dire economic difficulty, not just in Britain but across the world, it is imperative that the United Kingdom has a Chancellor who devotes every working hour to the nation's economic recovery.\r\n\r\nIt has been reported that the current Chancellor is currently responsible for his party's political strategy; a huge undertaking that in previous governments would have been done by the party chairman on a full-time basis.\r\n\r\nWe call for the Prime Minister to absolve his Chancellor of these responsibilities, or else appoint a new Chancellor, as we need one who is relentlessly focused on the British economy.",
