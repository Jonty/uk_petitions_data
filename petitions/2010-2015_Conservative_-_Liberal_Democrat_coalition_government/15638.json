        "additional_details": "The government should allow a degree of risk exposure to retail banking customers which should be no more than between 8-10% of their deposited amount, as customers' awareness of risk would help encourage better stewardship by executives in the bank and more prudent usage/selection of financial products by customers.  The current situation encourages a laissez-faire attitude to risk, as the tax payer is seen as the safety net for any savings, etc. ",
