At present Mp's seem to spend no money whatsoever on life's essentials like petrol, housing, travel and food. Many reclaim what they spend on expenses leaving the public with the bill. Mp's would make better politician if they paid for everything out of they own pockets and the public would have a lot more respect and trust for them.\r\n\r\n",
