        "additional_details": "Drinking of alcoholic beverages on the streets, in public parks and alike is becoming a huge problem for the UK.  Many children are participating and the police appear to have very little power to stop this activity.  I believe the police should have the powers required to enable them to prevent this type of activity.\r\n\r\nThe current law means that someone has to be seen to be a nuisance before the police can act.  This is a ridiculous law and I propose that under no circumstances should the drinking of alcoholic beverages in a non-licensed public place be allowed.\r\n\r\nIf this were to become law it would enable the police to crack down on this activity and in doing so prevent a great deal of anti-social behavior crimes from taking place.",
