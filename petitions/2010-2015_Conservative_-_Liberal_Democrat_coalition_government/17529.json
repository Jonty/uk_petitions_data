        "additional_details": "The UK population has increased by 3.1 million people between 2001 and 2010 and is estimated to exceed 70 million by 2026.   This puts pressure on housing, schools, hospitals, transport systems and natural resources including food and water.  It also means there will be more waste and pollution.  This petition calls on the government to introduce measures to stablise the UK population including providing incentives to people to have smaller families and capping immigration, including immigration from the EU.",
