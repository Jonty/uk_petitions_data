        "additional_details": "Since the Child Support Agency has been in existence it has been repeatedly the source of much controversy including reports that it costs more to run than it collects in maintenance.\r\n\r\nOne of my main concerns related to the power and authority that this one agency possesses and the huge negative impact that this can have on families. The CSA, a civil service, investigates, adjudicates and then enforces its own decisions. Are these people the right people to make such rulings?\r\n\r\nI believe that child maintenance decisions should be made by the family courts where the complete situation of the family, history and financial concerns can be fully considered independently. The CSA\u2019s role should be focussed on facilitation of private agreements and enforcement of payments if and when required.\r\n\r\nRemove the power and decision making from the CSA.\r\n",
