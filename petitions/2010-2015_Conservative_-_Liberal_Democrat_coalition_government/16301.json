Government should not impose harsh visa rules and  abolish PSW scheme for non-EU international students just because of the misuse of PSW route by very small minority of bogus colleges/students. however, there should be additional safeguards to be emended to ensure fair usage and prevent misuse of the system.\r\n2. The Post study work visa route for international students should continue beyond April, 2011, however government should clampdown on bogus colleges and students who come to UK for immigration purposes\r\n3. There should be a debate as to why the government is  discriminating private colleges in favour of publicly funded colleges/universities by emending new changes in current visa rules which makes students studying at private colleges unable to work from June, 2010 onwards ",
