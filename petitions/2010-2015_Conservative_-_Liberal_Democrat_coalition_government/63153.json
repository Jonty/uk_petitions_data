        "action": "MERCEDES LAW: Refer young women below the cervical screening age for colposcopy",
        "additional_details": "Mercedes died of cervical cancer aged 23 years. She was too young for cervical screening but could of been referred for a colposcopy.\r\nMercedes was denied referral for colposcopy & or gynaecology. It has been found that had she been referred Mercedes outcome would of been very different.\r\nA coposcopy is a harmless diagnostic test that can determine STRAIGHT AWAY the presence of abnormal cells in the cervix.\r\nTreatment can also be given at the same time if abnormal cells are found. A biopsy can also be taken if deemed necessary.\r\nA colposcopy counteracts any argument re the 'false positives' of cervical screening in under 25 year old women.\r\nHelp save lives & severe debilitation of young women by signing this petition.\r\nWe need over a 100,000 signatures asap.\r\nThank you.\r\nSandra (Mercedes mum).
