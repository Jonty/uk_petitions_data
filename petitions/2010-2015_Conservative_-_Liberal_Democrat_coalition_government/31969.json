        "additional_details": "As a nation we feel David Cameron's decisions about how this country should be run are unfair and the consequences it has on the people of the Uk are not seriously thought through, but instead are based on an idea of how things should be. David Cameron needs to live a week in the life of an everyday middle class working citizen to see the real effect his decision making and his continuation to increase costs has had on this country. If you agree that the prime minister is seriously out of touch with the real daily lifestyle of the Uk then sign this petition to encourage him to come and see it from our point of view. Lets help him to understand how many of us are struggling since he and his party have come into power. We don't want handouts, just a fair deal. Stop putting costs up and let us afford to live again!!",
