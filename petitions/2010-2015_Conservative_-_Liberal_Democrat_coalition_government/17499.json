        "additional_details": "Since time immemorial, BBC Sports Personality of the Year has been a Great British institution on a Sunday evening leading up to Christmas.  It is considered by some to be as vital a part of the Yuletide festivities as mulled wine or Jesus.  This year, without consulting the License Fee payers, Auntie has inexplicably decided to broadcast this flagship show on a Thursday evening.  The Government should force the BBC to move the broadcast to an appropriate Sunday evening.  If not, the BBC will doubtless continue its quest to spoil Christmas.",
