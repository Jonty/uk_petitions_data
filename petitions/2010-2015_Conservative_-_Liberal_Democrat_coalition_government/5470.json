        "additional_details": "Have I Got New For You is one of the greatest ever television programmes, possibly even the very best. For two decades in has provided supreme entertainment as well as a comprehensive breakdown of the week's news.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's best days are behind it. Despite Paul Merton's assertion that Angus's job was merely 'reading out loud' a huge amount of guest presenters have come and gone, categorically failing to replace him. No-one else can deliver the lines from the autocue with such snide charisma.\r\n\r\nThe chemistry shared by Deayton and his two team captains was laced with a mutual distrust and malicious resentment providing genuine tension. This is a petition which demands the Department for Culture, Media and Sport intervene for the good of the country.",
