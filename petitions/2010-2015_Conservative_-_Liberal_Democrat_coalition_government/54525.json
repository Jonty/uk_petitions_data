        "additional_details": "I thing there should be a 'tolerance' of Cannabis in our country and society. You can not hide that Cannabis plays a part in people's lives and society and despite whether it is legal or illegal will not change the amount of Cannabis usage in the UK, the only sensible decision the government should apply is to introduce a 'tolerance' policy, this way the government can finally go to peace with the fact that Cannabis has been used in the UK for many years and many years to come despite legality or illegality, other than the government prosecuting people for Cannabis possession and usage and growing, the government should tolerate small amounts of cannabis and cannabis usage in people's homes.",
