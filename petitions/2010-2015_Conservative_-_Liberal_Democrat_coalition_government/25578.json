The financial crisis has been met with no response of regulation or taxation from the government.\r\n\r\nThere should be limitation to the amount of donations received and the amount of advertising spent for any candidate and party.\r\n\r\nParties should be transparent, and individuals should be allowed access to the same advertising methods and scale of budgets.\r\n",
