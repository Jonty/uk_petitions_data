        "additional_details": " Please I want UK government. to revolutionize the single parenthood and youth motherhood state benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n During my research I discover that many broken homes were false. One spouse intentionally want to become a single parents in order to qualify for whopper sate allowance.\r\n\r\n During my research I discover the innocent parent end up in the hospital e.g. stroke or mental health. The NHS could had save the money spent on treatment of stroke and mental health worth's about \u00a34billion P/A.\r\n\r\n Therefore I made a suggestion that the right to divorce under MCA 1973 and separation is a civil right, but the right to claim state benefits should be conditionalize, under two factors  Necessities and Circumstances. The exceptions were If one spouse is residing in abroad, If one spouse is dead, and If one spouse is mentally ill, severe sickness or disable.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
