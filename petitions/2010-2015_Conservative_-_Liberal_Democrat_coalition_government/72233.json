        "additional_details": "With the recent changes in road tax, an issue now exists at the time a vehicle changes hands, resulting in a vehicle effectively being taxed twice for the month in which the transfer takes place. ie the seller losing the balance of the month and the new owner having to tax from the start of that month.\r\n\r\nConsidering that all vehicle records are computerised and online, is it unreasonable for charges to be calculated at a daily rate?\r\n\r\nAs most payments are issued automatically this should not in reality incur any extra great expense to set up and is, quite clearly, the fairest solution.\r\n\r\nThe current charging system could easily continue for transactions not completed online - which potentially would encourage customers to move to online transactions which should result in saving overall costs.",
