        "additional_details": "Reduce the VAT rate to 5% or lower on products used for retrofitting homes in order to kick-start the UK building sector, related businesses and community social enterprises into upgrading our homes, to lower emissions and to meet UK Climate Change Act targets.\r\nVAT needs to be reduced on insulation, and other products required for retrofit. Doing so will stimulate a massive drive to employ people fixing our homes for 2050 and will also make the Green Deal more effective.",
