This would promote healthy exercise, reduce school run congestion, give wheelchair users greater independence, and allow greater employment mobility in areas where public transport is limited. These should not be routes that are shared between pedestrians/cyclists AND motorists if at all possible, except where that is the most efficient and most direct route. ",
