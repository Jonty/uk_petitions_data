        "additional_details": "Saab was originally a division of Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolaget (English: Swedish Airplane Limited), which had been created in 1937 in Link\u00f6ping. The company had been established in 1937 for the express purpose of building aircraft for the Swedish Air Force to protect the country's neutrality as Europe moved closer to war. As the war drew towards a close and the market for fighter planes evaporated, the company began looking for new markets in which to diversify.\r\n\r\nSAAB Automobile has been around for years and has pleased so many. People who buy Saab cars tend to hold on to them, why because they're great. Save SAAB from bankruptcy, allow business funding to support the popular small Swedish car manufacturer. Long live SAAB!",
