        "additional_details": "In 2003 at Qarmat Ali, Iraq, members of 26 Squadron RAF Regiment were exposed to Sodium Dichromate, a carcinogenic compound at a Water Treatment Facility. The site was under the restoration by KBR Haliburton and Force Protection was provided by members of 26 Squadron and units of the United States National Guard.\r\n\r\n  In a report in September last year by the Inspector General of the US Army, it was discovered Sodium Dichromate was at the facility and had been used there for decades since the plant was built, and used as a rust inhibitor.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Air Force has refused to acknowledge the truth and fact that the compound was at the site and now many serving and former members of the Squadron are falling ill with conditions related to exposure to Sodium Dichromate.\r\n\r\nWe ask the MoD to release the facts about the plant and that the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency acknowledge Sodium Dichromate Poisoning and Pensionable.",
