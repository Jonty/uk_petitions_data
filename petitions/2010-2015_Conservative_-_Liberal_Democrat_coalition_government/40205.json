If the murder was pre-meditated or the offender has committed more than once. If the murder is not due to self defence but is more of a sadistic murder.\r\nHowever if the murder is due to manslaughter e.g car accident or self defence then it is questionable and the defendant should be sentenced to prison.\r\nDeath penalty should be given to those with life sentences or undecided sentences.",
