People in Zimbabwe have for years been killed, brutaly beaten and starved under Mugabe and his henchmen. Voting is blatently rigged, and the government totally corrupt, yet the world stands back and watches. I call on the British Government to take the lead and take action against this brutal dictator and remove him from power and allow the Zimbabwe people to regain their dignity and freedom under a democratic government.",
