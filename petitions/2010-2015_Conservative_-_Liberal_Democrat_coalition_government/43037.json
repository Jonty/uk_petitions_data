        "additional_details": "On June 5th 2012, The Queen's Diamond Jubilee provided many Britons with a day off work, dedicated to celebrating the Royal Family and Great Britian itself. The countries of GB united with garden parties, celebrations, fetes, and festivals. National pride and community spirit was at its highest in years.\r\n\r\nWe want to keep this feeling of reignitied patriotism at the forefront of our minds. We want to come together once a year to celebrate what it is to be British.\r\n\r\nWe would like a new Autumn Bank Holiday, giving the public a morale boost as the days become shorter and the temperature begins to cool, and a chance to celebrate Great Britain. This would fall on the first Monday of October.",
