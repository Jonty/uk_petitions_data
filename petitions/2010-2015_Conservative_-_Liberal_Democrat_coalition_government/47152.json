        "action": "Abandon guidelines on the importation of excise goods and introduce limits",
        "additional_details": "The common market allows for unlimited importation of excise goods for personal use. The importation of huge quantities of cigarettes, tobacco and alcohol is no doubt damaging to the economy whether for personal or commercial purposes. It also means there is a lot of ambiguity for both legitimate shoppers, bootleggers and authorities and creates unrest and rebellion against law enforcement officers.\r\nI petition the Government to abandon guidelines and introduce a sensible limit on the importation of excise goods. For example 3kg tobacco, 3000 cigarettes, 50 bottles of wine, etc. Then if people have more than that, they have committed a categorical and absolute offence, just the same as when travelling from outside the EU.",
