When they tried again (With the recommended changes) they were once again refused. After two years, they put up the solar panels without permission and nothing was said.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to undergo two operations. Firstly, I would like them to make it easier to install solar panels, and other sustainable energy systems by telling councils to make changes to their planning permissions. Also, I would like to see the price of solar panels to reduce, so that poor families have a better chance of escaping energy poverty.",
