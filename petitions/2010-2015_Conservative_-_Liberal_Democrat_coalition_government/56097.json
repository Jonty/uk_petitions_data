The current system is expensive, unreliable, and cuts off those who cannot afford to pay over \u00a320 for a weeks worth of television that is Free to Air.\r\n\r\nMany people have access to the Internet and television via mobile phones and tablets, but even in cities the fabric of the building is such that in all but the beds next to windows, patients receive poor or no signal.\r\n\r\nIn this age where successive governments have called for super fast broadband to be rolled out countrywide, they are  neglecting those in most need.\r\n\r\nI call on the government to scrap the current system and introduce free television ( for free to air channels) and a free broadband connection for each hospital bed.
