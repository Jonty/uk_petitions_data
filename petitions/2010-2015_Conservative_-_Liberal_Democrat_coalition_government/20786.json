        "additional_details": "The Lack of literacy and number recognition from children leaving school in the uk is poor, I think that programs like Sesame Street are an important learning tool for Children to gain number knowledge and also to start learning the Alphabet.  Sesame street is shown all over the world and is a fun way to learn, In the UK, one of the only countries in the developed world not to show this.  I think it should be added to the Public Service part of the Licences given to Broadcasters or even as part of the Licence Fee for the BBC channels",
