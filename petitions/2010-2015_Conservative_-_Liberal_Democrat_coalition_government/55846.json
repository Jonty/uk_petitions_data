        "additional_details": "I am 15, and for the past few years, my friends and I have been thoroughly looking forward to driving at the age of 17. We have been counting down the days in fact. Just over a year to go, and this week we saw on the news the government plans to move the minimum driving age from 17 to 18. We were instantly devastated.\r\n\r\nIn the past week there has been lots of speculation in the press about new driving laws coming into place relating to teenagers having to be 18 before they can get their drivers license.\r\n\r\nMany young drivers are stereotyped as being 'dangerous, fast and un careful', when the actual fact is people 80 and older are involved in 5.5 times as many fatal crashes per mile driven as middle-\u00adaged drivers.\r\n\r\nAll I want is for the government to keep the age at 17. The thought of waiting until 18 to drive is awful, I and every other teen wants freedom.\r\nSTOP STEREOTYPING AND trust teens! Thank you.\r\n",
