        "additional_details": "Following the introduction of the coalition government, cuts were made across the board to schemes such as the Future Jobs Fund and consequently, youth umemployment in 16-24 year olds are at record-breaking lows. Numbers of those claiming working age benefits doubled in the 7 months following it's eradication. While we understand the importance of tackling the financial global crisis, we believe that cutting the Future Jobs Fund has rendered the youth of this country unable to find long-time employment. The fund made important support available to young people across the country as well as providing a sustained workforce for employees. The re-introduction of the Future Jobs Fund will be cheaper in the long-run than retraining staff and paying benefits to those who are unable to reach their true, working potential.",
