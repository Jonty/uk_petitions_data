        "additional_details": "The Hammersmith Flyover closure is intolerable and the result of mismanagement and benign neglect over a long period of time.\r\nThe effects of corrosion in reinforced and pre-stressed concrete structures are both well-known and documented. There are suggestions that salt was used to de-ice the surface rather than in-built heating that was inoperable and/or expensive to run thus exacerbating corrosion.  The regular and methodical inspection and maintenance of critical infrastructure is crucial to the nation and irrespective of the economic climate, any systemic failings in this area require immediate and effective attention.  Remarks like \u2018just leave an extra hour for your journey\u2019 fail to measure and expose the reality and true magnitude of the impacts in terms of disruption, additional pollution and costs that extend far beyond the borough boundaries.  I think we need public inquiry.\r\n",
