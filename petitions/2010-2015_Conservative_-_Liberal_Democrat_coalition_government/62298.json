        "additional_details": "In 1975, a referendum was held on whether or not Britain should join the EEC, to which the public voted 'yes'. Since then, various governments of different stripes, without any reference to the public, have dragged Britain deeper and deeper into the EU, which is a vastly different organisation from the EEC. I call upon the government of this country to give the people their say, and hold a straight in/out referendum on EU membership immediately, not in some fictional future where the conservatives have an overall majority",
