        "additional_details": "In England, Planning Policy Statement 25 defines the functional floodplain by the 1 in 100 year storm event, whilst Scotland\u2019s SPP uses the more onerous 1 in 200 year event.\r\n\r\nHaving flood modelled numerous UK watercourses over many years as a professional civil engineer I have concluded that; in the majority of cases, there is a significant difference in flood level and floodplain extents between these two events.\r\n\r\nTherefore, English flood risk guidance should be amended to the 1 in 200 year level to provide a longer term solution to flooding and greater protection for homes, schools and infrastructure.\r\n",
