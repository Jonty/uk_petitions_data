        "additional_details": "Postgraduate international students from all disciplines are a great asset to the UK economy and have the potential to drive innovation and intellectual breakthroughs in this country.\r\n\r\nHowever, this asset is being wasted with the current visa rules which denies international students the right to stay and work in the UK after their graduation.\r\n\r\nInternational students who want to work in the UK, must get an employer who is willing to offer them full-time job roles, and sponsor them for their Tier 2 visa - which is incredibly hard-. However, companies are shying away from offering students such jobs in the first place due to their concerns about the visa status, and the current rules that forbids them to employ anyone who doesnt have the right to work full-time in the UK (which includes international students).\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are requesting for a change in UK visa rules with regards to postgraduate international students, and allow them to stay and work in the UK after graduation",
