Did you want cuts? DO you want to live in a world like ours?\r\n\r\nThis is a call for a completely clear government.\r\n\r\nIts very simple why do we live in a world where the people who dictate our lives conceal so many facts, figures, conferences , massive financial agreements?\r\n\r\n1. Full transparency in all government activity.\r\n\r\n2. In 2007, 147 companies controlled nearly 40 percent of the monetary value of all transnational corporations.. You defiantly don't forget to tax us so why do you them?\r\n\r\n3. Talk to the PEOPLE of the country and stop guestimating.\r\n\r\n4. When people protest is for a reason, don't evict them listen to them.. They are the people of the country and that is them putting across there vote.\r\n\r\n5. CHANGE.\r\n\r\nSign this and spread the word so this doesn't fall upon deaf ears..\r\n\r\nAppreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
