        "additional_details": "This petition's aim is to get the Government to add more funding into research for treatments and cures for all asbestos related illnesses such as mesothelioma. In 2012 2,429 people died from mesothelioma alone, not including any other asbestos related illnesses, and this number is set to peak around 2017-2018.\r\n\r\nI believe more could be done and should be done to prevent people suffering from these diseases which could have been so easily prevented in the first place.",
