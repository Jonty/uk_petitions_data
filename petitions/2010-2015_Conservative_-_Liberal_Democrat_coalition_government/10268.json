        "additional_details": "For all 17 to 20 year olds who are not in full time education or work I propose that those people should be given a national service period consisting of a 10 week basic training package, for those who fail a system of back classing until they do pass. on completion of this the best are given the opportunity to join the armed forces the rest then go to community service work. This does several things provides work for those currently claiming benefits, improves the fitness of the youth, provides a team of community workers increasing local pride, and gives our youth some discipline. it would also give some of our ex forces personel work in training those youths it would reduce the benefits bill and provide more money in the form of tax. I want the government to debate this idea and to consider asking the population of the uk about this idea",
