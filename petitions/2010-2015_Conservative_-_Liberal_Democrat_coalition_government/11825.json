        "additional_details": "We should all have the right to protest peacefully, without our protest being highjacked by anarchists. Therefore we must have a law that protects our protests from these anarchists. This law will means everyone in the protests must wear a white, hoodless top. They must not wear anything around their necks or over their face. White tops are a contrast to the traditional black clothing of the anarchists. And since their necks and heads are exposed, it is easy for the police to take clear, recognizable pictures of anyone involved in violence. Anyone disobeying this law would be quickly arrested by the police, with assistance from the protesters who would recognize there is someone who could potentially hijack their protest. This would make protests more effective, as well as tackle the problems with anarchists.",
