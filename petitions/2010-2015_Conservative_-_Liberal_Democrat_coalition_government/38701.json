        "additional_details": "HM GOV UK must immediately legislate to isolate and incarcerate all pedophiles, past and present, permanently from society in order to protect all children - the rights of our children must come first and foremost. The pedophile gave up their human rights when they gave up their humanity in preying upon children with what can only be descibed as insane sexual violence towards a child. They cannot be rehabiliated as they are not meerly ill or only need help - they are irreparably damaged and HM GOV UK and the public at large must acknowledge this fact immediately and take action to insure the children are protected from these monsters at all times for the benfit of all society; there is a very strong pressing social need to enact such legislation.",
