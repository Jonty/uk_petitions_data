        "additional_details": "How many times have you been refused something that you really wanted? How about having something refused that you needed and could've saved your life? Too many young women are dying from Cervical Cancer because the NHS are failing to give smear tests to those under 25. Every single morning I read that another young beautiful woman has lost her life due to this horrific disease. There are over 100 different types of Cancer and this one seems to be most common lately. Sign this petition and get the smear test age lowered! Save our girls in this country too.",
