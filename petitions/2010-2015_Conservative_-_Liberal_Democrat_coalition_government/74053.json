Many other examples could be found, I'm sure.\r\n\r\nAncient laws should be harmonised between Scotland and the rest of the UK to enable greater and freer investment from south to north.\r\n\r\nWe want the Government to open up discussion about greater unification of services, and operation to build a more United Kingdom.  Savings can then contribute to reducing the National Deficit.",
