        "additional_details": "I think it is wrong for someone to get Police to back them up in religious matters. It is like forcing someone to change their belief.\r\nThe Police told me to accept I was forgiven even though my friend did not want to reconcile.\r\nMy beliefs (as a Jehovah's Witness) told me that Jehovah will not let her get away with this. But the Police said I may be arrested if I contacted her again. She and the Police may now be liable for Armageddon destruction. They also think this MY fault.\r\nI think my friend's Church just did not like her being friends with a JW (see?).\r\nSo the Police need to stay out of what is not their business. Surely they have got better things to do than argue with Christians.   ",
