        "additional_details": "\r\nAs commuters we are subjected to heavily overcrowded unreliable services yet we still face year on year above inflation price rises (25% on some Southeastern fares in 2 years) whilst most of face a salary freeze despite rising inflation. We are told that it is unfair for the tax payer to subsidise or train fares yet in reality the commuters are subsidising the off peak fares as if the commuter services were run in their own right they generate huge profits. I would like the government to ensure that train fares are frozen for at least 2 years.\r\n",
