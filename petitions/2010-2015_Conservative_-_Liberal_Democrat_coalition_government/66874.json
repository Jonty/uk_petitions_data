The coffee is sourced from Civet cats in Indonesia who essentially digest the coffee beans and excrete them which was once an rare occurrence but, once farmers saw its profit potential have now started farming the animals in appalling conditions causing them to get zoochosis which can be fatal.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to ban the import of this coffee as not only is it ostentatious, but also cruel and unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIt's time to cut the Crap!",
