        "additional_details": "Instead of dealing with the problem of anti social drunken  behaviour by imposing heavy fines and making the people responsible pay for medical treatment etc. the Government is punishing everybody by proposing an illegal and totally unfair fixing of a minimum price for alcohol. It is no part of Government responsibility to interfere and dictate to sensible law abiding people how much they should drink and introduce pricing laws which punish the least well off in society. This policy must be dropped.",
