Even if there is a coalition government.\r\n\r\nWhen the current government formed a coalition in order to be in power, both have selectively used the argument that neither party is bound to their manifestos because no party had the majority vote.\r\nIf a coalition government is formed then a secondary vote should be given to the voters upon which they select a 50/50 split of each of the parties manifesto pledges.\r\nIf this cannot be agreed to then the general election should be held again until there is a majority vote for one party.",
