        "additional_details": "No Confidence vote added to all ballot papers, whether a Local or General election. If 10% of the turn out place a No Confidence vote then that election is void and new policies/candidates have to be put forward for that seat. In a General election if 10% of the seats return a No Confidence vote then the election has to be re-run.\r\n\r\nThis would hopefully promote a greater voter turn out and make all parties more accountable to the electorate.\r\n\r\nA lot of policies and indeed MP's are out of touch with the people's views. This is an attempt to address this and encourage more people to vote and to stop people having to pick the best of a bad bunch.",
