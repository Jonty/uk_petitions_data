        "additional_details": "Due to the inevitability of the introduction of benefit-smart cards for the unemployed which will only be used to purchase necessities like food and fuel, it will be necessary to ensure that they are given access to free broadband (not necessarily cable TV) in their own home, and free gynmasium passes at council-run gyms and sport centres. For many unemployed people having broadband access in their own home environment staves off boredom, creates opportunities, and improves social networking. Having access to sports facilities ensures optimum health and staves off boredom, and it could also lead to career opportunities as well as improving one's character.",
