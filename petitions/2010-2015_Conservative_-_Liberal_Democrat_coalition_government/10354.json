        "additional_details": "A petition to the Government to resume National Service for youths convicted of crime. In the light of the London and regional riots, and subsequent looting, it has become apparent that a number of younger members of our society (both male and female) have a blatant disregard for our communities and property, plus a total lack of respect for anything but themselves. By reintroducing National Service, any youth convicted of a serious anti-social crime (or repeat offender) will be conscripted to the Armed Forces for a minimum period of two years. Not only will the offender learn both respect and discipline, they will also (and importantly) be in a position to take advantage of many career enhancing opportunities that our exceptional forces have to offer.",
