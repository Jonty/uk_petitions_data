But, at the same time our electeds are using some of the money taken from us in taxes to pay for THEIR exclusive membership and use of a gymnasium.  That facility needs to be extended to everybody so that they can get HMRC to pay their membership at a local facility so they can enjoy the same taxpayer funded gymnasium access as that taken by our elected dishonourables.",
