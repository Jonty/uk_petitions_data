        "additional_details": "Make it straightforward in helping a victim of Medical negligence, and not a minefield that only assists the negligent  surgeon/doctor and Medical profession.\r\nThis culture of insurance help for a negligent practitioner is far to harsh on any one individual who's life is ruined by too many medics who continue after blunders made by them. 1 life destroyed by wrong operation is 1 too many. Yet Many doctors may continue undisturbed by too many blundered ops. The victim usually is tarnished for ever by a legal case doomed to fail, almost never the negligent doctor all because they have the power of their profession.",
