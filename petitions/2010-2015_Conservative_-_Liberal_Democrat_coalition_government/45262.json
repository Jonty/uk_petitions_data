        "action": "End the misuse of statistics when deciding on education policy.",
        "additional_details": "Over recent months the Department of Education have been rightly criticised over current education policy. Currently, there are issues over GCSE English grading; the accuracy and discriminatory effect that school league tables have, and the replacement of the GCSE with a qualification that dates back to the early 1980s.\r\n\r\nThese policies appear to be a result of the misuse of statistics when determining government policy. Using statistics out of context is not only careless \u2013 since standards of Maths is a hot topic in the department, yet appear to be un-versed in statistics \u2013 but it also produces very poor policy outcomes that act to the detriment of those students, teachers and academic institutions that are affected by them.\r\n\r\nThis petition requests that this practice ends immediately and that the use of statistics, when deciding or justifying policies within the Department of Education, are put in their rightful context.\r\n",
