It produces inferior meat, raises questions of animal welfare and has negative impacts on world food production and the environment.\r\nFeed-lot systems are rare in Europe but are starting to make some impact.\r\nConsumers need to be able to identify such beef in the supermarket in order to make informed decisions.\r\nDemand adequate food labeling measures to make this possible.",
