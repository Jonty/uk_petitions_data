        "additional_details": "This petition is to address the issue of voter fatigue. If you like me are unimpressed and feel disenfranchised with the feeling of career politicians and hollow electoral promises which you feel are not kept, then I am suggesting we get to know the real politicians without the spin and political games and allow them to go in to the Big Brother House for three weeks as part of the 2015 and future electoral campaigns. This would allow us to see the true nature and character of the politicians who are running the United Kingdom and give the British public the right to judge for themselves if they are worthy of a place in government.",
