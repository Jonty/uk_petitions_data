This will give them more transferable skills when they are applying for jobs, looks good on a CV and should save money when budgets are being cut as these placements would be cheaper than hiring new staff.\r\n\r\nIf they do not want to take a placement, then they do not want to work and should not get Jobseekers Allowance.",
