        "additional_details": "MPs are set to receive an 11% pay rise when a parliamentary watchdog publishes its final recommendations on salaries this week.\r\n\r\nThe rise is due after the 2015 general election and will take pay to \u00a374,000.\r\n\r\nAll three party leaders disagreed with the rise when it was first proposed.\r\n\r\nHowever Ipsa does not need to get the agreement of Parliament to bring in the changes.\r\n\r\nThe pay rise for MPs is expected to cost the public purse \u00a34.6m.\r\n\r\nIpsa was created by Parliament in the wake of the MPs' expenses scandal in 2009.\r\n\r\nA Downing street spokeswoman said MPs' pay was \"a matter for Ipsa\", but added: \"The government has submitted its views to Ipsa as part of the body's consultation on MPs' pay.\"\r\n\r\nAs austerity measures are continually being tightened, following the Autumn Statement, it is ethically and morally wrong for MP's to receive such an obsurd rise in their pay, whilst the public they're employed to represent are experiencing the opposite.",
