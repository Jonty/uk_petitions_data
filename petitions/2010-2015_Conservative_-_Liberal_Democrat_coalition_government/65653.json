        "additional_details": "I beleive that Emergency Life Support (ELS) skills, such as recognising signs of a Heart Attack & what to do, what to do in event of a cardiac arrest (CPR & AED), the recovery position, etc. should be taught to all school pupils.  Imagine every school leaver with such skills. Now imagine if YOU had a cardiac arrest. There is a STRONG chance one of those pupils would be near-by to support your life until professional help arrived. Such skills could, and would, save lives.\r\n\r\nThe skills can take as little as 2 hours to teach. So in 2 hours we could teach the skills that could & will save lives, what more vital skill could our children learn at school? And why is it not already a legal requirement to teach these skills at school?\r\n\r\nI ask the government to make it a requirement that all pupils are taught Emergency Life support skills.",
