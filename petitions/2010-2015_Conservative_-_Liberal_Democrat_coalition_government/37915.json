        "additional_details": "It is without a doubt a reality and necessity for certain MPs to have access to a place of residence in London to allow them to conduct their parliamentary business successfully.\r\n\r\nHowever, It is time that a solution is found in regards to MP's second homes that they buy in London using tax payer\u2019s money and then benefitting financially from such arrangements.\r\n\r\nI suggest, and ask you to sign up to it, that the UK Parliament build/buy an apartment complex which is large enough to house all MP's entitled to a second home. Each MP will be loaned a small apartment large enough to live comfortably and work from and which is then transferred over to their successor when they leave Parliament or lose an election. The taxpayer remains the owner of the property and not the individual MP.\r\n\r\nIf individual MPs, who can afford it, wish to buy their own property in London with their own money, that is their right.\r\n",
