        "additional_details": "This e-petition is in support of the notion of a None of the Above vote or scratch vote. The none of the above vote would offer the opportunity for people to indicate discontent at the candidates on offer in the voting system, with many of the parties at this time seen as inadequate by voters. I believe that the implementation of a none of the above vote or a scratch vote would improve voter turnout and allow parties to recognise that voters are not \"lazy\" but see the current parties on offer as unappealing. It would also allow previously would-be voters to legitimise their views as no longer would the question as to why they think they should have a say in government when they did vote be asked.",
