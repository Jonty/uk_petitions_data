My 14 yr old nephew bough some from a shop in Brighton, gave them to my 16 yr old nephew, who took them and was rushed to hospital in an ambulance foaming at the mouth! In leeds a stall holder was successfully prosecuted for selling legal highs to a 16yr old boy, he was only given a conditional discharge! Surely this is negligent and causing harm to children? Harsher punishments are needed and to be banned!",
