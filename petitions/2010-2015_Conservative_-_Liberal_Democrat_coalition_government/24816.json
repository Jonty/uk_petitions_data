        "additional_details": "While it is pertinent in a time of austerity, to raise taxes to pay off the country's debts, it is not pertinent to do so when it is damaging British businesses and the British economy. The current rates of APD put airlines in the United Kingdom at a severe disadvantage with their EU counterparts, that's not good for British airlines or for the economy. I am calling on the Treasury to either abolish this travel tax or significantly reduce it ,before it does irreparable damage to the UK airline industry and to the wider economy.",
