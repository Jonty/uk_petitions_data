In practise, the UK is condoning and financing a practise it has itself banned which is hypocritical. I implore the UK government to illegalise the importing of foie gras products in the UK.GIVE THE BRITISH PEOPLE A VOICE!\r\n\r\nFrom the RSPCA http://www.rspca.org.uk/allaboutanimals/farm/poultry/ducks/keyissues\r\n",
