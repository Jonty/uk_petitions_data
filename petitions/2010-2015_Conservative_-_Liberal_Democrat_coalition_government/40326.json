        "additional_details": "Every year, a ridiculous quantity of food is thrown away, purely because it is the \"wrong\" size, or shape for supermarkets. This is unfair to the farmers, and also to the environment, as huge amounts of energy are put into the production of this food, which is pointless if the food is then rejected.\r\nQuite simply, I would like the government to either impose restrictions on the amount of produce that supermarkets are allowed to waste, or create a code of practice detailing the reasons that supermarkets can reject food, which does not concern size or shape.",
