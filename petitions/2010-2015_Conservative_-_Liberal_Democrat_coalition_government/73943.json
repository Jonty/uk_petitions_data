        "additional_details": "For a whole month, we have been watching the news as minority religions like Christians, Sikhs and Muslims have been victimised by Hindu extremists. Innocent civilians have been forced to convert to Hinduism or face a brutal murder by mobs. Narendra Modi is a part of the RSS organisation which continues to terrorise non-Hindu believers.\r\n\r\nIndia has a well written constitution for the protection of all the citizens of India. The constitution clearly defines from articles 25 to 30, the freedom of faith to worship, to organise activities, to promote faith, and maintain culture of faith.\r\n\r\nThe British Asian Christian Council is working with all Christians, Sikhs and Muslims to raise awareness and voice this issue.\r\n\r\nWe want the British government to raise awareness to the Indian government allowing minority religions to have freedom of speech and faith and most importantly, protection from these violent attacks.",
