These inter-related factors are having a worrying impact on how care is delivered to patients.  GPs are fire-fighting to provide services their patients need.\r\nGPs care about the current situation and support the British Medical Association's call for all politicians to understand the urgent need for long term, sustainable investment in GP services.  This will help to attract, retain and expand the number of GPs; expand the number of practice staff; and improve the premises that GP services are provided from.\r\nPlease show your support.",
