There is already an option for people to take a secular oath, and those of other faiths are able to swear on their own holy texts, therefore there is no need to abolish the Bible Oath.\r\n\r\nRather than scrap the Bible Oath it is more important that we prosecute those who lie in court under oath, which will reaffirm the importance of taking oath.\r\n",
