Namely to make all sex outside of marriage between one man and one woman illegal.\r\n\r\nThe vile gay marriage act and equality acts should be repealed and it should be made quite clear that any sexual activity outside of marriage as defined in the bible will not be tolerated.\r\n\r\nIn practice this means outlawing the following:-\r\n\r\nCasual sex\r\nCo-habitation between a man and a woman\r\nAdultery\r\nHomosexuality\r\nLesbianism\r\nSingle parents (except due to the death of the spouse)\r\n\r\nThis will have an effect of strengthening the family and helping to end poverty, crime, heartbreak and children robbed of their childhood be a broken home.",
