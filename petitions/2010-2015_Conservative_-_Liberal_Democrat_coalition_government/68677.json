        "additional_details": "We petition for the removal of the OBE from Ann Gloag, and barring her from any future honours nominations.\r\n\r\nAnn Gloag used her father's redundancy money to found Stagecoach, a company which has received valuable local authority concessions by seriously and despicably undercutting rival bus companies (including her late husband's).\r\n\r\nOn 29th November 2013, Gloag took ownership of Manston Airport (Kent), for the nominal fee of \u00a31.  Despite assurances to staff of long-term investment in the airport, she announced consultation for closure in April 2014, finally closing it on 15th May, with the direct loss of 144 jobs.  Her management team is now asset-stripping the site in preparation for a non-aviation future.\r\n\r\nShe attempts to cover her unsavoury business tactics with \u201cphilanthropy\u201d through her charity, The Gloag Foundation, which is why she received her honour.  The people of Kent, however, are evidently not as easily fooled as the Cabinet Office when money is involved.",
