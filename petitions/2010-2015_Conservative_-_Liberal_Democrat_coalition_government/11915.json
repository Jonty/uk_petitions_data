The result seems to be prison sentences for many found guilty of burglary, etc. and as received public support.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition requests public reviews and eventual realignment of the whole justice system to once again make the punishment fit the crime during \"normal\" times. Stop using sentencing to manage prison populations, but to once again deter offending! ",
