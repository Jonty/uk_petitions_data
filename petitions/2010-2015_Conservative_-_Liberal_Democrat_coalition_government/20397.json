        "additional_details": "I am a low income earner and believe that eye tests and a basic selection of frames should be provided on the National Health Service to people on either low incomes or to all people. If people want extras such as more expensive frames or tints they should pay extra. However basic lenses and frames should be on the NHS to all ages or people should recieve money off. It is cheaper to go blind in this country, and we live in a developed country where people cannot see, because they cannot afford an eye test. Eye tests are important for discovery of brain tumors and other disorders.",
