        "additional_details": "New printers are forcing consumers to replace ink when the cartridge/toner is not empty.\r\n\r\nPrinters are not able to determine that a cartridge/toner is empty, instead it uses a formula to work it out.\r\n\r\nYears ago printers would continue to work when the ink started to run out and it was up to the consumer to decide when to change the ink. People quite often content to have faded ink.\r\n\r\nTonnes of ink cartridges/toners are being thrown away before their end of life. I propose that printers should warn the consumer of low ink but not force a replacement, and should never stop the printer from functioning due to low ink.\r\n\r\nI can understand equipment forcing a replacement when there is a health and safety issue, that does not apply here.\r\n\r\nManufacturers will argue that the quality of the output will degrade, which is true but that should be my choice.  When the printer reports that the ink is out, it stops, which forces consumers to have 'spares', this is unfair and expensive.",
