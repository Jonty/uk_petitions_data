Like a photo id card(like the proof of age cards & also a similar method of how you get these by filling form & having an authority figure and vet to sign it)with picture of animal & owner and some details &/or make microchips in animals lawful & also the fact that they DO PROVE OWNERSHIP unlike at the moment where they do not & make it so they can be used in court by law to get a lost or stolen animal back to its rightful owner & upon sale or other means of giving up the rights of ownership or first time ownership that the new owner must register with a governing body.Like selling a car & changing details on DVLA. & that all persons,sanctuaries,rescue centre\u2019s as well as sales markets & pet stores selling live pets must scan an animal within 7 days of when it comes into their care.Because like me & my horse. One day your pets might go missing & when you find them you might not be able to get them back because someone failed to scan & check.",
