        "additional_details": "The government should stop the DVLA selling our vehicle information to private parking companies (PPC's) like Civil Enforcement Ltd who fine motorists with extortionate fee's (\u00a345 fee within 14 days or \u00a390 after) and threaten you with debt collectors and further fee\u2019s.\r\n\r\nCompanies such as Athena ANPR and ParkingEye are robbing the motorist with fee's and are solely profit based organisations! Helping the UK debt figure rise and getting the public into unjustified debt!\r\n\r\nFurther to this, DVLA could be encouraging theft by selling the location of some rare and desirable vehicles.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and share with family and friends.",
