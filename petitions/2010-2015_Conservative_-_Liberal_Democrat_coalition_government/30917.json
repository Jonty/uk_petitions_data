When the occupant leaves the company realises they need to charge someone. They look up credit reference agencies or the land registry to take a guess at who owns the debt and where they live.\r\n\r\nAfter they let loose the debt collector, the burden of proof is on the falsely accused. If this agency doesn't get the money, it gets refered to another. This cycle can continue for years with no recourse.",
