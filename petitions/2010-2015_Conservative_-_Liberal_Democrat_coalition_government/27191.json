This act, by which the lands of the Exeter dukedom fell into the hands of the duke\u2019s ex-wife, her lover and his ex- brother-in-law  was about enrichment.\r\nHenry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, descendant of Edward1, was a plausible heir to the throne, He was drowned at sea on the return trip from France with the King, some say, on the Kings orders.\r\nJohn Holland 1st Duke of Exeter was executed for trying to save the King on orders of Bolingbrook who imprisoned and starved to death Holland\u2019s half brother Richard11. . Boling brook called himself HENRY IV and the murders were ignored by parliament.\r\n",
