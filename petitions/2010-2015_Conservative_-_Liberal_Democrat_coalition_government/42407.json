        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the Government to call a debate on a vote of No Confidence in the incumbent Secretary of State for Work And Pensions, the Rt Hon Iain Duncan Smith MP.\r\n\r\nMr Duncan Smith has presided over a disastrous set of welfare reforms, punishing the ill and disabled whilst demonising claimants.  His Department is responsible for the disastrous implementation of the Work Programme which the DWP's own figures have proven to be a failure.\r\n\r\nWe therefore call on this motion of No Confidence be put before Parliament at the earliest opportunity.",
