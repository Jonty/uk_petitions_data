        "additional_details": "Faith schools' admissions policy should be amended so that they cannot disciminate against children of different faiths. School admissions policies that discriminate on religion amount to a religious apartheid. Children of non believers effectively do not qualify for such a good education, and in many cases local schools.\r\n\r\nNon believers are encouraged to go to church to get their kids in to the best state schools - which is a milder version of the crusades.\r\n\r\n Non Believers should at least be offered a tax rebate as right now they pay for schools that will not accept their children. Hindus and Muslims can set up their own schools of course, but does this country really want to encourage such religious segregation, especially at such a young age?\r\n\r\n",
