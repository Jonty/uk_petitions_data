        "additional_details": "In adult films, also watched by children, and children's comics, war is glamourised, in whatever era they are set. Violence is portrayed as acceptable and normal. The real horror's of war, the real injuries and mutilations, the real deaths are sanitised, and made to seem heroic. Children grow up with a false impression of war. Such war comics should be banned and if people must make war films, they should show the true horrors of war.",
