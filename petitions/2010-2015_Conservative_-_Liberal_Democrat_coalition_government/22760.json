This has potentially allowed terror suspects, murderers, rapists and other major threats into the country. Her position needs to reviewed by the government, I am not asking her to resign but we need to get the facts and if it seems that she is at fault she needs to look at her position of being in control of our borders. She has a major role on what goes on in the U.K and we need someone that we can trust in that position. As well as borders she also let us down with her response to the summer riots. Her position is in need of an urgent review!",
