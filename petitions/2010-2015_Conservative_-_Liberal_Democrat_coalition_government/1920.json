        "additional_details": "The current EU regulations on free movement between borders are having a massive detrimental effect on the UK.This applies to many areas of life but probably the area feeling the most pressure is on employment.There are currently approximately 2.5 million people in the UK who are unemployed,bearing in mind that there have been approximately 1 million people who have come in to the UK since border controls were dropped then it seems a fairly logical conclusion that had there not been this influx then the current number of people unemployed would drop considerably.This would have many beneficial effects to our economy not least,even if only 500,000 jobs were freed up,there could 500,000 more people paying taxes and the same number taken off the benefits system.There should be a debate in the house on this at the very least and a subsequent referendum so the country can decide what is best for us.Ultimately a referendum on EU membership should also take place.",
