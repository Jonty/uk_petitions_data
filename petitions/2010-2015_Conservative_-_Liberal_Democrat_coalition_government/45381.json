MP's should not be allowed to recieve \u00a350 expenses for an item that could be purchased at a fraction of the price in everyday stores and markets.\r\n\r\nMP's Should not have the right to simply go into Harrods, Marks & Spencer's etc simply because they normally purchase their goods there, if the item is to be reclaimed then it should be bought at the cheapest place regardless of circumstances.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to introduce legislation preventing claims for items that have been purchased in a Brand Named Store when similar items are available cheaper elsewhere.",
