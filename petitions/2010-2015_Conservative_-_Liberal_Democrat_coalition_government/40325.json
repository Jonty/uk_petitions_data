        "additional_details": "London and Cornwall are very different but, to my mind, truly complementary. It is astonishing that virtually no motorway exists between them. The most direct route (the A303 and A30) is inadequate and, in parts, dangerous. Also astonishing is how the people who live along this route have managed, decade after decade, to put up with heavy traffic on their doorstep. Building motorway between London and Falmouth (possibly by linking the M3 and M5 and extending the M5) would have considerable benefits for London and Cornwall, enhance the A303 and A30, and improve access to Exeter (and numerous other places).",
