        "additional_details": "I think that anyone that is born outside of the UK should not be allowed free heath care, unless both father and mother are from the UK or the person is in the army.\r\nI think that foreigners should have to pay a tax to the goverment to alow them to have health care (round about \u00a3200-\u00a3500 per year) this way it will help stop cuts being made to the NHS and inprove the heath care that we get, im not saying health care is poor but when ever i go to the hospital all staff members are fighting a losing battle because of cut back to the amount of staff they have ect\r\nthis would be great help to the NHS so please please sign it ",
