        "additional_details": "Industrialists and politicians have recently said that a shortage in engineering skills is slowing the UK's economic recovery. Many companies are struggling to fill all of their job posts with people who have to required technical skills.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to the UK government that all professional engineers (who have completed an engineering degree) are allowed to use the pre-nominal \"Er.\" in their name. The hope is that it will add some prestige to the career and make it more attractive to school children. Furthermore I hope it will generate some discussion about the career and increase the knowledge people have on it.\r\n\r\nI believe it would be a step in the right direction towards increasing the interest in the career and hopefully the number of school children pursuing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
