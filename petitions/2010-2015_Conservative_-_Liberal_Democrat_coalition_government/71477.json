        "additional_details": "50,000 people identified as accessing child porn sites will go unpunished because the legal system has not got the resources. If there is not enough room in the prosecution service or court time, use the evidence from internet service providers. The threat alone will dissuade potential users. If there is no market for the product then hopefully less will be produced saving some children from such a life destroying experience. Accessing paedophile sites for more than a prescribed time period will result in an automatic gaol sentence. Make the law !!!",
