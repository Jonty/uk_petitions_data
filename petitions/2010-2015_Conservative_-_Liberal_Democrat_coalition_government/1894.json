More awareness to be raised around issues beginning to concern our country (Obesity, drugs, alcoholism, petty crime) within these clubs.\r\n\r\nMore training to those working with the children to spot signs of abuse earlier (any and all types), and more training so that more can be done to assist in the event that a child is being abused.\r\n\r\nThe more work put into the clubs and ultimately, the children, at the beginning of their lives the lower the cost to soceity when they grow up.\r\n\r\nPetitions to bring back the death penalty are becoming increasingly more common - It's been proven time and time again that the death penalty does NOT reduce crime.\r\n\r\nRoot causes of crime need to be tackled. Children and teenagers need to be kept off the streets because they're too busy attending youth groups, sport clubs, and other active, cheap and free ways of exercising and educating their minds.\r\n\r\nThis applies to several Departments!",
