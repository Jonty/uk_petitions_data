Each person's livelyhood is already severely restricted, and this potoentially could effect their pension rights in later life.\r\nThe unpredicable nature of long term chronic fluctuating conditions such as ME/CFS amongst many others can only be exacerbated by the continuing stress of financial hardship.\r\nWe also ask for a comprehensive overhaul of the Welfare Benefit medical assessment process, paying heed to the vast number of complaints already in your posession.",
