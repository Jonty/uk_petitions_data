        "additional_details": "VAT impacts on those who are on low pay and old age pensioners, much more than those people who are on much larger incomes.\r\nAs an example, an old age pensioner on the basic pension of 95.00\u00a3 per week, who fills up their car with 40\u00a3 worth of petrol, has to pay 8.00\u00a3 vat. This represents 8.4% of their income.\r\nOn the other hand a person such as footballer who can earn between 130,000.00\u00a3 to 400,000.00\u00a3 per week, and fills up with the same amount of petrol. The VAT value represents 0.0062% of his salary, (based on the low end of the salary range)\r\nThis means the pensioner is paying 8.4/0.0062 = 1355 times more VAT than the footballer.\r\nThis is grossly unfair to pensioners and also to low paid workers and strongly recommend that the government abolish VAT.\r\n I would strongly recommend that all persons sign this petition (except perhaps rich people such as company directors and politicians who benefit from this type of tax)\r\n",
