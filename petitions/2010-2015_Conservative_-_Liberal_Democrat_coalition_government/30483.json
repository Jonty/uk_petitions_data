This petition is aimed at reducing the number of immigrants who come to the UK who see the free health care as one of the main reasons they wish to live here.  This should also be applied to diplomats families, who should be made to pay for any treatment and not be allowed this free.\r\nOur NHS is struggling for funds - we the, the taxpayers, have now to demand what is done with our money, and we should be demanding that this hole in the NHS wall is plugged to stop the draining of OUR money.",
