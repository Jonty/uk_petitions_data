        "additional_details": "We want to ensure innovative therapies get to brain tumour patients as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nThis could be achieved through the following initiatives:\r\n\r\nEarly Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS): This could help move towards precision medicines to treat the rarest conditions where patients are willing to take higher risks with experimental drugs and there are no viable treatment options.\r\n\r\nAdaptive pathways (also known as adaptive licensing):  An approach that would license drugs earlier than currently happens, while continuing to assess the effects of the drug after the licence has been granted.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the Government to:\r\n\r\n- Properly resource the EAMS to ensure that brain tumour patients have access to drugs with the potential for efficacy;\r\n\r\n- Support the adaptive pathways approach to improve the efficiency of the drug development process, following the pilot by the European Medicines Agency.\r\n",
