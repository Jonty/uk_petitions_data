        "additional_details": "The government has clearly need to sort this issue out. Most people that have to contact the dwp are usually on benefits and live on very limited income. To call the dwp you have to generally ring an 0845 number . But to most on benefits cannot afford a landline so we either have to take a very inconvenient trip to the job centre,some of these people suffer from mental health problems or are disabled and do not have the luxury of going there. The point i'm raising is that we have to result in using mobile phones. this cost considerably more especially the long waiting times. I've seen post on the internet of over \u00a315 charged for calling a department that is ment to be there to help. Bring back a landline number we could call or talk to the networks so that mobiles could use there  minutes to call ",
