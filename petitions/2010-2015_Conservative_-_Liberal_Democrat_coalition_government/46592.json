        "additional_details": "AS a reformed ex-bank robber I am grieved by the \"Two Tear\" Legal system we now live in today. THE LAW must be CHANGED so that the Bankers will never again have the power to fraudulently manipulate the Banking System on a \"Grand Mega Scale\", without fear of a Custodial sentence.\r\n\r\nI robbed a bank in 1985 for which I went to \"Crown Court\" due to the fact that the amount of money was over \u00a32000.\r\nThe public money \"Used\" & \"Lost\" in what can only be described \"Mega-Fraud & deception from the top down by all in the industry they must be made accountable under the LAW.\r\nEach PPI claim has the amount involved & a traceable paper trail of evidence case by case.\r\nACTION Wanted:-\r\n1. I hear by demand that the two levels of law which now exist be CHANGED to a one LAW for ALL.\r\nThe law does not see \"White Collar Crime\" by \"The Banking Industry, WHY?\r\n2. Crime is Crime they should do time.\r\nI want to see BANKERS in prision.",
