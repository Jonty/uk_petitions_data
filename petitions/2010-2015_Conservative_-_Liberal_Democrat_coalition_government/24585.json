        "additional_details": "In 2008 the actions of the banks almost resulted in the collapse of the financial sector and, indeed, the UK economy.  This resulted in several banks being rescued at the expense of the taxpayer, and has led to massive cuts being imposed upon the public sector while the institutions which caused these problems have got away with their almost criminal behaviour.  We the undersigned call upon HM Treasury to properly tax banks, their profits and their transactions, to make this sector pay for the problems it caused.\r\n\r\nThe British public do not deserve to be made to pay for the mistakes of the banks with higher taxation, runaway inflation, and real-terms pay cuts while the banks continue to enjoy huge profits and obscene salaries and bonuses.  The banks must be made to pay for the damage they have done and we, the sovereign people of the United Kingdom, call for this issue to be taken seriously by HM Government.",
