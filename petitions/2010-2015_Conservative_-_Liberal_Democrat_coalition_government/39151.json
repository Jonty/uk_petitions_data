        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, propose a new law to prevent tax evaders and avoiders from sitting in either the House of Lords or the House of Commons to the effect that: \"No person may sit in either the houses of Commons or Lords if they either do not pay tax in full, at all proper and correct stated UK rates on all occasions, or if they make use of tax havens or other avoidance schemes in going about their business and/or have done so within 20 years previous to any such occurrence.\"\r\n\r\nWe believe and democratically assert that no MP can possibly make a realistic claim to representing the interests of either their constituents or their nation if they actively seek to avoid making the contribution to it required and expected of them.",
