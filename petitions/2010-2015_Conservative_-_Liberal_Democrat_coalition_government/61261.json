Compare and deliver the findings to the residents of the communities that have destroyed via a clear and honest medium.\r\nFollowing the investigation, decide whether or not the Environment Agency should be held accountable for the extreme conditions experienced downstream of the Relief System and also review capacity and flow prediction data relating to the channels design and installation to assess whether or not it is fit for purpose in its current configuration.",
