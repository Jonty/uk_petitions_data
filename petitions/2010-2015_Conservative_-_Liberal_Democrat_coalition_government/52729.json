Today a decision was made to scrap the Liverpool Care Pathway because it causes exactly what it was set up to prevent, but it will be phased out over the next 12 months.  Why so long? How many more people are to be subjected to the horrible death the Pathway causes (which is the very reason it is to be scrapped!) over the 12 months it takes to shut it down.  Grow some balls, elected dishonourables, shut it down now, today.",
