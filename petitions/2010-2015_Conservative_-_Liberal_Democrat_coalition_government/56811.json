        "additional_details": "Recall of BMW MINI's built between 2001-2007 for replacement of power steering mechanism.\r\nVOSA has already set precedence for a recall by recalling other manufacturers vehicles, in each case they do not state that loss of power steering is dangerous they do quote \"that the driver may experience a loss of power steering\". Yet they do not recall the MINI for the same reason?\r\nThe recall should be for cars upto 13 years of age and with up to 150,000 miles, this is the same parimeters as set out in there offer of good will made in the USA.\r\nThe driver owner of the vehicle should not expect to pay any costs including those of diagnostics nor for the power steering fluid as they would have to remove this before taking out the existing unit and replacing it with a new one.\r\nWe need your support now.\r\n",
