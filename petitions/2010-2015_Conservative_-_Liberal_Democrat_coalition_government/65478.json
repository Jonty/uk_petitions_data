        "additional_details": "I'm making this petition in hope that others are as frustrated as i am with the levels of injustice that bouncers for nightclubs show when allowing people in.\r\n\r\nThere judgement is merely based on appearance and especially on race issues. This is an act of institutional racism and it is just accepted without intervention or repercussions.\r\n\r\nThey also turn down groups of males who are seeking to only celebrate a good time. Yet they seem to share this belief that males will be animalistic or violent this is judgement based on only accusations not proof and is dehumanisation and sexism.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you agree or can atleast relate.\r\n\r\nThank you",
