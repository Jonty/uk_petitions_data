        "additional_details": "Google has a growing monopoly on the capture, processing and storage of user data from a variety of sources (Search Engine, Android Operating System, Google Street etc) their recent acquisitions such as the Nest purchase are intended to broaden that scope. As we know Google heavily harvest the data they can acquire generally because users have to opt out of the collection (rather than opt in)\r\n\r\nAs such they have a monopoly position on data that is never considered by the various regulators that are in place to ensure that anti competitive behavior does not take place.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to debate this and change Monopoly/Anti Competitive legislation to deal with the issue.",
