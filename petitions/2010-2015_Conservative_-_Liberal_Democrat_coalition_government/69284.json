        "additional_details": "Parts of Britain's largest hill fort are being destroyed by quarrying that's been sanctioned by Somerset County Council, the Government and English Heritage despite being a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Local Nature Reserve and it's a Country Park. Even with three layers of protection it's being 'Legally' destroyed. The Ham Stone being quarried is for the upkeep of Ham Stone built buildings but is being used for many other purposes. I want the government to stop the destruction of this ancient monument.",
