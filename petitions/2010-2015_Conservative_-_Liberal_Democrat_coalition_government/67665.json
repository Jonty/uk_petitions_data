        "additional_details": "This e-petition is in honour of Scott Davis, who was fatally stabbed in 2001 whilst out celebrating a friends birthday. Scott's murder was the UK's first CCTV conviction. His killer received a 10 year prison sentence.\r\n\r\nA campaign was started by Scott's sister, Lucy, and friend Donna Williams called 'knives cost lives' in 2006 with local newspaper Reading Evening Post & local MP Rob Wilson. A petition for tougher sentences in knife crime was handed to 10 Downing Street in 2007 with over 3000 signatures. In June 2014 a new law was passed to convict people carrying knives for the 2nd time and we would like this law to become known as Scott's Law to see justice for knife crime and feel it will honour Scott's legacy.
