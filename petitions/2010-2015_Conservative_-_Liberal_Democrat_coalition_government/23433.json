        "additional_details": "We urge the Government to change the current policy of using wind turbines to generate electricity in  Britain.  Last year, the Crown Estate, which owns almost all of the seabed off Britain's 7,700-mile coastline, approved an increase in the number of offshore wind farm sites.  Within 10 years, Britain's 436 offshore turbines will increase to 7,000 - all subsidised by all electricity consumers.  It is an open secret that both onshore and offshore wind turbines will neither meet their design output nor the Government's 32% target for the provision of electricity from sustainable sources.
