        "additional_details": "A recent UN Report has highlighted the atrocious human rights abuses currently, and historically, carried out by the North Korean government against it's citizens.\r\n\r\nMen, Women, Children, entire families are sentenced without trial to a life of hard labour in internment camps for such simple acts as questioning the government, watching a South Korean soap opera, or even singing foreign pop songs to themselves.\r\n\r\nThese camps have been described as beyond hell, where prisoners are routinely tortured or murdered for not following the rules.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that up to 200,000 people are currently being held for life in these camps, many for crimes that distant family members have been accused of committing.\r\n\r\nThe crimes committed by the government against it's people have been likened to the holocaust, we have to act to end this abuse.\r\n\r\nWe, the people, ask the UK Government to petition the UN to ensure that action is taken to liberate the people of North Korea.",
