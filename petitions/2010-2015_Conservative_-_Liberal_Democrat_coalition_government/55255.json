        "additional_details": "The government talk of a legacy after the Olympics, but the Don valley in Sheffield is being closed, for the sake of about 800K a year running costs.  The stadium cost about \u00a330 million to build and is still being paid for.  This stadium could be used for much more than athletics and could pay its own way.  Only the Olympics venue in London is a better stadium.  I call on the government to prevent the closure of the stadium and invest in sport in Sheffield.  ",
