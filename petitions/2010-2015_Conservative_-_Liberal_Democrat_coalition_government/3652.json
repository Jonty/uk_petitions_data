        "additional_details": "Limit the size of out population by measures on immigration and on controlling the birth rate. Stop the influx of dependents of migrant workers.  Impose extra taxes on the fathers of large families to pay for the extra resources needed for their children.  A levelling off or reduction in the population would ease the pressure on many resources such as housing, fuel, water , health and education provision.  People being asked to work longer will fill the supposed gaps in the workforce  and we can organise effectively  to manage a reducing population.  The right to reproduce at an excessive rate is not viable and is an anti-social act in the context of being a member of a civilised society, given the current state of the world's resources. A constant rise in population  does not have to be inevitable if we take a sensible, mature approach. ",
