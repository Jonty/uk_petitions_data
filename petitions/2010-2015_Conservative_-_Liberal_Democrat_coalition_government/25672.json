        "additional_details": "The Government plans to cut in half a vital benefit for low income and out of work families with disabled children.  This cut will not take the overall benefit bill down, but will increase child poverty amongst families with disabled children.\r\n\r\nAs you know, families with disabled children are more likely to live in poverty due to higher costs. These costs are particularly high at this time of year as many families with disabled children are forced to keep their heating on 24 hours a day and have to drive everywhere in icy conditions.\r\n\r\nDue to these extra costs any cuts are felt especially hard.  Your Government is proposing that within the Universal Credit, Disability Additions will be 50% lower than their current rate. This means a cut of \u00a31400 per year. I cannot understand why you would target unnecessary cuts at the lowest income families with disabled children. Please give some good news to disabled children this Christmas and think again about this policy.",
