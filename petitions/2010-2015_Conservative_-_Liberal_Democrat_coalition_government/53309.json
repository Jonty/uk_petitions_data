In August 2012, 1600 people were detained pending deportation over a single weekend.\r\n\r\nNow it has become an excuse to systematically round up and imprison transgendered 'undesirables', drug users, and prostitutes - who are furthermore being forcibly tested for HIV and publicly humiliated.\r\n\r\nThese camps hold up to three detainees per square meter, a twelfth of the right that prisoners have to four square meters each. These people live in squalor, their children have been abandoned, and prisoners regularly attempt suicide rather than remain in 'Greece's Guantanamo'.\r\n\r\nWe want the British Government to publicly condemn this breach of people's basic rights and put pressure on Greece to stop Operation Xenios Zeus",
