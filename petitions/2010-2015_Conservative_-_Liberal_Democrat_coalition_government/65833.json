They appear on just about any show who is desperate enough for them, and with the endless repeats  over all the channels It makes them even more annoying. They make me hate stuff. And I know that TV would be a nicer and much more entertaining place without them. And if this has any success I'm going to petition against the one show. Please sign and lets rid UK broadcasting of a trilogy of mediocrity. ",
