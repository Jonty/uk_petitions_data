        "additional_details": "After the terrible incidents near Chelmsford in Essex which almost killed at least two people this week, I feel it is absolutely essential that all bridges, road and footpath, that pass over A-Roads, B-Roads, Motorways & Dual Carriageways are enclosed with a steel cage to prevent concrete blocks, stones, bricks and other missiles from being dropped onto passing vehicles. This simple action will potentially prevent many injuries and save lives.",
