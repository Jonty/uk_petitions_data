        "additional_details": "Currently, I think that the way car taxation is dermined is based on the emissions of a car, yet old vehicles constructed before 1 January 1973 (historic vehicles) some having appauling emissions enjoy freedom of motoring Tax Free....\r\n\r\nAlot of these historic vehicles are second cars to some people and only get brought out on a sunny days and the same applies peoples 2nd vehicles that aren't pre 1973, and low usage primary cars.\r\n\r\nMy Suggestion is to have a nominal low fee \"base rate car tax\" for all the emissions categories, and the rest of road tax gets added onto the price of fuel (based on an average yearly usage - i.e Tax Band L - \u00a3460 divided into average milage per year, and this value added to the price of fuel) so that the more your vehicle gets used, the more you should be made to pay...... therefore somebody that does 100,000 miles a year should have to pay more tax via fuel in the ratio to usage than somebody that only goes 1,000 miles a year.",
