        "additional_details": "Small businesses make up the largest portion of businesses in the UK, and only approximately 122 thousand of these make under \u00a3500k per year. Growing a company past this mark can make a significant difference to employment and innovation.\r\n\r\nThe current 20% tax rate is hinderance to this growth and can hugely restrict a small companies ability to grow, especially in the service sector which is an area of growth for the UK.\r\n\r\nReducing the corporation tax to 10% could allow these companies to reinvest in the business, employ more staff and create a more sustainable cash position. All good for economic growth.\r\n\r\n",
