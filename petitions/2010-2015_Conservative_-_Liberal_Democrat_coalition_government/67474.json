This agreement was struck as the Tanzanian government was close to agreeing to the destruction of its stockpile following campaigning from groups in Tanzania.\r\nWould preserving the economic value of the tusks contribute to fighting poaching and the illegal ivory trade particularly as the conditions that the estimated 34,000 tusks are currently kept under means the tusks naturally deteriorate and loss value.\r\nTanzania at the London Conference did not ask for help in storing and preserving its ivory stockpile but has asked for help in recruiting, training and equipping rangers to fight poachers.\r\nWould money being set aside to preserve tusks be better used supporting rangers in the field?",
