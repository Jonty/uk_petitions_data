        "action": "Review and modernisation of Civil Disorder legislation and creation of a Civil Disorder Taskforce",
        "additional_details": "Incidents of Civil Disorder and Rioting are becoming more common in our society and the resulting social breakdown is harming our economy and communities. The actions of those causing this disorder result in misery, suffering, injury, and in extreme cases death to law abiding innocent human beings. The mindless actions of those involved also result in massive amounts of financial loss to individuals, businesses, and the public purse.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the government to review existing legislation such as Public Order Act and to transform it into a modernised legislation capable of dealing with this plague of anti-social and base behaviour in our communities. It also calls upon the government to create a Civil Disorder Taskforce that can be deployed in addition to the police to respond to serious incidents of Civil Disorder with specialist anti-riot training and equipment.",
