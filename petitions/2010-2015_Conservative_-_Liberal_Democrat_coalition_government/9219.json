        "additional_details": "The recent riots show a profound lack of respect for authority.\r\n\r\nThe problem starts in schools with a system too willing to make excuses,and too unwilling to punish.\r\n\r\nPupils swear at teachers, start fights in class and even physically attack teachers - all with feeble punishment.\r\n\r\nThey fail to get an education, disrupt the learning of others and make schools an increasingly dangerous place.\r\n\r\nThe softly-softly approach has been proven beyond all doubt to fail -  it's time to change\r\n\r\nThe government should ensure:\r\n\r\n1. Any pupil who swears at a teacher to face harsh punishment.\r\n\r\n2. Any pupil who physically attacks a teacher to be prosecuted\r\n\r\n3. The most disruptive and dangerous pupils to be taken out of mainstream education and sent to special institutions - keeping them in a normal school is a risk to the safety and education of others.\r\n\r\n4. Removal of the apologists within the education system who protect pupils from the consequences of their actions.",
