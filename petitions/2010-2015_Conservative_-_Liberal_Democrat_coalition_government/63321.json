        "additional_details": "The newly-proposed Welsh rules to ban e-cigarettes indoors do not go far enough. Children must be insulated from any knowledge that nicotine exists or that some dirty, disgusting people like to inhale burning plant matter. All nicotine products are used soley by those with degenerate minds, and so all nicotine products must be treated equally.\r\n\r\nIn order to make smoking as socially unacceptable as it should be, the government must make it illegal to use any nicotine product anywhere that has a roof that children might be under, or anywhere within 500m of a school. Anyone chewing nicotine gum must go outside for the duration of the gum, and anyone wearing a nicotine patch must stay outside all day.",
