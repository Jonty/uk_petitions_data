        "additional_details": "I believe Secondary Schools in the United Kingdom should open later in the morning because of the hormonal changes during puberty. What effect that has on education, I hear you ask. Well, research has proved that on school nights, students perform less during the day if they fail to get 7-9 hours sleep, effectively making them \"teenage zombies\" as scientists call then. In fact ~20% of students actually get 7 hours or more sleep on school nights. Research also says that sleep deprivation has mental and physical health issues, leading to events like depression, increased risk of obesity and being overweight. I am requesting the Government and the Department for Education to review the research and make it illegal for schools to open before 0930HRS. ",
