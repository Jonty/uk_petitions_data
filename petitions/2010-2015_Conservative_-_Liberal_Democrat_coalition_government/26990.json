        "action": "Change law to ban the importation and public display of Cetaceans such as Dolphins, Orca's, Whales.",
        "additional_details": "There have been no Dolphinarium\u2019s in the UK since a tightening of laws in the mid 1980's. However technically it is NOT illegal. In theory a park could open which meets current law in the future. Dolphins and all Cetaceans are intelligent, social sea mammals with close family ties and bonds within their groups. Dolphin communities are ripped apart during the capture process, often with the creatures not selected for captivity slaughtered for their meat. As happens in Taiji, Japan which is a major global supplier. Keeping these intelligent creatures in captivity for entertainment is cruel.\r\nAS THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO PARKS DISPLAYING THESE ANIMALS IN THE UK, I PROPOSE THAT IT WOULD BE STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR A CHANGE IN LAW TO AN OUTRIGHT BAN ON KEEPING AND DISPLAY. A provision should be made for the rehabilitation of stranded/ill wild cetaceans in sea pens for appropriate release, but not for public display. The UK could be a leader within the EU in this important animal welfare issue.",
