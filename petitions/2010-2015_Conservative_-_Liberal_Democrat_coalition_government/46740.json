WITH CONSERVATION BEING A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE SOCIETY WE LIVE IN NOW ADAYS IT IS UNTHINKABLE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD ALLOW THE RE-OPENING OF THE NETTING STATIONS. THIS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY UNDO ALL THE HARD WORK THAT RIVER BOARDS,TRUSTS AND MANY INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN DOING IN ORDER TO TRY AND GET STOCKS BACK TO WHAT THEY ONCE WERE. IF THIS IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY MAY SUFFER IF STOCKS ARE DEPLETED, PEOPLE WOULD NO LONGER WANT TO SPEND THEIR MONEY TO COME AND FISH OUR RIVERS. ALL FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW INDIVIDUALS MAKING A PROFIT FROM NETTING.\r\n",
