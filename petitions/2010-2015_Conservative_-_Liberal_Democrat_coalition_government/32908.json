        "additional_details": "Every year, a number of horses are injured then shot at the Grand National. The horses obviously struggle at the high, uneven jumps resulting in them falling and injuring themselves. Both horses which were killed in the 2012 race both fell at the Becher's Brook fence. This fence is too high for the horses and has an unexpected drop at the other side, causing the horses to lose balance and fall. This needs to be changed. The maximum number of horses that are allowed to race in the Grand National is 40. Watching the race it is quite obvious that this is too many. At the jumps they all fall into one another and if one falls, the horse behind it falls too. This also needs to be changed.\r\nPlease sign this petition to lower the height of the jumps and the number of horses allowed to take part in the race. I can guarantee these two changes to the Grand National will make a significant difference and make the race a safer place for both jockeys and horses.\r\n",
