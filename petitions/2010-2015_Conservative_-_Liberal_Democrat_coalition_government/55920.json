        "additional_details": "We believe that Politics should be taught in schools from a younger age. When many people reach the age of voting they chose not to vote as they often do not have enough knowledge on what happens in parliament and the electoral system.\r\nYoung people get very few benefits form the government and are receiving less than ever before, whereas older people get a lot more from the government, this is because they are the ones who chose to vote, so party's target their policies towards them. Whereas there are little benefit towards supporting young adults as the party\u2019s seats in parliament are unlikely to be affected by their vote.\r\nThe government must make political education compulsory in schools under the age of 16, as young people and adults believe that it would have been highly beneficial for them too have learnt politics in school.",
