        "additional_details": "Recent surveys of the fabric of the Houses of Parliament have shown serious damage which it is estimated will costs more than \u00a33 Billion (\u00a33,000,000,000) to repair. Repairs canot be done while people continue to work in the building.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to move everyone working there to somewhere else for several years while the repairs are carried out. It could even becoem a permanent move, leaving the HoP as a tourist attraction which could bring in many \u00a3 millions every year.\r\n\r\nBoth Houses of Parliament and all their staff should be moved to Salford as soon as possible after the General Election as there is plenty of space and accomodation available there. It will also have the advantage of having the BBC nearby to ensure access to the airwaves for MPs and Lords.",
