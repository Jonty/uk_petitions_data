This rule is not applied to their straight counterparts who donate blood and so in turn should not be applied to gay and bisexual men.\r\n\r\nA criteria for donation should be based purely on each and every individuals sexual activity and then risk assessed accordingly, not by judging all MSM as an entire group. This should be applied to ALL no matter what their sexuality. Risky behaviour such as unsafe sex is the same across the board, as is safe sex. Allow gay and bisexual men who are safe to donate.\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Dutton",
