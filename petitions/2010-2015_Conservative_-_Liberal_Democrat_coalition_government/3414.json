        "additional_details": "The government should legislate to reduce the massive black market of scrap metal that is encouraging the theft of electricity and telephone cables, lead from roofs, catalytic converters from cars, industrial theft, etc the list is almost endless.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is that all registered scrap metal dealers would be appointed an inland revenue tax official and a police officer who should work at the point of sale.\r\nEvery transaction that is currently paid to the sellers of scrap metal should be subject to 40% tax which could be reimbursed to the seller reclaiming the tax (if appropriate) on their annual tax return form.\r\nThe officials and officers should be changed on a regular basis to help avoid bribery.\r\nAll collectors and carriers of scrap metal should be registered and monitored, with some of the revenue collected to be used to police the transportation of such materials.\r\n",
