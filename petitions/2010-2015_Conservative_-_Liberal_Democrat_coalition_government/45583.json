I just wrote a petition that clearly stated what it was mean't to say and in a good amount of detail so that a reasonable person could not just understand but could see where I had reached the conclusion. I did this in 500 words but due to this rediculously low wordcount I had to cut over half of it bring my petition down from a statement of soloution to a pointing finger saying why don't you do this?\r\n\r\nYou can not expect a informed basis for a argument in such a small space.\r\n\r\nincrease the word limit for the e-petition!
