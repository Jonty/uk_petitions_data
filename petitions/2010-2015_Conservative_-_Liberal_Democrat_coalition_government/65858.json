In the UK the NHS do not fund important OT (occupational therapy) treatment for children with Autism and many thousands of children suffer because of it. We want access to OT treatment for all children who suffer sensory processing issues.\r\n\r\nChildren will greatly benefit from treatment allowing them to organise their sensors and calm inorder to learn.\r\n\r\nPlease sign our petition for funded OT therapy for all children.",
