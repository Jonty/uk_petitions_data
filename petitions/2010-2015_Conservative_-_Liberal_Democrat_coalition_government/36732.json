        "additional_details": "I think with the current market and credit crunch situation currently in the UK, could we not pay road tax by direct debit like the TV licence and the Council tax?\r\nwould be a better way for all. The goverment would get more payments of the higher taxed vehicles rather than people ditching, selling or scrapping them, and people who dont want a big lump sum at the end of the year would manage the finance of a car better. Bit of a no brainer, just cannot see why it would not be viable? could be monthly or quarterley even.would like changed to a twelve month direct debit if approved.  ",
