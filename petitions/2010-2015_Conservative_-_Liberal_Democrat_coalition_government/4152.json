        "additional_details": "The Government must review its policy and reduce the number of universities that are raising fees to \u00a39,000 per annum. This is a policy that has been abused. It was intended for exceptional cases only and the number of universities that have elected to raise their fees to this level is excessive. This policy will only lead to further education being limited to those with the ability to pay rather than those with the talent for university education and in the long term will lead to shortages in key skill areas, teaching, medicine etc. in this country",
