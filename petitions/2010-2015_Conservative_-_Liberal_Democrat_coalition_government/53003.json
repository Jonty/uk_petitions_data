        "additional_details": "This petition proposes making irresponsible dog owners own selfishness not effect other people quietly going about thier business. Dogs do bark and dogs are part of our lives/culture throughout the world. But the selfish acts of some dog owners keeping their dogs in the back garden over night or letting thier dogs bark at 7.00 am in the morning or 10.00pm at night is not fair on the rest of us who are trying to sleep, or go about or business quietly. Why should some individuals acts impact on the rest of us?! Or can I start playing my stereo as loud as possible at 7.00 am just because I work nights and 7.00 am is my 'night time' and I want to enjoy my evening!! No, it doesn't make sense does it! Let commonsense prevail!",
