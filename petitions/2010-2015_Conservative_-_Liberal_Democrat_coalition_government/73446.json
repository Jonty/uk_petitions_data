        "additional_details": "Alderman Maurice Turtle Mills, the Democratic Unionist Party councillor for Ballymena, publicly announced the death and destruction of Hurricane Katrina was God's revenge on the gay community. He has also attributed AIDS to the \u201cfilthy practice of sodomy\u201d. Furthermore, he has refused to retract and apologise for these statements.\r\n\r\nAwarding a MBE honour to a public person who has made such derogatory and homophobic comments, whose outspoken beliefs stand to divide the public and degrade a group within society, sends the message that the Queen and Great Britain support these hateful messages and are intolerant of the lesbian and gay community.\r\n\r\nI refuse to stand by whilst this message is supported and the the honours system ridiculed.\r\n\r\nI hereby request the honours be withheld until Mr Mills retract his homophobic, intolerant, derogatory, hateful comments.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\nNicholas S J Parton",
