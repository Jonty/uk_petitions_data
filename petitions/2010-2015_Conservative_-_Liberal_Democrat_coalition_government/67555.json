        "additional_details": "I would like the government to make providing a reference a mandatory responsibility for an employer. It is a common misconception that workplaces are obliged to provide references for their employees. Employers can refuse to provide a reference without explanation or grounds for doing so. Considering that all prospective employers ask for at least two \"satisfactory\" references before an offer of employment can be made, then the law should consider the negative connotations of a refused reference and the potential for discrimination. Current UK law states that an employer can give a reference that is \"fair and accurate\", up to and including whether or not you were sacked from your job.\r\nIn the interests of equality a \u201cfair and accurate\u201d reference should always be given without the option of a refusal.\r\n ",
