        "additional_details": "I believe that a campaign is necessary to pull the standards of the Coventry authorities up to those of the north west and capital city. The legal system in Coventry should mirror the legislation currently laid down by the British Law Society. The authorities seem to be very lazy and the situation is getting very dangerous and is being compared to Amsterdam, Holland. Furthermore, the mental health of under 25 year olds in Coventry ought to mirror the standards set up by the Royal College of Psychiatrists. The situation is very dangerous and the slander within this age group is extremely wild. School teachers in Coventry must be kept up to date with changes in the workforce and they must not get behind and slander professionals in their own careers and give students the wrong information!",
