After working 55 hours I would like to sit infront of my tv and have a beer . You have put up fuel prices AGAIN and now my lager. STOP PUTTING HIDDEN TAXES ON WORKERS ! Soon it won't be worth me working . I ask anyone who thinks increased taxes on fuel and alcohol are impeding on your normal life to sign up. Because a few louts make the headlines DON'T tax everyone !",
