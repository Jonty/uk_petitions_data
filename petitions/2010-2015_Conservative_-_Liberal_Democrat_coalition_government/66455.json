I had no support from them whatsoever and have to do everything myself and always getting the wrong dates on the letters. They also got my money stopped when I told two people that I was going on holiday they said it was fine and we change the date for you. Until I got back and found out that my money stopped. When I do go without being told my advisor wasn't there.  ",
