        "additional_details": "I think that the height of horse racing jumps is unnecessary, and if a horse goes of the track or maybe injures itself from a jump and they cant cope they are immediately shot. The reason for this big petition is to hopefully stop the jumps on horse racing or even to make them lower. Please help stop these lovely horses dyeing and please just sign this petition and hopefully the jumps will be stopped or lowered. It is a cruel and dangerous sport as there have been allot of accidents. Flat out galloping, getting whipped to do it... jumping high hedges over ditches... and there\u2019s always at least one horse dead by the end of it! Around 420 horses die a year from horse racing. So please help me do something about it. Thank you. ",
