        "additional_details": "A call to ban all flights that create 'Persistant Con-Trails'.\r\nThis type of con trail is effecting the UK's weather patterns / climate and it is also known to be causing 'global dimming', as well as other consequences such as destroying the Ozone layer in the Northern Hemisphere due to the amount of particulates left in the air.\r\nPersistant Contrails are more commonly known as Chem Trails and they come under the genre of ' Geo Engineering'. It is a general consensus that persistant contrails are not related to fuel exhaust emissions but they are particulates sprayed at high altitude as a means to modify the weather.",
