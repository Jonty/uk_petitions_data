After training  he is sent into action by parliamentarians not required to take any test. This is unfair,unconscienceable and undemocratic.\r\nThis system could be used to shortlist those for those with the aptitude for ministerial positions in particular fields giving the electorate the right man for the job rather than it be based on popularity.\r\nThere has been negligence, irresponsible overspending and never any accountability resulting in  investigation for criminal negligence. We have overspent, are putting in place austerity measures. it is irresponsible to demonstrate or strike.\r\nIgnoring the policy of the past of promoting peace, promoting British Trade  we now sadly follow US lead threatening violence and sanctions, destroying trade relations.\r\n",
