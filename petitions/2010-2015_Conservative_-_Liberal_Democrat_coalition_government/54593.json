(In today's terms over 1m people)\r\n\r\nWhy 350 years on is it any different, people in Syria have divided opinions as they did then, the only way to replace this issue is to leave Syria and its so called Rebels to get on with it\r\n\r\nIt is not for any country, whether it be USA, UK, France, Russia, China etc, etc to get involved in another sovereign states political argument.\r\n\r\nEven in grounds of humanitarian aid, we would need to invade a country a week, half of Africa would be at war, where 2500 CHILDREN die a DAY of starvation but no one does anything about that??\r\n\r\nBelieve in keeping people alive, don't let World War 3 happen. Sign this petition to let our voted MP's know how we feel, in that we are not a world police force and believe in good,\r\nBut not at the cost of creating a massive World War and further strengthening of western hatred.",
