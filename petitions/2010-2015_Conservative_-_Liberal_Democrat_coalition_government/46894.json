        "additional_details": "Leeds City Council (LCC) has announced the impending closure of Primrose Hill Care Home, Westwood Way, Boston Spa, LS23 6DX.\r\n\r\nA decision is expected by September 2013, causing a significant amount of anxiety among residents and relatives, and indeed staff.   Some of the residents are 100 years old.\r\n\r\n No reasons have been given for this closure.\r\n\r\nPrimrose Hill is an excellent purpose built Care Home with dedicated staff.  LCC has not said where the 32 residents of Primrose Hill, will be moved to.\r\n\r\nThere are no nearby Care Homes;   the nearest are either in Leeds, Harrogate or York, many miles away from Boston Spa.\r\n\r\nPlease add your signature to this petition to support our campaign\r\n\r\nto stop the closure of Primrose Hill Care Home.\r\n\r\n",
