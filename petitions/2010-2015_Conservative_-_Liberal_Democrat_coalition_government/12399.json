        "additional_details": "Businesses are struggling within the UK and being forced to outsource overseas to countries like China in order to stay competitive. Abolishing VAT would make Britain affordable for the British public and far from damaging our country would allow the economy to rebuild as investment would be viable and manufacturing would viable in this country. We are selling our soul to other nations and stripping pride for our nation from the British people.\r\n\r\nThe benefit system should be overhauled to take away the fact that for some individuals in the UK, there is no choice but to remain on benefits, because tax is too high and wages are too low, so there is no added incentive in working for a living.",
