There are too many children today who ride bikes and think they won't get seriously injured if they fall off their bikes.  Children are at higher risk of brain injury than adults due to the fact that their brains aren't fully developed.  22% of all UK cycling casualties are under 16. It is estimated that 90,000 on-road and 100,000 off-road cycling accidents occur every year in the UK, of which 53%(100,000) involve children under 16.  We need to educate our children now by giving them a short bike safety course in schools and also give those who don't have them, helmets.  ",
