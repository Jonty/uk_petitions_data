        "additional_details": "There has been an angry reaction to proposals to close a Nelson church primary school and relocate it on a new site more than a mile away.The county council is considering building a new primary school on the site of the former Mansfield High School, Brierfield, which would accommodate twice the number of pupils currently at St Paul\u2019s.\r\nThere has been no consultation about this and this will destroy the heritage of the area.\r\nIt will also mean putting a lot more traffic on the roads - more than half of the children at the current school walk there but will not be able to if the school is moved.We as a community want our children taught in a family-friendly environment. The community will be wiped away if the school is moved to another town.\u201d\r\nWe would like the Goverment to take action to stop the upheaval & change to a valuable community.\r\nAfter all what is a church School with out a church its just a School",
