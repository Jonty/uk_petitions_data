        "additional_details": "To follow an example of Wales, I would like to ask government to have the same opt-out system for organ donation in the rest of the UK.\r\n\r\nHaving an opt out system for organ donation would mean people would be presumed to give consent for their organs to be donated after death, unless they have specifically objected.\r\n\r\nIn loving memory of Emma Witty.\r\nAn organ donor at just 19 years old, five of her organs went to six different people, if there were to be an opt-out system, millions more people could be saved.\r\n\r\nIf you are not on the UK Organ Donor register already please sign up here: https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/how_to_become_a_donor/registration/consent.asp\r\nand please sign this petition.\r\n\r\nMore than 10,000 people in the UK currently need a transplant. Of these, 1000 each year - that's three a day - will die because there are not enough organs available.",
