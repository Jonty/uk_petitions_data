        "additional_details": "The government should completely subsidise all participation in sport.\r\n\r\nThe 2011 statistics on obesity show that 25% of all people in England were classified as obese compared to just 25% of adults who were regularly taking exercise This is because cost is a barrier to sport. This is not just football and rugby but all sport such as cricket, sailing, horse-riding etc, as equipment for these sports prices most people out of getting involved. Subsidising all sport would incur a large cost but could recovered by the benefits in other areas such as NHS (costs would reduce if obesity levels dropped in England), crime (Similar projects in deprived areas of US with cricket and rugby have reduced gang crime in LA) and education (sport encourages self motivation, and decision making, leading to better performance of schools in deprived areas). In summary, free sport is a change in the philosophy that provides opportunities to participate rather than barriers.\r\n",
