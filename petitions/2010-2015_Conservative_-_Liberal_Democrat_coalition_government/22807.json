        "additional_details": "This petition has been raised due to the amount of tax and vat that the government take from everyone who\r\nOwns and runs a vehicle. Petrol, diesel, and autogas.\r\nPrices are far too high, the government needs to accept this fact and accept they are taking too much from individuals and businesses with regards to fuel duty and vat. If the government does not act more people will be forced off the road, more businesses will be forced to cut back staff of close altogether. It's better for the government to receive some revenue than not receive any. If more businesses close thousands or millions will be forced onto the dole. If revenue is cut more people will be taken off the dole and more families lifted out of fuel poverty, and prices in the high street will reduce to sustainable levels. ",
