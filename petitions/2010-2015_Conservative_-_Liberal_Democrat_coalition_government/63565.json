        "additional_details": "The new Scottish qualifications cause an unnecessary amount of stress and workload for pupils and staff. Failure of prelims is sky high with the new National 5 subjects, this should be ringing alarm bells for the creators and administrators of the new courses, SQA. Exams can be a stressful time normally but the fact that the courses are highly unsettled and shambolic implements further stress on our Scottish youth. The government needs to revise the education system and consider bringing in new or old qualifications.",
