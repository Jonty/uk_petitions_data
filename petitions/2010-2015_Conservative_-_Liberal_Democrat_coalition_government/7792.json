        "additional_details": "In light of the recent riots in London and across the UK, it highlights the fact that apart from producing a generation that feel they have no purpose and that no one is listening to them.  We have also produced a generation of young adults that generally lack leadership, guidance, discipline and respect for themselves and others.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose that all UK citizens under the age of 20, would serve a minimum of 1 year National Service.\r\n\r\nIt would enable them to benefit from the skills available to them, such as team work and leadership,  which would also develop a sense of self achievement within them.  It would give them the opportunity to learn and develop skills such as engineering, catering and a whole variety of skills that will further their careers.  It will help them gain experience and a sense of pride and belonging to the community. ",
