        "additional_details": "I Think that if you are 16 years old and your parents allow you to get a tattoo then in the UK I think you should be able to as it is your body and you should be able to do what you want with it. I think the tattooing of miners act was a stupid law, there is no freedom to do anything in this country any more. On the other hand its not effecting anyone else, so if your 16 and have parental consent then you should be able to get a tattoo if you want one. Plus a lot of other country in the EU let 16 year old's get tattoos and some country's let you get one what ever age you want.This country is only a minority of country's that restrict you to get one at 18.And also when your 16 you can do things like leave home join the armed forces with parental consent, but no your not allowed a tattoo at 16 but your allowed to join the armed forces.
