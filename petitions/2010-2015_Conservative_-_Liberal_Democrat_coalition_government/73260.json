        "additional_details": "The setting of education policy should be removed from government control and transferred to a committee of educators and industry leaders. Terms of reference for that committee should concentrate on developing an education strategy that meets the long-term skills needs of the country and produces rounded, 'well-educated' young people. Strategy should be stable and not subject to change at the whim of an individual [education secretary]. Government responsibility should be limited to funding and delivery of the education strategy.",
