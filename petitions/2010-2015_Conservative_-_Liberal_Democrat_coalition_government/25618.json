        "additional_details": "Most people have had experience of insurance companies delaying genuine payments to claimants, whilst ensuring that monthly payments are taken religiously. Whilst a claim is being reviewed, surely there must be a way of legislating that claims are made speedily along with the monthly payments being frozen whilst the case is being reviewed.
