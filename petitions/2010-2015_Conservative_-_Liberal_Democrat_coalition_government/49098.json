        "additional_details": "I sold my house in Cyprus and returned to the UK after my husband suddenly passed away. I sold with funds paid into my Cyprus account on 15th March 2013 two hours before close of business. Too late to transfer that day but with email instructions given on the same day to transfer to my UK account on the next working day. The next day I heard about the levy the Cyprus Government would be placing on their depositors.  My funds are not savings that have been accruing interest. It is from the sale of my house and only in the account for two hours. I am asking the British Government to help me to get all my money released from Cyprus in order to move on with my life. I am currently living in my sisters house. I have been told by the local council that I do not qualify for a rental property. Can someone PLEASE help me?",
