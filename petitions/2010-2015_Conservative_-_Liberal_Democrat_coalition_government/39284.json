MP's and Lords should all be UK tax payers and pay tax as we all do and be banned from using off shore tax havens.\r\n\r\n2. Their pay increases and pensions should be same as they impose on public sector workers\r\n\r\n3. Any property bought using MP's expenses should either be sold and the money raised is given back to the treasury, or at least they need to pay capital gains tax on proceeds.\r\n\r\n4. Their expenses should be no more than is allowed within tax rules for those of us in the private sector, and in any instance , any requirement for personal advancements is not a qualifying \"expense\"\r\n",
