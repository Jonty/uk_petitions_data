        "additional_details": "Absent parents have to pay CSA at a proportion of their take home pay (for 3 children it is \u00a325%) but the CSA don't take into account that if you have the children for any amount of days (not over night visits) costs money to collect, feed, entertain the children but unless you have the children for 52 nights (therefore 104 days a year) you don't get any reduction, for example living 20 miles from the children just taking then to your house and back is 80 miles thats before taking them on any outings. the CSA should take into account that 25% out of your money is a lot especially when you take them on holiday and still can't claim any money reduction if you haven't had the children for the 52 nights a year.. it is time that absent parents were taken into account and the costs of having the children is taken into account too...
