        "additional_details": "Stephen Sutton is a remarkable young man. Since discovering he has incurable cancer he has worked tirelessly to raise millions of pounds for cancer charities, and to raise cancer awareness.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Stephen is against the clock. His health has recently taken a turn for the worse. He accepts that he may not have long left, and is facing this fact with the bravery and acceptance of someone many years his senior.\r\n\r\nI feel that in the time Stephen has left, his work should be recognised. I'm calling on the British Government to break with all tradition and award Stephen with a national honour, to be awarded to him as soon as possible due to his special circumstances.",
