Many in Britain now believe Gibraltar should join the people of Malta to receive this great symbolic honour.\r\n\r\nNow is the time for Britain to genuinely stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the Gibraltarians, and for the British territory to receive the UK's highest award for gallantry.\r\n\r\nWe believe the people of Gibraltar should be given our highest honour NOW!\r\n\r\nPlymouth & SW Friends of Gibraltar",
