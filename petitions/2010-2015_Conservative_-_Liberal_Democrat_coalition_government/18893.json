        "additional_details": "I think teachers contracts should ensure that teachers are on-site for full-time hours and have five weeks holiday per year, as for the rest of the population.  When we hear teachers complain of working 'in their own time' what it really means is working in the time the rest of us consider normal working hours. This would reduce the need for PPE time when classes are left with unqualified supervisors, the need for INSET days during term time and would leave ample time for marking.  The long holidays are required for children to recuperate.  Teachers work no harder than anyone else.",
