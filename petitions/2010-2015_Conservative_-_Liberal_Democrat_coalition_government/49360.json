Control of our country has been given away to an unelected criminal network and intentionally hidden from the British people. Skull & Bones, Rogue members of the Freemasons, Bilderbergers and other groups are pushing forward for the destruction of our beautiful island and the system our forefathers died protecting.\r\n\r\nWe the British people demand the immediate dismantling of the current government and justice served to the traitors who are pushing for the destruction of the British way of life for their own personal agenda.\r\n\r\nWe the British people are awake & aware, FEAR no longer has meaning when our way of life is under threat. As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil, for you are with me.",
