        "additional_details": "Until this week, Ingrid Layou-Kennett was a mother and cub scout leader, living quietly in London, known only to her friends, family and well, some cub scouts. Today she is the only positive thing to have come out of Wednesday\u2019s horrific events in Woolwich. Even David Cameron thinks so, saying on Thursday afternoon: \"Confronting extremism is a job for us all. And the fact that our communities will unite in doing this was vividly demonstrated by the brave cub pack leader - Ingrid Loyau-Kennett,\" he said. \"When told by the attacker that he wanted to start a war in London she replied: 'You\u2019re going to lose. It\u2019s only you versus many.' She spoke for us all.\" ",
