        "additional_details": "To deal out a short, sharp shock to the rioters AND start the process of families taking responsibility, set up boot camps but send the whole immediate family.\r\n\r\nIf a brother or mother or sister for example realises they will be included in punishments they may start to positively influence the perpetrators/family members in the future.\r\n\r\nNothing will be gained from imprisonment & the under 18s are not allowed to be sent anyway.\r\n\r\nThe strict, disciplined regime and hard work ie repairing the damage they have done & meeting, face to face, people who have had their lives ruined will not only have a short term impact but a longer term one also and start a process of responsibility.\r\n\r\nThis will cost no more than prison for 1 person so long as benefits are cut also.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is to be sent for 6-12 months.
