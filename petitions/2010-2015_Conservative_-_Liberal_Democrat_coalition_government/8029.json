        "additional_details": "Reforming the House of Lord by replacing the current appointed Lords with elected \"Senators\" is not in the best interest of the United Kingdom, taking into account our constitutional structure.\r\n\r\nThe reform would essentially replace our current Lords, which consists of experts from their respective fields of practice, who are capable of providing their expertise into the scrutiny of a Bill, with career politicians who are already dominating the House of Commons. Elected bicameral parliament only works in federal states, where conflicting legitimacies (Nation as a whole, and individual states) sparks genuine debate between the chambers.\r\n\r\nIf Clegg intends to leave untouched the current functions of the House of Lord (scrutinize) then what is the logic behind replacing scrutiny experts with career politicians? And democracy certainly is not the answer, if  too much efficiency and expertise are sacrificed on the altar of democracy, then democracy will only become barren and empty.",
