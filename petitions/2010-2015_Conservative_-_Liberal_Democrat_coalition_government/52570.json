        "additional_details": "1.4 Billion people are in poverty. 250,000 people die everyday.Why? Because we have chosen to value money on peoples lives. We have said to ourselves that it is but human nature that people suffer because of money. I am no psychologist and I'm not even a biologist yet. But I know that, that is not the truth. And then the next question we ask ourselves (because we know it isn't human nature) is can we change poverty and make it non existent. There is a simple answer to that question, It is but one simple word with 3 letters in it. YES. There is a great quote by Walt Disney who says, \"If you can dream, You can do it\" I'm going to take a guess and say many of us have dreamed a world where there is no war or no poverty. We have to change the world. If not now, then when?\r\nWe must look beyond our selfish and not donate a couple of million every year. We must donate all we can. Because we all live on this same planet.\r\nHuman lives are more important than money.  ",
