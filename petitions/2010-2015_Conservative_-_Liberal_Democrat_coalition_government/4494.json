        "additional_details": "A petition to for the government to reconsider its current stance on raising tuition fees. Students are the future of this country and its economy, and therefore have the right to affordable or even free tuition as the Liberal Democrats originally pointed out in there manifesto. Students are already leaving university with vast debts. With the governments new decision to raise tuition fees then students are going to be finishing a three year degree with at least \u00a327,000 of debt, and this does not include living costs, such as rent and food. Should the government really be encouraging young people to get into so much debt? Particularly as students are the future to the countries skills.",
