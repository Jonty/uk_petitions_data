        "additional_details": "Manchester City Council along with Chesire East and Stockport Council have made plans for a A6 Relief road from Hazel Grove Stockport to Manchester Airport. For this road to go ahead, wildlife habbitats will be comprimised, open country space used by the public will be comprimised, land will be unfairly developed using a CPO order and house prices will suffer even more than they already have. This road is not wanted, needed and should not happen.\r\n\r\nThe Government should realise that this relief road will not solve the problem it intends too, but in the process of trying it will create more problems that will last decades. The Government should stop the relief road pressing ahead, and use the money for other much needed services. ",
