Set up a website similar to epetitions to allow the public to report directly judicial decisions which are inappropriate. Appointment to the bench should not be for life, but for a fixed period after which a review is undertaken to verify the effectiveness of the individual and whether he/she should continue in the position for a further fixed time period.
