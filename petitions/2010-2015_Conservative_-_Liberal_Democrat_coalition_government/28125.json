        "additional_details": "The DoH has ruled that emergency control staff within our emergency services are not eligible to receive the Queen's Diamond Jubilee medal this year because they don't have \"direct patient contact.\"\r\nEmergency control staff are annoyed by this decision as many lives have been saved by the very people who answer the 999 calls and dispatch the emergency vehicles to the incidents.\r\nIt also appears that the DoH do not care about the staff who have to deal with threats, abuse and heartache everyday.\r\nWe want the DoH to change the rules, so that ALL members of the emergency services are recognised for their hard work and determination to have an impact on the lives of those in need of our help.",
