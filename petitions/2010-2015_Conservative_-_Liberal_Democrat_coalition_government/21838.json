        "additional_details": "Changing the law to allow overtaking in any lane on Motorways.  This will prevent the under utilisation of lanes 1 & 2 and the bad lane discipline which results in everyone queing in the outer lane to get past when the other lanes are free to use.  This would help the economy by making journey times quicker and reduce lost time and frustration.  This needs to be looked at in a strategic range of measures including speed limits, drivers signalling, lane use, and law enforcement on our motorway network.",
