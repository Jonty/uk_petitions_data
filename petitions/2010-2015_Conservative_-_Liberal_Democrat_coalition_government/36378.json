He is married to a UK national.\r\n\r\nBut disciplinary action for a 2010 fight with a colleague means he is considered to have a criminal record.\r\n\r\nThe Border Agency said applications for settlement by ex-forces personnel were considered the same way as all others.\r\n\r\nVeterans Aid chief executive Dr Hugh Milroy said it seemed \"completely incredible\" that L/Cpl Baleiwai was being barred from the UK because of his brawl.\r\n\r\n\"This is so minuscule as an incident, but the implications are massive,\" he said. \"This should have been done and dusted and gone.\"",
