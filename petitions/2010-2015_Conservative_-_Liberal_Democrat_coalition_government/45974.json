This is not a frivolous request.\r\n\r\nThere have been cases of MPs dying of heart attacks for instance in the past and I believe these could have been prevented with these kind of checks.\r\n\r\nSimilarly with mental health checks it is in everyone's best interest that an MP/lord is sound of mind.\r\n\r\nYou may re-word my request if you still deem it offensive in some way but please do not dismiss it as if I do not matter.  I have AS.",
