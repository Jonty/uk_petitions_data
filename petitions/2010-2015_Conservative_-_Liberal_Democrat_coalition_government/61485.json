        "additional_details": "The government is in breach of the Equality Act 2010 through its recruitment processes of using application forms only.\r\n\r\nI would urge the government to send a directive stating that all government and public sector organisations must allow choice of application process, from the point of advert i.e. completing an online form or forwarding a CV and cover letter.\r\n\r\nThe government is in breach of the Equality Act by forcing applicants to contact the organisation and disclose their disabilities, in order to get adjustment. It has also been noted that the vast majority of public sector/government departments will not offer choice when asked. In 2014 we should not be asking for adjustments on application forms. One size does most certainly not fit all.\r\n\r\nApplication forms only are a barrier to dyslexic, autistic, ADHD, visual thinkers. The government is tasked under, the Autism Act 2009, with bringing down barriers for people on the Autistic spectrum, not putting them up.\r\n\r\n",
