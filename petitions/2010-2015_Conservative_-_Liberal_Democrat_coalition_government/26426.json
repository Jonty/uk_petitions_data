        "additional_details": "Despite numerous appeals and a lengthy consultation the UK Government has decided not only to rule out a restructuring of the tax which would level out the disparity to the Caribbean region but to increase the APD by an additional 10%.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government also confirmed the treasury will not offset revenues raised through the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) against APD, meaning that passengers will be taxed twice when they fly from January 2012.\r\n\r\nWe hereby call on the United Kingdom Government to abolish or reform the Airport Passenger Duty to protect the tourism sector in the Caribbean and to provide equality of access and opportunity for British citizens of Caribbean origin or descent to travel to their countries of origin.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance in anticipation of your support",
