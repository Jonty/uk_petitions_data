Communities in Ireland, North and South have serious concerns about the extension of the nuclear plant at Sellafield. We are calling for Britain to abandon further nuclear development in favour of greater investment in renewables and energy conservation.\r\nWe consider nuclear to be an unsafe, unclean and potentially lethal energy source that may be the cheapest option, but at what long term cost?
