        "additional_details": "On 14th March 2013 we heard that \u00a310.5 billion is needed to repair winter pot holes and bring British roads up to a good standard.  Lack of investment in roads which are essential for a vast majority of people to get to work safely or transport goods around the country by van or lorry or for commuting and leisure use by cyclists are essential in a developed country and yet the Government and local authories are neglecting these road users who pay vast sums of road tax and fuel duty.  We therefore call on the authorities to use these taxes to repair roads OR to start refunding a proportion of road tax and fuel duty in compensation for dangerous and poor services.",
