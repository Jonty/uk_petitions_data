        "additional_details": "Cars have been becoming faster, and safer for years. We pay for an MOT test each year, to prove the road worthiness of our vehicles. It is time the government moved with the time and raised the motorway speed limit to allow road users to travel at 90mph.\r\n\r\nManufacturers are allowed to make cars that surpass the current speed limits with ease, if these cars are deemed safe to be sold in the UK, then by inference, they are safe to be driven - at any speed.\r\n\r\nMany EU countries have no speed limit, and in fact have less accidents than the UK.\r\n\r\nIt's time for a change. Raise the limit, and do it without any hassle. It's what the public want.\r\n\r\n",
