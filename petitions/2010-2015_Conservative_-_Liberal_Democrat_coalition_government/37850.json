China's rise in the 21st Century may cause threats to the whole world, including the Britain. Britain must not be split so that it remains powerful and will be capable of solving the threats of China in the 21st Century.\r\n\r\nWhat the UK Government should do:\r\nNever let Scotland be independent. Arouse Scottish patriotism with the Great British Empire and her history of military and socioeconomic strengths.\r\n",
