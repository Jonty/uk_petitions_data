        "additional_details": "We have already seen in the past a petition of just under a 2 million signatures ( created By Mr Peter Roberts )  who did not want any charges against the motorist for Toll's ,or other forms of road tax usage on certain types of roads. This new two tier tax will hit the poorest community who only just manage to survive keeping their cars on the roads already, but will increase the cost of all goods transported on motorways. It will be the business sector and comsumer who will again suffer the financial consequences. I'm sure this is the first stage before they then bring in the Black Box which will monitor your every move -speed- location, So BIG BROTHER can control. I ask you to sign this petition and  STOP this idea before we are totally removed from using roads as they will be unaffordable.  The Goverment must not consider this two tier road tax. ",
