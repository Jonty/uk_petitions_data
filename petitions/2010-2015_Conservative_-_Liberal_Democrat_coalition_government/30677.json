        "additional_details": "The government needs to step in and simplify train fares.\r\n\r\nThere are too many options confusing people. Numerous newspaper reports and studies have shown that people do not understand train ticket fares including the advance, advance off peak, weekender, etc, etc, etc...\r\n\r\nWith train fares already very expensive - it is absurd that we are left confused about the options available.\r\n\r\nThe government must review and force train operators to have a simple fare system rather than expecting people to spend hours understanding new terminology.",
