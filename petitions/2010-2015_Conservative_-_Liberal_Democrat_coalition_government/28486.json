All non-British citizens who came to UK as migrants should have should be given e-ID cards & IT systems tracking their activities in UK. Such ID cards should be strictly required to be checked online - whenever a foreigner takes up employment, in education, seeking NHS treatment, seeking DWP benefits, getting married, entering UK, leaving UK, having children, arrested, on bail, etc.  People (& family members) on work permits, students visas, EU citizens not permanently residing in UK, illegal immigrants should NOT receive means tested (like JSA) benefits & non-means tested (like child benefit) benefits. Also workers who send money to their extended families aboard are not British workers but foreign ones & are a drain to UK balance of trade.",
