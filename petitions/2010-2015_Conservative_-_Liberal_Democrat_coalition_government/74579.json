        "additional_details": "Large companies countinue to outsource a variety of back office work to low cost countries. These countries are partly low cost due to lower living standards than in the UK, additionally the workers often have fewer rights. This is therefore not a level playing field. Unless we want to see the rights of employees and pay reach equally low levels (this will exerbate poverty in the UK). Companies should be made to pay a non-reclaimable ongoing outsourcing tax per head outsourced, this will level up the playing field and promote a fairer economy. Additonally it is only very large companies that can benefit from low cost outsourcing and have unfair compeitive advantage when compared to smaller companies. The loss of income to the UK treasury (via tax and NI) is significant due to this outsourcing and harm is being felt in all areas of the economy.",
