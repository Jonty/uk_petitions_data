        "additional_details": "Whereas we do not intend to encourage children to behave sexually, it is a biological fact that they will naturally do this from the age of puberty onwards - about the age of 13. At present, young people can be charged with rape and put on the sex offenders register for doing this. They are given mixed messages from sex education and health agencies that have a much more permissive attitude than the law allows. This is not fair on young people. We call on the government to decriminalise sexual activity between young people where no harm, manipulation or force has been used.",
