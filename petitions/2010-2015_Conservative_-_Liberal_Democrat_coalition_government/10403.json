They deserve to be protected, not humiliated for the entertainment of the masses, by being forced to perform tricks and routines in a circus ring.\r\nTo any civilized country, such as the United Kingdom professes itself to be, the idea of using and humiliating animals for pure entertainment should be abhorrent. That is why we, the undersigned, excersise our democratic right to demand that the governement brings to end the cruel practice of using animals in circuses. ",
