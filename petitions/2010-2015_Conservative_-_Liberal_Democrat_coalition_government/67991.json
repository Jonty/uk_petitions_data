If the council tax payer does not pay their council tax in full they can have legal proceedings taken against them.\r\nBut when the council tax payer doesn't receive services paid for, and no rebate is given, then this is wrong and equates to fraud.\r\nI believe the council tax payer, when services are not met should be legally bound to have a rebate on council tax, otherwise this is an unfair system which amounts to fraud. It needs to be looked at!",
