However the government refuse to enforce a helmet law on bicycle riders.\r\n\r\nPersonally I ride a motorcycle and id never leave home without my helmet and leathers however I would still either like the choice to wear a helmet or not, OR have cyclists wear a helmet. Either way I think there needs to be some sort of review on helmet law in general regarding tinted & coloured visors, in helmet music etc etc as there seems to be a lot of 'grey areas' ",
