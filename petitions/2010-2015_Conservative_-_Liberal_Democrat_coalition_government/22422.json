The former Preston North End and England player scored 187 goals in 433 games for PNE and 30 goals in 76 games for England along with putting his career on hold to fight for his country during the 2nd world war.\r\n\r\nIn honour of his birthday and as a fitting tribute we are planning a charity football match between an England legends XI vs A PNE legends XI with many high profile players, media and sponsors already pledging their support.\r\n\r\nDespite this event expected to raise \u00a3100,000 to be dispersed amongst St Catherine's Hospice, The Alzheimer's Society, The Baby Beat Appeal, SPACE and The Gary Parkinson Trust, the Preston North End hierarchy are refusing the game to be played at Deepdale.",
