        "additional_details": "The A40 between Oxford and Witney is only part dual carriageway. Due to this, many traffic issues arise.\r\nDuring rush hour, it can take over an hour to travel a few miles. If there is an event on in Oxford, the same situation occurs.\r\nThe road is wide enough from the point the dual carriageway ends, until you get to Oxford, for it to be all dual carriageway.\r\nFor some reason unbeknown to many people, there is also no direct access to the A34 from the A40, and vice verser, which would dramatically reduce congestion at the Wolvercote roundabout.\r\nSituated on the A40, is RAF Brize Norton, the RAF's largest airbase, and the hub for all military operations around the world. Anything to leave or return to the UK from operations around the world, goes through RAF Brize Norton. Repatriations of fallen troops also arrive back there, usually at around 1600 - 1700. The procession then makes its way to the Oxord John Radcliffe Hospital along the A40, inevitably hitting all the rush hour traffic.",
