Rules have been there for years but thousands of health tourists still flourish and get treatment with taxpayers like me paying for it.  The ONLY thing which will work is if NHS employees are made RESPONSIBLE and ACCOUNTABLE so that if they choose to ignore the new entitlement rules and treat non-entitled foreigners, that NHS employee should then be made to fund the cost of that treatment.",
