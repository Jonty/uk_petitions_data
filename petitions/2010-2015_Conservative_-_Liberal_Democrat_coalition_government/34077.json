Uniform promotes gang / club mentality we see on our streets now, rather than a mixed populas. The constant complaint of uneducated generations rings in our news programs. Schools spend vast amount of work hours thinking up obstructive polices rather than Educating our children this practice must stop. Schools should be teaching achedemic subjects non club/gang fashion. Give them every chance to develop a sense of worth to society, not to draw lines of our gang/club. ITS OUR's AND THEIR FUTURE",
