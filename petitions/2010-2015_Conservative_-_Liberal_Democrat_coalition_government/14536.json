        "additional_details": "In the last 12 months Car insurance has risen by 40%!  This is despite the fact that Car accidents have dropped by 10% in the last 3 years.  This is purely driven by Fraudulent personal accident claims as well as by a broken legal system surrounding legal fees for referral fees for personal accident claims relating to car incidents.  Referral fees should be banned immediately, and the whole \"whiplash\" claim system should be reviewed.  This American style, greedy claims culture needs to be regulated, as a 40% increase in fees is a joke",
