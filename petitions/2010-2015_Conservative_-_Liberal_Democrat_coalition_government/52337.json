        "additional_details": "On 3rd July 2013, plans were outlined to introduce mandatory charges of a minimum of \u00a3200 per annum to access all NHS services, for migrants from outside the European Economic Area who do not have indefinite leave to stay.\r\n\r\nThis would include migrants who have settled in the UK and make contributions to the NHS through taxes and National Insurance - this contribution should make these people fully eligible to receive treatment free at the point of use. The proposals aim to stop \"health tourism\", but will simply penalise legal migrant workers, and spouses of British citizens, whose earnings may not be sufficient to pay for treatment that their NI and income tax contributions should entitle them to.\r\n\r\nThe government should withdraw these plans, and make all those who pay income tax and National Insurance eligible to receive free treatment on the NHS.",
