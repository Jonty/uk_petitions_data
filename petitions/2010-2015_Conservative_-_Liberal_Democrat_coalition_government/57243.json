        "additional_details": "I would like to ask that air passenger duty is abolished before it's too late for some of the United kingdoms airports.\r\n Due to the financial down turn in the UK and in the General worldwide market place airlines are looking for ways to save money and one of the ways is to move operations to cheaper countries in the EU.\r\n Belfast international is truly struggling to stay open due to the recent abolishment of air passenger Duty.\r\n I would like the government to allow Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales to set the rate of the tax or a compleat abolishment of the tax.\r\n It would make flights cheaper in the summer and may stop many families with drawing their child from school during term time.
