        "additional_details": "The fact that bicycles and their accessories are still subject to VAT is objectionable in itself.  At the very least, let us take that money and put it directly into making cycling safer.  Schools already teach Personal Health and Social education as well as Citizenship and first aid - make cycle training part of the National Curriculum.\r\n\r\nWe want to encourage more (and safer) cycling, and the best way to do this is to introduce it in a safe way from a young age.  If the government is serious about its long-term goals (obesity, climate change, etc.), measures like this are necessary to induce a cultural shift.",
