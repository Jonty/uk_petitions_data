People need to feel safe and young people need somewhere where they can enjoy social activities which will benefit them in life. There is currently a shortage of such places and the youth community needs more opportunities for better lives.\r\n\r\nYOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO ENJOY LIFE.\r\n\r\nIF YOU WORK WITH THEM, THEY WILL WORK WITH YOU.\r\n\r\nHELP CREATE A BETTER COUNTRY AND SET A GOOD EXAMPLE.\r\n\r\nSIGN TO CREATE A BETTER GENERATION FOR THE FUTURE.",
