        "additional_details": "Preston Council have announced plans to demolish the iconic and internationally celebrated bus station. As well as being a unique and well preserved example of British design the building is also home to many local, regional and national bus services with council figures reporting 3000 buses a day passing through the station.\r\nPreston Bus Station has been put forward for listing twice by English Heritage and the 20th Century Society, it is also recognised by the World Monuments Fund as being an important building of its period.\r\nPrevious listing attempts were fought by the local council and vetoed by two separate Culture Secretaries due to a proposed \u00a3700m redevelopment scheme in Preston which would have seen the bus station demolished. The scheme itself has now collapsed and with it go the main reasons against a listing which could attract funding to the building in the form of lottery and heritage grants as well as money from central government.\r\nhttp://www.prestonbusstation.co.uk",
