        "additional_details": "Stop stigmatising the unemployed when there is a job shortage, and when certain groups, e.g. over 50s and long-term unemployed, are unfairly excluded by employers.  For the sake of people's mental health,training has to be geared to local skill shortages, and job availability, not training for training's sake.  Mandatory participation in courses which are of no value and not going to lead anywhere does little for self-esteem or motivation, is a waste of taxpayers money, and leads us to believe we are being punished rather than helped back to work\r\nIncentives would be likely to produce better results, if work was available for all, but that is not the case, is it, so why put pressure on the most vulnerable groups who are the least likely to be successful?  Surely it makes more sense to remove the job seeking obligations of certain groups until the job situation improves.\r\n .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
