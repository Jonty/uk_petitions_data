He is not a qualified member of staff. Police equipment should be used by qualified members. He is still being paid a full monthly salary, as far as I know. What a scandal! Rumour has it, that he is trying to create a programmable woman. He is using the premises at night time, for this purpose.\r\n\r\nHe could be using the premises as housing, also.\r\n\r\nPlease investigate. No comeback on myself, please.",
