This is to be achieved by cuts to social welfare law, axing specific legal aid projects and direct legal aid to those seeking representation.\r\nAccess to justice for a number of civil cases will be denied to many people on low incomes and will see a greater proliferation of Conditional Fee Agreements (No win, No Fee) which often require clients to take out insurance in the event that their case loses.\r\nMany will not see justice done as they will not be able to afford to bring a case before the courts.",
