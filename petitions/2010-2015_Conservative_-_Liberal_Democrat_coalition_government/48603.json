        "additional_details": "For too long the government have told us that WE need to tighten our belts while THEY claim expenses and use OUR tax money to fund wars. They very rarely give to cancer research, the last time was \u00a35million in the early 2000's to create anti-smoking adverts. Adverts don't cure cancer, people. It's time for the government to help fund the research that's so desperately trying to beat this horrible illness. If we have money to spend on wars, state funerals, MP's expense's ect. Then we have the money to start funding the heroes at cancer research.",
