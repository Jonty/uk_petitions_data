        "additional_details": "When you buy a drink, you pay 20-30p on a can or bottle and then when emptied, you return this can or bottle back to the supermarket for refund which will help to combat litter, promotes greater opportunities to recycle, saves costs in councils and disposal costs to landfill and allows good quality materials to be turned into something new. Recycling rates are currently low and traditional methods such as kerbside recycling does not capture drinks containers away from home so this proposal would help the UK boost its recycling rates and reduces the growing problem of litter significantly.",
