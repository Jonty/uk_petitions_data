        "additional_details": "Middlesbrough Council want to sell off the town's Teesaurus Park to the highest bidder.\r\n\r\nTeesaurus Park is one of those places that many locals don\u2019t even know exists. First opened in 1979 with the Teessaurus a triceratops by Genevieve Glatt, fabricated by Harts of Stockton at a cost of \u00a316,000.\r\n\r\nThe sculptures were built by workers on the government Youth and Employment Training Scheme, its a shame the council can\u2019t see their way to giving them all a lick of paint a bit more often.\r\n\r\nUpdate : December 2011 \u2013 Made some corrections to the chronology of the sculptures, I had previously said the T-Rex was first which is incorrect, Teesaurus came first !\r\n\r\nUpdate : December 2012 -Sadly Teesaurus Park is under threat as its a \u2018non-strategic asset\u2019 for the Council.\r\n\r\nUpdate: The park is now for sale - sign now before another part of the town dissapears!\r\n\r\n",
