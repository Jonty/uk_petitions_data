        "additional_details": "Many children with disabilities or SEN often find it hard to deal with crowds, noise and the general hustle and bustle of travelling in peak times. Yet, these families are penalised for removing children from school for holidays the same as everyone else.\r\nIt's not the case that we fancy being awkward, simply that our children cannot cope, which ultimately leaves us with two choices, go in school holidays and spend most of the time stressed, or be allowed flexibility and have the same rights to relaxation and a stress free break as those families without SEN.\r\nWe ask that you make allowances for families of SEN children (including siblings attending mainstream schools) and allow us to take a maximum of 10 days term time leave throughout the academic year without fear of being penalised.",
