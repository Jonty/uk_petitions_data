In the course of my pilgrimage, I have many times asked myself whether there can be more potent advocates of peace upon Earth through the years to come, than this massed multitude of silent witnesses to the desolation of war.\"\r\n\r\nKing George V, May 1922 at Tyne Cot.\r\n\r\nThe Tyne Cot graveyard contains the graves and memorials of over 40 000 commonwealth soldiers, and is a testament to the folly of war.  I believe the cabinet should be obliged to visit the graveyard before voting on any military action to properly consider the implications of their actions amongst those \"Sacrificed to the fallacy/That war can end war\"",
