The recent rioting is an example of how minors do not fear the repercussions of the criminal system.\r\n\r\nUK further education Students are required to self fund further education utilising low interest loans repayable once graduated and earning over a certain threshold.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition requests the government to implement the same system used by students for minor criminal activity. In the event a minor is prosecuted with an offence the damages sustained to repair and make good the damage should be collated and made cumulative payable once of working age or deductable from social benefits.\r\n\r\nThe benefits are three fold, financial compensation for criminal victims, financial accountability for criminal damage by minors & increased government revenue.\r\n",
