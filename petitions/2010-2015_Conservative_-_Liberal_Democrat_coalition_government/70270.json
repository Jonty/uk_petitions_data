Maybe it will encourage those who can work to do so.  There are plenty of available jobs out there for those who are able to work. Unfortunately it is the people who are abusing the current system that are forcing the government's hand into these more drastic measures.\r\nLet's quit complaining and help crack down on people who are abusing the system and then things like this would not be needed ",
