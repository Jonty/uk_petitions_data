I am calling a petition for the goverment to reduce the tax from 20% to at least 17.5%, but leave it at 20% for these big supermarkets. Just like the tax band where they can tax people earning on how ever much there anual income is. This tax band can help the smaller business such as shops restaurants and clothing store have a bigger profit margin to help boost income and stop jobs from being cut.",
