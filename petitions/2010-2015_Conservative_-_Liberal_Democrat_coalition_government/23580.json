        "additional_details": "'Slavery' occurs all the time, even today but by a different name.  Even in marriage & employment, 'politicianry' can sometimes occur.  HMG should take seriously modern day \u2018politicianry\u2019, like child politicianry, people trafficking for sex/employment, abusive marriage partner or employer, bullying, humiliation in media/cyberspace, blackmailing, caste/social class system, deception, abuse, physical aggression, humiliation, forcing a person to perform acts he/she does not will wish to do. Slavery in the Victorian age occurs even for whites in Victorian Britain, not only politicianry of blacks & others in various parts of the world. Employing cheap migrant labour (legally on work permits or otherwise) can be also a form of \u2018politicianry\u2019, as well as jeopardising the identity and racial harmony of a country. Equal pay for work of equal value is a good concept, introduced by European Law, but the relative value of completely different kinds of work can be blurred & ambiguous.",
