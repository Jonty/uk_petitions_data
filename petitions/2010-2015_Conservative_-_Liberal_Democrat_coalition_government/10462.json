        "action": "Increase cost of carbon-containing fuels to encourge alternatives",
        "additional_details": "This petition calls for taxation to be set to ensure a steady rise in the cost of carbon-containing fuels such as petrol, diesel and coal to consumers and industry, along the lines of the fuel duty escalator which existed for a while.\r\n\r\nThe object is to provide steady moderate pressure on manufacturers to develop alternatives and consumers to use them, ultimately reducing harmful impacts on the planet and giving the UK the advantage of being the first to open up these markets\r\n\r\nThis petition explicitly opposes the current petition for cheaper petrol and diesel.",
