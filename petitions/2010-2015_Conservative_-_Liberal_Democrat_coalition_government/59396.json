For example, green if the profit is less than 25%, amber if the profit is between 25% and 50% and red if the profit exceeds 50%.\r\n\r\nThe coloured marking doesn\u2019t have to appear on the actual product labelling but it should appear on the company\u2019s own price labels. An in-store list of all products and their associated profit margins should also be made available for shoppers to view and this list should be published on the supermarket\u2019s website. And of course, the coloured labelling should appear for each product displayed on the supermarket\u2019s online store.\r\n\r\nIf I\u2019m buying a product for \u00a34 and at least \u00a32 of that is going in pure profit to the supermarket then I would like to know. It\u2019ll definitely make me think twice about buying that product.",
