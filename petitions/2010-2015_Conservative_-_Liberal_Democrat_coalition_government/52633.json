Enable both parents to spend/save the benefit on/for the child during contact time.\r\n2. Stop the current system whereby only the sole recipient parent is able to make a claim against the other using the CSA no matter what the other's earnings or contact levels. This can lead to a situation where even if contact is 50/50, the recipient parent can make a 'valid' CSA claim against the other who may earn less and receive no child benefit but still has to pay.\r\n\r\nThe system is needlessly & openly unjust, unequal and is being abused by malicious parents. Let's fix it.",
