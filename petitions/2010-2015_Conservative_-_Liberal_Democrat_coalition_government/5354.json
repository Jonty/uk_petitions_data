Where two people after many years of marriage, who have children over the age of 16, amicably agree to call it a day for whatever reason (drifting apart being a common cause), a divorce should be granted in order to minimise upset to the children.\r\n\r\nPresently, if not separated for 2-5 years, one spouse has to petition the other for just cause.  This is engineered to engender accusations and bad feeling.  Surely this is not in anyones interests (except perhaps the legal profession?).\r\n\r\nIt is high time this antequated system of divorce should be amended.\r\n\r\n",
