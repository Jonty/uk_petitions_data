        "additional_details": "Young carers have always had difficult lives and spending cuts by the government is starting to affect them even further. Due to the economy today, spending cuts are almost compulsory so we are asking for a grant. A simple one of \u00a32000 which will help the young carers and improve their lives for a few months. Just \u00a32000 will get them them outside and having fun. Please sign this petition so we can raise awareness and recognise the amazing work that these children do.",
