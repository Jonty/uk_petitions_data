        "additional_details": "Wartime code breaker Bill Tutte was responsible  for cracking the Nazi Lorenz code while working at Bletchley Park. Unlike Alan Turing who broke the Enigma code, Tutte's  work was kept secret for decades until two years before his death in 2002. Unlike Turing he was never honoured nor his work officially recognised although it led to the development of the first computer. I would like to see Bill Tutte recognised posthumously by the Government as a true war hero.",
