This amounts to unwarranted taxation.\r\n\r\nWhile the government holds investors money, investors are (a) unable to invest in other business to the detriment of the country and (b) losing return on investment.\r\n\r\nThis is completely unjustified, unfair and unnecessary.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to return investors money immediately or to otherwise compensate investors for the opportunity costs of holding their money for this extended perion.
