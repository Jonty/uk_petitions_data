        "additional_details": "We currently have a 5 day working week - only a 2 day weekend.  One weekend a year, the last Sunday of March, we lose one of the 48 hours of the weekend for the clocks to go forward.  This is always a bit depressing for all those who love that bit of time with families and friends.\r\n\r\nLet's put the clocks forward at 4pm on a Friday instead.  This will allow people to leave work an hour earlier and will be the perfect way to launch British Summertime.  I genuinely believe this small gesture would be brilliantly received in the UK and greatly appreciated by the majority.\r\n\r\nI carried out my own straw poll of 35 people and 34 of those thought it a superb idea.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks and please sign the petition if you want your extra hour at the weekend back.\r\n\r\nConnor ",
