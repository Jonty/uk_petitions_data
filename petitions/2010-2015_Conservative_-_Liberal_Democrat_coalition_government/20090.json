As the Euro membership referendum debate shows tonight, even if the the people of the UK want their parliamentarians to debate an issue openly MPs ultimately get forced into voting along the lines decided by the leadership and the whips. An MP putting career advancement in the party machine before his/her conscience and beliefs and views of constituents is wrong. This is especially the case where MPs are threatened by seat losses pursuant to the upcoming boundary changes.  The people should decide which MPs stay in parliament not the whips.\r\n\r\nSo get rid of the whip system and make MPs accountable to the people, not the leadership to whom the people have no link to or right of recourse over.\r\n\r\n",
