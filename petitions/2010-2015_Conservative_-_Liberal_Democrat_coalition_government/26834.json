We should not play their game\" followed by \"#tacticasoldascolonialism\"\r\n\r\nThis was clearly a racist comment and as a MP is totally unacceptable, especially in light of the postion Diane holds.\r\n\r\nI agree with Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi who stated on BBC Radio 5 live: \"This is racism. If this was a white member of Parliament saying that all black people want to do bad things to us he would have resigned within the hour or be sacked.For a shadow minister to hold these sort of views is intolerable, it is wrong, she needs to go.\"\r\n",
