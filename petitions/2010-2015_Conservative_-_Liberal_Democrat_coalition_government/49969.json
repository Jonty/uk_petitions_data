        "additional_details": "I live in an area where it is multi-national, which I have no problem with but when it comes to foreign people living here, alot just come here for the benefits, hang around with their buddies and drink alcohol on the street. Some have no intentions to start work and they receive these \"freebies\" (housing, jobs, healthcare etc) There are still people in the UK that need this much needed support such as the elderly, sick, homeless and even teenagers who have had troubled upbringings that would like to make something of their lives. How is it fair that benefits that these individuals recieve are sent to their own country when we as a country need growth to stimulate the economy. Our money should be spent on making these priorities, rather than turning a blind eye on the reality of what really goes on. The money can be better spent on issues that need addressing. Is this the time for something to be done??\r\n",
