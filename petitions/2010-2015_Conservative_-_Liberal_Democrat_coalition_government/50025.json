This is unfair on those students and also unnecessary as there are days with no exams at all.\r\nThe extra stress of having to remember the necessary information for multiple exams is again unnecessary and unrealistic. Students would surely achieve better results if they had only one exam per day.\r\nI would simply like the exam boards (OCR, Edexcel, AQA etc) to communicate when planning the exam dates and not schedule multiple exams for one day!
