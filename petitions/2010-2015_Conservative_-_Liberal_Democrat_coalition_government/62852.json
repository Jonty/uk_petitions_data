        "additional_details": "'Decades' ago Redbridge Borough approved planning for a car wash at 168 Snakes Lane East Woodford Green IG8 7JD, with no review since.  After an arson attack in recent years the mechanical drive through car wash has been replaced (since BP took over from Total) with a hand car wash open all day, 7-days a week.  The constant noise with staff shouting to each other, items being dragged across the concrete grounds each morning/evening they open/close, car horns blowing when they clean car interiors, the high-powered-water-jets used and the banging of items in the tin can they use as housing/drive through is constant.\r\n\r\nThis car wash approved planning should be reviewed in line with the fact this is a hightly residential area and the noise they cause affects the surrounding residents quality of life, including mine.  It is absurd there has been no review to this in decades.",
