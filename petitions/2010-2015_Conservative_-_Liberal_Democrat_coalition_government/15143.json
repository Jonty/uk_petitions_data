        "additional_details": "The problem with balancing the budget is that there is always pressure from civil servants to increase the size and cost of government. Currently 50%+ of the country's money is spent by the state.\r\n\r\n\r\nProposal for debate: that an Act be passed requiring that until government spending is within 5% of what is raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 - Hiring of new government employees be prohibited beyond 5% of retirals and other departures. Roughly 5% leave annually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 - No pay increases - either promotions or cost of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween these 2 manpower spending should fall about 10% annually in real terms which would end the deficit within one Parliament without anybody having to be fired.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps even more important it would give the civil service a strong incentive to find new ways of saving money since the sooner it is saved the sooner the sooner things can get back, hopefully not all the way back, to normal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
