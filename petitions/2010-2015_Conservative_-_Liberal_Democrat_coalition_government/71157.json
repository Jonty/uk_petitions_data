        "additional_details": "Since 1998, there has been an Iraqi and Kurdish refugee community located in the British Sovereign Base area of RAF Akrotiri. As their boat landed within British territory on the island of Cyprus, they are under Britain's jurisdiction. Despite this, the United Kingdom will not allow them to settle within the United Kingdom, and instead seeks to deport them back to Iraq and Kurdistan ravaged as it is by ISIL. The Cypriot and British authorities have stated that they must leave the British Sovereign Base Territory by January 2015, and either go back to their country of origin or any other nation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I propose that Britain accepts these refugees and that they should be permitted to move to the United Kingdom and settle here.
