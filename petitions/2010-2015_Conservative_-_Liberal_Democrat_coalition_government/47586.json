        "additional_details": "The whole of the UK electorate has an equal right to self-determination. The Scottish Nationalist-led referendum threatening the break-up of the United Kingdom should not be restricted to a minority of Scottish voters to the exclusion of the remainder of the UK electorate. This is discriminatory. The UK Government should expand the referendum to the entire UK electorate. This is our democratic right.\r\n\r\nThe proposal to extend the right to vote to 16 - 17 year olds should be dismissed. That age group is rightly considered too immature to vote on matters of national importance and concessions should not be made for the Scottish referendum. The UK Government should veto this.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government must preserve the natural resources of the UK for the whole of the British population in perpetuity. The whole of the UK has invested in the development and management of these shared resources. They are not the preserve of any one region and are owned by each of the UK's citizens equally.\r\n\r\n",
