        "additional_details": "In the small print of the budget 2014 red book George Osborne provided HMRC authorisation to raid people's bank accounts if they believe that the person owes more than \u00a31000 in tax. There is nothing stopping officials initiating this process even when a dispute is in progress.\r\n\r\nI believe that the Chancellor has breached numerous articles that have removed the rights of the population including:\r\n\r\n1. Respecting rights\r\n7. Retroactivity (in backdating a potentially criminal act)\r\n8. Privacy (depriving someone of funds could be potentially detrimental the right to family life by removing the means to pay to live)\r\n13. Effective Remedy\r\n14. Discrimination\r\n17. Abuse of Rights\r\n\r\nAdditionally it provides an unnecessary financial burden of legal action to recover funds thereby potentially restricting people to seek legal redress.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you would like to see this debated in parliament.",
