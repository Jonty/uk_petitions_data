        "additional_details": "Urgent review of national guidelines for the re-homing of abandoned dogs.  Too many centres are using risk-averse policies which are failing to service the needs of the dogs which they are entrusted to serve. Strict adherence to insurance friendly 'older children only' guidelines are resulting in too many dogs being stopped from finding a loving home. A 'common sense' policy should be adopted in which re-homing centres find reasons for re-homing a dog and not place barriers for fear of prosecution.\r\n\r\nAs an example in Hampshire, two springers could not be re homed to a family, whom already had a springer, because the dogs may jump up! Where is the logic...needless to say, the dogs are still in the re homing centre and NOT in a loving family environment. I understand that many dogs have problems and extra needs, but if people are willing to re home, know the breed but have children surely then the policy can be changed?.\r\n\r\n",
