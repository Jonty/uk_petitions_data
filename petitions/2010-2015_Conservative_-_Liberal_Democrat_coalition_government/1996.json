        "additional_details": "Tuition fees of up to \u00a39000 are ultimately unfair and price some of the poorest sections of society out higher education, because even though the fees are paid after graduation, the debt people will be in is enough to scare them away from university.\r\n\r\nVariable fees also make higher education more unfair, forcing people to choose not the best institution for them, but the one which they think they can afford.\r\n\r\nThis increases inequality and reduced social mobility and is inherently bad for the country.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the Government to review tuition fees in consider reducing them significantly or abolishing them and to equalise them across institutions. It is the only way to ensure fair access to Higher Education for all people.",
