        "additional_details": "I am calling on the UK Government to review the current situation facing people seeking sanctuary from persecution in Scotland.  Currently, in order to claim asylum, men, women and children seeking refuge in Scotland are expected to travel to Croydon, south of London, to register their application for asylum in the UK. They are expected to make this journey with no funds or support provided - that's 420 miles (from Glasgow)! Governments have an obligation under international law to ensure people fleeing persecution can access the asylum process. Currently, in the UK, and in Scotland in particular, this is made extremely difficult by UK Government policy. I am calling on the UK Government to:\r\n\r\n1. Facilitate access to the asylum process in Scotland.\r\n\r\n2. Facilitate access to end-to-end asylum support to start when someone first presents to an authority or support organisation seeking to claim asylum, right up until they are granted leave to remain or they leave the country.",
