There is no need to show such barbaric behaviour on our tv screens.\r\n\r\n These dogs are being trained to fight and are walking round like loaded guns,they could attack anybody or  any animal at any time.\r\n\r\nWhat we want the Government to do is ban these programmes from being filmed and if that isnt possible.We want the names of the owner's given to the police so they have the power to seize the dogs.\r\n\r\nThey need to be taken out of those enviroments and the owners need prosecuting. These people are training these dogs to be nasty and one day they will turn on their own. Its not the dogs fault.Its the owners who are bad in these situations.\r\n\r\nLet's stop it now please before it's an even bigger problem than it already is.",
