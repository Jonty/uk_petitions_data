        "additional_details": "I would like the government to put a cap on income tax, whereby the maximum any individual would pay on their earnings would be \u00a3100,000 per annum.  \u00a3100,000 is enough for anyone to contribute, and many people who now hide their wealth overseas or use tax loopholes would willingly contribute this amount. Bringing in such a cap would result in a huge number of individuals already in the country and from overseas declaring their incomes, thereby generating vast sums for the government, who could then raise the tax-free allowance for everybody.  This would benefit the lower paid earners. I believe that millionaires the world over would be queuing up to deposit their money in the UK and pay the \u00a3100,000.",
