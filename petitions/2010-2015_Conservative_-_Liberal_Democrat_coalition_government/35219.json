With the news today of a couple of UK banks having the credit rating reduced it is going to be harder to lend money and therefore the government plans to stimulate the UK economy will fail.\r\n\r\nWe need to reduce fuel duty tax by 50p to help business and Joe public which will in turn help stimulate the UK economy.\r\n\r\nThis would bring the cost of fuel to around 89p per L. That would help businesses and the people who depend on there cars to get around and help give the economy a kick start. then every 12month put it up 10p per year for 5 year. to bring it back inline when the economy will be hopefully back on its feet ",
