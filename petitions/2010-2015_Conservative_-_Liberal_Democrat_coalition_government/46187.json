        "additional_details": "This petition is against the petition sweeping the internet to get Page 3 banned from our newspapers.\r\n\r\nPage 3 has been an iconic feature of our tabloids for many years and there is no reason for it to be banned.\r\n\r\nMany female models make a living out of this, this is their career path. Many people could lose jobs out of the banning of Page 3. The argument is that Page 3 is demoralizing. It is not for these women. They make this choice, this is their job that they love.\r\n\r\nThe girls of Page 3 are also known to raise an incredible amount of money for charity.\r\n\r\nPlease, models and fans of Page 3, sign below and show your support to keeping Page 3 in our newspaper.",
