        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the collection of criminal evidence of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) by the physical examination of girls, who are identified as being at risk: Thereby removing the need for children to make a complaint against their parents and family before a case for prosecution can be made.\r\n\r\nSecondly, to provide significant central funding to set up localised FGM Safeguarding partnership programmes, which will co-ordinate the protection of likely future victims, the prevention of FGM and the prosecution of perpetrators.\r\n\r\nThe number of little girls in the UK at risk of being violently abused in this way is currently estimated at 30,000; 10,000 more than 10 years ago. There has been a law against Female Genital Mutilation throughout the UK since 1985. However there has also been a total failure of Safeguarding processes and the criminal justice system to prevent FGM,\r\nto protect defenceless children and to prosecute the perpetrators.\r\n\r\nPlease support this petition.",
