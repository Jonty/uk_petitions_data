        "additional_details": "Following the Ched Evans debate, should it not be compulsory for all professional sportsmen and women to have criminal records (DBS) checks done to ensure that they are safe to work with certain groups of people? For example, sportsmen and women have regular contact with children and if they have been found guilty of, for example, a sexual offence, then they shouldn't be placed in situations where vulnerable people could be at risk. I therefore petition for the government to enforce a law where all sportsmen and women have to undertake compulsory assessments, such as DBS, to ascertain if they are safe to work with certain vulnerable groups. This would therefore be similar to what is required of doctors and teachers. ",
