Their budget is 12 BILLION POUNDS of tax payers money that is designated to be given away to foreign countries. Use British tax payer\u2019s money to help the British and stop giving it away to nuclear states like India who have their own aid program! The money required should not be squeezed out of the hard pressed British public when the money is already there.   ",
