We did the right thing in Libya and we should be proud that we stepped up when it mattered. We need to do the same again with or without full UN backing.\r\n\r\nI don't want us to look back and say we should have done something sooner and be obliged to apologise to the Syrian people for standing by while tanks bombard civilians and troops prepare for a ground attack.\r\n\r\nThis is a mass slaughter in progress and looking likely to get worse.\r\n\r\nLet's send in our attack planes and remove the Syrian army from the periphery of Homs. They are killing their own people just like Gadaffi.\r\n\r\n",
