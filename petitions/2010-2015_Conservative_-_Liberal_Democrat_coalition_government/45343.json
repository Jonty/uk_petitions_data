The FSA have had to employ hundreds of extra people to handle these claims. If Banks were made to cover these costs with a fee added to every claim resolved. The FSA could cover their costs. Banks would think twice before refusing 60% of genuine claims. The economy would benefit with the PPI compensation being in peoples pockets rather than Banks coffers. The FSA would reduce their costs. A win, win, win, for the Treasury. and the UK.",
