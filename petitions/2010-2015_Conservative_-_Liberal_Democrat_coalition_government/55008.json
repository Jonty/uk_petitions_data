        "additional_details": "For students who have turned 19 and still at College or Sixth Form, they have to pay for their travel with only 30% discount. For some families with financial difficulties or students without a part-time job, this is a huge financial burden that will affect their ability to attend their educational establishment.\r\nWe want TFL to change the terms of the 18+ Oyster so students above 18 can have continued free travel or at least 50% discount instead of 30%. We feel this will help students considerably in our already difficult financial times. ",
