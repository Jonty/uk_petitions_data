        "additional_details": "The current British Government needs to increase its defence spend and reemploy our troops it has just sacked. The UK is the 4th most powerful military nation and the second country in Europe with the power to project it\u2019s military. The last time we cut defence spending in the last century, our country was left defenceless at the last moment and had to rely on the USA to supply & bail us out of the WW1/WW2/Cold war. If we are unable to defend our neighbours let alone the Home nations, the UK could be left defenceless and bankrupt from inconsistent spending. E.g. Mass loans to fuel urgent resupply of arms at the last moment. As tensions have increased in Eastern Europe with Russia, we must ensure that our defence forces can sustain it momentum to defend our nations & allies. Let\u2019s not repeat the same mistakes of the past and maintain our power to neutralise threats that maintain peace in Europe.\r\n(The UK should not go to war but should have strategy in place to defend itself).\r\n",
