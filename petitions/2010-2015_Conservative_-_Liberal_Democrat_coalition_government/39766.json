        "additional_details": "There are many millions of degree holders who were taught at UK universities who have NEVER paid a penny.  If it is right to charge, today, GBP9000.00p to obtain a degree at a UK university then it is right that those who gained access to highly paid employment through having a free university degree should be obliged, now, to make that same contribution.  Every doctor, lawyer, engineer and ALL MPs were educated at the cost of the taxpayer.  If ANYBODY who holds a degree is being paid over GBP21,000.00p it is probably because they have a degree and therefore they should be made to pay for it.",
