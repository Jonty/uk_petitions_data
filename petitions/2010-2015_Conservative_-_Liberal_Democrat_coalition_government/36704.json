        "additional_details": "I believe that it is deeply unfair that an unmarried parent cannot claim Widowed Parents Allowance if their partner dies.\r\n\r\nThe allowance is calculated on the NI contributions of the deceased parent (who will of course, never claim their entitled state pension based upon their earnings), and therefore, the marital status of a child's parents should have no standing.\r\n\r\nEvery child that has lost a parent should be entitled to the same level of support regardless of their parents' marital status.\r\n\r\nI would like to see the entitlement criteria for Widowed Parents Allowance revised, so that it may support all lone parents whose deceased partners made sufficient NI contributions.\r\n",
