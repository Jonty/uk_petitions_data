        "additional_details": "Provide Lemtrada for everyone with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis who fit the criteria set out by NICE within the 3 month timescale. Many people are waiting for this treatment which has the potential to stop multiple sclerosis in it's tracks, and in some cases reverse previous damage. Not only can this treatment vastly improve peoples lives but it can save the NHS a lot of money. The cost of Lemtrada is around \u00a356,000 per person, when you compare this to Tysabri, another infusion treatment, which costs approximately \u00a3100,000 per person per year, this is a massive saving. It also could reduce the amount of disability benefit claimants as they would potentially be able to return to work. This treatment needs to be provided at all hospitals for all people who wish to have it, who are eligible, well within the stated NICE deadline of 3 months.",
