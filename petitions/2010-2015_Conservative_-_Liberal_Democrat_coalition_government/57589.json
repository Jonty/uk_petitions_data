        "additional_details": "The key recommendation that IPSA (Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority) has made is to increase the basic salary of MPs from its current annual rate of \u00a366,396 to \u00a374,000 in 2015 - an increase of \u00a37,604\r\n\r\nthe ISPA has announced a package of detailed proposals so the consequences for MPs' bank accounts are a slightly more mixed bag.\r\n\r\nPay:\r\nIt's not just an increase - MPs' pay will be tied to annual growth in average earnings. Given that 2015 average earnings aren't yet known, the increase would actually be between \u00a373,365 and \u00a383,430, but ISPA thought it best that \"in recognition of the current difficult economic circumstances we recommend that the salary be set at the lower end of this range: \u00a374,000\r\n",
