The law must apply to all institutions where \u2018Regulated Activities\u2019 take place, mandating all staff who know, suspect, or have reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting child abuse, to inform the Local Authority Designated Officer, children's services or the police. This is the only way to ensure that an independent assessment can happen right away, and to stop perpetrators as soon as possible. The statutory guidance system has failed; it\u2019s time for tougher laws to protect children now.",
