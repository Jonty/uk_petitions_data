        "additional_details": "In light of the riots in the UK, it has become apparent that the UK has an issue in how we deal with and sentence minors when they commit crimes. Such as only being able to issue say ASBO's and referral orders.\r\nWhat is proposed is that in cases like the ones that have arisen in the riot that these minors are given deferred sentences.\r\nFor example they are treated like an adult when receiving a sentence from the courts but it is deferred until they reach adult age, at which point they must serve it.\r\nAt the point they are expected to serve the sentence these minors should be put back in front of the courts. If they can show that in the years since their deferred sentence was given that they have changed they ways and become a decent member of society, they sentence could be reduced or quashed,  providing an incentive for these minors to change.",
