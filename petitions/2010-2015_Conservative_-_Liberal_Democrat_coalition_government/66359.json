        "additional_details": "We want the Government to put an end to the media's biased reporting against Muslims. Why does a crime committed by a Muslim necessitate having their religion brought to the public's attention.\r\n\r\nWhen a crime is committed by a Christian his religion is never mentioned, when a crime is committed by a Muslim the media is sure to mention his religion, why?\r\n\r\nIt seems like the media has some sort of vendetta against Muslims, and it seem the Government is complacent in this.\r\n\r\nReminds me of Americas racial attitudes in the 1950's and 60's. Shame we're in the 21st century and still have so many narrow-minded and xenophobes amongst us.\r\n\r\nWe need to stop these hateful tactics used against the Muslims in the United Kingdom and we have 100,000+ people who feel the same way!
