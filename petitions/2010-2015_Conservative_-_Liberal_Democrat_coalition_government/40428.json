        "additional_details": "The UK Govt (both National and Local) is expected to set a budget of approx \u00a3676bn in 2013.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense for UK Govt expenditures funded by UK Tax payers to be spent in the overall National Interest.\r\n\r\nEach 1% of Govt expenditure switched into the UK economy is worth an initial \u00a36.7bn and even more once the impact of secondary purchases through the value chain are captured - jobs, profits and taxes will all benefit.\r\n\r\nWere UK Suppliers preferred in 5% of Govt contracts by value otherwise awarded to overseas contractors, this would result in an initial direct value to the British economy of \u00a334bn - this is equivalent to 2.1% of projected GDP.\r\n\r\nPls support this petition.",
