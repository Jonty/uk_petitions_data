The indicator to measure: how well the majority believe the authority members and officers have delivered services and responded with prompt open positive intent; and how well they have interpreted, complied with and delivered statutory requirements incumbent upon them.  In recognition of the substantial local tax levied, we request that the indicator include provision for: how openly transparent the majority see the level of service available to them; how well the perception enhances the quality of their life and environment; and how well it delivers against a mechanism of scrutiny and inspection to ensure and maintain a standard of quality.",
