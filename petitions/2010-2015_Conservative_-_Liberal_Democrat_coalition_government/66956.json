        "additional_details": "I believe all LGV / HGV instructors should have to be DVSA registered like car instructors to teach for reward. Some are on the DVSA voluntary register but I think all should be DVSA registered so the public receive professional training every time. This would stop the general public paying large amounts of money to companies and not getting professional training they require. This is what is happening at the moment\r\n\r\nMost of the public don't realise they are getting taught by a person who is not qualified or doesn't have to be qualified, they only held their licence for 3 years or more. for example 'A student learning in a vehicle capable of 44t (approx. 400% heavier than average car) driving through town & city centres at 30 mph by an unqualified person that may not even drive LGV/HGV regular'.",
