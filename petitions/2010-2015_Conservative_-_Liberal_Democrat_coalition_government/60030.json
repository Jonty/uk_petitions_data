        "additional_details": "They are not fit for purpose, they are overturning GP's / Surgeons / Specialists advice to claimants, forcing people to work when they're not fit for work, the claimants then have the stress of a tribunal, only to overturn ATOS decisions, decisions made by medical staff, not Doctors or Specialists as the government would like us to think. There is no need for a medical assessment at all, once the claimant has been signed off by their own GP / Surgeon there is no need for anyone else to asses, trust the Medical Profession.  This is costing the taxpayer not saving on the welfare bill.  It is costing lives. Sack ATOS and put a stop to assessments right now.",
