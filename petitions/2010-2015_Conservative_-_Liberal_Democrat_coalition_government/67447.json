        "additional_details": "Me, and many other people of the UK want to reduce the dominance of London within the UK and create more local economies for local people.\r\n\r\nI am suggesting that the government should merge the 10 boroughs of Greater Manchester in much the same way that each of the 32 boroughs of London have close ties with each other, making London regarded as one, united city. I want this idea to be brought to Manchester, so that it can compete on the same level as London with other worldwide megacity counterparts. We want more cities in the UK that have worldwide recognition and large economies, instead of pouring all our efforts into London, a city that most British people have no connections with.\r\n\r\nLondon population - 8,445,066, area - 606.95 sq mi\r\n(Greater) Manchester population - 2,685,400, area - 493 sq mi\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to consider signing this petition and let's help the UK's cities flourish economically.",
