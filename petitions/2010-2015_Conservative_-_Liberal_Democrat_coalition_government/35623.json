        "additional_details": "It has been apparent that the retail parts of British Banks have been compromised by the \"Casino\" or Investment arms of the same. Not only financially, but their reputation. High Street Customers and Savers have seen their interest rates plummet whilst massive bonuses have remained.\r\nAnd now on top of this the \"LIBOR\" scandal has made this change imperative.\r\nRingfencing is not enough, the Banks will find a way to circumvent this, let's face it they've been proven untrustworthy. Please sign this petition for a split not a ring fence",
