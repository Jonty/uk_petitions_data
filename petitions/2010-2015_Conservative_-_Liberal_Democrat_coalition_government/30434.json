My child cannot have school dinners every day so why should someone on benefits? Do these children go without lunch at home on the weekend and holidays?\r\n\r\nStop free breakfast being delivered to homes because a couple decided to have so many kids and are now struggling.\r\n\r\nStop making it so easy for these people to have help and children, make these people realise that having children is their responsibility and not everyone elses. They chose to bring them into the world same as any other parent, we have to deal with cuts and cost of living when will they?\r\n",
