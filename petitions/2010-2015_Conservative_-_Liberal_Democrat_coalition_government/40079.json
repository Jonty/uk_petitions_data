        "action": "BINGO - Fair taxation for fair competition",
        "additional_details": "Bingo is popular with a large number of people from a broad spectrum of the population.  It provides a vital social occasion in many communities and is friendly and welcoming activity. It is a far less aggressive form of gambling than others and is socially inclusive. Despite this, it has historically been taxed at a higher rate than other forms of gambling (20% as opposed to 15% plus corporation tax). This is unfair, anti-competitive and biased. This petition calls for a reduction in the taxation levelled on Bingo operators to that raised from other forms of gambling. ",
