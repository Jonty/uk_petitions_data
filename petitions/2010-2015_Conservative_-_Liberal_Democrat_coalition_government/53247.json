        "additional_details": "We would like the Minister for Culture to ensure that a genuine and democratic Public Consultation is held with the people of Lincolnshire prior to library closures and the removal of all library services to some 200+ rural villages.\r\n\r\nAt an LCC overview and scrutiny committee meeting, a motion was proposed, seconded and won - defeating the current Public Consultation as not fit for purpose.\r\n\r\nThe results went back to the Executive Committee who decided to ignore this democratic outcome and chose to go forward with the existing Consultation.\r\n\r\nThe current consultation results will have no effect on the already announced closures and each meeting is little more than a thinly veiled press-gang for voluntary workers.\r\n\r\nCllr. Anne Reynolds\r\n\r\n",
