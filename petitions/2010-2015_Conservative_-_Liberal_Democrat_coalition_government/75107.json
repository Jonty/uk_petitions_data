        "additional_details": "The National Police Air Service (NPAS) have announced that a number of existing police helicopter bases are to close.\r\n\r\nThe NPAS say that 98% of the population will be within 20 minutes flying time from a police air base.\r\n\r\nThis is all well and good if you live in an urban area where the 20 minute range circles overlap providing air cover from more than one helicopter base.\r\n\r\nIn rural, sparsely populated areas however, helicopter cover will be reduced as these areas are further than 20 minutes from any of the proposed air bases.\r\n\r\nThe areas at risk are large areas of rural Wales, East Anglia, Cornwall, Cumbria and the Lake District.\r\n\r\n Please sign this petition to ask for a re-evaluation of this important service.\r\n",
