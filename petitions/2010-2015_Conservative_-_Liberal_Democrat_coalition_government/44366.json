To have this removed is an enfringement of the benefits afforded to taxpayers.\r\n\r\nTo establish what constitutes being arrested for riotous assembly, that includes violence, blockading roads, acting in an intimidatory manner towards members of the public; In order to police this matter in the respective parts of the UK, policing should be sought from neutral parts of the UK, for example, the metropolitan police should police NI riots as they would be neutral and not acting according to a political agenda.\r\n",
