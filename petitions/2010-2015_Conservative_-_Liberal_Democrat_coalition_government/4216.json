        "additional_details": "We want the government to legalise marijuana ONLY for medicinal purposes. It has been proven in trials that marijuana when used for medicinal purposes has numerous benefits. This drug has been used for centuries as a medicine and is already legal in certain states of America, and Canada. This should NOT be made available to those without a proven medical condition, and be managed and regulated as it is in the USA and Canada. It has proved to be beneficial to sufferers of many diseases including the following:\r\n\r\nSevere pain and/or persistent muscle spasms from multiple sclerosis;\r\nSevere pain and/or persistent muscle spasms from a spinal cord injury;\r\nSevere pain and/or persistent muscle spasms from spinal cord disease;\r\nSevere pain, cachexia, anorexia, weight loss, and/or severe nausea from cancer;\r\nSevere pain, cachexia, anorexia, weight loss, and/or severe nausea from HIV/AIDS infection;\r\nSevere pain from severe forms of arthritis; or\r\nSeizures from epilepsy.\r\n",
