        "additional_details": "There are proposed plans to re build a \u00a34 million pound open air lido in Pontypridd. Pontypridd is the largest town in Wales without a swimming pool. It is also the home of the University of South Wales; the largest university in Wales in terms of student numbers.\r\nThis petition is to suggest Rhondda Cynon Taf council reconsider whether this is the right decision. The RCT council & University can work together to build a more sustainable, year round indoor aquatics facility that can be utilised by both local residents and students alike.",
