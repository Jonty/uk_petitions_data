        "additional_details": "There is no law in the UK regarding the burning of waste garden material. As such many people feel they have a right to burn it in their gardens.\r\nGarden bonfires produce toxic smoke that is prejudicial to health and as such should not be permitted.\r\nThere are excellent recycling centers in all towns and cities allowing free disposal of waste garden materials.\r\nAs such I would like a law introduced to forbid the burning of all waste garden materials.",
