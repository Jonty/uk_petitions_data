        "action": "Ban the high jumps at horse racing",
        "additional_details": "There is a need to ban the cruel act that is horse racing! So many horses die needlessly at horse racing events due to the jumps being set too high. This is a sick act in which people are putting betting and the enjoyment of this sport before the welfare of these animals. To a certain extent these animals are well looked after, but at the end of the day how can someone compare the stress that these animals go through when they are whipped and challenged across an endless number of extremley high and dangerous jumps !!!? Yet ironically the news shows a woman putting a cat in a bin and is arrested and sent to court!!! Where is the sympathy for these horses when in just 3 days of the Cheltenham races 5 horses have died!!!! Does that not speak volumes??\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to at least ban the high jumps at horse racing - every signature counts!!!\r\n\r\nThank you, Gabrielle",
