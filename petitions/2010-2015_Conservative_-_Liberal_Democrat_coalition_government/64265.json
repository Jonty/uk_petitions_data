        "additional_details": "Former Leader of Westminster City Council, Shirley Porter was found guilty of wilful misconduct and gerrymandering following the 'Homes for Votes' scandal of the 1980s.\r\n\r\nThat she continues to hold the title 'Dame Commander of the British Empire' is, we believe an insult to the democratic process in the United Kingdom.  We further believe that while she continues to hold this honour all past, present and indeed future honours are, or will be thought tarnished.\r\n\r\nWe respectfully request that this honour given to Shirley Porter be removed.",
