        "additional_details": "MPs are responsible for the state of education and healthcare in the UK and insist that they are doing what is best with regards to these responsibilities. If this is true, then there is no reason for them to object if they are required to enrol their children and grandchildren in the same schools that everyone else uses instead of private school and for their families (them, their spouse, children, children's partners and grandchildren) to be required to use the NHS.\r\n\r\nThey have no current incentive to improve these system because they are not part of them. This needs to change.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to make it mandatory for any MP and their family to be required to use state education and health care like the people that they represent.",
