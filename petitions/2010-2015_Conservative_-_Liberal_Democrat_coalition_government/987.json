I believe these vans should be parked at the depots of their employers as the vans are an eyesore, especially if there are several together.\r\n\r\nI would like the Government to stop this practice of commercial vehicles parking overnight in residential areas - usually NOT outside their own houses usually outside someone else's - causing conflict.",
