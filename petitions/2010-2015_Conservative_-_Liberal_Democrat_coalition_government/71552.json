        "additional_details": "With modern technology allowing microprocessor controlled accuracy of timing, it is imoral and should be illegal to over charge for parking spaces. Setting the granularity of parking charges to 1 hour, 2-4 hours etc. is a simple exercise in extortion. electronic ticketing and microporcessor control means that car parks know to the minute when a vehicle enters and exits.\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable for a airport car park to charge by the day, but it is not for an inner city car park to manipulate timings so you averagely shop for just over 2 hours but are forced to pay for 4 hours.\r\n\r\nReasonable per 5 minute parking charges would promote commerce and inner city shopping experience, the current system detracts from it considerably.\r\n\r\nThe governement should make it illegal to extort money through overpayment for car parking by regulating opperators into setting reasonable granularity ( 5  minutes) to allow for exit and entry times.
