This is a situation that needs to be rectified.\r\n- there is a need to support the victims of human trafficking and to make greater efforts to secure convictions against the traffickers and those associated with them.\r\n- review low levels of funding for law enforcement agencies to fight trafficking, and review of the number of children missing from local authority care as there is a growing connection between local authority care facilities and trafficking.\r\n- To create more awareness and education around the uk about human trafficking to encourage the nation to understand that they can help prevent human trafficking in their everyday lives. for example by buying fairtrade products\r\n\u3000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
