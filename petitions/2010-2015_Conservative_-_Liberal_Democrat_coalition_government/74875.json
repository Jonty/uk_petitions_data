Because of this and to gain the most respect from their constituents, their only income should be the salary they earn for being a MP.\r\nAs from 1 Jan 17, any person wishing to become a MP, should not be allowed to own any stocks and shares or proprietary interests or rights in any companies or organisations.\r\nThis will be the rule for the whole time that they are a Member of Parliament. This will mean that when MP's are debating important issues such as Climate Change, Renewable Energies etc. their decisions could not be influenced by financial gain, for instance, if they have shares in an oil company.
