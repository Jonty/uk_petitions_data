        "additional_details": "On the 26th February Azerbaijan mourns the 21st anniversary of one of the darkest days in its history. On this day in 1992 Armenian armed forces brutally murdered 613 civilian inhabitants of the town of Khojaly in the illegally occupied region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Twenty-one years after this fateful day we remember those who died during events, which led up to the illegal occupation of around 18% of Azerbaijan's sovereign territory, which still continues to this day in direct contravention of four UN Security Council Resolutions. We the undersigned urge the Prime Minister to condemn this shocking act and the continuing Armenian occupation of Azerbaijani territories, which prevent 875,000 Azerbaijani refugees and internally displaced persons from returning to their homes.",
