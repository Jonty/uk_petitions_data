        "additional_details": "This uncivilised law dates back to 1824 and came into effect before the abolition of slavery and child labour. It is still enforced by the police when they arrest the homeless for begging and confiscate the free will offerings that people have given them. I have recently contacted the Ministry of Justice on this issue, who have informed me that, \"The Government currently has no plans to make changes to this law.\" Since society has not yet reached the point of moral progress that prevents people from ending up on the street, then the least we should expect is for homeless people to have the chance to remain fed and protected by asking others for help, especially as British weather becomes ever more inhospitable. When we consider that real criminals live in prisons resembling cheap hotels, it is a cruel twist of justice that sees the misfortunate persecuted by those who should be there to help, backed up by a law that runs counter to every religious text and the basic conscience of man.",
