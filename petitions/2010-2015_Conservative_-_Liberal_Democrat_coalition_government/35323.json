        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, petition the government to establish equal rights for all couples to get married and use the word 'marriage' for that union in law, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.\r\n\r\nThe law already recognises the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people to love, and have relationships that are protected from discrimination. These couples can legally have those relationships recognised in the form of civil partnerships, but we ask for legislation that will give an equal right to marriage, for all.\r\n\r\nWe believe the underlying law of the land should detach equal rights to marriage, from religious objections and practices, since the state is not a religion.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to remove the clear discrimination and unfairness which presently exists.",
