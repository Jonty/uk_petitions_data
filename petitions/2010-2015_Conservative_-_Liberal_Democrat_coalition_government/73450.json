All computer pricing should show a basic price plus the cost of the operating system . This is to combat the artifically high software prices created by the perceived Microsoft monopoly on computer operating systems . This will have a number of benefits which include a reduction in money leaving the country to pay for Microsoft software , & a longer life for computers which are scrapped simply because the public  cannot afford high Microsoft updated software prices .",
