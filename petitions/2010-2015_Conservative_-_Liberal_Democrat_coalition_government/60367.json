        "additional_details": "There are a great deal of hard-working tax payers in the UK and some of them pay that much tax they are systematically getting \"Scrimps and scrapes\" of their paycheck.\r\n\r\nTo avoid people who are hardworking to dip below the poverty line, I think there should be an instatement of a \"Social bond\" Which the government would give a certain taxpayer to help them cope. For example, taxpayers who barely have enough money for their weekly shopping, rent or utility bills.\r\n\r\nThis petition should only apply to hard-working taxpayers who've paid their tax in full for at least 5-10 years. So people who would be exempt from this and not being able to apply would consist of:\r\n\u2022 Non taxpayers (Tax avoiders/on job seeking allowance or any other benefit that means you're not in work and paying tax)\r\n\u2022People who haven't paid tax for at least five years.\r\n\u2022Self employed workers\r\n--\r\nPeople who should be prioritised are those in poverty stricken areas earning the lowest wage.",
