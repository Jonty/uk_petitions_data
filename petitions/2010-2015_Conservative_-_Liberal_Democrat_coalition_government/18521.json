        "additional_details": "Bullying is a big problem in the UK, Sometimes Bullying can lead people to self-harm and other health problems. Bullying has been proven to effect GCSE grades. From personal experience schools fail to deal with Bullying effectively, and not enough action is been taken. If we change the law to make Bullying illegal it will certainly improve GCSE results for students, increase health and well-being for students. The Government needs to enforce the law, they can do this by, stricter discipline in classes, easier methods to report bullying, and a high punishment for Bullying. The schools should forward serious Bullying cases to the Police. We should stop students from getting too many warnings, and we should take action. Bullying can lead to truancy, it is estimated it is costing the economy \u00a3800 million. We can save money and make lives better all across the UK.\r\n\r\n",
