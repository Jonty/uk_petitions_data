        "additional_details": "The rules for consumer credit firms are that you must have assets worth 20% - 50% of the money you borrow. When you want to start your own business, its easier to just borrow money from a consumer credit firm without having to get assets worth 50% of the money you want to borrow. When you do start your own business after borrowing, you would pay the consumer credit firm back and that's not a problem. I would like the government to make borrowing money from consumer credit firms easier which is you don't have to have assets worth 50% of the money you want to borrow from the consumer credit firm.",
