There are many competitions around the world for BJJ and I have had many BJJ members saying that they hope that one day it is introduced into the Olympics. It would be a fantastic opportunity for those who are into the sport.\r\n\r\nFor more information on Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu take a look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu to see for yourself what it is all about.
