        "additional_details": "We would like the right to leave flowers at the site of our friends death, to remember him (as we have done for years gone by). He is not buried in the local area so unfortunately we cannot visit his grave to do so. Tetney Parish Council recently made the decision to stop us from doing so and we have been informed any flowers or any other memorials left by friends and family members will be removed as they are a distraction to drivers. We would like this decision over-turned and to come to an arrangement which is safe for everyone on the roads, but also allows us to peacefully not forget a kind, wonderful and greatly missed friend to many.",
