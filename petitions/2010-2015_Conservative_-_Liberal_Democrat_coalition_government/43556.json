You don't actually give a damn about the gun murder rate in America.\"\r\n\r\nMore than 31,600 people have signed the petition, which hit the 25,000-signature threshold to get a White House response.\r\n\r\nCalling on all British people to respond appropriately and flood this petition with more signatures than the Americans raise to deport him\r\n\r\nBesides the obvious benefits to Great Britain keeping Piers Morgan in America is a way that we Brits can make clears our feelings regarding gun laws in America.",
