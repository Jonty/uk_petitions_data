        "additional_details": "Every year, millions of animals are killed for the clothing industry\u2014all in the name of fashion. Whether the clothes come from Chinese fur farms, Indian slaughterhouses, the Australian outback, or right here in the UK an immeasurable amount of suffering goes into every fur-trimmed jacket, leather belt, and wool. Feathers are ripped off the backs of birds, bleeding gaping wounds with no pain relief are sewn back up and left to grow back for another human material. If this was happening to humans; there would be an outrage. A person is attacked by an animal. Compete outrage, the animal is killed. Yet here we are torturing them for there skin. What gives humans the right. It's disgraceful and we must change the law! This has to stop. There are so many alternative more Eco friendly materials that can be used. This is old fashioned, cruel and morally wrong. Please sign to make it stop.",
