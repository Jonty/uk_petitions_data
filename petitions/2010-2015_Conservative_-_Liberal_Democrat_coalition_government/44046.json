        "additional_details": "To stop car chases involving police all new cars should have wireless networking built into engine management systems. Each car could have a code stored in DVLA that the police could use to disable that engine.\r\n\r\nIf a car fails to stop, all the police need to do is send the code to the engine. That will effectively stop the car. This would save many lives and could be used against stolen vehicles.\r\n\r\nEncryption would be used to stop any random signal affecting any engines.\r\n\r\nThe govenment need to make this law for all new cars/bikes.",
