        "additional_details": "The Law of Joint Enterprise must be revoked, and it must be made retrospective so that all previous cases are reheard and the people concerned treated as individuals and held accountable solely for their possible criminal actions, and not the actions of the sole perpetrator.\r\n\r\nThe law of Joint Enterprise allows innocent people to be convicted of henious crimes which they clearly did not commit. Dereck Bentley is a prime example of the consequences of this barbaric law which continues to routinely destroys innocent peoples lifes, and the lifes of their families.Joint Enterprise has no place in a self proclaimed civilised society, and we demand it is revoked.Individuals are responsible for their criminal actions, not the criminal actions of the sole perpetrator",
