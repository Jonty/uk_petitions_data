        "additional_details": "Over 850,000 children in the UK have been diagnosed with a mental health issue, however there are also a significant number who are currently battling against similar problems but have not been able to reach out for help. Currently CAMHS (child and adolescent mental health service) requires that anyone under the age of 16, first has to obtain their parent's permission in order to get the help they desperately need. This is not, however, an option that many children can take, as they may not have the courage to tell them or their parents may be part of the problem.\r\n\r\nThere are children that need urgent help in order to tackle feelings of depression, suicide, paranoia and the likes, but are being prevented from doing so, despite wanting the help. It is of vital importance that the government allows a child of any age to reach out to the mental health service without any worry of the repercussions. ",
