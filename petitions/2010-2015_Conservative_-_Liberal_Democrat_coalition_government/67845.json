UK Government should implement recommendations of House of Lords Science & Technology Report  http://tinyurl.com/nbqbvca\r\n\r\n- Treat student numbers separately for immigration policy making   purposes.\r\n- Review the package for international students every two years to   ensure it is globally competitive.\r\n- Improve the way information is provided to prospective students to ensure welcoming and clear language is used.\r\n\r\nWhen we need to send the message that international STEM students will get a warm welcome in the UK, they\u2019re getting the cold shoulder and heading elsewhere.\r\n\r\nInternational students contribute significantly to university finances, often partly subsidizing courses for domestic students. They also make a huge contribution to the academic, intellectual and cultural vibrancy of UK universities, and enrich the experience for domestic students.",
