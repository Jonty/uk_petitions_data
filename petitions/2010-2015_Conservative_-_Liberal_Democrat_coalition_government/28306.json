We want lower fuel costs, thus helping the economy because transportation costs for goods will be less good for businesses, food will be cheaper good for general public, filling up will save general public less etc\r\n\r\nMore focus on service by companies.  Give tax incentives for great service, instead of as is at the moment where its all about being greedy. Tax breaks for smaller businesses.\r\n\r\nMake working a good option whereas it is too easy not to work & people like me pay for these people who cannot be bothered to work.  If they cannot be bothered get them mending roads, schools, parks etc\r\n\r\nSTOP all benefits for Non-British.  If enough \"stamp\" has not been paid then you do not receive.\r\n\r\nSTOP giving prisioners an easy ride, prision isn't punishment anymore as they have games, tv's, games consoles.  Make them work chain gangs and work as part of their punishment.",
