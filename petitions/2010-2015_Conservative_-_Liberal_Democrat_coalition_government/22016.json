        "additional_details": "HGV's pose a risk to all motorists when overtaking and in addition slow down the carriageway when 2 come together side by side with the same speed restriction devices fitted to them. I myself was involved in an accident when a lorry pulled out into the middle lane and did not see me. Sometimes this happens in error, other times it is a lorry driver bullying other law abiding motorists with a 'hit me or give way' type attitude. By outlawing HGV's using the middle lane the number of accidents on UK motorways would be reduced.\r\n\r\nPlease support.",
