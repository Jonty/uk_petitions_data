The contract for egg and sperm donation by a couple must be drafted on the understanding that once donated, the embryo can be used for IVF in the future by either one of the biological couple, without further consent by the other half of the couple (regardless of whether a biological sperm or egg donor). There should be a presumption of implied consent that a biological donor of sperm or egg for his/her frozen embryo to be given IVF sometime in the future, without the need for further consent if one of the biological donors requested for an IVF either immediately or at a future date.  The clinics doing the IVF should however be regulated under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) or its equivalent.",
