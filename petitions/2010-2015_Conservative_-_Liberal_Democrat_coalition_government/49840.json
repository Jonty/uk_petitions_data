        "additional_details": "As the numbers of older people in care continues to grow promoting Dignity in Care will enable us to highlight the level of knowledge and standard of excellence we expect from all our services. Alongside consistent application of good practice we need a major cultural shift in the way the system thinks about dignity, and we need to work together with other organisations in creating care environments for people with dementia that promote independence, help reduce anxiety and distress, and help people feel safe.\r\nThis campaign is to :\r\n~ raise awareness of Dignity in Care\r\n~ raise awareness of the needs of people living with dementia\r\n~ raise awareness of the political agenda for Dignity in Care\r\n~ inspire local people to take action\r\n~ share good practice and give impetus to positive innovation\r\n~ give people a voice\r\n~ reward and recognise those people who make a difference and go that extra mile.\r\nWe are looking to obtain 1 million signatures in support of raising this awareness.",
