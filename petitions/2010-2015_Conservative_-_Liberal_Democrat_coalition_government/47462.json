        "action": "That the Government do a deal to secure the UK's energy future by helping Cyprus",
        "additional_details": "The Government should (quickly) move to do a deal to help Cyprus through its current financial difficulties to help secure the UK's energy future and bolster relations with our most important Mediterranean friend and ally. We could also use the opportunity to improve relations with Russia through helping overseas Russian savers/depositors in the country. In return the UK could receive underlying rights to Cypriot natural gas assets or a securitisation crystallised over proportion of the future receivables from Cypriot natural gas assets. The 18 billion or so needed is a drop in the ocean to us and the potential return far outweighs the initial short-term outlay. It would make a superb long term investment that could significantly aid the UK economy in the future.",
