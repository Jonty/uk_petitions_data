        "additional_details": "The policy of Scottish firearms officers now carrying their weapons on routine patrols is unnecessary and fuels a climate of fear.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re calling on you to revert this policy. For safety, firearms should be locked away and only taken out by a firearms officer when it is deemed necessary and authorised by a senior officer.\r\n\r\nWhy is this important?\r\n\r\nIf police carry arms routinely, this will fuel fear and criminals might arm themselves more heavily.\r\n\r\nDespite this, a number of police officers (around 300) are now routinely carrying sidearms while on patrol in much of Scotland. Armed police officers have been seen in a bakery, in a branch of Aldi and at a routine traffic incident in Glasgow - all incidents where it was unnecessary for the officer to have a firearm by his side.",
