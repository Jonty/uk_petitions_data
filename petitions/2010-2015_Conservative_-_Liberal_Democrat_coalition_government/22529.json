        "additional_details": "Britains second carrier should be made fully operation even if it is a number of years behind and with different airfraft (maybe converted existing eurofighters). The Uk's defence needs a \"back up\" in  case of emergency's. It does not need to be reinstated straight away but can be added on later. The lack of a carrier was found in Libya with aircraft having to fly from the UK and than Italy. However, friendly bases will not always be available in a rapid situation. Also hard diplomacy will allow greater influence within the EU and the rest of the world. It would also be a massive waste of money having a fully working upto date ship being unused because the government refuses to spend a bit extra.",
