        "additional_details": "Cat fouling on private property is a growing nuisance. Cat faeces can be harmful to children and damage properties. There are a growing number of cases where deliberate harm, through physical damage or poisoning is being made towards cats by people who through no fault of their own are so fed up with continued fouling of their property that they consider and conduct extreme measures to prevent further fouling.\r\n\r\nThe law needs changing to put the burden of responsibility for cat fouling upon the cat owner. One suggestion would be for a law to be put in place that requires cat owners to litter box train their kittens and cats before they are allowed to roam beyond their owner's home. Once a cat is litter box trained it will always return to its home to defecate and so will no longer be a nuisance for surrounding neighbours. This solution would both prevent fouling and also prevent the deliberate harming of nuisance cats.",
