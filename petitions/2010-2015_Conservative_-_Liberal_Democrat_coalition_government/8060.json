It should:\r\n\r\nCombat the lack of social mobility that stops people from poorer backgrounds advancing in society: http://bit.ly/pizU3Y\r\n\r\nSpend rather than cut back on local services like youth centres, which provide an alternative to criminal activity and activities which lead towards criminality: http://bit.ly/n0sJh1\r\n\r\nInvest in the public sector; to provide a better level of service nationally, to spur growth by increased spending as per the Keynesian economics the government claims to follow when it suits them and to provide decent jobs for youths who would otherwise be disaffected.\r\n\r\nFocus on closing the gap in the current tiered education system.\r\n\r\nProvide support for families with young children though programs like Sure Start as these allow children to grow up in healthy families which will be less likely to become involved in crime.",
