        "additional_details": "Let's get as many people to sign this as possible. The past few nights have shown that there is a total breakdown of Law and order in this country.\r\nThe police are scared to do their duty, in case they themselves are brought to justice for hurting a criminal. The Human rights act, should only be for LAW abiding Citizens, who pay taxes and follow the law. These past few nights have shown that, police are restricted n what they can and cannot do. The leaders are scared of backlash, yet normal people want this backlash. We get 100,000 votes and it will be discussed in Parliament. We, the COMMON man  want the rioters severely punished.  ",
