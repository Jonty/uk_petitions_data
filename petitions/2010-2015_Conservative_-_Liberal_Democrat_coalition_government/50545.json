One onlooker, identified as James, said he saw two black men chopping at a man in his 20s like he was \"a piece of meat\". He told LBC radio: \"They were hacking at this poor guy, literally. They were hacking at him, chopping him, cutting him.\"\r\n\r\nIn one attackers own words, he did it because \u201c'I killed him because he killed Muslims and I am fed up with people killing Muslims in Afghanistan, they have nothing to do there.'\" ",
