        "additional_details": "Please help us to raise concern regarding the current law on abortions. At present it is legal to abort your baby at 24 weeks gestation, unless you see how formed a baby of this age is you would think it is still quite early in the pregnancy, this is certainly not the case after loosing my baby boy recently at exactly 24 weeks it is heartbreaking to think that it is legal to abort a baby as my son was just like a perfect sleeping baby he had hair and skin was perfect was just tiny but was still a good weight of 1lb 11oz. Please sign this and hopefully they will look into it and change the law. Thank you",
