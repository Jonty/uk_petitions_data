        "additional_details": "The area and workload which is expected to be covered by a traffic police officer in this country is totally unrealistic. There are far too few traffic police officers to properly enforce the law as they are far too busy dealing with major incidents to persue motorists who are driving carelessly or erratically and too little time is taken to educate motorists where sometimes just a few words would change attitudes and could be a real preventative influence upon road fatalities. It is time politicians realised that speed cameras and traffic calming measures are no real substitute for proper road policing which embraces a much wider scope of driving behaviour and is more likely to be respected by the public than arbritrary penalties. Road policing policies are long overdue a general reveiw and this should take into account how much traffic officers have to disregard in order to prioritise other incidents and the number of traffic officers per square mile.",
