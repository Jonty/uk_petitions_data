        "additional_details": "Leverage the buying power of the entire NHS to get brilliant deals on drugs, all types of equipment and uniforms. Build a central warehouse and make all hospitals order from the central location.\r\n\r\nWarehouse can increase employment in the local area and provide jobs for drivers to deliver the equipment across the NHS estate.\r\n\r\nThis should reduce the costs for all hospitals and let them focus on their primary objectives while also saving the NHS money in the long term.\r\n\r\nHaving a central location would enable the NHS to provide the same standard of equipment across the entire estate and result in higher standards of care as monies saved could thern be channeled back into front line care.",
