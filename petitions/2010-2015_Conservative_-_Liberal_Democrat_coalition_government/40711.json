This generation have worked hard and paid into the system all their working lives..\r\n\r\nResponsible department: Department for Work and Pensions\r\n\r\nThe Government must fund elderly people's rights to free residential Care paid for by the State because our elderly people have paid into the system all their working lives, and Government must also pay all pensioners now and in the future, a much higher basic state pension by restoring the National Insurance Act born of a Labour Government in 1974 which linked increases in the State pension to male average earnings, or The Retail Price Index ( RPI), whichever the greater.\r\nIn 1975, the then Labour Government passed the \"Social Security Act\", introducing a State Earnings Related Pensions Scheme, this was considered in the pensions industry, the most cost effective scheme ever.\r\n",
