I would like to ask if there could possibly be any possibility of abolishing the monarchy in favour of a federal, secular and democratic republic and commonwealth of Britain with an elected head of state, a written constitution and bill of rights, with devolved parliaments for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the replacement of the House of Lords with an elected House of the People and the disestablishment of the Church of England as the state religion, having a complete seperation of religion and state, with no religion having privilege or supremacy over any other.",
