        "additional_details": "Currently children are legally required to start school when they are 5 years old.  However, most schools now only have one intake in September, meaning that most children start school at 4 years old.  This is far too young for children to start formal schooling as the school day is too long and too tiring for them.  They do not learn properly under these conditions.\r\nChildren in many European countries don't start formal schooling until they are 7 years old and they achieve just as much as British children who start school much younger.  There is a wealth of information available that shows starting school at 7 is more beneficial to the child and the country as a whole.\r\nI would like the Government to review the current school starting age, with a view to increasing it.  School should be a place where children are properly educated and not a childcare centre.",
