        "additional_details": "Westminister doesn't have the right to sell public assets with out a public consultation. These assets are paid for by the British tax payers over many years and require parliment to listen to its share holders; we need to say what happens to these assets.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Mail was sold off at half its value and the same could happened to Eurostar. At present the value of our share is \u00a320 billion, if we wait another 10 years the asset could be worth more. At present the company is making us money and the profits are being ploughed back into the state or the company. If a sell off is to happen, a British company or assets group should have priority.\r\n\r\nThe selling of URENCO would put our national security at risk. Having a forgien company to own our nuclear assets, could mean that other countries having access to uranium enrichment eg nuclear.\r\n\r\nNote If this petition is deleted it would indicate that the government already has a preferred buyer and is ignoring it's uk tax payers.\r\n",
