        "additional_details": "Many people who are convicted of dangerous driving recieve a ban, but are not required to retake their test before they start driving again.\r\n\r\nWhere the accident in question results in a fatality, the presumption should be that a driver convicted of dangerous driving is required to retake their test before being allowed back on the roads.\r\n\r\nThis is in addition to any other bans and punishments the court might hand down.\r\n\r\nLetting dangerous drivers back on the roads without re-testing them puts the public in unaaceptable danger, undermines confidence in driving standards and is deeply disrespectful to the family of the deceased.",
