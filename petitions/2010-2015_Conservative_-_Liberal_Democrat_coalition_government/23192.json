        "additional_details": "In the interests of safety all cyclists over 10 years of age should have to register and obtain a unique \"number plate\" which would be clearly visible on a reflective yellow jacket. This jacket would have to be worn whenever the cyclist is using a cycle in a public area. (it would not apply to private property unless the owner installs signs to the contrary.) The \"number plate\" would allow cyclists to be identified in the event of an accident or incident of some kind. Anyone over the age of nine would have their cycle impounded if they commit offences or are not wearing their jacket as prescribed by the law. It would be an offence to allow others to carry your \"number plate\".",
