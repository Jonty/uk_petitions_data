        "additional_details": "The rise in Palm oil plantations is resulting in mass deforestation across the planet. Products used in the UK that contain palm oil are normally labelled simply as \u2018vegetable oil\u2019. To raise awareness of this issue and avoid discrimination against other forms of cooking oils I promote a fair and simple change to legislation; all types of oil used in the food industry should be clearly labelled so as to make the consumer fully aware of the sort used in a specific product. This would hopefully encourage companies to source sustainable forms of oil production, and help the consumer to be more informed in a product in which they are investing.",
