I think it would be fitting to make a new Royal Yaught. My idea is that a perpose built vessel should be built in Briitian. This scheme could be part of  training for many young workers and proove to the world our ship building industry is of the highest quality. This vessel can be use as a floating embasy, a Royal recreation facility and a Royal Naval ship for use as a hospital to mention a few roles. This should be a public/state partnership",
