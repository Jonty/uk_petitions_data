        "additional_details": "Every skilled profession in the UK must be backed by formal qualifications to show that the person proclaiming to be skilled in that area of expertise has undertaken an education in that subject eg. Bricklaying, plumbing, osteopathy, bus driver, and the list goes on and on. But we allow people with no formal qualification in the subject of tattooing to mark a person\u2019s body for life. There should be a formal qualification for tattooists, so they can prove they can draw to a very high standard, how to correctly operate a tattoo machine (also known as a gun), know hygiene, disposal of human waste, sterilisation of equipment etc... This should then give the tattooist a licence to operate. No licence. No tattooing! This will help eradicate those people who are incompetent and should never pick up a tattoo machine (also known as gun)! This will also safeguard the public from rogue tattooists who either offer services at home or those who have no skill from opening a studio. ",
