        "action": "Stop schools from becoming academies and begin the process of converting existing academies back into Local Authority run schools",
        "additional_details": "Local Authorities whose council is voted in by the public should take responsibility for our children's schooling. Education should not be controlled by private companies who are not democratically accountable to parents, carers and the general public. One of the academies in the UK is run by a Spanish railway company. Organizations like this should have no place in our education system.  There is no evidence that academies achieve higher results than schools. Many academies have had to have their sponsor changed due to bad management and poor grades from school leavers. Numerous academies have even had their sponsor changed several times for this reason. Some academies which were once schools have been forced to close because the sponsor could not run the academy effectively. The government should place an immediate freeze on forcing and allowing schools to convert to academies and make provision for existing academies to return to school status under control of the Local Authority.",
