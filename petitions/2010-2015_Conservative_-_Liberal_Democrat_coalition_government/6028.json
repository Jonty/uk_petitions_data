        "additional_details": "I believe the 1995 Pension Act should be revisited and that the new plan to extend the pension age again should be scrapped. It is totally unfair and disproportionately hits women who are already in their fifties.  We are always being told to plan for our old age, but we haven't been given enough time.  The government is trying to save money at the expense of older women. Making older women stay at work for up to 7 more years won't help the unemployment situation either.  Wouldn't it be better for these women to leave work and make way for young people to get jobs?  Better to use Government money for older people's pensions (who have contributed for years) rather than for unemployment benefit for the young starting them on a demoralising path of joblessness.",
