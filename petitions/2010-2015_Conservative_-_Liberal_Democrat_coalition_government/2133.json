        "additional_details": "Domestic Violence has a severe impact on our national life. The NSPCC say that 750,000 children witness it every year. One in three women attends Casualty because of it. There are 1,300 calls a day for help.\r\nThe government needs to respond with more urgent and effective policies and support for the victims. It is estimated that one in ten men and one in five women will experience violence in the home. The human, emotional and financial consequences are considerable.\r\nWe need to reflect national disgust over this violence. A national monument to the victims would reflect our sense of outrage that domestic violence costs the lives of two people a week, and harms hundreds of thousands of innocent victims of violence.\r\n",
