        "additional_details": "The government should open its eyes. the current Prime minister is despised by many, and his opposition leader is despised by even more. The electoral process should be suspended for the forthcoming 2015 general election and William Clubb given the keys to 10 downing street. he is a fair and just leader, who I'm sure will do a better job than many of the current people in politics. He will fight for the rights of every man, woman and child, and will make Britain great again",
