        "additional_details": "We call on the government to immediately abandon planned legislation that would allow GCHQ to monitor emails, texts, calls, and what websites individuals visit.  This legislation is unreasonable and will be costly to the taxpayer.\r\n\r\nThis is a disproportionate invasion of our privacy, which is unfair, unjust, and unnecessary.  Under current law, the security services can monitor communications by obtaining permission from a magistrate.  This judicial oversight is a necessary protection that prevents government agencies from abusing their surveillance powers.  Legalising blanket surveillance will remove this essential judicial oversight.\r\n\r\nSurveillance on this scale is used in countries such as Iran; it has no place in a democracy.\r\n",
