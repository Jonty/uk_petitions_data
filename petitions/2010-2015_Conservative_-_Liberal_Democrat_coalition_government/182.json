        "additional_details": "The category Potential Emotional Harm can be used to take children from their parents with no proof whatsoever of any harm to the child. GP's, CPN's etc can give written statements that there is no problem serious enough for the child to be removed from home. The child's school can say the child was fine until removed from parents, the child improves whenever contact with parents is increased. If parents challenge social work opinion this is seen as not co-operating. A child can remain in care so long as parents do not co-operate. There is no opportunity for parents to defend themselves from social work accusations. There is no legal aid for LAC meetings where the child's time in care is reviewed and only the social work report is considered, despite carers, teacher etc saying the child longs to come home. The child has become a victim of expensive state intervention which causes child and family great distress. ",
