If I do not vote it is viewed as me being too lazy. If I vote for a minor party as a protest I may end up with an MP I don't want. I want a box which allows me to register my vote as being for 'none of the above' meaning nobody convinced me to vote for them and I was not too lazy to go and vote. Yes it is still futile but if the winner in the vote was 'none of the above' then the election would be reheld until a real winner is found. Perhaps then the Mp's etc. would be forced to engage with people like us who pay their wages and want their views represented, heard and understood.",
