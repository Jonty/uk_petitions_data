        "additional_details": "The number of cyclist deaths in London continue to rise. Traffic volume, driver error and poor cyclist discipline are probably factors but another one must surely be the poor layout and implementation of London's cycle lanes. Some cycle lanes have been created in roadspaces not large enough to accommodate existing traffic, let alone introducing cyclists into the equation. Cycle lanes should also have greater levels of barrier to entry from vehicles. Some cycle lanes could have been cut into the pavement space instead of on to the road. Will the Home Office intervene to mandate that the Mayor of London reconsiders his existing cycling networks and the safety tolerances between cycle lanes and existing traffic, drawing upon the lessons from cycling in Holland for example.
