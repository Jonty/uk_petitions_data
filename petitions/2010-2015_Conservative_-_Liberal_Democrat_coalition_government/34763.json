        "additional_details": "In 1993 Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council identified areas to restrict development and to retain the respective identities of Crewe, Nantwich and the adjacent villages. These areas - designated as the Green Gap - prevented urban sprawl and preserved the amenity value and the environment within the land so designated.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming desire of those who responded to the consultation process initiated by Cheshire East Council as part of the formulation of the Cheshire East Local Plan is to retain the Green Gap wholly intact and incorporate it in the Plan. This will prevent the infrastructure, drainage, traffic, educational and medical facilities becoming over extended and therefore unsustainable.\r\n\r\nThis petition gives further expression to the virtually unanimous wishes of the local inhabitants who have responded to the consultation process.\r\n\r\nSupport this petition and make localism a reality and not merely an empty slogan.\r\n",
