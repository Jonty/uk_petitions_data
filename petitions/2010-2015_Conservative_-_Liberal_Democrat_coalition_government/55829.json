This petition is prevent teachers from cherry picking pupils to take early entry exams to help the performance of the schools. Give each and every child equal rights and the opportunity to take 2 exams one mock exam in November 2013 and again at the end the YR 11. This should be a pupils choice not the teacher or governments choice so they can fiddle the facts on school performance every child should have the choice and chance twice. ",
