        "additional_details": "Excessive pay to top bosses in UK companies mean that they earn in just a few days more than the average worker will earn in a year.  The gap between rich and poor is growing because pay rises of top earners are far above those of the lower earners.\r\n\r\nTo reduce income inequality, HM Government should legislate that the total remuneration package, including share options and bonuses may not increase year on year by more than the lowest % wage increase given to employees in their company.  When any employees receive a wage reduction, top executives must also receive a wage reduction equal to the highest % reduction received by their employees.",
