        "additional_details": "Each year we all get insurance renewal documents and these often quote an inflated premium. Often, by calling the insurance company the premium can be substantially reduced due to \u2018special\u2019, \u2018new customer\u2019 or other discounts.\r\n\r\nTherefore, let us require by Law, all insurance company renewal notices carry the following prominent \u2018health warning\u2019 in much the same way cigarette packaging must carry a warning:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe may be able to provide you the same policy and identical cover at a substantially lower premium if you do not accept this renewal notice and instead contact us or your broker and start a fresh insurance proposal. This is due to the way in which our renewal premiums are calculated which may not necessarily quote you our best price. You may pay an elevated premium by accepting this renewal offer.\u201d\r\n\r\nHow about a bit of \u2018transparency\u2019 and honesty from our insurers!",
