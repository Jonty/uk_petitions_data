A force which will not be intimidated by acts of violence.\r\n\r\nIn so many other countries armed forces would be on the streets with live weapons. These \"kids\" don't fear the police because they have limited powers, and no weapons of any substance.\r\n\r\nLet's show these criminals, and the rest of the world, that we WILL NOT allow this sort of behaviour in our country. We WILL use every tool at our disposal to stamp out this sort of violent conduct. We WILL NOT show any sympathy to those people who put innocent people's lives at risk.",
