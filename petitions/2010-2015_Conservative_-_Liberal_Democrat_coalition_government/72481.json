        "action": "Mental health trusts should liaise with local police forces to educate them on mental health issues (esp use of s136 on young people)",
        "additional_details": "The police have powers under section 136 of the MHA 1983 to detain someone if they are in a public place and are thought to have a mental disorder and are in need of care. If detained under a 136 you should be taken to a \"place of safety\", which could be anything from A&E to a police cell. This lasts up to 72 hours.\r\n\r\nIt seems straightforward. The reality is that when a 136 is carried out, officers often aren't sure of the appropriate procedure, things get messy, and people may end up in cells awaiting assessment. This is not right. A physical health emergency would be treated in a setting such as A&E so why aren't MH crises being treated the same?\r\n\r\nThere should be some form of psycho-education between local MH trusts and local police forces to ensure that the police know what a MH crisis looks like & how to deal with it in a safe and contained way.\r\n\r\nThis is especially important for vulnerable children and young people who come into contact with the police in a crisis.",
