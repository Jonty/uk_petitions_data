        "additional_details": "Why should 'single' parents still get CSA if they have entered a new, committed relationship? If everything is done officially with their relationship such as living together, bills share etc why should CSA be paid when the child will have 2 incomes coming in?\r\n\r\nI know of women who are creaming the money in off their ex-partners and using it for their benefit and not the childs! Its disgusting.\r\n\r\nIf a single parent with the child custody has 2 incomes coming in plus child benefit, tax credit etc then they do not need CSA.\r\n\r\nPeople with a good income are being penalised by the percentage the ex partner is 'entitled' to. If someone is on a good wage the ex does not need \u00a3300+ a month for a child.\r\n\r\nIf that is the case then why is child benefit only \u00a320 pw and not more?",
