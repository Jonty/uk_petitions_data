        "additional_details": "Sign this petition if you believe the government need to develop a strategy to deal with abuse of the 999 system. The emergency services not only respond to thousands of hoax calls a year but also to thousands of inappropriate emergency calls. A tougher system needs to be developed to deter, for example, people who request an ambulance because they could not get a GP appointment for a minor ailment or people dialling 999 for police because they have a minor disagreement. The emergency services do a valuable job, often a life saving job, but have their hands constantly tied due to inappropriate usr of the 999 system. Allow the police, fire and ambulance services to have more power in dealing with abuses of the system.",
