Many other countries have low fixed price fares for local and regional journies which i believe if introduced in the UK would take cars off our roads and put people onto public transport making the country a better place to live with air quality and enviromental issues caused by cars. The Government should look at taking over once again our Transport systems and make them comparable to our EU neighbours!",
