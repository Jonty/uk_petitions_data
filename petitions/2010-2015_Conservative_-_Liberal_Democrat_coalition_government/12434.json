        "additional_details": "Phagetherapy should be allowed as it is safe and effective against some forms of bacterial disease.  At present the UK Government does not allow the NHS to use phagetherapy against MRSA and other diseases, and this leads to much suffering and death in mostly the old but also in children and people of all ages.  The Government should allow phagetherapy.  It would save money as well as saving lives.",
