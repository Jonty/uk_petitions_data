The employer currently only has to show they have completed a risk assesment. HSE say they can not enforce a temperaturw due to different working enviroments. I believe that the average working temperature should be measured in spring/autumn and that 10\u25cbc +/- from that temp would be acceptable in the workplace. A thermometer in the working area is easy enough to monitor. ",
