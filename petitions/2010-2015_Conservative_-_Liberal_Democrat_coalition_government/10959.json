        "additional_details": "We're all struggling with increased taxation, high fuel costs and high inflation. The recent unrest will increase insurance costs and local service provision - a burden ultimately paid for by the taxpayer. We're already cutting services because we can't afford them. Locking rioters up costs us money and is a badge of honour on the steet..Convicted rioters should do community service - replacing/supporting services that the govt can no longer afford. Why should the tax payer pay twice for these idiots? They should repay the damage they have done to their communities without increasing their street cred!!",
