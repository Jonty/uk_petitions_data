        "additional_details": "Three months after the event now known as \"Plebgate\" occured on September 19th, it has now come to light that the Metropolitan Police's version of events was corroborated not by an independent member of the public, but by another police officer.\r\n\r\nThis \"eyewitness\" now stipulates, according to Channel 4, that he was not at the gates of Downing Street on that night. This, along with the CCTV footage that seems to lend support to Mr Mitchell's version of events and the leaking of the official police report demonstrates the need for an inquiry into the events during and after the 19th of September.",
