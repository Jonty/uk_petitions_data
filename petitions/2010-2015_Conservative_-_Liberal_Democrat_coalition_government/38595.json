It has been reported that currently new 200,000 immigrants are adding to the pool of immigrants in UK every year. Quarter of Britain's babies are born to foreign mothers in 2011 alone. Such empowered expended UKBA force should be able to arrest, detain & deport immigrants swiftly. If necessary, deportees can be detained in a British protectorate - if they are appealing against or awaiting documentation for deportation. e-ID cards & IT systems should be introduced to track foreign immigrants on visas  (like employment, education, NHS treatment, DWP claims, marriage) to ensure that they keep to the conditions of their visas.
