        "additional_details": "HMRC employs over 200,000 people at a huge cost to the taxpayer.\r\n\r\nBy abolishing HMRC and eliminating the costs associated with employing such a large number of civil servants, a substantial cost saving can be made which will contribute significantly to deficit reduction. To achieve this we will need to abolish:  Income tax, N.I., V.A.T. We can also abolish some of the benefits that HMRC administers e.g. childrens' allowances which are used mostly for alcohol, cigarettes and tattoes for the parents. The reduced amount of revenue required for essential expenditure would be collected via a single tier Sales Tax administered by H.M. Customs (as previously) but with a small number of civil servants. An additional benefit is the reducion in the cost of tax collection by the private sector.",
