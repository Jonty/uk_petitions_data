        "additional_details": "Many teacher supply agencies demand a new CRB clearance for each agency despite provision within legislation which allows portability of previous CRB checks. Such agencies should be required to accept portability for up to 3 years (teachers permanently employed need never fill another CRB application unless they move jobs). Supply teachers are known to hold four CRB checks. In effect this is a recruitment agency charging for admission to their register of available workers - which is contrary to current legislation.",
