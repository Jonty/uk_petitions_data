        "additional_details": "To help the economy now and in the future extend the M11 from Cambridge, passing to the East of Lincoln, to connect with the Humber Bridge. This will create construction jobs now and relieve congestion on the A1, A14 and many routes through Lincolnshire in the future. It will make sense of both the M11 which stops at Cambridge and the Humber Bridge which is not able to make an operating profit. Connecting the M11 to the Humber Bridge is likely to dramatically increase usage of the bridge and would likely lead to a reduction in road deaths in Lincolnshire.",
