        "additional_details": "There are minimal if any benefits to having fluoride added to water. The SHA and water companies will tell you that fluoride is found naturally in water. Yes it is but not the industrial waste product that is currently used by water companies to fluoridate.This substance is a class 2 poison, contains arsenic and is a neurotoxin. It damages health to a far greater extent than any benefit derived from protecting teeth. The dental caries argument is founded on pseudo science that originates with the atomic bomb project during WWII and has little if no basis in verifiable science. A lie that is promoted for long enough and by so called trustworthy sources becomes the truth but always remains a lie. Petition your MP to support the cessation of fluoridation of the UK's water. It is mass medication on a grand scale, illegal under UK and European legislation and should be stopped immediately.",
