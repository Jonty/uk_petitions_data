        "additional_details": "One cyclist is killed every two and a half days on Britain\u2019s roads whilst Six cyclists are seriously injured every day. These are cyclists sustaining injuries ranging from broken bones to brain injury or paralysis. 37 cyclists are slightly injured each day. This means 16,196 people suffer injuries on Britain\u2019s roads every year. And yet none of these cyclists have a legal obligation to be insured, even if they run a red light, causing an accident and damage to a motor vehicle.\r\n\r\nAlso, with more and more pressure being put on the motorist, Bike lanes getting wider and wider, The Road Tax isn't getting any cheaper, and yet on some roads across the UK whole lanes are given away to cyclists.\r\n\r\nBy introducing Road Tax, Licence Plates for Pushbikes, Compulsory Basic Training and Compulsory Insurance, we can reduce the number of accidents caused by dangerous cyclists.
