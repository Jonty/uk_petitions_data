        "additional_details": "I want the government to remove any possibility of a police officer, acting in accordance with the situation, to not fear legal action taken against them for using force required to either keep the peace or restore order to communities. For too long now police have had to watch what they say or do to criminals for fear of them being sued for being 'too harsh'. I want the government to stand up and back the police and give them the power to act as they feel fit, without any possibility of the criminals or public using it as leverage to sue the police force. A law should be passed to protect the police in any circumstance where necessary force is required, and used, within accordance of environment. The police force should have all possibility of any charges against them for doing their job.",
