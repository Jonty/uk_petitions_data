        "additional_details": "Student May Brown, 19, faces being kicked out of the UK after her asylum plea was rejected.\r\n\r\nMay fled her native Nigeria aged 16 after seeing her father murdered and suffering sexual abuse.\r\n\r\nThe college student is studying to become a barrister. She met and married her husband Michael, a former British soldier, in Weymouth, Dorset.\r\n\r\nThe pair are very much in love and had been busy making plans for the rest of their lives. That has been cruelly snatched away.\r\n\r\nRecently May was told by immigration officials that her marriage was a sham and her asylum application had been rejected.\r\n\r\nMay said if she returned to her home country she feared she would be killed.\r\n\r\nSo great was her fear of persecution that a few days before she was told she was to be deported she attempted to take her own life and was rushed to hospital in a coma.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, are calling on the government to allow May Brown to stay in the UK.\r\n",
