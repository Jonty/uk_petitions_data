Create a new group of Disabled Person's Parking Bays' by creating a sub group. A Disabled Person's Parking Bay requested specifically for a disabled person's use OUTSIDE his/her HOUSE should belong to this subgroup.

When a substitute car is used, displaying a Blue Badge and THEN it receives a penalty ticket this IS A MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCE and the ticket should be cancelled on appeal to the issuing office provided evidence of HAVING TO USE REPLACEMENT CAR is supplied.",
