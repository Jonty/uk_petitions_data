Surely this is theft on so many levels. Because for example if I entered HMV with my \u00a311 gift card today they will reject me using it because they have entered administration and their stock is being returned to a 'third party' BUT HMV still accept cash, so if I bought something with \u00a311 in cash they will accept it.\r\n\r\nBusinesses that enter Administration should be held accountable to their actions and legislation should be put into place so that they are FORCED to pay back the money they owe citizens of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nStop the customers being 'bottom of the pile'!",
