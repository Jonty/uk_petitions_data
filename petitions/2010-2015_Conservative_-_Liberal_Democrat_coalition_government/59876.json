        "additional_details": "I'm trying to get as many signatures as I can to stop families with young children being housed in big blocks of flats. I've lived in a block of 16 flats with my partner & 2 young children for 2 years now & since we received our tenancy here it has been nothing but hell. We are the victims of anti-social behaviour, not just us but neighbours in the block with children. If families were housed in smaller blocks we could get to know our neighbours and not be terrorised by people who associate with other tenants who are not so nice. Myself & my neighbours have had physical abuse, emotional abuse, our doors being banged & kicked by people trying to get in, threats to kill, drug dealers who are owed money interrogating us etc. This is both physically & emotionally draining & does not only affect us but also our children, enough is enough! Surely we're not the only ones having these sort of problems in flats! ",
