        "additional_details": "The government of the United Kingdom has a duty to collect taxes and should do so in all cases without prejudice and according to the law. If the law allows for billions of pounds of tax to be avoided by those with the financial means to do so then the law must be changed.\r\n\r\nLoopholes that allow the super-rich to avoid paying their fair share of tax are essentially crippling this country and providing huge benefits for a tiny proportion of the population at the expense of the great majority.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to stand up for the needs of the many and not pander to the desires of the few.",
