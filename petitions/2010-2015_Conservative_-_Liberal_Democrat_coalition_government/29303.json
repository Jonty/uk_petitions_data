        "additional_details": "Women should be able to obtain the cervical cancer smear test from at the least the age of 18. It is wrong for the NHS to refuse to give smear tests to the under 25s, as in some european countries it starts from as young as 18. This is appalling as a 23 year old woman has died from cervical cancer because doctors say she was too young for a screening. We should provide help, support, advice and funding for private cervical smear tests for women/girls under 25.\r\n\r\n",
