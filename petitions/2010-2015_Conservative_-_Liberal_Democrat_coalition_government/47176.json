This is politically motivated and aims to appease NIMBYs to the detriment of the people of Slough.\r\n\r\nFollowing the enormous success of the Olympics we should be boosting communities with new sports facilities.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to stop their interference and allow the Local Council, elected by local people to proceed with the development that the local people want rather than forcing a school that is not wanted in another borough onto the people of Slough.\r\n ",
