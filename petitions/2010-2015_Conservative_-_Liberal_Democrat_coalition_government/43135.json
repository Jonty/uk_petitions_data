        "additional_details": "I would like the government to heavily tax foreign companies purchasing residential property in London, in order to stop the escalation of prices.  Many empty residential properties in London have been purchased by foreign companies as a means of investment, this has pushed up the price of most properties out of the reach of ordinary working Londoners.  If a heavy tax was introduced this would filter through the market, reducing prices and removing the problem of many vacant houses and flats.   ",
