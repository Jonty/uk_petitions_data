The British Government is guilty and must apologise.\r\nPoliticians, over the last 3 decades, have been negligent and have let down the younger generations and provoked them to feelings of anger and hopelessness by permitting the de-industrialisation of Britain and the out-sourcing of jobs to foreign countries. English Law is Bible-based:\r\nKing James Version\r\nEphesians 6. http://bible.cc/ephesians/6-4.htm\r\n4. And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.\r\n\r\nColossians 3. http://bible.cc/colossians/3-21.htm\r\n21. Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.",
