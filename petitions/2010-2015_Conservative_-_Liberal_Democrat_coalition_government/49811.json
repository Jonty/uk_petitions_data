        "additional_details": "Every year more than 100,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with skin cancer (caused by UV rays) and over 2,500 lose their life as a result*. Under current UK tax law, Brits pay a 20% tax charge on sunscreen as it's deemed a \u2018luxury\u2019 item rather than an essential health product.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the cost to the NHS of skin cancer will be more than \u00a3180m by 2020, proving there are serious health risks and cost implications posed from sun damage. Skin cancer is largely a preventable disease, and high factor sunscreen can help protect skin against harmful effects of the sun. Recent research reveals that 60% of Brits believe sunscreen is overpriced and in turn are resorting to out-dated sunscreen or even avoiding purchasing it altogether.\r\n\r\nBy signing this petition you agree that sunscreen VAT should be diminished to ensure Brits can stay safe in the sun at a reduced cost, which will ultimately reduce the cases of skin cancer and save lives.\r\n *British Skin Foundation, March 2013",
