        "action": "Stop proposal of the scrapping of housing benefits for under 25's, who'll be forced to live with their parents.",
        "additional_details": "The prime minister has suggested that people under the age of 25 could lose the right to housing benefit. David Cameron admits that \"Some of these young people will genuinely have nowhere else to live\". It will also force young parents to live back at home with unsatisfactory living conditions for them and their children. This will particularly hit hard on the working class as David Cameron expects family's to provide for their under 25's. Many under 25's are rightfully scared that their parents cannot afford and/or not willing to accommodate them.\r\n\r\nThe CEO of the leading youth homelessness charity, Centrepoint, warned that scrapping housing benefits for unemployed under-25's would have \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d and leave more young people homeless.\r\n\r\nThis petition's goal is to urge David Cameron to re-consider and look for cuts elsewhere.\r\n",
