        "additional_details": "About 30 years ago young people were taught for 2 years and then given their final exams. Many parents and teachers found it highly unfair as many children were unable to memorise 2 years worth of work for their exams which meant they didn't get the results they would've got if the modular exams had been around while they were at school. Now the modular exams have been scrapped and the government has went back to the old system. This is shocking and unacceptable. ",
