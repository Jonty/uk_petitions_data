They could clean streets, pick up litter or paint bus shelters for example.  If they don't turn up they don't get paid. This not only helps the local community but also promotes a sense of responsibility and removes the attitude of getting something for nothing. If you have to work to receive your benefits you might as well get a job and get paid better. ",
