        "additional_details": "The issue of alcoholism should be addressed, it causes unnecessary expense for the NHS, acts as a catalyst in petty crime and in social deprivation. Alcohol products should also have a 'drinking  kills' label as per the 'smoking kills' label on tobacco products.  Parliament should discuss significantly raising prices of alcohol (as in Norway) and putting an end to all cheap supermarket alcohol. It should also implement legislation forcing pubs and clubs open and close earlier than they do at the present. ",
