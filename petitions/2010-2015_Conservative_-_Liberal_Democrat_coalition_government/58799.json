        "additional_details": "Sir David Attenborough is surely one of the most influential and inspirational living persons in the world today. The engaging and informative manner in which he explains to us the magic of the world we live in, whilst at the same time reminding us of our often damaging impact on it, is unequalled and recognised by both casual observers and serious scientists.  Who has not seen and been enthralled by his work; perhaps the programme 'Africa' aired over the festive period is a perfect example of his work.\r\n\r\nIn order to recognise the impact David Attenborough has had over more than 50 years in increasing the knowledge of awareness of mans impact on the world  you are encouraging the Government of the day to elevate him to a Lord in a future honours listing.
