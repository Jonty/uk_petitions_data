        "additional_details": "The action I would propose for the Government to take is to cease penalising to uncover covert operations of the Secret Services in Ripa 2000.\r\nIf the Secret Services cannot do their duties without perverting the whole structure of this society and forcing by law other authorities to act against basic human rights of their Targets, it will be far better if they stop doing those \"secret duties\" in the first place.The victims of those Secret Services should get help from the Police to detain their torturers, and to get evidences against them, because torture is illegal. The police should not be able to cover up this infringements of the Secret Services due to the threats of Ripa 2000. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal is dismissing complaints due to the difficulty of the victims of getting evidences against those Services because they use high tech non-touch weapons. They need the Police's help to get them.",
