        "additional_details": "NHS patients are to have their medical records sold to private research companies without their prior consent. They can opt out by writing but if they are uninformed about this then they are unlikely to write to complain or opt out.\r\n\r\nMedical records are private information and although name and address are not included identity could be gleaned from the information that is taken. If this information is sold now later other information could be included.\r\n\r\nIt is wrong to sell on a persons private medical information without specifically requesting their permission first.\r\n\r\nThis petition asks the Government to ban the sale of NHS patient medical records.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you want to keep NHS medical records private between doctor and patient.",
