Could the government also develop as a matter of urgency schemes for fuel subsidies/cold weather payments/free home insulation/subsidised  replacement heating systems to all households (means tested perhaps and available to all households with an annual income of  less than \u00a325,000, irrespective of whether they are on benefits or not?)",
