One of the parts of final assessment called Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA) has obviously and significantly different pass rate between white local graduates and Black and Ethnic Minority Graduates.\r\n\r\nRCGP figures indicate that the failure rate for IMGs (international medical graduates) taking the CSA exam is at 63.2%, compared with 9.4% of UK graduates.\r\n\r\nMany GP trainees failed this exam 4 times, this means at the end of 3 years of training and education due to a possibly flawed exam system many doctors are left with no career prospects. They continue to endure immense strain on their family, personal anxiety, stress and financial ruin having spent tens of thousands of pounds on exam fees and courses. Training a doctor to this level costs the UK tax payer \u00a30.5m per doctor.\r\n\r\nEach attempt costs the trainee \u00a31694 the exam is very subjective and another \u00a3800 to appeal the result.",
