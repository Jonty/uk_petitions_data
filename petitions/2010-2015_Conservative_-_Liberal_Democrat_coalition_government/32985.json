        "additional_details": "This petition looks to raise the level of detailed research and study into the environmental effects of Shale Gas Fracturing (Fracking), recently approved for implementation in the UK, despite numerous US states and European countries calling moratoria on this extraction process.\r\nCorroborating study into Fracking used to make this decision was commissioned by Cuadrilla (the company that is implementing these wells and serves to profit from them) and only explores the seismic threat, ignoring the potential environmental and human impact that this process might have on the UK.\r\nNumerous research pieces (two cited below) from institutions like Cornell cite Shale Gas Fracturing as:\r\nMore harmful than coal extraction & use: http://tinyurl.com/3nqgw8d\r\nDamaging to emissions targets & with considerable environmental threats: http://tinyurl.com/84cglp4\r\nBetter understanding of this energy source is crucial before its widespread use.\r\nPlease sign this petition to support this initiative.",
