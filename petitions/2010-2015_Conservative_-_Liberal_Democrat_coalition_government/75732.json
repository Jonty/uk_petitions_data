In short, the BBC should not have taken the decision to take the current series off air.....it is the public who should decide. The current groundswell of positive opinion in favour of Jeremy Clarkson and especially Top Gear, should indicate to the BBC, that we, the paying licence payers, should not or will not be dictated to, by faceless do-gooders in flip flops and suits.",
