Asking members to like these posts to show their support and stop incureable diseases and abuse is disgusting and it plays with their conscience.\r\nI'm sure with some high level lobbying Facebook will have no choice but to ban these obscene posts.\r\nPlease support this epetition if you too feel that this has gone too far and is ruining people's Facebook experience.",
