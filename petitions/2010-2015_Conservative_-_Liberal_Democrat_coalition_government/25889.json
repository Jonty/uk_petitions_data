        "additional_details": "The 2010 Equality Act legalised positive discrimination; that is to allow employers to discriminate against potential employees based on a host of predetermined factors, such as race, gender and sexual orientation. We, the British public, find it abhorrent that having fought discrimination for so long, the previous government legislated to allow employers to racially discriminate against people, and we ask the current government to repeal this disgraceful legislation. Everyone, no matter what ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation they are, should have the same rights as everyone else, and we ask the government to reflect this in law.",
