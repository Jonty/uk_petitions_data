        "additional_details": "Currently, there is no minimum amount of debt required before a CCJ can be issued.  I received a CCJ for a \u00a310 parking fine.  This will remain on my credit file for 6years, and obtaining credit has now become extremely difficult.  A CCJ is the highest order a client/company can go to request their money back - and I am not saying I disagree with the rules of a CCJ.  However I don't believe I or anyone else should receive such a penalty against my name for \u00a310. This shouldn't be allowed to happen.  I don't know what I would like the minimum amount to be, but I would like this matter to be discussed in the House of Commons.  If you agree, please sign.  ",
