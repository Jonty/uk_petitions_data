        "additional_details": "Abolishing the One Pound paper note has meant that a huge amount in One Pound coins have to be transported from shops to Banks, carried by individuals & even transported by Air to duty free shops abroad. The cost of carrying these tonnes of weight can be replaced by carrying a light weight paper Pound. The heavy one Pound coins also create holes in jackets & trousers requiring repairs.\r\nThe Scots still have the One Pound note & so do the Americans (One dollar note). Trying to save the ecology in less wastage in petrol & energy seems like a good idea.\r\n\r\n",
