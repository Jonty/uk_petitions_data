We believe that this will help Britain's economy to become safer for savers, as well remove any requirement for the government continue with deposit guarantees; a system that continues to socialise the losses of banking failure and requires that taxpayers continue to insure against the risks taken by the private bank's, thus continuing to subsidise them.",
