Children need to be at home being looked after by either mum or dad. Any form of childcare no matter how good it is is not what is best for our children.\r\nWhat is wrong with being a stay at home mum, this is the way it has been for centuries and it has worked well.\r\nThis government need to first stop make mums who do stay at home to raise their children bad for doing so and to seriously tackle the cost of living to get it reduced so that staying at home to raise our children is actually an option as for many mums it is financially an option.\r\nBeing a stay at home mum is one of the most challenging but rewarding jobs there is to do and the government needs to recognise this and do something serious to allow this to happen for those that want nothing more than to do this wonderful job and raise their children.",
