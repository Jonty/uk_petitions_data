        "additional_details": "Both A1 and A66 are overcrowded parts of the transport infrastructure.  An unacceptable number of major and fatal accidents, with subsequent loss to the northern economy, arise due to 2-way sections waiting to be upgraded to dual-carriageway.  Without adequate major arterial routes to the north the HS2 project will decrease the North's business competitiveness.\r\n\r\nFor safety and the northern economy the Government must implement the A1 and A66 upgrades with the same urgency as the HS2 project.
