        "additional_details": "Currently on a single carriage road where the national speed limit is imposed, HGV's are only permitted to travel at 40mph whilst other vehicles can travel at 60mph.\r\nThe 20mph difference of speed limits on these roads create hazardous conditions with many road users overtaking HGV's. HGV drivers also often ignore this law so as not to hold traffic up & this is usually overlooked by the police too.\r\nConsideration needs to be made to reduce this difference by either reducing the speed limit for normal vehicles, or increasing the speed limit for HGV's, or both.",
