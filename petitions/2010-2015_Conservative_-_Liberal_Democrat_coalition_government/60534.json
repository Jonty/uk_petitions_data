        "additional_details": "During protest situations it is difficult to tell police vehicles and ambulances and or fire engines apart which could cause delay or even death.  We request that police vehicles strobe lights are switched to pink as this is more noticeable that blue as the police state. Also it would curve police behavior from acting like a gang of corporate thugs with little respect for the law and remind them they are servants of the people and secondly corporations. ",
