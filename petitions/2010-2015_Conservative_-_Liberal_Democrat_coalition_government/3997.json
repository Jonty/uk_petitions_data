        "action": "Make the US-UK extradition treaty fair and balanced",
        "additional_details": "The US-UK extradition treaty is unfair and unbalanced because it is far to easy for the US to extradite a UK citizen without good reason or fair trial. The most recent of cases involving Richard O\u2019Dwyer who is subject to extradition proceedings serves to outline the ridiculous and unjustness of the process. The extradition is sought on the basis that the domain name registered by Richard O\u2019Dwyer uses a domain name registry system in jurisdiction of the United States. This criteria could apply to the millions of Britons using a .net or .com domain name, who despite following UK law to operate their website can be extradited to the US. To conclude; the US-UK extradition treaty makes a mockery of British justice and further brings to question the \"special relationship\" we hold with America. This petition calls on the government to make immediate changes to the treaty to see that any UK citizen sought for extradition to the US get the same fair trial that a US citizen would receive.",
