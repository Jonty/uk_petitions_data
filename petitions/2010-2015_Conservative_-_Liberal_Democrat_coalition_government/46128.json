        "additional_details": "A campaign to get the government to place a tax on the sale of puppies. Such a tax would encourage people to adopt rather than to buy from breeders due to the cost. This in turn would discourage breeders due to the reduction in demand.\r\n\r\nA tax of say \u00a3500 per puppy could be placed on all sales. These funds could be channelled towards animal charities and in doing so encouraging animal charities to help with the enforcement of such tax.\r\n\r\nDog breeding in this country out weighs demand!\r\n\r\nIt Is absolutely absurd that in this day and age many thousands of dogs are being put to sleep every year mostly because of the lack of thought and unawareness of the by many people.\r\n\r\nIt is the intention that causing a debate in the House of Commons will raise the profile of this issue and hopefully put in place a solution.\r\n\r\nI believe we need a hundred thousand signatures. If you agree please sign it only takes 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nStuart Jones\r\n\r\n",
