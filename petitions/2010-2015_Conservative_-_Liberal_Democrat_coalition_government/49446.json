        "additional_details": "Diabetic Retinopathy causes the highest amount of acquired visual loss in the UK - treatment options are limited and in certain parts of the UK the care is appalling.\r\nMost common treatments are photocoagulation (laser) and improved diabetic control. Proper and effective treatment can save sight. Newer treatments such as Avastin can prevent other complications. Sometimes an operation called a vitrectomy is needed- please help us get contact to the government to improve early treatments for everyone.\r\n",
