        "additional_details": "It is mandatory to provide a Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) with all outpatients prescribed medicines-- unless the patient has received a PIL in the last three months.\r\nThe process of checking to see if that patient has had a PIL in the last three months can take ten minutes- the process of finding PILs  for all medicines provided can take ten minutes. The subsequent checking of the medicines is further delayed as the pharmacist or checking technician has to check if the PIL is correct. Adding at least 20 minutes dispensing time on every TTA and Outpatient prescription.\r\n\r\nI would like the law to reflect these points:\r\n1. Manufacturers of medicines to provide a PIL in every medicine\r\n2. Manufacturers to provide a downloadable PIL of all medicines they produce, the PIL should be succinct and worded for the masses.\r\n3. The pharmacy should provide a PIL if demanded on a prescribed medicine but only if demanded.\r\n\r\n",
