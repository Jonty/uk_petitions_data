This heavy tax hits these people the hardest yet they probably work full-time and earn less than their unemployed neighbours on benefits paid through the very same tax.\r\n\r\nGeorge Osborne must right this wrong and soon, before more people slip into poverty while living costs soar and wages stagnate.
