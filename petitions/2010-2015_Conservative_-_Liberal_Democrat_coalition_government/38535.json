        "additional_details": "This petition is for people who believe that bringing up a child costs a set amount, and that the more the parent without care earns should not mean that they must pay more to the parent with care. Just because you are making a success of yourself and earning more, does not mean the parent who has care should be better off from it. This is your money you have worked hard for, which can be used to treat your son or daughter when you have access to him/her. It should not go in the parent with cares back pocket. For years families have started due to one side knowing how easy it is to get money from the other partner by simply having a child.",
