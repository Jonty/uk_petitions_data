Non believers are encouraged to go to church to get their kids in to the best state schools - which is a milder version of the crusades.\r\nNon Believers should at least be offered a tax rebate as right now they pay for schools that will not accept their children.\r\n\r\nHindus and Muslims can set up their own schools of course, but does this country really want to encourage such religious segregation, especially at such a young age?",
