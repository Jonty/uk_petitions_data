They are more likely to pay their prescription charge where applicable and less likely to waste NHS time as they see the cost to the country through wasted medications and appointments.\r\nTherefore, by doing their duty for the NHS and the country, healthcare professionals should be exempt from paying national insurance in exchange for their hard-working and dedicated service to the public for what is often less money than their foreign counterparts.
