        "additional_details": "This E-Petition is for the seperation of the BBC entertainment services from the governing/managerial body. In doing so the TV Licensing would go to the governing body and the TV infrastructure. Meanwhile the BBC channels, radio etc can be left to function just like any other TV service, especially in the case of funding.\r\n\r\nThis would result in a pure, unbiased governing body and allow the citizen to choose which TV channels he/she pays for, rather than paying for one he/she doesn't actually watch, or care for.",
