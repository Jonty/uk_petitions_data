        "additional_details": "Car Insurance Premiums are already too high. What drivers don't need, is to be penalised for something that isn't their fault.\r\nAs it stands, if someone drives into you and admits liability, you will still be facing higher premiums come renewal.\r\nWhy?\r\n I have absolutely no idea. Apparently, being in the wrong place at the wrong time, whilst doing nothing wrong, still merits a financial penalty!\r\nIf you, like me, believe that insurance companies are taking advantage of innocent people, then please sign this petition.\r\n",
