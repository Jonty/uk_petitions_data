        "additional_details": "PETS ARE STILL NOT ALLOWED ON EUROSTAR\r\nMany of you will be aware of a defect in the pet travel scheme \u2013 those who do not drive can still not take their pets with them across the channel by train. The Channel Tunnel Shuttle service is only accessible for car drivers and their passengers; the ferries have only very limited facilities for foot passengers with pets. The obvious solution is for Eurostar (the London \u2013 Paris/Brussels train) to accept passengers with pets. After much pressure a concession was made for Guide dogs and this was later extended to include all registered Assistance dogs. But there has been no progress on travel for the ordinary passenger with a pet. There is in general no difficulty taking a pet dog or cat by train from London (or elsewhere) to Folkestone and then from Calais to any part of France. It is the link across the Channel which is missing and Eurostar has effectively a monopoly on the route and a veto over its use. ",
