Countries such as India still receive massive aid payments from Britain, yet India can afford to spend money on a space program. Britain would find it hard to buy two sparklers.Its a crazy situation spending billions on aid overseas when peaple in Britain cant find jobs becouse of spending cuts.Its our money and we demand it is spent on funding British jobs and charities.",
