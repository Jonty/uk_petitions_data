If they don't have the required training, they should not escort our children.\r\n\r\nOften, as parents of children with additional or special needs, we find the transport to school and home are staffed by escorts who have no idea how to relate to our children, either when they are distressed or just in interacting with them.\r\n\r\nEscorts have a duty to of care whilst the children are under their supervision. How can they assist the children's needs if a) they don't understand them and b) see them as just a necessary burden for their job.\r\n\r\nPlease UK Government, make this disability awareness training mandatory for school escorts on Specialist Support school transport from home to school and home again.\r\n\r\nThank you.
