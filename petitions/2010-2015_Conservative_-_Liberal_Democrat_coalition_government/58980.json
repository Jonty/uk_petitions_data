I simply CANNOT believe that none of them agree with the population that it should be scrapped because it is causing EXTREME deprivation in this country and it us fear under the corrupt patronage system of politics now dominant in this country which causes them to keep quiet.  The people should know just how many, if not precisely who, would also do the right thing if their current and future financial well being did not depend on them toeing the party line.",
