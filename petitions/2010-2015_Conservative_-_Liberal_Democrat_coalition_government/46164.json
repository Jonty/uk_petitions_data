        "additional_details": "Public houses all over Britain are closing in increasing numbers per month as a result of drink-driving laws, smoking legislation and high prices (mainly tax).  This represents a serious decline in an important part of British Culture. It will also have a significant effect on the national drink problem. Much of the drinking problem arises from drinking cheaper super-market drink at home. A responsible pub landlord will refuse to serve anyone excessively drinking. Pubs are a great social \"mixer\" of all ages and class. The tendency for pubs to close could be slowed by reducing the tax on keg beer and increasing the tax on canned and bottled beer, thus producing a \"zero sum\" change for the treasury",
