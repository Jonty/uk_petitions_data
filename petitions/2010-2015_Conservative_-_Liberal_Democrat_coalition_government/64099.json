Think about this; your own child, if you have one, could be one of these 'abominations' you speak of. And so perhaps, as a result of your preaching, they are too afraid to stand up for themselves, and have been worn down to a state where they are so afraid, and so ashamed, that they dare not come out.\r\n\r\nI am but I mere 13 year old girl, who's ambition is to be able to change the way our society works, and make marriage equality, as big a issue, as racial equality.\r\n\r\nLove is not a sin. Hate is.\r\n",
