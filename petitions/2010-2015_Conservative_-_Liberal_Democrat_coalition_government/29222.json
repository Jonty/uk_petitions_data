They should not get involved, send troops in or anything else. Its up to the un to do this and call on help not for americans to jump and do the dirty work.\r\n\r\nThis is 1 asking for another cold war and if it escalates 2 world war. In my opinion russia is more communist ruled that ever and it is in no ones best interests to aggravate them.",
