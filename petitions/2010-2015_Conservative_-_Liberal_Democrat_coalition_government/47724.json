        "additional_details": "Every day millions of animals are caged and abused or put down because there is no control of the animal breeding practices in this country. We don't have any laws in place that protect the animals nor the government. .There needs to be legislation in place to protect the animals from being placed in small cages and bred over and over until they are no longer useful to the breeder and then disposed of. There needs to be legislation in place to require every breeder to be fully licensed and insured. There need to be inspections of the facilities and there need to be serious consequences to their actions. There needs to be legislation banning the selling of dogs from unlicensed breeders..I'm asking for a special measure, one that would be UK wide, that would stop this destructive and costly practice. The only way to stop it, is to make it illegal.\r\n\r\n",
