        "additional_details": "The use of GM and cloned crops & livestock should be considered positively. Without the benefits of GM & cloned crops and livestock being positively encouraged in agriculture, food will become even more expensive and feeding the exponential rise in human population impossible. Though the ecological effects of GM crops are not entirely clear, they are unlikely to be physiologically harmful, as unlike pesticides and weed killers, specific genes introduced to GM crops produce known natural nontoxic compounds. Merely ingesting GM crops will not change any one's own genetic makeup. Perceived advantageous characteristics are the result of natural slow random adaptation or selective breeding and then the survival of the fittest in a particular environment/niche. Cloning crops (and even for animals) merely ensure that such advantageous characteristics are retained and perhaps used for natural reproduction of future offspring.",
