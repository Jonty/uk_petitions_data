        "additional_details": "ITV have announced that they are planning to scrap 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' after 15 years. As a Great British export and as it is the most popular 'exported format' in the world, it seems logical that the original version should remain on television, and not just repeats on BSkyB channel Challenge.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition hereby calls for Her Majesty's Government to order ITV to stop their plans to scrap this show, and not necessarily to stop Chris Tarrant leaving the show.",
