        "additional_details": "The Government recognises that the price of petrol has become an increasingly significant part of day-to-day spending. We know this is causing real difficulties in ensuring that motoring remains affordable and people are feeling the pinch.\r\n\r\nThey recon that since the last budget the have saved the avg motorist \u00a356 on fuel costs ! Great  you think Wrong , with high fuel costs everything you buy has gone up to cover the additional costs in delivery even the humble postage stamp has increased .\r\nPeople are tending now to buy food rather than fuel.\r\nless fuel bought equals less revenue for the goverment so they put the prices up to compensate the losses,\r\nDrop the prices will mean people will be able to travel  further ,buy things with the spare money ,tourism will increase .more purchase's through shops and business means they are busier and are likely to employ more staff .\r\nmore fuel bought will also help us keep the buying cost down as we will be buying more .\r\nCant be a bad thing ??",
