        "additional_details": "Timeshare ownership is now an unwanted item in many peoples eyes and the ever increasing cost of maintenance fees in the present economic climate is becoming a burden that people can no longer manage. Timeshare clubs and management companies are becoming more aggressive in the way they attempt to collect un-paid fees, resorting to threats of County Court actions and utilisation of Debt Collectors, some of whom  do not hold a licence.\r\nIn some cases, maintenance fees have risen so much that they are no longer viable for an owner to maintain and  the rise is often far in excess of the rate of inflation.\r\nMost contracts are held in perpetuity, meaning that liability for maintenance fee payment is FOREVER, resulting in the debt being passed down the line to your children.\r\nThe law must be reviewed to annul the perpetuity clause and allow fair arbitration in endeavours to cancel the ownership contract that exists.",
