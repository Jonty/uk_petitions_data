Many rioters/looters/etc. could not be pursued due to the gear being too cumbersome and/or heavy. Many officers worked for thirty-six hours non-stop.\r\n\r\nAs reward for their service to our community, we demand that Manchester's loyal and hard-working officers should be immediately supplied with the most up-to-date, protective and best riot-gear available.",
