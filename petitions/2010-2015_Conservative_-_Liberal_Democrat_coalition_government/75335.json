        "additional_details": "For the past 18 months this crossing has been an issue from the barriers getting stuck to now not closing at all as trains pass through. Something needs to be done about this before somebody gets hurt. What happens if one day the lights dont work aswel as the barrier what would Network Rail have to say then? Would they still find some excuse as to why its not their fault for making the crossing automated To save some money? Are you willing to sit back and wait for this to happen? Surely it costs alot more each year to send engineers out to the barriers and for the police to monitor the crossing when thereas a fault, than it would to place a signal man back in the box. The chaos this crossing is causing is rediculous when it could be avoided so easily. So I ask you please sign this petition and lets hope that someone will finally listen and something will be done before its too late!",
