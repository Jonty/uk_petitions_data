        "additional_details": "as a student nurse I find the lack of continence knowledge is quite shocking and I believe that this should change. it is an important issue and I understand that it is a taboo subject but it can help diagnose many health issues. so I think that a greater awareness may help to reduce some pressure on the NHS even if it is a small reduction. So please sign this petition and lets raise awareness!!!",
