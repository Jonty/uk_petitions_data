I wish for the general populace to retain their right to petition the current government to review this legislation by signing this petition.\r\n\r\nThere is clear  inconstancy when company's file for administration around policy towards customers for example Comet, JJB Sports, Game, Peacocks and Blacks Leisure who all recently filed for administration or were liquefied.\r\n\r\nIt is the belief of many that there should be strickter guildlines and rules within this area. This has recently been highlighted through with HMV filing for administration with many people left distressed by the loss of assest via gift cards. The current appeal to the administrator for compensation is not fit for purpose. So in all I hope the people can get a vioce through this petition about the weakness of legislation and application of legislation that currently exsists.",
