        "additional_details": "Use of personal communication devices such as iPads, laptops, PDA\u2019s, e readers, phones and other mobile devices whilst driving is likely to distract a drivers observation skills, and concentration. The use of mobile devices whilst at the wheel at the present moment in time is seen by many as a chance worth taking as the penalties if convicted are no longer seen as a deterrent by many\r\nIf a drivers concentration is impaired when using these devices it is no different to their concentration being impaired through drink or drugs so the punishments should be just the same\r\nWe therefore ask the government to carry out the following as a matter of urgency\r\n1 Make the using of these mobile devices whilst driving a criminal offence\r\n2 Raise punishments if convicted of using these devices whilst driving to those of driving under the influence of drink / drugs\r\n3 Mount a robust national campaign to make it socially unacceptable to use a mobile device when driving",
