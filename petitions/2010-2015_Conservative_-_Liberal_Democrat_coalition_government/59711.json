Local residents are cut off from the motorway and the traffic can strand you for hours at a time.\r\n\r\nThe Trafford centre has increased in size over the last 10 years and road system is not capable of handling the volume of visitors. They have recently added a convention centre which has greatly increased the issue of traffic problems.\r\n\r\nThe Trafford centre should not be allowed to further expand unless they improve the road system surrounding it - This petition is cap further development until a suitable traffic calming measure is developed and put into place.
