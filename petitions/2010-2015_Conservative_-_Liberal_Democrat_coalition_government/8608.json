        "additional_details": "Considering all the riots that have hit particularly London there needs to be a new charge which makes imprisoning those individuals that are guilty of looting and causing criminal damage far easier.\r\n\r\nThis charge/offence should be limited to situations such as seen in the last few days and to those responsible for ruining the peaceful student protests. This should not be a general offence that can be used for the single individual causing criminal damage but for instances where large groups are working together to cause damage, fear or violence as well as to those who are looting.",
