        "additional_details": "Altaf Hussain, resident of Edgware, London, leader of MQM, should be prosecuted for inciting violence against peaceful protesters in Karachi (who were protesting against the rigging carried out by his party in the elections) on live national television on 12th May 2013.\r\n\r\nWe urge our Government to declare his \"political party\" a terrorist organisation, as has been done by the Canadian government in the case of Mohammed Kashif Omer, a resident of Montreal. It was the second time Canadian courts had ruled that the MQM party meets the legal definition of a terrorist organization.\r\n\r\nWe urge the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that Altaf Hussain does not continue to be a threat to human rights and human lives from his base in London.
