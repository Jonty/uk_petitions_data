Instead of discussing all types of racism in the world it has become exclusively devoted to attacking one country - Israel.\r\nAt the previous Durban 2 in Geneva Mr Ahmadinejad, who has already called for the destruction of Israel was allowed free reign to spout his hatred and denial of the Holocaust..\r\nThe USA, Canada, Czech Republic, Italy and The Nederlands have already said they will boycott this farce and the UK should do the same, and not encourage the rise of anti-semitism, which is already increasing alarmingly..\r\n.
