        "additional_details": "In 1974, the former London Borough of Hornsey was amalgamated into the London Borough of Haringey. The local government of Haringey often ignores the wishes and needs of the people who live in Hornsey. This petition is a call for the government to restore a measure of local democracy and reconstitute the Borough of Hornsey, with minor amendments to the former historical boundaries, such as including both sides of Highgate High Street within the borough.",
