        "additional_details": "Hi everyone this is a petition for something we feel very strongly about , as well as something that seriously needs to stop .\r\nYou have have the International Whaling Commission ( I.W.C. ) it's made up from government members from all over the world , some are from Anti Whaling countries and some are from Pro Whaling countries ie : Iceland , Greenland , Norway , Japan etc . The I.W.C. make up a Moratorium which states the legal amount of whales they are allowed to kill , all of these countries are illegally killing whales . Just now the Moratorium hasn't been reviewed since 2004 and we think it's about time it got reviewed , I mean 7 years is a long time for something so important not to be reviewed when in actual fact it should be getting done every year . And more importantly ENFORCED 25,000 whales die needlessly every year .\r\nPLEASE sign the petition and get the Moratorium reviewed .\r\n\r\nThank you .",
