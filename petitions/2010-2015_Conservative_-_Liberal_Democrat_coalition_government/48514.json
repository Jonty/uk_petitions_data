        "additional_details": "The NHS tells us that \"Best before dates are about quality, not safety. When the date is passed, it doesn't mean that the food will be harmful, but it might begin to lose its flavour and texture.\"\r\n\r\nYet today we found 20+ bags of Doritos crisps in a Tesco store that were past their best before date by 8 days.\r\n\r\nWe requested to speak with the manager about getting them written off so we could take them to our local charity food bank.\r\n\r\nThe manager told us \"it's against the law for us to give you these\", we said ok, what if we sign a waiver. He said no, he would love to but it's against the law.\r\n\r\nHe told us they would be put in the bin & there is nothing we can do about it.\r\n\r\nWell we can do something about this! We urge the Prime minister & government to reconsider food dates and how supermarkets handle these.\r\n\r\nNow I'm sure you may comment saying that some shops already give food to charity/other companies to sell on etc\r\n\r\nIt's ridiculous at the moment & we need change.",
