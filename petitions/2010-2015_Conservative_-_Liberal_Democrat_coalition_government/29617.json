It is not sustainable to maintain these selfish people any longer. In rare circumstances there can be medical reasons for their size, this petition is not about those people. Nor is it about overweight people, it is about the morbidly obese that drain an unbelievable amount of resources.\r\n Imagine all the time and money we could gain for helping desperately unfortunate people who have terrible illness's. These people are the poster children of a sick society, we must force them into a lifestyle change, for their own good, and for the good of our future.",
