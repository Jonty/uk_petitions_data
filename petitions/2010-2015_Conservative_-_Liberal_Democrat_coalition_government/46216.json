        "additional_details": "Disabled children under 3 years old do not currently qualify for the \"Motability\" component of the DLA. This obviously includes many children who have Spinal Muscular Atrophy, and we feel that the rules need to change.\r\n\r\nWe were told that children under 3 do not require help getting a vehicle as they get transported in a pram / pushchair. While that is very true, it is also a fact that young children who are disabled often need to travel to hospitals for regular check-ups and tests. They also often require a lot of equipment to be transported with them, and that equipment can take up more space than that available in a typical family car.\r\n\r\nThis is why we believe that children under 3 deserve to be included within the motability section of the disability living allowance.\r\n\r\nPlease sign our petition to get the rules changed in the future.",
