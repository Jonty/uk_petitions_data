        "additional_details": "I would like to call for a review of the current workings within the UK courts system.\r\nThe Police have recently had the Winsor review in which they have been instructed to make drastic changes to, let's be honest, save money.\r\nThe court sysytem in this country is, for want of a better word, abused to some extent by some of the members of the legal profession who on a daily basis, delay trials/hearings or call for unnecessary items on the day of a trial which only sets to delay the hearing and maximise their payment.\r\nAn urgent review is required to see what  if anything can be done to cut bureaucracy & to save money.\r\nI truly believe that the government will save millions by conducting a review of the courts in this country and would ask people to sign this petition to have this matter discussed in parliament.",
