        "additional_details": "As you are aware the UK is being over run by illegal immigrants and the government hands are tied to introducing identity cards to stop it. Its simple, if you are legally entitled to be in the UK you would support the identity card but the cost is too great, therefore we should use existing systems and measure to tackle both problems. Everybody is issued with a national insurance card therefore we should make them picture insurance cards verified against legal documents and made mandatory for people to carry them. This will help with illegal immigration, benefits cheats the like. Lets be honest, in my opinion most of the people who want to avoid such measures are people who have something to hide or no legal entitlement.",
