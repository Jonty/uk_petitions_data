        "additional_details": "Charge people part of the cost of their NHS use like their Income tax rates - so both the more you earn & the more you use the NHS, the more you pay. Charging by use (even largely subsidised & capped) would encourage more frugal use of the NHS and, together with competition & choice, help prevent suppliers overpricing & doing unnecessary work. Essentially this is modernising existing prescription charges. NHS charges would be added to your Income tax bill. Income Tax might itself be cut. Charges would include consultation, medication & surgery - though the first X pounds of a person's NHS charges each tax year would be free. Preventative healthcare (eg. dentists' & opticians' routine check-ups, flu jabs, quit smoking etc), accident & emergency and maternity care would also be free.",
