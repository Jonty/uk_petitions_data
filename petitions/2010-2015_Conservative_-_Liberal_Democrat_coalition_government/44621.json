Most women affected will also be eligible to apply for it.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a small number of women, born in the first half of 1953, who also had their pension age increased in 2012 but who, under the Government\u2019s January 2013 proposals, will not be eligible to apply for the new higher flat-rate pension.\r\n\r\nThis may have been unintentional, but it is unfair and discriminatory and we urge the Government to look again at this issue and find a fair and just solution.\r\n",
