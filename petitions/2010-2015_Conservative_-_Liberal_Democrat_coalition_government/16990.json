        "additional_details": "Students on student visas, many on elementary courses (like NVQs, English language courses, assess courses) came to UK on student visas with the actual intention to work full-time, not to study. Foreigners on student visas are allowed only to work a maximum of 20 hours a week. It is a loophole to allow bogus students admitted by bogus colleges to circumvent immigration control and stay & work in UK. After 5 years in UK they are likely to be given 'indefinite leave to remain in UK' visas for themselves and their extended family members. Any courses taken by foreign students must be one approved as of benefit for foreign students on their return to their own country. Foreign students must leave a large deposit (say \u00a350,000) to UK\u2019s Department of Education before commencing a course in UK. The deposit will only be returnable if the foreign students leave UK on completion of the course specified in their student visas.",
