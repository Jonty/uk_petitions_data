        "additional_details": "My wife works for an children's Accident and Emergency Department in a busy city hospital here in the North east of England. She works long hours, and rarely has time for a rest never mind a lunch break. She normally starts early but nearly always finishes late. A new time keeping system requires them to hand scan on start of their shift, and the same on the end of their shift. My frustration is that my wife's wage will be reduced if she tries to leave just 1 minute early, or arrives to work just 1 minute late - plus her breaks are deducted even if she doesn't get to take them. This is disgraceful and can't be right. This petition is to ensure this type of time keeping system can't occur in hospitals and a more flexible approach is adopted. Nurses don't get paid very much for what they do so this is the least the NHS can do for them. ",
