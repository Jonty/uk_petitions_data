They are forced to work ridiculous hours in unsafe conditions.They are often locked inside the workplace and abuse is a regular occurrence. This is to enable shops such as Adidas, Primark and H&M to sell their clothes for 'bargain' prices whilst making a large profit at the expense of these poor women who are paid less than even the minimum wage.\r\nThis is unacceptable, these companies are individually extremely rich and would be able to afford to pay these workers and ensure they have appropriate working conditions.\r\n\r\nPlease help us raise awareness of this issue and put a stop to it, make these companies own up to their actions and the effect it has on real lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
