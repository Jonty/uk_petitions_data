Familys on low incomes are struggling to feed there children the food they need due to the cost and get no financial support\r\n\r\nI wish for the government to recognise this problem and for the dwp either make a new benefit for these sufferers or for it be counted as part of the current dla.\r\n\r\nIt may not be a disability as such but if given the wrong food can have severe consequences.",
