        "additional_details": "Over recent years many police forces across the UK have started using the Special Constabulary for more front line policing roles.\r\nIt appears that all forces are using the Special Constabulary even more so they can cut costs and 'Police on the cheap'. This is putting a large strain on volunteers and causing most to resign due to being expected to have more responsibility for free.\r\nThe government needs to be made aware of this issue and look in to changing the Special Constabulary to a Police Reserve (like the Army Reserve).\r\nTurning the Special Constabulary in to the 'Police Reserve' would benefit local forces because, like the Army Reserve, it could call on officers to assist as and when it needed them and not worry about officers failing to turn in due to their work commitments.\r\nAs paid reservists,  officers could be given more responsibility, could be 'posted' to stations for a period of time and receive financial rewards.\r\n",
