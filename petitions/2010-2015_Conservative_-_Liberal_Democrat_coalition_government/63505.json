After a 30 minute car journey, then a park & ride bus journey, followed by  20+ anxious minutes in the hospital\u2019s  public waiting room?  Would you prefer to leave that same public waiting room in a state of understandable devastation, through a public area, with an equally distressed partner/supporter, with neither of you really able to think straight?  Then tackle the journey home?\r\nNO!   Like Amanda you would probably prefer to have pre registered your preference for your GP to deliver significant test results in your own home (or even at your local surgery).  Naturally, subsequent hospital appointments would be necessary, but that initial, all important and potentially shattering piece of news would be better delivered in a manner you have chosen.\r\nAmanda wants the government to give patients the choice!\r\n",
