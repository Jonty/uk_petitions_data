        "additional_details": "Last week France had 260,000 armed police available to respond to the terrorist attacks.  The UK's police numbers are rapidly diminishing with only 6,000 armed officers.  We call on Govnt. to improve our ability to respond to armed terrorist attacks by a) increasing significantly the ability of the UK police to deploy armed officers at any time across the breadth of the country, b) improving police command resilience, and c) creating a larger reserve of specially trained soldiers as a back up.",
