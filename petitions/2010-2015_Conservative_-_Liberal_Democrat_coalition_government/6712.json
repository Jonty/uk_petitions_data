        "additional_details": "I undersign the following petition to the government to ask that the futher training supplied in the \"Pass Plus\" Scheme should become compulsory for all new learner drivers.\r\n\r\nThis is to ensure that not only are the roads potentially safer due to the education but it also gives new drives the all important skills, which will in turn give them the ability to understand the road systems better.\r\nIf mandatory, I also believe that it will assist in the reduction of insurance premiums, not only on an individual basis, but on the entire insurance market as a whole.",
