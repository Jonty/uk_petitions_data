        "additional_details": "All car manufacturers should install automatic lights on vehicles. Too often we see vehicles being driven in poor visibility with either no lights on or almost unseen sidelights. Vehicles should, by law, be manufactured with the installation of automatic lights which would overide a drivers response. Too few vehicles have this capability as standard ie you can have it but it is classed as an extra. The law should also be retrospective, in that existing vehicles should have this capability installed via after market purchase. The owner should be allowed grace until the vehicle is due its next MOT where it should be a compulsory MOT requirement.",
