        "additional_details": "Bill Longmore was elected as Police and Crime Commissioner for the West Mercia region and has shown by his subsequent behaviour that he is not fulfilling any part of his role.\r\n\r\nHe has refused to speak to the local media or acknowledge the fact that local people in the West Mercia region (1.2m people approx) disapprove of him appointing his campaign agent and long time friend as his Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner on a salary of \u00a350,000.\r\n\r\nThis post of Deputy is an unelected post and neither the Police and Crime Commissioner nor his Deputy know the West Mercia area.\r\n\r\nBoth of them obviously think this is a nice cushy retirement option with a nice fat salary cheque.\r\n\r\nThe wishes and concerns of the West Mercia residents need to be listened to and action taken against Bill Longmore and his crony Deputy.",
