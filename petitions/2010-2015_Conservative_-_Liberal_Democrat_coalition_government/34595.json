He has not been seen since, and his family believe that he is - or was - held incommunicado. The authorities deny that they are holding him. The reason for his disappearance is unknown.\r\n\r\nIbragim's father reported his son's disappearance the same day and a criminal investigation was opened. However, the investigation has been repeatedly suspended on the grounds of 'failing to establish a suspect'",
