        "additional_details": "BBC cultural, entertainment and public affairs output seems to more readily accept and promote a left-wing political agenda than in previous decades.  This  threatens the institution's impartiality and integrity.  This petition requests a public inquiry into the existence or otherwise of institutional  left-wing political bias at the BBC, particularly (but not exclusively) focusing on public affairs policy, en-masse membership of Unions (in particular the NUJ), vested interests in left-wing newspapers (and magazines) and the existence or otherwise of a deliberate Gramscian 'long walk' agenda. Examples include excessive air-time afforded to the Labour Party, cultural marxism such as so-called political correctness, anit-capitalist 'banker bashing' and institutional vilification of conservative tradition and corporate success.  This petition is requested in order to ensure that citizens are presented with unbiased output rather than a left-wing propagandist agenda. ",
