        "additional_details": "We the people of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ask the government to stop considering the option of allowing refugees from the Syrian conflict to come to this country. We are not racist but believe that other countries should take care of them, ideally countries surrounding Syria. We believe that sending financial aid would be a better option and would ensure we dont end with jihadists promoting violence or with abuse of the benefit system. We also ask the UK government to encourage other countries to take in refugees or at least to provide aid to ensure the UK, American and European taxpayers are not alone in supporting the Syrian people.
