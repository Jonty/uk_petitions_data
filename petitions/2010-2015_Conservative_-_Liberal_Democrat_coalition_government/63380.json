        "additional_details": "East Lancashire Medical Services (ELMS) has provided Out of Hours Care (when your GP surgery is closed) to 540,000 patients across Pennine Lancs for 20 years. There is a proposal to tender this service, which may negatively impact upon patients, drastically reduce the level of care and mean the loss of local jobs and local GPs providing the service. Clinical Commissioning Groups take note - We would like to see any decision to tender, overturned and this service taken out of procurement. Keep ELMS as the Patients preferred Provider.",
