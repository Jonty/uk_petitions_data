In most instances something could have been done to stop someone ending their life.\r\n\r\nTo quote Mr Lamb\r\n\r\nMr Lamb said: \"We have a complete responsibility to reduce the number of people taking their own lives.\r\n\r\n\"One suicide is one too many. It's this awful sense of the torment they must go through which means we have to give this a high priority.\"\r\n\r\nIt remains the biggest single killer of men in the 15 to 29 year old age bracket.\r\n\r\nLet us hold him to his word.",
