        "additional_details": "Giving our date of birth on a daily basis leaves us all vulnerable to identity theft, illegal immigration as well as potentially endangering national security which could be compromised due to this lack of  ID security. An example is: We are forced to give our date of birth to call centres in other countries daily, we give this to people who really could be anybody at all. A National Security number for us to produce for ID purposes would be globally preferable to cover a range of vulnerabilities.\r\nSuch a solution would also be in compliance with HRA Article 8 'right to a private life' - apart from that law, the UK appears to have little privacy law and the Data Protection Act is clearly not working well across the board according to reports. A new system with an ID number could also assist with the NHS and other government bodies. For added security our NI number, or part of it, could also be requested, if needed. Thank you. ",
