The law does not currently provide adequate protection for such attacks.\r\n\r\nWe call upon UK Government  to address these concerns by;\r\n\u2022 Granting the same protection to cats as is granted to protected animals under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, ensuring that owners of dangerously out of control dogs that attack cats, could face prosecution, as is the case if such dogs attack a person, assistance dog or other protected animals.\r\n\u2022 Looking to prevent such attacks with the possible introduction of Dog Control Notices, that could tackle behavioral problems before attacks take place.\r\n",
