It is often necessary, because of oncoming or parked vehicles to pass over speed bumps with only nearside or offside wheels. This causes a sharp lateral displacement, whether in a car or on a bus. It is this movement that causes severe back pain to sufferers from slipped discs and other spinal problems. On a bus, especially on the upper deck, the movement is exaggerated and, apart from pain it is very dangerous for passengers, particularly the elderly, negotiating stairs.",
