        "action": "Stop the Release of NHS Data to the Private Sector",
        "additional_details": "The government plans to release NHS data to private sector healthcare companies to facilitate \"research for the benefit of patients\".\r\n\r\nAlthough the government assures that individual patients will not be identified there is a poor track record of data security amongst both central and local government departments.\r\n\r\nThe government also states that this will give the \"sickest patients access to life-saving drugs a year before they would normally be available\" and \"put new drugs and technologies in NHS hospitals more quickly\".  However, this does not guarantee that such drugs and treatments will not be later withdrawn from patients by NICE on the grounds of \"expense\" and \"value for money\" as so many have in recent years.\r\n\r\nThe supporters of this petition see these plans as a serious further erosion of our privacy for the sake of a project with questionable objectives and intangible benefits and demand that such plans are suspended immediately.",
