        "additional_details": "This Petition has been set up by ACT Against Corvid Traps.\r\nLarsen traps are banned in their country of origin because they are viewed as inhumane, they are still legal in the UK. They use a live wild decoy bird to attract/trap crows, magpies, jays, jackdaws & rooks. The decoy bird suffers a terrible existance. Close to the ground, terrorised by predators, these intelligent birds see its fellow birds brutally killed in front of it. A number end up being found dead through neglect. Most used by gamekeepers, but more worrying now used by normal householders.\r\nMulti Corvid Traps are often called crow traps. These traps are almost always used by gamekeepers to catch and kill crows but will often catch Raptors (birds of prey). Gamekeepers have historically been hostile to Raptors, and inevitably many of the trapped birds are killed.\r\n\r\nAll we ask is for these traps to be banned from sale and use in the United Kingdom and anyone found using them to be punished with the full force of the law.",
