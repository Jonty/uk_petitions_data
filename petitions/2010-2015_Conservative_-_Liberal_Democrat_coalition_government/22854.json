        "additional_details": "Look into the possibility of turning mined coal into a source of re-usable fuel for private and public transportation. South Africa has a product called SASOL which mixes Ethanol with the mined coal to form petrol. Can the department concerned look into the feasability of this product which would help reduce our dependency on outside sourcing of oil products at a great expense to the public as a whole. This would help rekindle the coal mining industry and assist farmers as sugar cane/beet is the ingredients for Ethanol. This program would assist the government in reducing unemployment and lower the costs of obtaining fuel oils worldwide.",
