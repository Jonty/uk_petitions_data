        "additional_details": "For the last 21 years there has been no  Secretary of State for Defence who has had previous military experience.\r\n\r\nI believe this will effect the Armed Forces in the future, as the government is giving all the decision making power to someone who has had no experience of military life and so does not truly understand the needs and wants of our Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nI propose that for the future Secretaries of State for Defence, a requirement of a least ten years of military experience is required to be even considered for the position.\r\n\r\nI believe this requirement will help the Armed Forces. it will also mean that all soldiers, sailors & airmen will be able to truly trust those who are in control of there futures.",
