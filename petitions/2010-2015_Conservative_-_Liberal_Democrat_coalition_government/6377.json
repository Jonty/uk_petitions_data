        "additional_details": "I petition that the BBC Charter be amended so that the Trustees include a majority of members of the general public to ensure that the Corporation reflects the views of the majority of licence-fee-payers.\r\n\r\nThe BBC Trustees are supposed to represent the 'ordinary' licence-fee-payer, but are themselves members of the elitist, liberal clique that control the Corporation's policy.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the official criteria for suitability ensures that only \u201cthe great and the good\u201d are eligible.\r\n\r\nThe BBC over the years has exerted far more influence than the Murdock organisation and fear of its power has prevented MPs from representing the overwhelmingly majority view of the electorate on matters like immigration, Europe, antisocial behaviour etc.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile (as is the current procedure) the Prime Minister should advice HM Queen to appoint members of the general public to replace at least half of current BBC Trustees.\r\n",
