These children are often forgotten about and \u201cdropped\u201d by the social services, can often suffer on-going emotional trauma requiring therapy, their welfare is not checked and social services rarely help the family financially. It is important we raise awareness of the plight of these young people and their grandparents. The government need to address this issue and give more emotional and financial support to those families affected.",
