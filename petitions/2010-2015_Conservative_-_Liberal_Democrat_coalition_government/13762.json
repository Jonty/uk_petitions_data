        "additional_details": "On 28.02.2011 David Cameron showed leadership and proposed intervention in Libya. This was a no-fly zone, designed to help prevent a deteriorating situation resulting in a humanitarian crisis in Benghazi. Muammar Gaddafi's forces were close to re-taking Benghazi after it had been taken and made the capital of the opposing National Transitional Council. On 17.03.2011 UN Resolution 1973 was approved and this authorised intervention to protect civilians. Now, according to reports, a similar situation is now looming in which the National Transnational Council forces are close to conquering Tripoli. Colonel Gaddafi still has much support in Tripoli and has reportedly supplied the public with many thousands of guns.\r\nMr.Cameron, please propose that UN Peacekeepers or an ISAF force be inserted between the two opposing forces in order to assist an orderly transition of power as is possible and prevent unnecessary chaos, suffering and a humanitarian crisis in Tripoli. Thank you.",
