        "additional_details": "The government is in consultation on forcing search engines and ISP to automatically block adult content.\r\n\r\nThe technology cannot possibly work without severely censoring the internet. Placing the onus on search engines and ISPs may help slightly but as soon as the child is on a content sharing website, e.g. yahoo/tumblr/snapchat/instagram and countless others adult content will be available. This is where kids are more likely to come across adult content already .To pretend otherwise shows how completely out of touch the government is with technology.\r\n\r\n Let parents be responsible for their kids and stop trying to run the rest of our lives.\ufeff",
