        "additional_details": "Currently there is no scheme in this country that effectively encourages people not to drink and drive. Prices in pubs and clubs means that the price difference between an alcoholic drink and non alcoholic drink is not that great. Why pay more for a soft drink  when an alcoholic drink is cheaper? Create a scheme where designated drivers are entitled to free or discounted soft drinks. This can be done by door men noting the details of designated drivers and providing them with a wristband that can be used throughout the night at different venues.",
