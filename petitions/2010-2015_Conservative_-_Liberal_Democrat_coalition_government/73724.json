        "additional_details": "Genuine fans are losing out to ticket touts who buy large numbers of tickets to music, cultural and sporting events, then resell them at far above the face value, excluding large numbers of fans who cannot afford the inflated prices\r\n\r\nWe call upon the Government to introduce measures to regulate touts, and protect genuine fans:\r\n\r\n- tickets cannot be resold for more than than 10% above the face value. This includes all booking fees and other secondary charges\r\n\r\n- a ticket with a face value of zero cannot be resold at higher than reasonable postage costs only\r\n\r\n- no-one may advertise tickets for resale before tickets have even been released\r\n\r\n- all resale sites must clearly show the ticket's face value and whether a re-sale breaches terms and conditions\r\n\r\nThere is a place for legitimate ticket agencies. However the secondary ticket market needs to be transparent, so that genuine fans and customers are protected from profiteering ticket touts making huge profits by ripping off fans",
