        "additional_details": "With more shops and businesses disappearing from the High Street every week, it is now the right time to stop Sunday trading for all shops except the corner shop and petrol stations that are not connected to larger stores such as Tesco. Small high street shops seem forced to open on a Sunday to compete with the larger department stores. Not trading on Sundays, would reduce the overheads of the smaller shops. It is these small stores that are going bankrupt. We could also restrict 24\\7 trading of supermarkets, this could help to improve family life. As a balance, we should encourage late night shopping on one day a week.",
