I find it rediculus that a Government department gave my details away to be shared on the internet for all to see, this includes fraudsters, and other criminal/commercial minded persons. Is your private details shared on the internet with www.192.com?\r\nNo one asked me if I wanted the world to know my address, or who lives here or telephone number, only a foul would agree to that.\r\nI feel sorry for the older generation who don't have internet and don't know that fraudsters etc can see who is in there home.\r\nCLOSE THE SITE DOWN NOW",
