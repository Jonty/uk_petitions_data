        "additional_details": "I am creating this petition becuse I want the government to to indroduce a baby box scheme like the one in Finland. In Finland all expectant mothers that go to a doctors appointment before the fourth month of pregnancy receive a box of everything the baby will need for the first few months of life like vests, sleep suits etc. The box itself contains a mattress and sheet to be used like a moses basket. I think we should have this scheme implented in the UK as lots of mothers cant afford or even know what the baby needs. The box could also contain lots of infomation for new parents on pregnancy,  looking after new borns and signs of post natel depression.",
