This is on the basis that: 1) England & Wales share the same club league (e.g. Cardiff in the Premier League) 2) Millenium & Wembley Stadiums are not too far away and 3) together we would be a true world force - Wales have always had a number of outstanding individuals (e.g. Bale & Ramsey). Scotland not included as they have a seperate league and it would be too far to travel for games.",
