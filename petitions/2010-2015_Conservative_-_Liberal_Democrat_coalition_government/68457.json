        "additional_details": "Strongly object to Gazan's being treated by NHS staff to the detriment of UK patients who are being denied treatment/having to wait too long for treatment and attend poor facilities.  Doctors and surgeons leave their NHS posts and there is therefore inadequate cover for UK citizens.  A lack of co-ordination to ensure cover during conferences and holidays already exists.  In addition Gazan's will have to be housed here along with their families and will probably not return to Gaza.  There are other countries nearby Gaza with the facilities and wealth to assist and these should be the first port of call for Gazan's.  ",
