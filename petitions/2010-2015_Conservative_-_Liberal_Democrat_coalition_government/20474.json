This is specifically related to the basic use of the English language and grammar therein.\r\n\r\nReading through many of the e-petitions it is clear that many of petitioners are unable to coherently or clearly state their intentions or ideas in a standard that is comparable to a basic level of British education.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, therefor feel that it is the duty of parliament to provide every adult within Britain the basic requirements for rational discourse, this is inclusive of both verbal and written communications.\r\n\r\n",
