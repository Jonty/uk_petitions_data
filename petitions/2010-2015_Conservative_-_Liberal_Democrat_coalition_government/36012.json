        "additional_details": "Approx. 40 helicopters fly over the broadland area of Norfolk, 7 days a week - that includes flying over housing and areas of natural beauty.\r\n\r\nTired of those helicopters that make noise in a way that it affects your health? Fed up of the noise that rattles your home and stops a conversation? Is that helicopter right above you, like you could touch it it's so close?\r\n\r\nThen it is illegally too close. The limit is 2000 feet, if it is below and takes shortcuts above homes then it is breaching laws.\r\n\r\n7 days a week 6:30 - 22:00 is to much for anyone to have to put up with in their own home and garden.\r\n\r\nThat's what this petition is about. Have your voices heard!",
