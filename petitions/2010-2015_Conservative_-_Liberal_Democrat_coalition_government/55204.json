Legislation is required so that vouchers and cards should be treated as cash and retain their monetary value, that is not inflation proofed, and be redeemable at any time for any item or service of equivalent value. If the company has gone into administration then holders of gift cards and vouchers should be treated as priority creditors ahead of tax debts, suppliers, etc.",
