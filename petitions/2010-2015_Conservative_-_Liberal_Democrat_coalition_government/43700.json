        "additional_details": "I think it is a disgrace for young children who have an interest in sport to have someone like Alex Ferguson as a role model. His constant lies and his weekly criticism of the press, fellow managers, referees and anyone who dares to challenge him are not the standards we should be setting. Referees make mistakes, we have to accept that, but the way he insults and belittles them can not be tolerated in our country's sport. He should be removed from his position in football! People should not be allowed to bully or pressurise others in such ways.",
