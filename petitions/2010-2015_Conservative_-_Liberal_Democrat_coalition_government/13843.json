        "additional_details": "Government should give people work for their dole money. Instead of just handing a cheque to those looking for work the government should give people the opportunity to do work in their community for minumum wage. People would only have to work 2 full days a week to have more money then the average job seekers payout, leaving them pleanty of time to look for alternative work. By doing this the government and local councils can save money on street cleaning, graffiti, etc., it will incentivise people to work, give them more appeciation for there local area and stop abusers. I believe a lot of people out of work would apprieciate the chance to earn what they are recieving. It will also change the image and the view of the system for the positive. If you agree please sign.",
