This did not happen.\r\n\r\nTranche 1 of the redundancies, and Tranche 3 had their service aggregated.\r\n\r\nMany asked for their pension to be aggregated in order to receive a bigger redundant payment, which did not happen.\r\n\r\nThey will now receive their pension 10 years later. And still haven't had a decision on their redundancy payment. The complaints are still sitting with Service Complaints Commission nearly 2 years on.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and share to raise awareness of this issue. Full payments should be made to the 75-100 ex service personnel affected by this plus any interest lost.",
