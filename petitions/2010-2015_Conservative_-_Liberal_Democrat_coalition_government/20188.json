        "additional_details": "I believe it is time for the voting system in the House of Commons to be changed. At an election the public are allowed a secret vote and there are strict penalties for anyone who interferes with the vote or puts undue pressure on a person to vote a particular way. Yet in the House of Commons this is exactly what they allow and what they do. If MP\u2019s were allowed secret votes there would be better Laws and more honesty in Parliament. The way parliament votes is directly against the freedom of choice and often the will of MP\u2019s and the electorate. it works against  proper democracy. Voting for MP\u2019s must be made secret, the same as it is for the public.\r\n",
