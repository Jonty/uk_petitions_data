        "additional_details": "Can we please build a purpose built accommodation for MPs.  Within walking distance of Parliament to save travel cost and congestion. Each MP could have a room with space and storage for stays during the week.  A shared canteen can help discussions and cut costs more.  No need then for second homes and a lot of their London costs..  Or maybe an underground bunker beneath Trafalgar Square. Seriously.  Let them  concentrate more on running the country without extra travel and time to create all the expenses.",
