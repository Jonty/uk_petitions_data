It is statutory to have school Counsellors in Northern Ireland and Wales, why not England? After all, this is our future.\r\n\r\nOur campaign is about everyone coming together and understanding the importance of school Counsellors and the positive impact they can have on young peoples lives. We underestimate that there will be students, pupils and young people all around the country that will need this help but don't have access to it. Counselling could save people's lives and change them for the better too.\r\n\r\nPlease help us make this change and raise awareness of the importance of Counselling in England. After all 'this is our future'\r\n\r\nFollow us on twitter: @MakeItStatutory\r\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/schoolsneedcounsellors",
