        "additional_details": "In recent weeks, UKIP, and more specifically UKIP Students and Young Independence, have attempted to form a Society at Nottingham Trent University. Despite meeting each of the extensive criteria, the assorted presidents of the Student\u2019s Union have decided to disallow the creation of a UKIP Society.\r\n\r\nAlready formed at NTU are Conservative and Labour societies, not to mention that of the \u2018Marxist and Proletariat\u2019 group.\r\n\r\nUKIP is a party represented in the UK and in the EU parliaments as are Conservative and Labour.\r\n\r\nWe believe that democracy should be upheld, and that an University should not be allowed to ban representation to political parties especially when other parties are already represented.
