        "additional_details": "We the signatories of this E-Petrition urge the UK government to the anti-sikh violence committed in India in November 1984, following the death of Indra Ghandhi and classify it as an act of genocide.\r\nThere is more than enough evidence from Sikh groups, Human rights groups and eye witnesses to show the violence was carefully orchestrated and police, congress members and high ranking officials were not only complicit in the violence but provided support for those carrying out murder, looting and rape. To this day Sikhs (who have a long and proud connection with the UK) have had no real closure. So now we urge as in Australia that this issue be debated and then the acts of November 1984 be classified as Genocide.",
