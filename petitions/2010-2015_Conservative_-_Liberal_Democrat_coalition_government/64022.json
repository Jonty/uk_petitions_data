        "additional_details": "This petition is to raise awareness and hopefully stop Intu Watford from increasing daily parking costs in Sutton Car park. This car park is the cheapest option for people that work in the town centre, many of which are on minimum wage as they work in the shops and offices around the town. For people working in Watford, it costs \u00a3120 per month (\u00a36 per day) to park in Sutton car park for someone who works full time (5 days per week) but Intu would like to more than DOUBLE this to \u00a3300 per month to an extravagant \u00a315 per day! How do they expect people to afford this? parking elsewhere will affect residents parking. Let's put a stop to this! Please sign my petition. ",
