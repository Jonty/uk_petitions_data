        "additional_details": "Given the recent conflict and rioting based on the decision to remove the Union flag from Belfast City Hall, surely the time has come for the decent silent majority of Belfast to stand up and lobby the City Hall to fly a flag that has no issues with politics or sovereignty, and is internationally recognized as a symbol of tolerance. This demonstrates that we are (mostly) on open, welcoming city where all are accepted with outstretched arms. Not only this, but as naturally the flag stands for LGBT pride, flying it from a prominent building will amplify the tolerence not just for every sexuality, but for all people, regardless of background, religion, ethnicity or any other factor.",
