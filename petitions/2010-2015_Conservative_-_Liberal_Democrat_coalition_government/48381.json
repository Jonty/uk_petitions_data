        "additional_details": "For people who are not aware of this, Quinolone is a 'family' of drugs that people take to kill of bacteria, however, with that comes potential lethal side effects. It can range from Tendinitis to permanant Tendon Rupture. Just like myself, other people either are of have suffered with the side effects that have changed their lives.
