That will cost more again! Simply, in an ED, if the duty consultant feels the patient has wasted time and bedblocked for no genuine medical reason, then charges levvied. If they don't pay, installments instructed through court to dock their pay/benefits until amount paid in full!\r\nSame in ambulance service ... Duty manager (paramedic/ECP) to make final decision. The NHS is stretched to the limit and attitudes towards its use need to change. ",
