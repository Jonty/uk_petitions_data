I propose a scheme where peoplle have to earn a licence to purchase alcohol.\r\n\r\nThis would be based on studying the effects of alcohol.  Items covered should be how alcohol works, the physical effects, understanding the drunken highs and the resulting hangover and why they happen, the effects on society, family life, relationships, addiction and the financial costs.\r\n\r\nThe same scheme could also be used for gambling.
