        "additional_details": "The recent rioters have excused themselves by stating that they owed by society.  They are not.  Surely, an answer is to employ young people in military service in a programme of formal training, thus giving them a career opportunity and  a sense of purpose.  They then have a chance to continue a career or at least create an aim in life.  The rioters come from many diversities of life.  Surely, we can use the social differences to focus these individuals into a disciplined regime.",
