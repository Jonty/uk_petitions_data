The Foreign and Commonwealth Office should be working to improve imbalance for many international peoples' who work within British colonies and mirror overseas territories  terms and conditions to that of the British Government.\r\n\r\nThe current Caymanian average for employees (22/03/2014) is $7 (Caymanian dollars) an hour, a full $1.55 less per hour than the equivalent \u00a36.31 British minimum wage than it should be.",
