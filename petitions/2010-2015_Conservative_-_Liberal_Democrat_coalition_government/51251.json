        "additional_details": "It is wrongl to say schizophrenics on sedating antipsychotics are 'fit for work-related activity'. Sedation cannot 'be managed'. The DWP need to change the rules so instead of saying medication sedation or fatigue can be 'managed' and make any schizophrenic on sedating medication automatically eligible for the ESA support group. Many schizophrenics are going off their meds as they are being made to do paid or voluntary work and getting very, very ill. We have tried unsedating medications but that caused intolerable akathsia.",
