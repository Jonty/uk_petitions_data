        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the government to change the focus of services to the unemployed. At the moment Job Centre staff, Work Programme providers and National Career Advisory staff are uncoordinated, uninterested, unfocussed, and providers very often duplicate services. We the undersigned call for a strategic reappraisal. For example basic improvements could be the offering of a website linked to the Directgov website with hints and tips about CV writing, interviews, and cover letter writing, and the development of blogs targeted at operational, managerial and senior management, as well as topical issues, as this would allow the development of informal networks/self-help groups and it would be highly cost effective and a repository of good ideas, etc which could be used to improve services offered.\r\n\r\n",
