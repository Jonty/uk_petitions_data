        "additional_details": "The aim of the petition is to show the Department for Transport and Rail Regulator that the people of North East Lincolnshire want, and will use, a direct train to London.  With a population of 160,000, status as the UKs renewable energy hub and the largest port complex in the country, we more than deserve a direct link to the capital.\r\n\r\nThis petition does not favour a railway operator, tendering method or route. It simply calls for a nonstop train from North East Lincolnshire to be established as soon as practically possible.\r\n",
