        "additional_details": "Reduce the queues at the Dartford Tunnel / QE2 Bridge (M25 between junctions 31 - 1a) by removing the tolls and using electronic vehicle charging, similar to the way vehicles are charged for the London Congestion Zone.  \"Rush hour\" is often 3pm-7pm on weekdays and weekends are often more busy.  Advantages include a reduction in pollution, save time for people and business and therefore making huge improvements for the economy.",
