        "additional_details": "The aim for this petition is to make it compulsary for all bookmakers to have bandit screens in every premises to protect staff in case of robbery for example. William Hill and Paddy Power are both introducing a lone manning policy, meaning staff will be working alone on an evening, which is already in place with Ladbrokes. I myself would fear for my safety working alone at night without bandit screens in place, and feel they would make a big difference to attitudes of staff regarding this policy. How would you feel if somebody could jump over a counter and potentially harm and rob you without you being able to defend yourself?",
