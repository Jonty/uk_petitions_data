Young locals are forced to move from the area in which they were raised as they cannot afford to live here, there is no available low cost or social housing available.\r\n\r\nThis development is perfect for this the foundations are there as well as the utilities, instead areas of natural beauty are threatened with development whilst this eyesore of a building site is left to rot.\r\n\r\nThis area should be compulsorily purchased and used to provide social housing to desperate  people which need housing.",
