As a part time trader vehicles are not in my name so I cant tax which means I cant drive. This makes the trade part of a log book useless and pointless. Also Someone selling a car now with Tax if they sell at the start of a month they will not be refunded that month as DVLA class that as a part month yet the new owner much Tax from start of that month so yet again the Tax man gets paid TWICE for the same month.\r\n\r\nITS A SCAM PLEASE REVERSE THIS LAW AND STOP PUNISHING MOTORISTS.
