        "additional_details": "The legalisation of cannabis throughout the UK would have major benefits.\r\n\r\nHere are just a few.\r\n\r\nMedicinal use is PROVEN to help sufferers of MS, cancer, arthiritis, asthma and any illness that the patient suffers with pain.\r\n\r\nThe revenue that would be generated from taxing cannabis would be beneficial to the UK in a way that no other taxable consumable can. By producing it in the UK not only would we create jobs but we would turn drug dealers into business men and get them off of benefits.\r\n\r\nThe waste product would be used for paper, rope and even clothing.\r\n\r\nCannabis is the most widely consumed drug amongst all walks of life and we should all fight for legalisation. Please sign this petition and help the innocent potheads from discrimination.",
