The church demands the death penalty.\r\n\r\nAll sins are NOT forgiven: All children believe in Christ - since all children go to heaven when they die and we are called to have hearts like little children - hence the death sentence:\r\n[King James Bible] Mat 18:6  But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.\r\n\r\nChild rape and child murder is the 'sin unto death':\r\n[King James Bible] 1Jn 5:16  If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.\r\n",
