For all the parents that attend this service already find how hard the parking is let alone the effect it will have on the surrounding housing estates.  The traffic will be horrendous and the safety of the children will be majorly compromised!  Please sign to show your support for the safety and wellbeing of all those effected. Many thanks. ",
