        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to allow local authorities where a majority of their electors voted yes in the AV referendum to adopt AV as their system for local elections.  This could be for a fixed trial period, such as 5 years, and then subject to a confirming referendum to become permanent.  We also ask that other local authorities be able to also offer AV subject to confirming referenda, perhaps after the first set of \"pilot\" authorities have run it for 5 years.",
