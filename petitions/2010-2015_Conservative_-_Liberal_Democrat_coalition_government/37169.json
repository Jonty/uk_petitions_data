Drafting up a first letter which I'm going to send out to doctors in my area.\r\n I am a young person, and an anxiety sufferer. I truly don't believe that young peoples' mental health is taken seriously enough, specifically, anxiety, depression, and various other forms of 'invisible illness'- hence the name. I'm just one person but if I can even make ONE person see how people struggle, then I'll be happy. Too many of us are suffering because doctors don't take young people seriously, and I hope that people will get on board, too, specifically sufferers. It seems like we have to scream and bounce off walls to be listened to. I intend to do something about it. I'm hoping to make this as big as I can, starting small of course.\r\nWe should NEVER underestimate what we can do, or our power to change things.\r\n",
