As we haven\u2019t  got enough housing, jobs or money for the people who already live here in the UK, it seems absolutely ludicrous  that we should allow any more people onto this already overcrowded island.\r\n\r\nThis has nothing to do with the colour, race, religion or creed of any individuals. I just can\u2019t stress how outrageous that in these extremely difficult times, we the UK are still trying to shelter the rest of the world, when we can\u2019t even look after our own.\r\n",
