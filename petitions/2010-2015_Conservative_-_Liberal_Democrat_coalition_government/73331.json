This is set up by the Government to help keep accidents on the road to a minimum.\r\n\r\nHowever, we have to pay for the test out of our own pockets and then any repairs on top of that. The test itself should be made free at all test stations, it is the Government that want us to have these checks after all. It should all be funded by the Government and we just pay for any repairs that need doing.\r\n\r\nNone of us want the our vehicles MOT'ed as we always get a feeling we will be ripped off somewhere but we have to pay for something we don't want but have to have.",
