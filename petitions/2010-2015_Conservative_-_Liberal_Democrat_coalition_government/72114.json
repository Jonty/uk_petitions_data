        "additional_details": "All saints Cathoilc College Sixth Form, Dukinfield, faces a consultation period from the 17th of November where the future of the sixth form will be decided. If this fails, the sixth form will not recruit anymore sixth form students from September 2015.\r\n\r\nTo show your support for the sixth form, please sign this petition.\r\n\r\nFrom this we can discover how many people truly believe that ASCC 6th form is a successful, socially advantageous sixth form.\r\n\r\nSmall class sizes are the biggest selling point of ASCC 6th form and are currently under threat. The smaller than average sixth form brings everyone closer together in a close knit society providing a fantastic social experience.\r\n\r\nBy signing this, you believe that keeping the sixth form open is the BEST option for our students.",
