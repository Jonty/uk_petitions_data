        "additional_details": "Dear All, We need to stop selling our Police Buildings. If we allow the sale of police buildings and put the money in to the police fund we will lose the assets. This money will be spent remedying the short fall in the current policing budget and not on new assets. This is a false economy. The tax payer, will end up paying money on renting properties to house our police force, which subsequently will cost us more than maintaining the existing state owned property. Recent history has shown us, selling off state owned assets to boost budgets is a short term solution and leaves a long term deficit. Selling of properties quickly will also mean they are sold for less than their market value which tends to happen in these cases so we would not get value for money.",
