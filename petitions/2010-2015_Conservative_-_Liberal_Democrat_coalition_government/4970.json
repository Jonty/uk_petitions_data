        "additional_details": "Credit Reference Agencies and their records of so-called 'bad credit' are stifling the small business market and social mobility. It is too easy for banks and other financial organisations to leave a black mark on a person's financial reputation that does not consider the full picture or take account of circumstantial factors. A few bad months financially should be negated by a lifetime of being an honourable customer, but currently a handful of arrears, even if soon caught up with, results in a financial reputation equivalent to that of a fraudster. The Government needs to ensure that credit histories are not for agencies to interpret as they wish and provide individuals with a means to contest unfair ratings.",
