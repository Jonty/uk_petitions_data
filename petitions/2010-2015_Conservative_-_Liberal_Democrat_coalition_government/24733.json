        "additional_details": "We believe that all students should be taught about the world in which we live. Many young people are not aware of both events in the UK or worldwide which affect their everyday lives. This needs to change. Politics and current affairs must be taught to secondary school pupils, from year 7 upwards, so they gain a basic understanding of how the world works. This would help them in their adult lives, including how they can make informed choices when voting, and getting more young people actively involved in politics and the way their country is run. ",
