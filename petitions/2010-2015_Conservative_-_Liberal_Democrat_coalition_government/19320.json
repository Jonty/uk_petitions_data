Collisions with wildlife are a threat to motorists too.\r\n\r\nIn Holland and Spain such crossings have been shown to have positive results for habitats, wildlife, and drivers.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080917074132.htm\r\n\r\nFor example, fences and over 600 tunnels around and under both major and minor roads in the Netherlands have helped to substantially boost population levels of the endangered European badger. Since the fences were installed, the badgers are using the tunnels every night, as are other small mammals. Due to this success, these badger fence installations are now being considered as additions to any new highway built in the Netherlands.  Some countries are also closing portions of highways to allow seasonal migration to occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
