In those instances where this is true, a lot of the times, its due to incompetence and lack of confidence rather than deliberate bad practice.\r\n\r\nGovernment needs to:\r\n1) Have a minimum class based training (in excess of CIS), before care workers can start working\r\n2) With the training, care workers would then be registered (like other health professionals) and must do relevant training to maintain their registration\r\n3) Ensure all training are accredited and therefore transferable.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n1) Standardise the sector making regulation simplier and more credible for CQC\r\n2) Less pressure on Agencies/Homes to train staff who are using the sector as a stop-gap\r\n3) Creater a better pool of human resource for Agencies/Homes to choose from\r\n4) Vulnerable Adults are assured their care workers are qualified at day 1",
