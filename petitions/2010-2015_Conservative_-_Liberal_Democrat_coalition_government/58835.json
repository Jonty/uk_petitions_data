        "additional_details": "The Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has said that Biodiversity Offsetting could apply to 400 year old woodland.Under the scheme Developers can build within Ancient woodland areas providing they plant 100 trees for each one felled, elsewhere. Under the scheme, the destruction of a wildlife habitat is balanced by funding for environmental improvements in other locations. It would seem that no consideration is being given to the Flora and Fauna displaced by these developments. You cannot plant Ancient Woodlands that is something that comes with time. There is more to an Ancient Forest than just trees, and this is equally as important.",
