        "additional_details": "All people no matter what race, religion or sexuality they are should have the right to marriage. For years governments across the world have been hiding behind article 16 of the declaration of human rights which states Men and Women of full age have the right to marry, many people may say that article 16 states that there\u2019s only a right to marriage if its between a man and a women but in fact it does not say this at all. Also if you look at article 2 it states that \u201cEveryone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\u201d The government may say that they have allowed civil partnerships but lack the status of marriage and are nothing more then a distraction. So please sign this petition so that parliament has a proper debate about same sex marriages.",
