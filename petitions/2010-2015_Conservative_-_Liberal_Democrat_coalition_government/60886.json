Currently a woman cannot legally be convicted of rape unlike a man; the Guardian reportd that teenage girls can legally do crimes men would be imprisonned for, equal maternity and paternity leaves which would allow girls the same pay as men (the reason the currently don't get the same - another sexist flaw in the UK); unlike in France, British men do not have the same rights during a divorce; many night clubs let women in for free time on time, unlike men and so on. I ask to end the madness and simply introduce equal laws, penalties, regulations, age restrictions and rights to EVERYBODY, no matter which gender they are!\r\n\r\n[please also tell your friends, Facebook etc. to help get signatures if you would like to].",
