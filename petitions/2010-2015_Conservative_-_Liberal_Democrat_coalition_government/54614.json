        "additional_details": "MPs Pensions are to increase by 25%.The move will be a huge hypocritical snub to public sector workers who are in effect having their pensions reduced in order to pay for the MP increase not to make the alleged cuts the government suggests it requires. It has been disclosed that MPs, who earn \u00a355,118 a year, will see their pension entitlement increase by a quarter with immediate effect.They currently qualify for a pension of a 50th of their salary for each year of service. This will now rise to a 40th, with almost half the increase funded by taxpayers.The news will provoke fury among workers whose own pension funds have suffered dramatic falls.  Especially now that we the Tax payer will have to cover at least 2% of the 3% increase in their pension contributions.MP's are public sector workers and therefore should be on public sector pensions in line with the Police, Fire, Ambulance and Teachers etc.  ",
