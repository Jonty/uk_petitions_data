        "additional_details": "The current Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright was head of children's services in Rotherham during the period that 1400 young girls were abused. There have been calls from all sections of society for him to resign however he refuses to accept responsibility for this awful period.\r\n\r\nKeith Vaz MP has proposed emergency legislation to remove him from his office and the government should support this as a priority. We need to send a message to all public figures involved with child protection that this type of thing will no longer be tolerated.\r\n",
