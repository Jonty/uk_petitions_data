        "additional_details": "Children as young as 6 are regularly being exposed to computer games depicting extreme violence rated 16 and above. At present the law prevents children from purchasing games that are age inappropriate, but there is no legislation to prevent parents and carers allowing those children in their care from viewing and playing these games. Studies have shown clearly that games depicting extreme violence have a detrimental effect on Children's mental health and also contribute to a desensitisation towards violence. Parents and carers who allow children to play these games are entering into a form of abuse and should be prosecuted.",
