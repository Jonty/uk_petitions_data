        "additional_details": "\r\nWe ask that the Ministry of Defence (MOD) set aside additional funds to cover the cost of visits, consultations and treatment provided by registered mental health charities for ex-service personal in custody diagnosed with PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe British Armed Forces has been fighting for a decade in Iraq and Afghanistan. Ex-forces personnel have faced traumatic and distressing scenes, leading some to struggle with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).\r\n\r\nThose now in custody rely on charities to deliver treatment to help them manage PTSD, brought about during their brave service for this country.\r\n\r\nThe MOD should recognise the trauma suffered by its service personnel and fund charities who strive to reach those outside of the regular care facilities.",
