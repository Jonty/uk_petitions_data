As of yet none of the plans have come to fruition.\r\nShe is now slowly rotting away in dubai drydocks, under extreme heat and lack of maintainance. Pictures have come to light recently obtained by louis de sousa showing  how bad it is getting and how sad the ship now looks. The owners in dubai seem to ignore all the questions her fans ask, we need the government to press the leaders of dubai to get them to either release the ship or look after her before its too late.",
