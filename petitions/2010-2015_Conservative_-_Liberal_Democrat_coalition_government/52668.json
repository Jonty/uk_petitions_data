        "additional_details": "There is widespread abuse of the budget system in the public sector.\r\nSchools,hospitals and local authorities are having to scrap perfectly good equipment at the end of the financial year and purchase new replacements in order to retain the allocated money for subsequent years. They are in fear of having these funds removed if they don't spend them.\r\nWith the current austerity regime this means many employees are on reduced hours or being made redundant, placing increased burden on the benefits system whilst departments waste money.\r\nI believe the sums involved across the whole country are truly shocking and require immediate change.",
