It is a shame on humanity that these grown men cannot put aside their differences for one night so that the entire population can experience sheer utter brilliance on stage. I ask our government to get the message across the pond that enough is enough. The people of Great Britain want to see the original members of Guns and Roses perform live in the UK! #gunsandroses #gnr #axlrose #slash #duffmckagan #dizzyreed #izzystradlin #stevenadler #buttrock #metal #reunion #2015 #Wembley #lespaul #tophat #paradisecity #sweetchildomine #welcometothejungle #mymichelle #terminator #lieslieslies #appetitefordestruction #useyourillusion #novemberrain #mrbrownstone #rocketqueen #axl\r\n",
