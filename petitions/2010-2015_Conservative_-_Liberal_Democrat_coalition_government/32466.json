        "additional_details": "We believe that the UK requires a revising upper house. The upper house should reflect the views of the electorate but should be neither appointed by HM Government nor elected.\r\n\r\nThe current powers of patronage of the Prime Minister are too open to political misuse. The country does not need an additional level of elections which, in any case, could not be synchronised with existing elections.\r\n\r\nThe number of members of a full upper house will be decided at foundation. New members of the upper house should be voted into office by the full upper houise.\r\n\r\nThe upper house should initially consist of the current members of the House of Lords.   Thenceforward, all hereditary titles should lapse at the death of the holder.\r\n\r\nMembership of the upper house should be until the earlier of resignation, disqualification through court sentence, or the age of 75 years. No-one should be disqualified from nomination except through court sentence.\r\n\r\nThe upper house should be titled The Senate.",
