Should a head teacher be allowed to aside the health and safety of stuff members and pupils. Should  someone that has travel 16 1/2 hours from one country to another be allowed to work without rest. Is 97 days notice enough time given to the head teacher regarding a wedding. Should a head teacher be allowed to punish one of the employees for another hundred days before dismissing her. Should a Catholic school be allowed to say to a mother if you go to your daughters wedding you will be dismissed from employment. The same head teacher allowed other members of stuff to have 14 days off, giving them a holiday in school times, but said to a mother, you attend your daughters wedding  you will be dismissed. A mother attended her daughters  wedding and was dismissed on 17 September 2013. Is this a form of abuse.",
