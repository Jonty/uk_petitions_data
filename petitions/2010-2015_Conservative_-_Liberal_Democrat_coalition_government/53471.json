        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, urge the government to halt Surrey County Council's plans to quote \"grow (the RideLondon cycle event) to become the equivalent of the London Marathon on a bicycle\" pending a full impartial review of the following areas:\r\n- Primarily the impact on the road network (residents unable to leave their streets by car, difficulties for emergency services responding to life saving calls)\r\n- The impact on the rail and bus network\r\n- The legality (and morality) of closing roads to vehicles taxed to be on those roads\r\n- Clarity on what role the Mayor of London plays in the extension of this race to Surrey and how appropriate this is (given that Surrey residents have no voting power at London Mayoral elections)\r\n- Full disclosure of all and any financial benefits Surrey County Council may receive from corporate sponsors in order to host this event\r\n",
