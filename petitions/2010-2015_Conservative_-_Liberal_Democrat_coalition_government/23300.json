        "additional_details": "This petition is calling for another referendum to leave the EU and if the PM can't listen to the needs and interests of the people before his own then he should resign for failing to lead this country.\r\n\r\nToo many stories in the news show that Germany want to control the UK and the rest of the EU. This has to stop! The people of Britain have decided to opt out of the EU. We do not want to stay in for the political greed of our so called leaders who only worry about their own benefits. If action can't be taken, leadership should be changed immediately.\r\n\r\nSign this petition if you want another say in our membership of the EU. Sign it if you feel betrayed about our PM and want a change in leadership. ",
