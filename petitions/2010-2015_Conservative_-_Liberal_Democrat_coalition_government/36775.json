        "additional_details": "There are now over 13million cyclists in the UK. London cyclists have increased by 110% since 2000 and this trend is set to continue nationwide, especially post-Olympics. In the Netherlands, around a third of all journeys are made by bike. The weather is similarly wet and windy as are levels of bike theft and although the land may be flatter than parts of the UK, this creates severe headwinds. However unlike the UK, cyclists in the Netherlands are protected by strict legal liability which means that in any collision with a motorized vehicle, the insurance of the motorist will be claimed against. In the UK if a cyclist and a car collide, the cyclist is treated like any other vehicle.\r\n\r\nFigures in a 2009 report showed that in cycling accidents the motorist was entirely at fault 64-70% of the time. With more people taking to bikes, this legal protection is more important than ever to ensure drivers respect cyclists on our roads.",
