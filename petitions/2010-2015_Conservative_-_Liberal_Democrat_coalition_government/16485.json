A freedom of information request was submitted under a pseudonym (fake name) in accordance with the Nursing and Midwifery Council's Code of Conduct. They were emailed to tell them that this was in a pseudonym and then maliciously answered the request in the students name (title, first name and surname) which has destroyed their right to remain anonymous. For more information on this please visit\r\nhttp://www.whatdotheyknow.com/ and look up Anglia Ruskin University.\r\nWe all have a right to have our data protected by organisations and businesses and this business are now refusing to put matters right. Please sign this petition to try to get Anglia Ruskin University to apologise publically for this error and to answer any freedom of information requests under the Freedom of Information Act and the Data Protection Act. This has totally destroyed this Students confidence.",
