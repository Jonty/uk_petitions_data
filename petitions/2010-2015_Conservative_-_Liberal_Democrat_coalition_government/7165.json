        "additional_details": "Many citizens are concerned by the number of migrants coming into the UK. Figures in respect of legal migrants do not tell the whole story. Thousands remain here illegally due to the UK's failing system which is unable to deal with illegal migrants who either do not posess or claim not to posess passports or ID documentation. Millions of pounds of tax payers money is wasted on identifying these individuals, only for them to be released with reporting restrictions, only to abscond and never to be seen again. Detaining these individuals until such time as they can be deported is the only way of reducing numbers of illegsl migrants, reducing the crimes in which they commit and reducing the amount of money spent on identifying and then supporting them.
