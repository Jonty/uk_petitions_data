        "additional_details": "Justice Secretary Mr Grayling wants to make it legal to use excessive force in self defence against intruders.\r\nWhile this might seem appealing, this would be silly and potentially dangerous law.\r\nMr Grayling argues what might seem reasonable in the moment might seem unreasonable in hindsight however Section 76, Criminal Justice and Immigration act 2008 already allows for this, in sub section 7:\r\n\"(a) that a person acting for a legitimate purpose may not be able to weigh to a nicety the exact measure of any necessary action; and\r\n(b) that evidence of a person's having only done what the person honestly and instinctively thought was necessary for a legitimate purpose constitutes strong evidence that only reasonable action was taken by that person for that purpose.\"\r\nHe also criticises police for questioning homeowners who have injured intruders, yet not questioning would make these people above the law.\r\n11 homeowners have been prosecuted in the last 15 years. Stop these reforms.\r\n\r\n",
