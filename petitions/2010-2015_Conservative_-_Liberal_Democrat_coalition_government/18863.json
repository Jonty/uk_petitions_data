        "additional_details": "Dorchester is well known for all the avenues of horse chestnut trees around the town, they are symbolic of Dorchester.  Please prevent Dorset District Council from cutting down Dorchester's heritage.  The trees are said to have a disease, specifically 'bleeding canker'.  I have sought expert opinion from a local landscape gardener who stated that they only have a minor disease of the leaves which is easily cured.\r\n\r\nImportant information taken from UK Forestry Commission in reference to Bleeding Canker:\r\n \"In some cases the disease will stop spreading and the tree will recover\u2014and it is for this reason that experts recommend that infected trees should not be felled at first signs of infection\"\r\n\r\nPlease save the trees from being cut down, they deserve to be left at least until they are officially dead, not cut down on speculation of a disease .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
