        "additional_details": "The current system of trying to ban the way prostitution is carried out has failed to deal with problems like human trafficking and under-age prostitution. Instead of having prostitution tolerated by the police and local authorities in certain areas, the Government should regulate the industry. This would leave the police free to combat trafficking and exploitation with the co-operation of the people in the industry. ",
