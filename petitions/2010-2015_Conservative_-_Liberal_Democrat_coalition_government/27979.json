        "additional_details": "In the UK there are many robberies and burglaries in innocent peoples houses. This happens too often in the UK and should be dealt with rather than the victims just getting money for the objects stolen.\r\n\r\nWe all will be robbed atleast once in our life. It is not that fact that they will take stuff. If you are a mother or father and you have children, your instant insinct is that they are coming in to take stuff and if your family or a loved one gets in the way, you know they will not stop until they get what they want and they are putting your family or loved ones in danger. Now I personally know that I will do anything within my power to stop from happening.\r\n I believe that if someone is entering your household with out permission and that you know that their instinct is to harm your family or loved ones for any reason then you should be able to fight back, even if it leads to death. Only if you know that they have come to harm you or someone in that household.\r\n",
