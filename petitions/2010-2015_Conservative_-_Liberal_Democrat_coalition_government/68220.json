        "additional_details": "Buy-to-let mortgages for those already owning at least one property, have grown to 1.57m and in 2013 they increased by a further 120,000. Early reports are that these will increase by 14% above 2013 levels this year. In London and the South East the numbers are vast.\r\n\r\nIn villages, towns and cities up and down the country, communities are having large scale developments on green belt land, forced upon them. If we have reached a stage where house building is so urgent, then those who own a house already should not be allowed to benefit from green belt land at the cost of the local community, a cost generally of forcing-up house prices and a cost to the environment.\r\n\r\nWe are calling to restrict buy-to-let in the South East, where green land is being forced upon a communities.",
