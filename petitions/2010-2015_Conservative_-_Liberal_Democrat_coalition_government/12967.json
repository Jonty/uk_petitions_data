        "additional_details": "The recent riots have some basis in a lack of social responsibility and quite possibly this is also supported by excess drinking.  At the moment it appears to me that because of the current continental style availability of 24 hour drinking that the different age groups go drinking and socialising at different places and different times.  If opening and closing times were re-introduced there is a probability that the different age groups would go to the same places at the same time.  This could result in a more acceptable level of social responsibility due to the likelihood of some people becoming role models for behaviour.  It would also possibly go some way to resolving the crisis in the pub trade as well as helping preserve British traditions and an important way of life.  There may also be a benefit in improving health.  ",
