It will remedy issues that, rather than being solved by throwing money at the problem, requires a specifically targeted task force to build a long term solution alongside the community.\r\nHaving a large idle workforce is unacceptable when there's vital work that needs to be done. It would be a fantastic gateway job, getting young people out into the world, with experienced professionals as team leaders, to learn the true value of hard work, and also workskills applicable back home, like the army is advertised but instead a force for unquestionable good. This would restore pride in our country, improve relations with other countries, and regain a global reputation for the right reasons.\r\n",
