        "additional_details": " This petition is to allow local residential groups within their community interest area, the authority alongside local authorities and agencies, to inspect and approve areas of land developed and awaiting final contract sign off and on land that has had a demolition to ensure the clean up meets the agreed standard and vacated areas remain managed and kempt.\r\n\r\nOften following demolition a built up area of land waiting to be sold or developed lays barren for months/years. Likewise areas of land that are developed are not adequately cleared, both can be blighted by building material or are continually unkempt and overgrown.\r\n\r\nCouncils and private landlords can be easily held accountable by local community groups when these parts are contravened by legislative additions to building contracts and vacated land policies across the UK.",
