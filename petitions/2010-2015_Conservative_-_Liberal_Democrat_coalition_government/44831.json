        "additional_details": "Since the launch of fifa 13 it has been plagued with problems. With connectivity and in game faults. This game is not fit to be sold and a refund should be offered, not just on the game but also for those duped into paying for a season ticket. This game was obviously rushed out with the makers knowing full well of these issues. The public has been taken for a ride by this company who seem to think of more ways to con money out out of them. EA needs investigating as to why they released this game, also after 4 months no refund has been offered.  ",
