        "additional_details": "We call on the government to introduce a tax on second dogs. The fastest increasing sector of ownership is multiple dog ownership. Cyclists on cycle paths, often paid for in part by donations from cyclists, are increasingly impeded by owners with several dogs on long leads. Their owners have not contributed to the paths. The revenue raised from a tax on second dogs should therefore be ringfenced for shared used path creation.",
