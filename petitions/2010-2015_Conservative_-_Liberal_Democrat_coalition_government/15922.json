        "additional_details": "Government spending is out of control. To be competitive with much more flexible labour markets in Asia and the US we must reduce taxation and government bureaucracy, which ultimately means we must drastically cut government spending.  For too long politicians have tried to solve problems through short sighted increases in public spending funded by stealing from workers and the private sector through higher taxation.  If we really want this country to be a better place for all residents in 100 years time, this trend of politicians pillaging our pay packets and the private sector must be reversed.  A reduction in government spending to 30% of GDP by 2021 will put us on more level footing with 21st century economic powerhouses and stem the UK's slide into a the third world.",
