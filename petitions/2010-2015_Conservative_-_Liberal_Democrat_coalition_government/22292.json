        "additional_details": "Too many food products these days are marketed and advertised in a manner that infers that they are manufactured in a particular country when they actually aren\u2019t.  This is done in several ways one of which is when the product is named after a particular part of a country or landmark and another is where, for example, characters in an advertising campaign speak in a particular way that refers to country of origin.  We the undersigned ask the Government to change UK consumer law so that it is forbidden to advertise products that infer a false country of origin by way of their name or marketing.",
