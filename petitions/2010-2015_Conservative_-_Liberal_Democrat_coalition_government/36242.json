This is far more than simply an unpleasant odour; the health effects of secondhand smoke are non-debatable.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11969074\r\n\r\nhttp://vitals.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/30/11473208-non-smoking-apartment-dwellers-have-secondhand-smoke-risk?lite\r\n\r\nAll I want is some choice. Designate certain residential buildings as completely non-smoking, so smokers can live together without harming non-smokers, or ban smoking in flats altogether.\r\n\r\nThere is no right to smoke; at least not one which supersedes the health of others who have no choice, especially children who are at the greatest risk.
