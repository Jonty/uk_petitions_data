Since the famous Roswell incident reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have risen.\r\n\r\nThe governments of the world deny any involvement with an extratresstrail presence and any knowledge of the existence of extratresstrail or alien life. If the government doesn't have any involvement with UFOs or extratresstrails. Then why keep files accounting these matters and why not release ALL these files to the public if they have nothing to hide. Or do they??\r\n\r\nI am calling on the government to release all files on UFOs and extratresstrails or aliens. All files accounting for UFOs and other worldly life forms visiting us to be released from now and in the future.\r\n\r\nEven though this subject may sound crazy and insane it really isn't. Just because we can't travel from star to star doesn't mean a highly advanced civilization can't. That is the height of human arrogance.",
