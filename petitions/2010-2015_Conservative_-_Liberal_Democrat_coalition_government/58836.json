        "additional_details": "The recent statement by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson makes it clear that this Government is determined to sell off, by the back door if necessary, Britain's Ancient Woodlands. Woodland which when gone can not be replaced. The Secretary's statement that woods csn be replanted within an hours distance shows the ignorance tat he has about the value of ancient woodlands to the country and the enjoyment that many of us have in visiting woodlands both ancient and modern.\r\nWe call upon the Government to acknowledge the fact that their propasals are wrong and to ask them to reject any further attempts to sell off the peoples land.",
