        "additional_details": "I would like the government to take drastic and necessary action in regards to the adoption of children, whether they are adopted by relatives or non-family members. This seems to be a subject where people are unwilling to acknowledge that things do go wrong and that adopted children suffer physical, emotional, mental and sexual abuse at the hands of their adopted parents, adopted siblings and the wider community. I want the government to guide social services on how to strictly assess adoption applicants on their suitably to raise a child that is not biologically theirs. I want each adopted child be assigned a social worker up until the age of at least 21 if needed; to deal with any problems or concerns including: family, progression to education, the transition into adulthood or becoming and living independently.
