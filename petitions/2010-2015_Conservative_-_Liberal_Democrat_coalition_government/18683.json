        "additional_details": "Tom Billington was born in 1958, into a working class family in Golborne. Mr Billington trained as a professional wrestler and under the ring name 'Dynamite Kid' became famous worldwide. He perfected his craft, gaining the respect of his peers and fans over his 21 year career. He is unquestionable one of the best athletes the UK has ever produced, yet he recieves little recogniton for his achievements. Therefore it makes sense to build a statue in around the Golborne/Lancashire area to commemorate the career of one of Britians great performers.",
