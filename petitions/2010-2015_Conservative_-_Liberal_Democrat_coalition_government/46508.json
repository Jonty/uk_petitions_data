        "additional_details": "This petition has been made so that Childminders & parents can have a voice!\r\n\r\nWe feel that if Agencies are introduced that their would loss of personal choice as Agencies will match parents to Childminders, fee's to payed at either a cost to parents, Childminders or both. Agency Childminders would not be individually inspected by OFSTED which could potentially be a safeguarding risk and Childminder Agencies could  potentially be damaging to Childminding businesses.\r\n\r\nWhy do Childminders NEED an agency?? We don't is the answer! We like to be self-employed and we run successful small business, but above all else WE CARE!\r\n\r\nWhy have the government only singled out Childminders to have agencies?? Why have they not pre posed that playgroups or day care nurseries are to be run by agencies too??\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to get our voice heard! ",
