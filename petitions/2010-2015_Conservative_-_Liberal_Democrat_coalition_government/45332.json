The very large reduction in Britains Armed Forces leaves this country open to attack  this country will be unable to defend Britain let alone the Falkland Islands with the proposed depletion of our armed forces. Present economic policies are inept and not working as there is no cohesive plan which incorporates the creation of jobs.
