New build properties are bringing people in from cities to rural areas and they complain about the noise! Allotment holders are trying to reduce carbon emissions by growing local produce. Please support your local allotment holders by voting for the law to include keeping cockerels by the side of hens which are allowed.\r\nThank you for reading.",
