        "additional_details": "I want this Government to take action against Local Authorities who are putting Childrens lives at risk by cutting funding for School Crossing Patrols (SCP\u2019s).\r\n\r\nOn March 31st The Labour Controlled Tameside Council will be cutting 30 SCP\u2019s. I live in Hyde & there is a very busy main road, before Christmas it had TWO SCP\u2019s. This road \u201ccan\u201d be dangerous to cross on your own, add in your children & it can be a death trap.\r\n\r\nI spoke to an SCP who has done the job for nearly 35 years she has to reapply for her job. This lady loves her job & the council just don't care, this is a disgrace!!\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the cost of an SCP & assuming they are paid the minimum wage of \u00a36.31, working two hours a day over the school term of approx 40 wks equates to a salary of \u00a32,524. I\u2019m sure the Labour Controlled council can fund this vital service.\r\n\r\nPlease stop this local authority from putting children\u2019s lives at risk.\r\n",
