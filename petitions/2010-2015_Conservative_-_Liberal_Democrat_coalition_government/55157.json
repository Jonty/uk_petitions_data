A Confederation would be a better system than the current Unitary State built on Democratic Centralism.\r\n\r\nThe North could subsidise transport and build infrastructure like reservoirs and water supplies.\r\nNationalisation stripped Northern cities of their civic pride taking away trams and transport and utilities.\r\n\r\nA Council of the North was deemed essential by Edward IV, a Yorkist, and since the monarchy ceased to be Lancaster or York the whole focus has been London",
