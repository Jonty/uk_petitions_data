        "additional_details": "Built after the war to relace slums and houses destroyed by bombing, somebody put a preservation order on them because they were thought to be a fine example of postwar architecture. But they are, in fact, a concrete monstrosity, looming over the city skyline on a hill behing the station. They are visible from most vantage points, and give a poor image of modern Sheffield. They had themselves become a slum and hardly anyone wanted to live there. Refurbishment is a waste of money, and preserving old graffiti for posterity just daft. Knock 'em down.",
