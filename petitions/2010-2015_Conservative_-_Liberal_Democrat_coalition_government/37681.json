Both drivers and pedestrians(who should be regarded as 'Soft' road users) should owe themselves and other users a duty of care that safeguards road use and they should not use these devices in a manner that would endanger lives.\r\nIt should be illegal for drivers to use or operate mobile phones and other electronic devices without a handsfree device whilst driving and likewise it should be illegal for pedestrains, cyclists and other 'soft' road users to use their Mobile phones in a manner that compromises safety ",
