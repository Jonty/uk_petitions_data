        "additional_details": "So!!! Our great frien Mr Obama has decided to effectively 'cut and run' From the Afghan conflict. France are on the way out and will no doubt be followed by the other allies. We will be the last ones to get run out of town in total loss, shame and embarrassment for our brave services. It is blatantly obvious that they all know Afghanistan is a lost cause and I for one do not want to see one more service man or woman die in vain. I implore the politicians and people of Britain to get our boys out of there along with the Americans etc. If Obama is cutting his forces then we should cut ours 'pro rata'.\r\nAfter all we followed them into this conflict so I'm damn well sure we can follow then out it. NO BRITISH LIVES SHOULD EVER BE LOST TO HELP THE POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS OF AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. If you truly care for our forces Mr Cameron then change the deadline and withdraw our troops alongside and in equal proportions to the other allied forces.\r\n",
