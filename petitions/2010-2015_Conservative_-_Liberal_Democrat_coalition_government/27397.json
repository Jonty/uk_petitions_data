        "additional_details": "The decision to scrap child benefit for families earning over ~\u00a345K is unfair.  The middle class are by far the highest contributors to the tax & benefits system but increasingly are the ones who are punished for working.\r\n\r\nThese entitlements are there for a reason, to support your children through their life.  Some people might save the money in the once known \"Child Trust Fund\", others might use the money to budget for clothes and food but each and every family is entitled to this benefit, more so those that contribute by working.\r\n\r\nSign this petition if you want Mr Osborne to step down on his decision today 13th Jan 2012 to continue with the scrapping of this benefit.\r\n\r\nWe are losing our future in this country as ultimately in Britain we work to live in middle class and no more.  It is those above and below that are either reaping the rewards of the benefits system or earning too many millions to be worried about their spendings on flash cars and properties.",
