        "additional_details": "- Where you happen to live within the UK is NOT a fair way to determine how much you should pay for your university education.\r\n- It is absolutely disgusting that while Scottish students can go to University for free, English students have to fork-out \u00a39,000 a year.\r\n- It should not be the case that English students have to pay excessively for their own university education while also having to pay for Scottish students to go for free through taxes later in life.\r\n- I cannot think of any other country in the world where tuition fees differ so considerably.\r\n- This is NOT a petition that is against the idea of devolution in general.\r\n- The specific powers of setting University fees should be taken back to the UK Government. So that we can eliminate this huge inequality, and put fairness back at the heart of the UK's University system. Maybe this could be in exchange for more fiscal powers for the devolved administrations? - that's for the politicians to decide...\r\n",
