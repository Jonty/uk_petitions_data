Well with this Government there are going to be a lot more of them without any luck of it getting better in the future! I think it is about time that we stand up for what is rightly ours and ask for our country back! I want a Government that is not going to make broken promise of Higher education and Jobs. I want a government that will help families and support them.  I want a Government that will help people back into work and promise new jobs and stick to their promise. I want a Government that will serve the British People Well. I want Conservative out and Labour Back in! A party that serves all!",
