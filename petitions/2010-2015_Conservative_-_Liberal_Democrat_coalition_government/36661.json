        "additional_details": "I want the government to ban the sale of animals on Facebook.  Many Facebook pages have been started with the good intention of re-homing pets but these pages are making it easy for people to breed and sell animals.  There are millions of animals in the care of charities looking for good homes.  A pet shop has to have a licence to keep/sell live animals to ensure that the animals are cared for appropriately.  There is no protection for animals being bred and sold on Facebook.",
