        "additional_details": "\"The Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014 requires that video-on-demand (VoD) online porn now adhere to the same guidelines laid out for DVD sex shop-type porn by the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC).\"\r\n\r\nFemale ejaculation is included among the acts that are effectively banned from being depicted in British porn.\r\n\r\nBy classifying female ejaculation as a kink or perversion we ought to protect the general public from, the British Government is doing two things:\r\n\r\n1. Keeping the sexual equality clock over half a century behind.  Female ejaculation is treated as a kind of unnatural perversion, whereas male ejaculation is \"normal\".\r\n\r\n2. Shaming that small but statistically significant percentage of women for whom ejaculation is a natural and normal part of sexual enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/a-long-list-of-sex-acts-just-got-banned-in-uk-porn-9897174.html\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_ejaculation",
