        "additional_details": "Laser hair removal can be for cosmetic reasons to some extent, but for a lot of women it can be a psychologically damaging issue.\r\n\r\nIt is not only a physical issue, but a mental health issue. If it is affecting an individual to the degree that it damages their self-esteem, causes depression and not wanting to leave the house or look in mirrors, then I believe they should be entitled to it on the NHS.\r\n\r\nIf other temporary measures of hair removal (e.g. creams such as Nair) are preventing the individual from leading a normal life, then this is reason enough to take action in this area. This is especially for the facial area but can also be extended to other areas depending on how it is affecting the individual.",
