        "additional_details": "Our aim is to stop the NHS from being homophobic! Because as it states on the website you are not to donate blood if you are a male who has recently had sex with another male or if you're a woman who's recently had sex with a male who's recently had oral/anal sex with another male. This to me seems homophobic as nothing is said about hetrosexual people or even lesbians even though they can pass on as many STDs as a gay person can. We need to stop this discrimination as it's unfair and as there is no good reason for it.",
