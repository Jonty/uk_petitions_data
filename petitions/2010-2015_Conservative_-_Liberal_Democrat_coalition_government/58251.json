        "additional_details": "Many people who suffer not only the Coeliac disease, but also illnesses such as IBS, Inflammatory Bowel Disease or Cathartic Colon do not tolerate gluten. Not everybody is able to get it for NHS prescription and buying specialist food in shops or supermarkets costs a lot. Therefore the Gluten-free food should not cost more than usual food as it is a necessity. For example a small loaf of Gluten-free bread costs on average \u00a32.30, where you can get a normal size loaf of wheat bread for \u00a31. Please sign to support people who suffer gluten intolerance!   ",
