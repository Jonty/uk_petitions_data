        "additional_details": "A Charter to Bully.\r\n\r\nThe Government recently changed the qualifying period for unfair/constructive dismissal from 1 years continuous employment to 2 years.  This allows employers to ignore workplace bullying/harassment in the knowledge that they cannot be held legally or financially responsible for 2 years. Bullying causes stress, mental health problems and ultimately job loss. Additionally it costs the employer and the health services money in dealing with absence and mental health problems stemming from the bullying.  No one should have to endure bullying for 2 years in order to receive a chance of compensation because employers can legally 'turn a blind eye'.\r\n\r\nPetition the Government to reverse this change NOW and fight the workplace bully.",
