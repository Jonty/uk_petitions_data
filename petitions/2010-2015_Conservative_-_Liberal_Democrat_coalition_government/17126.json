The scottish referendum on independence should only be considered binding within a wider vote by all UK citizens. The government should conduct a wider referendum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England before a decision is made on de-unification of all or any one part of the UK. Otherwise a decision by one country will dictate the fate of the entire UK.",
