        "additional_details": "By this e-petition we endeavour to prevent or delay the roadworks by Gibbet Hill scheduled to commence in May 2014, as we believe it will have a negative impact on students undertaking exams during this period, causing both unnecessary stress and uncertainty. As the student body is a major part of the local community, we believe it would only be fair to take into consideration the consequences of the timing of the planned work.",
