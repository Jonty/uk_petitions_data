There has not been a vote on membership since the initial one and this, for many, is history. Given the anti-democratic nature of this monstrous gravy train and the fact that much of our decision making is out of our hands we should get out now. If politicians believe that membership is in our interests they should have the courage of their convictions and let the people decide. If I am in the minority so be it. After all, we have an election for our Government every five years or less so why not a vote on the EU?",
