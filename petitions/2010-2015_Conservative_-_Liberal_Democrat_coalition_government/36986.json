        "additional_details": "Developers are proposing to build between 300 and 400 houses on greenbelt land in Formby and are of the opinion that we need these.  This is purely a money making excercise by these developers and the local council who are not concerned about the impact on our community and infastructure to our village.  We are not a town as the developers have informed us at a recent meeting, we are a village and want to keep it that way.  If they are allowed to do it now then they will be allowed to build anywhere in the country.  We need to protect all greenbelt land and stop the developers from making huge profits with a total disregard as to how it will affect local people. and their enjoyment of life.  This is a national problem for everyone in the country.  In May of last year it was estimated that there were around 900,000 empty homes which did not include new homes being built, so why do we need to build more if we cannot fill these.",
