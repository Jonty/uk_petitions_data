        "additional_details": "There are proposals for a 'transformation' - integrating the current services for a 'more effective' service!Yet a significant number of job cuts within the London Borough of Barnet children\u2019s service are proposed (approx 24 jobs).Transformation gives the impression the outcome will be 'better'.I can\u2019t fathom how so many cuts will produce a better service. There is already a lack of support available...job cuts will obviously reduce support further and increase workload!I don\u2019t doubt cuts need to be made within Barnet...yet cutting children\u2019s service jobs will undoubtedly have a detrimental effect on support services available!Surely this will affect Safeguarding, looked after children, youth offending, availability/accessibility of parenting support/courses, SEN and disabled children, and any other vulnerable families in the borough who are in need of support!I would like the government to ensure these cuts do not take place so those most vulnerable in our community are not failed!",
