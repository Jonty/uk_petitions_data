        "additional_details": "We call on the Government not to pay GPs a bonus to diagnose dementia.\r\nInstead, the government should train health care workers to recognise symptoms and treat patients, provide adequate funding for drugs, NHS Healthcare and training in how to communicate with sufferers when treating them for physical ailments.\r\nIn its early stages, dementia is distressing and frightening; as it progresses inexorably the burden on carers becomes intolerable as loved ones fail to recognise them and behave in totally alien ways before deteriorating to a point at which they can no longer communicate or control their normal bodily functions. This is made worse by seeing doctors and nurses treat loved ones as idiots, fail to help with simple tasks or worse still carry out surgical procedures without anaesthetic. Patients need professional medical care, not just social care; the fact that the NHS cannot cure them is no reason to relinquish responsibility to loved ones and social services.\r\n",
