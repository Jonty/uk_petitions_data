        "additional_details": "An increasing number of dogs are being stolen in the UK every year & yet nothing has been done to stop this & 'crack-down' on the inhumane individuals/gangs involved. Dogs are not just animals, they are people's pets, friends, family, a bond so huge that when they are stolen it breaks their hearts. Dogs are often stolen for breeding farms, bait for dog fighters, or for 'stolen to order' gangs. Houses are targeted, dogs are stolen in broad daylight from their owners when out walking & are also stolen from the \"safety\" of their own gardens. Dogs have feelings, grow attachments & need to be loved, just like children/humans. Social media has brought to light how many dogs are stolen & how many heart felt messages are put out to find stolen dogs, many that have been taken from warm loving homes & families. Dog theft is disgusting! Measures should be put in order to stop those involved in dog theft, illegal dog breeders & dog fighters, such as jail sentencing & tracking chips for dogs.",
