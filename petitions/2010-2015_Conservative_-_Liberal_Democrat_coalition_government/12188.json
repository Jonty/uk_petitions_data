However as much as we try we will never be able to help everyone.\r\nIn the meantime ordinary people and families in the UK are facing really hard times, losing their jobs, their homes, their futures. Continuing and harsh cuts to benefits and services we all need to give us a good quality of life would be unnecessary if the government reduced the amount it spends on overseas aid and spent it instead on its own people. We after all, are the taxpayers. OUR money should be spent on OUR people.  ",
