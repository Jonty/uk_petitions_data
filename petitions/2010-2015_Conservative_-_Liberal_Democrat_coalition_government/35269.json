If someone was earning over \u00a3260,000 in the UK they would be taxed 60% on anything above that bracket, 80% for anything above \u00a31,300,000 and 90% for anything above \u00a32,600,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nThese tax rates cannot be applied to the United Kingdom alone as the higher bands of tax payers would simply re-locate abroad and pay lower tax elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe live in a modern world that preaches Human Rights and Equality yet 1 person can 'earn' 10000+ times more than another hard-working person. People who do jobs that 'contribute more economically' to society DO deserve reward for their contribution however the wealth they receive exploits millions of equally hard-working families.\r\n\r\nThis is not a Communistic philosophy - it is how Capitalism can be used to create a fairer society for everyone.",
