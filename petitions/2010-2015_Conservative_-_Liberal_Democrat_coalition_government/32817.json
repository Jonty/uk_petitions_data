A basic entitlement.\r\n\r\nI wish to highlight frequent unpunished breaches to this right in our society.\r\n\r\nMy sole aim is to highlight a child has the right to association with both biological parents.\r\n\r\nIf this right is withheld by a parent with sole custody why is this not addressed, ignored by social services and somehow flexible and misunderstood in society.\r\n\r\nIf you break a human right there is a punishment, right?\r\n\r\nI want this to be debated, from a very basic level.",
