        "additional_details": "My son James was born 31st May 2012, 8 weeks early by emergency C-Section.\r\n\r\nJames now has Cerebral Palsy, Mild brain damage and Spastic Diplegia.\r\n\r\n22 months down the line James is a happy and healthy child. He never lets anything get in the way of his happiness.\r\n\r\nWe know he will need Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR) in the near future which will enable our son to walk. Unfortunately this treatment is no longer available on the NHS.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMyself & my family are very upset that my son can not get the treatment he requires. We hope & wish he will walk and live the life to the best of his abilities.\r\n\r\nJames wants to be like his other mates his age. It breaks my heart not seeing him take his first steps, kick a ball & run rings around me. He's such a determined little boy.\r\n\r\nWe need to raise about \u00a350,000 for all the treatment he requires.\r\n\r\nPlease change the lives of many families around the Country.\r\n\r\nThank you",
