Please bring other companies, authorities and organisations in line with this policy whereby only someone in a managerial position is cleared and given access to a trans persons files, notes or accounts. This will help protect trans individuals from harm and also ensure information pertaining to a trans person is kept confidential. Currently there are no laws to this effect in place and the GRA is not effective and people just ignore it!",
