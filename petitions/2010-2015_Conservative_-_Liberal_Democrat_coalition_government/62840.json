The cause is not known, diagnosis is invasion surgery, there is no cure and it takes on average 7.5 years to be diagnosed.\r\n\r\nEndometriosis costs the UK billions, through multiple surgeries, drug costs, doctor appointments, disability costs and time having to be taken off work.\r\n\r\nFunding for research into endometriosis is needed to have a less invasive test and find a cure.",
