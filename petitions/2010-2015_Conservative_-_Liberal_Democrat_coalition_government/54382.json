        "additional_details": "The bridge on blue bridge roundabout has recently had some maintenance work done to it and to my disgust when all the safety nets came down we were greeted by a hideous green bridge which is mocking the heritage of new Marske. The blue bridge is as if not more true to new marske's heritage than iron ore it's self. Please take the time to sign this petition and put new Marske back to how it should be.  ",
