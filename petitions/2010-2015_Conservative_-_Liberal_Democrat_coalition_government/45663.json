As the Euston Arch Trust has demonstrated the restoration of the arch is possible and is economically valid. The \u00a310 million needed for the restoration will be paid back by the facilities provided in the arch. This figure of \u00a310 million is a tiny amount compared to the budget of \u00a332 billion (Feb 13) for the redevelopment of the station.\r\n\r\nWe have the opportunity to reclaim this important part of our architectural heritage and to 'undo a great wrong', lets not waste this opportunity!",
