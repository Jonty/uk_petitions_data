To summarise the scheme was considered TOO big, TOO close and in the WRONG location\r\n\r\nIt will create virtually NO jobs, it will desecrate not only the seabed and seascape,but 22 miles of cables will run through AONBs and the New Forest National Park to a substation near West Moors.  Approximately 200 of the tallest yet wind turbines are planned  \u2013 clearly visible from the Isle of Wight and along the Jurassic Coast. Tourism will be affected \u2013 people come to the area for the beautiful coastline, it will be seriously marred and scarred\r\n\r\nIn addition, the energy produced will cost 4 times as much as by other means and the life span of the turbines is surprisingly only 15 years! Hardly a timescale that provides for \u201cfuture generations\u201d as the developers claim!\r\n\r\nSay NO to Navitus\r\n",
