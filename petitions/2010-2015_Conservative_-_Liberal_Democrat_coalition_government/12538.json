Also, because we have outsourced all manufacturing work to China and India etc. students who would have left school and gone into this kind of work cannot even expect to do this anymore. It is unrealistic to expect that \"all\" students are able to go on to attend university, so lets get government backed industry back into this country and give these kids the work they are capable of doing instead of encouraging them to draw social security.
