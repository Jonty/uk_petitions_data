This is not a free market strategy given their deceitful and criminal means and ends.  Surely within these severe times of austerity our government can see a way to Halt the Hike and ensure fairness resumes.  If not it would be a good idea for all to boycott (I know at some considerable personal pain) events until such times as the artists and government take some action. It is the only way this will work.",
