This only serves to reduce the trust of the nation's citizens towards the justice system.\r\n\r\nBy making these elected positions, held every 2 or 3 years, it would allow the citizens they represent to decide whether each judge and magistrate has maintained the respect, acceptance and agreement of the population locally.
