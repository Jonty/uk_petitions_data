Removing it from London would spread the power around the country so as to avoid corruption and reliance on London. It would create jobs and a sense of inclusion for the rest of the country and lead to a fairer and equitable state of affairs for the people of England.\r\n\r\nI am English, born in Essex, live in London and I believe in constitutional chnage to bring about a fairer deal for the people of England.",
