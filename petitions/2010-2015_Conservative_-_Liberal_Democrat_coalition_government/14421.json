        "additional_details": "I think benefits (or some benefits) should be paid in voucher form so they can only be spent on certain items  such as food, gas & electricity credit etc.  This may make claiming less attractive to those who are fiddling the system and create a stigma - rather than being a lifestyle choice as it appears to be to many.  For those who need the benefits for help and assistance it will ensure that the benefits are used for this purpose and not spent on alcohol, drugs, gambling etc.  It would also ensure that children are not left without food, heat & shelter as benefits have been frittered away on unnecessary items.",
