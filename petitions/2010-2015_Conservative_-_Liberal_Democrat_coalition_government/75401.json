        "additional_details": "Dear DWP,\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned call for the payment amount of Carers Allowance to be at least that of the relevant minimum wage.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind this is: A majority of full time carers, such as (the individual starting this petition and many others) who perform the duties of a carer for a disabled individual for 35+ hours a week; which prevents them from earning a fair income. Therefore meaning, that for 35+ hours a week \"working\" as a carer is paid at \u00a361.35 + a small amount of income support.\r\n\r\nThis is not a reasonable income for carers.",
