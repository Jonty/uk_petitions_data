Since there are deep divisions in society on all those issues, it is not surprising that the debate seems to rotate endlessly about them, without any reasonable prospect of consensus. Those for and those against the proposal are both unwilling to yield on what they see as immutable positions of principle.\r\n\r\nIf progress is to be made, a way needs to be found whereby personal views about the medico-social role of euthanasia can be excluded, while the subject is discussed on neutral grounds, capable of objective examination.",
