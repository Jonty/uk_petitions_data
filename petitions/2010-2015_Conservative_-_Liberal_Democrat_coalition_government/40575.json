        "additional_details": "It is quite simple to find a specific policy or piece of legislation passed by the Government, along with the legal effects that it has. However, there is no clear link between these items and other documentation which justifies said policy/law. By ensuring close ties between parliamentary records and laws, and perhaps also requiring every law or policy to have attached to it a document justifying it, we will:\r\n  * encourage transparency and accountability in government because actors in the process are required to justify their arguments and decisions;\r\n  * make our legal and political system more open to continual improvement, because old laws can be challenged on the basis that their justification at that time is no longer relevant. This will make our legal system less lethargic.",
