        "additional_details": "We urge HM Government to ban the use of PVC window frames and doors.\r\n\r\nAs well as the fairly well documented dangers to public and private health involved in the production, use and disposal of PVC products generally, PVC widow frames and doors have the added disadvantage of being very ugly, especially the doors. Vast areas of Britain have been ruined by the use of these products, even where planning regulations could be used to stop their use. They are a blight on the British landscape.\r\n",
