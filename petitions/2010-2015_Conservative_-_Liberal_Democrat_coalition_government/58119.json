Imagine not being able to do little things for someone who is the reason for your existence.\r\n\"The relative must need long-term personal care to perform everyday tasks, such as washing and cooking and that such care should not be available in the country where they are living\" before they are allowed into the UK.\r\nThis rule is harsh both in its wording and intent.\r\n\r\nWe request that the medical health and support requirement be relaxed for at least a British Citizens immediate family to be more humane and allow an elderly person who is dependent though not excessively ill to come to the UK and live together as a family with their British children or grandchildren.
