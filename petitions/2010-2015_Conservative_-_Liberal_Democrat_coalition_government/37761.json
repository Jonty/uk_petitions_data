        "additional_details": "Cannabis should be legalised.\r\n\r\nIt should be sold at a rediculous price, such as \u00a35-10 per premade 'joint'. You get around 4 'packed joints' out of a 'gram' which usually costs around \u00a310.\r\nPremade 'joints' would mean the users, sellers and government would know exactally what is being sold and where, and would be able to moniter the activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would mean legal growers could grow it with a licence, sell it to 'cannabis bars' and it could be taxed, at the expense of the user/buyer.\r\n\r\nThis would eliminate illigal drug dealers, and limit the amount of cannabis finding it's way to young people under the age of 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon't outlaw cannabis - it's grown on a plant.\r\nOutlaw chemically made drugs such as heroin and cocaine.\r\n\r\nUse the money made from the tax of cannabis to help educate young adults, run re-hab programs for people addicted to 'hard drugs'.",
