By treating male genitalia as 'art' to be proudly displayed on tv dramas, while treating female genitalia as dirty, nasty porn - only to be shown on medical programs is blatantly misogynistic - the message is clear 'male superior to female'.   The government must instruct the Dept for Culture, Media and Sport (and associated quangos - OfCom, BBC Trust) to treat male and female bodies equally. ",
