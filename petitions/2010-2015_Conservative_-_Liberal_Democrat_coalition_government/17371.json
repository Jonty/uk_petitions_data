        "additional_details": "The practice of no-win-no-fee means innocent people can be hounded legally and brought to financial ruin without any form of defence in the UK. Even with CFA Insurance in place, it is the responsibility of the claimant to ensure that the CFA procedure is policed and if this is not, then there is no insured protection against costs for the defendant. There is no legal requirement for the CFA insurance to be demonstrated leaving the defence with no recourse in the event that the action brought is lost. The no-win, no-fee culture is little more than Champerty and Maintenance - both of which are illegal. ",
