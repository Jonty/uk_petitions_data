        "additional_details": "The government proposes to introduce the new flat rate higher pension in 2016.  In the meantime it has put back the retirement age.  This means that there are many women over 60, who cannot get their pension until they are 63, but when they do it will still be at the lower rate.\r\n\r\nThis is patently unfair.  The government should either continue to pay pensions from the ages of 60 for women and 65 for men, until the higher rate comes in, or pay the higher rate immediately for everyone as they become eligible for retirement.",
