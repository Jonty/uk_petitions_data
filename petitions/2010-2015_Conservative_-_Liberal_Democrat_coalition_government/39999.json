I now have a green bin overflowing regularly with rubbish, including nappies, which is extremely unhygenic. I live in an area ridden by seagulls and foxes; this makes leaving overspilling rubbish in the garden an absolute hazard. We now have to make fortnightly trips to the local recycling centre (tip) with the overflow items that can't be recycled.",
