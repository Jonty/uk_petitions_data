Islam is one of the most peaceful and accepting religions on the Earth and naming the radicals as muslim is slandering those who worship their Gods in a good and honest fashion. All I ask, as an anti-theist no less, is that we drop the islam/muslim title when these stories are reported. These people are not representatives of the religion and I feel it is highly unfair to bunch those who have been taught incorrectly in with the multitude of honest muslim citizens in this country.",
