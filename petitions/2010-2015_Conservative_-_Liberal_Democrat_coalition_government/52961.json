        "additional_details": "The Health & Social Care Act 2012 effectively gives the permission for the sale of NHS services to private companies. NHS healthcare in Surrey has already been licensed to Virgin Care, and Norfolk & Norwich Hospital has been taken over by Serco. More recently, the NHS Blood Plasma service \"Plasma Resources UK\" has been sold to US asset-strippers 'Bain Capital'.\r\n\r\nThe Health & Social Care Act 2012 was rushed through parliament without public knowledge, and when finally released to the public, it was said to be \"too far down the road to turn back\". This is a clear violation of the Freedom of Information act.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act, provide more transparent details to the public and stop the sale of NHS services to private companies.
