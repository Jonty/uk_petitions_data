        "additional_details": "The Scottish Youth Parliament was originally formed to empower young people with an interest in politics to take part in and influence the decision-making process. However, the Parliament attracts almost exclusively young people who are already involved in politics; it is our belief that it is of little to no benefit to the vast majority of our country's young people. It currently acts as a vehicle for educated teenagers to further their own careers in politics, rather than addressing everyday issues. We propose that the SYP be abolished and replaced with youth politics initiatives which reach out to young people in deprived areas, or in raising awareness of the political process in schools.",
