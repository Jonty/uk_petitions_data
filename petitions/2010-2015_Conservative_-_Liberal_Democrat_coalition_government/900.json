        "additional_details": "Millions of people across the UK suffer from lactose intolerance and are forced to avoid lots of foodstuffs when out and about (including milk, ice cream, cakes) or suffer from symptoms including nausea, severe abdominal pain and diarrhoea. There is a solution in sight: a chemical process which filters the levels of lactose (a type of sugar found in milk) down to negligible levels; however, manufacturers are not motivated to use lactose free ingredients. Therefore we urge the government to enact regulations mandating the chemical process in all food and drinks sold in the UK.",
