        "additional_details": "Kate and Gerry McCann have steadfastly refused to answer pertinent questions relating to the disappearance of their daughter. Recently, a sighting in Leh, India, was supported by themselves and their spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, while the Leh Chief of Police denied that the event had taken place. Both parties cannot be right, and the fund-raising public needs to know the truth. Questions must also be asked regarding the use of money from the Find Madeleine Fund, following reports that the McCanns have used this for mortgage payments, and to fund lawyers for libel cases. Therefore I feel the need for a full public equiry into these issues.",
