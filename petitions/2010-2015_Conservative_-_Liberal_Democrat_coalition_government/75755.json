        "additional_details": "For too long the Government (this and previous Governments) have relied on the fact that our Armed Forces cannot strike. Because of this, they have offered year on year overall pay reductions (either pay freezes or 1% rise coupled with food/accomodation charge increases resulting in overall reduction in pay). We have seen Governments ability to find money to bail out banks and fund other countries space programmes so let's force the Government to stop hiding behind no strike laws and treat our Armed Forces fairly. Put the power to strike back in the hands of our Armed Forces and give them some control over acceptance of pay and conditions. ",
