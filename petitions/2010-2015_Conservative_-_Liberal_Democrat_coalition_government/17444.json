        "additional_details": "This summer the Youth Charter launched its 2012 Games Legacy Manifesto. The Department of Culture, Media & Sport currently has a policy of free access to museums, but not sports, recreation and leisure facilities. One of the Youth Charter\u2019s key recommendations is the free access to these facilities also for young people. The \u201c2012 Sport Legacy Access for All\u201d e-petition would seek to have the social and cultural benefits of this petition debated with the aim of seeing a real and sustainable legacy of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games to all young people in the UK. The e-petition aims to provide a response to the current debate on lessons that can be learned following the large number of \u2018recreational rioters\u2019 who participated in this summer\u2019s disturbances. The \u201c2012 Sport Legacy Access for All\u201d is about giving young people somewhere to go, something to do and someone to show them.",
