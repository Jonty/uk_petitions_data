        "additional_details": "In short: Permanent constitutional protection for the Internet from the state (politicians).\r\n\r\nIn light of the England Riots, some politicians are suggesting that the state should have the power to suspend sites such as Twitter. Nadine Dorries has defended this decision - by saying we're not like China... because we get the vote...\r\n\r\nThe reality is, the Riots were resolved by the Police, and are being dealt with by the courts. There is no need to make us all suffer through some knee jerk reaction. The internet can be policed without taking it down.\r\n\r\nThe internet is one of the most powerful means to spread democracy (example: the democratic uprisings in the middle east) and as such, the state should not be able to control it, or prevent access to it.\r\n\r\nIt was @CharlotteGore on twitter who had this idea.. I just read her tweet, and thought I'd run with it here :)",
