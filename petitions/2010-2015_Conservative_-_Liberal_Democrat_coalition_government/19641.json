        "additional_details": "During research for my dissertation I have found a great deal of pro-ana/mia websites. I am disgusted that these sites give tips on how to purge and how to hide it from friends and family. Many people wouldn't know what to do if it wasn't for these so-called \"self-help\" sites, and many of them would succumb to their hunger and eat and carry on living a relatively normal life.\r\n\r\nThese websites should be stopped as they are encouraging self-harm and ill health in young people all over the world.",
