        "additional_details": "Once the Euro crisis stabilises the UK should begin redefining its relations with the EU.\r\n\r\nThe UK should recognise that the EU (specifically the 17 Eurozone nations) will pursue ever increasing levels of integration in the future, and cast a public vote on a phased withdrawal from EU membership as it stands today: either full withdrawal or reducing its affiliation with the EU to something resembling a collaborative member if possible.\r\n\r\nIn any case, Britain will continue to work with the EU and its members where there would be benefit to the UK, but on a partnership of equals basis.\r\n\r\nBritain will also continue to be fully committed to the Common Market and ensure the promotion of UK plc in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe UK should recognise that a strong EU equals a strong UK, but that our nations interests go beyond the EU and as such we will walk next to the EU but not with it.\r\n\r\n",
