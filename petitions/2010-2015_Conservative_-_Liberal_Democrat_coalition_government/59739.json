        "additional_details": "Tabloid newspapers such as The Sun, Daily Star, The Mirror, Daily Express and the Daily Mail, etc are directly and negatively influencing public opinion on various issues.\r\n\r\nTabloids largely distort evidence or show a sensationalist and extremist view on scientific studies, politics and societal problems, to name just a few.\r\n\r\nThe public, largely the working class, tend to buy these newspapers and are often swayed by their reporting, using it as evidence and factual representation of the news. However, many news companies have been, and are in legal proceedings due to their style of news reporting, such as the Daily Star with the Madeleine McCann disappearance, The Sun with the Hillsborough disaster and many more.\r\n\r\nA warning needs to be added to the front page of such tabloid newspapers stating \"Notice: This is a TABLOID NEWSPAPER and contains SENSATIONALIST and EXTREMIST views. It should be treated as a work of FICTION.\"",
