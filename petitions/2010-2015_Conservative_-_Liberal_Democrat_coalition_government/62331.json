        "additional_details": "I petition the government for the withdrawal of UK petroleum exploration and drilling licences at sites utilising or preparing to utilise hydraulic fracturing (fracking) processes and the rejection of any further applications for licences. Hydraulic fracturing can contaminate local water sources such as aquifers, which provide about 30% of the UK's drinking water, and the land surrounding the wells. Unless the developer can give absolute assurance that this will not happen and that there is no possibility of citizens suffering adverse health effects then this process should not be further developed until they can give such absolute assurance.
