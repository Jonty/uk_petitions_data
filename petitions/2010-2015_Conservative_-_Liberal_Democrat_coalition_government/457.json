        "additional_details": "Please do not merge HMS Raleigh and Britannia Royal Naval College. There is an enormous difference between training rating and officers and the division between the ranks and rate would disintegrate the level of respect shown to officers of the RN. Surely it would make more sense to merge RN air bases with RAF bases? Or reduce the number of Army recruiting offices as the navy share theirs!\r\nWe're losing our fleet and with it the pride of Britain, save some of the tradition!!",
