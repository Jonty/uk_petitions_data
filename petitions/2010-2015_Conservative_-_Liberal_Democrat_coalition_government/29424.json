The media has poisoned the mind of the older generation influencing them that young people are to immature to make a informed decision. Where this is clearly untrue as there are many responsible young adults who are already involved in politics due to compulsory citizenship lessons taught in school.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to hold a referendum on this subject or it to be considered in parliament.\r\n",
