        "additional_details": "Russia is committing dreadful acts of discrimination against LGTB community. Eurovision at least in this country has been at the heart of camp entertainment for years. In Russia the contest is taken very seriously and seen as part of the cultural acceptance. The BBC are part of the BIG 4 that put forward much of the funding towards the event each year, it must give us some say in who can take part. Please sign this petition even if we do not get them banned we can raise awareness. ",
