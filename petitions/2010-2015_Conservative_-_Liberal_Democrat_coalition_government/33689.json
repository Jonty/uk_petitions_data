        "additional_details": "Judging by the way a majority of motorcyclists ride in excess of the speed limit, I believe there is a need for a national advertising campaign to highlight the dangers of constantly breaking the law by speeding.\r\n\r\nMost road safety ad campaigns have put the emphasis on drivers being more aware of motorcyclist and the think bike campaign is constantly on road signs. I believe a more realistic approach  would be to put the emphasis on the riders to slow down and take more responsibility for their riding habits.\r\n\r\nThe campaign would need to explain to motorcyclists that the speed limits are there for a reason. That every vehicle is not a chance to overtake and if the vehicle in front is already traveling at the speed limit, then there is no need to overtake it. Undertaking is illegal for safety reasons and filtering needs to be done correctly and safely.\r\n\r\n",
