        "additional_details": "This petition is to change the law on the media being able to print/ report whatever they like about an inquest involving suicide. This should be a private matter for the family. This just adds more hurt to an already hurtful time. Currently the media are exempt from privacy rules when it is involving suicide. Why? The law should stop them printing any private information that is private to the family. This is an invasion of privacy and has no public interest. ",
