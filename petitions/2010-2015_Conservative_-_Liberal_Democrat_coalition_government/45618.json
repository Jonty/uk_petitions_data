        "additional_details": "With the new housing benefit reform it has not been made clear who this will effect, as you may have seen in the press recently a couple who lost their daughter to cancer will be forced to pay for the 'extra' room they have. Many of the MP's live in homes with 6+ bedrooms, they will get away with this bedroom tax. Sounds fair right, what happened to 'in this together'  this is a slogan created to make people believe that the changes are for the good of the nation.\r\n\r\nWE NEED THIS PETITION TO REACH 150,000 SIGNATURES WITHIN 3 WEEKS.\r\n\r\nDONT LET THE TORIES RUIN MORE PEOPLES LIVES, LOOK AT THE FIGURES AND THIS REFORM WILL ONLY HURT PEOPLE NOT SAVE MONEY.",
