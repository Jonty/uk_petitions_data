        "additional_details": "In trying to get a job since being a business partnership bankrupt, we have come up against companies who will not even consider you for a post in their company if you are a bankrupt. We feel us being bankrupt does not affect our ability to carry out a job (unless it is to do with money of course), and as such we feel it should be made illegal for any company to have this as an employment policy as it is a bar to getting a job and could result in us remaining on state benefits, which does not help anybody! Perhaps sole trader and partnership bankrupts should be made seperate from non-business personal bankrupts, as not all businesses have the resources to make themselves Limited which then protects the directors from personal bankruptcy to a degree. A serious change in legislation is needed to protect sole traders and partnership bankrupts from gaining employment whilst bankrupt.",
