Postboxes have been painted Gold in the home place of British Gold Medal winners BUT achieving any colour of medal at the Olympics is a major achievement. We want postboxes painted silver & bronze in the relevant cities/towns/villages, to really emphasise the achievement of our athletes and remind people what was achieved by a 'local' whenever they see the postbox, which will then be a 'talking' point for all future young people and hopefully will help them to aim high and never stop trying to achieve their true potentials. Lets get this suggestion turned into a positive action for the future!",
