        "additional_details": "Taking into consideration all  recently released information on PIP, is there not a good case to abandon PIP and keep DLA with some modifications.\r\n\r\nNow the National Audit Office has announced that :\r\nDelays in processing claims under the new Personal Independence Payment have reduced the amount the Government expected to save by \u00a3140 million, the National Audit Office said.\r\n\r\nThe backlog in cases have cut expected savings over the course of this Parliament, with the DWP now forecast to save \u00a3640 million a year by 2015, rather than its orginial prediction of \u00a3780 million.\r\n\r\nEach new PIP claim - worth between \u00a321 and \u00a3134 a week to disabled claimants - costs an average \u00a3182 to administer, compared to \u00a349 under DLA, the report said.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion as a retired Welfare Rights Lawyer, PIP should now be scrapped and DLA kept with some modifications. I ask you to sign my petition to the Government to cancel PIP\r\n",
