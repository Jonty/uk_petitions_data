        "additional_details": "We often see the Air Ambulance called upon by the Ambulance Service or Police in news and TV programmes although this service is funded by public donations. If this service is so relied upon then surely the government should either fund or part fund its operations. A friend of mine was killed some time ago and if not for their service his family would not have had the precious moments to say goodbye.",
