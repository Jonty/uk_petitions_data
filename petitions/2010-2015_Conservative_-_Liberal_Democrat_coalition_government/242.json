        "additional_details": "We call upon the government to make sure that the BBC keeps its coverage of the Formula 1. The current BBC coverage has won numerous BAFTA awards and is arguably the best it has ever been. The motor sport industry contributes more than \u00a3500 million to the UK economy according to Andy Parr, Chairman of Williams F1. The majority of Formula 1 teams have their engineering offices in the UK; these support the very types of highly skilled jobs that the UK wants to attract; let alone keep. Formula 1 arguably represents the pinnacle of global motor sport; the government, along with the media, should be supporting it and making sure it is accessible rather than walled up behind expensive subscription services. If this isn't done there is the risk that sponsors will reduce their input and hence there will be a loss of jobs; not to mention the UK's leading position in the world.",
