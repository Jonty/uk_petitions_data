        "additional_details": "The current culture of having hour-long lessons and only 5 periods a day is ineffective for the learning of most school subjects.\r\n\r\nLessons should be shorter but occur more often: ideally 40-45 minutes per session but 3-4 times per week, rather than 60 minutes, once or twice per week.\r\n\r\nLonger sessions are ineffective for pupil concentration. Shorter sessions that occur more often allow for better learning, particularly for subjects such as languages, history and mathematics,\r\n\r\nFor more practical subjects, such as art, practical science, or home economics, sessions can always be doubled, where necessary, however it is important the minimum lesson unit become shorter.
