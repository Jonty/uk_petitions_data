        "additional_details": " The new benefits cap which will be introduced in April 2013 could see families of disabled people being forced into decisions to put their loved ones, into residential care. The government stated they would NOT attack carers. If a carer was to put the disabled person into the care of the state, then potentially the deficit the government wipes out now, could out way the cuts already made. A typical bill for someone disabled for the state to look after could be in the excess of \u00a3200,000  a yr. If the government didn\u2019t  cap  carers and  are cared for at home with minimal state intervention, this would be beneficial to all, keeping the  family unit togeher and the disabled cared for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
