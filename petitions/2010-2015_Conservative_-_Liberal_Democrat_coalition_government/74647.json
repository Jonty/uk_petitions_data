This a MAJOR commuting route and the only road from Grantham to Nottingham.\r\nTogether with a 40mph HGV speed limit, this leads to many drivers taking  unnecessary risks to overtake, causing many deaths every year, this change of road would also ease congestion, see A46 from Newark on Trent to Leicester.",
