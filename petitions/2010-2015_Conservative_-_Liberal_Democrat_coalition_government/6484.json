It would also set a principle for all businesses and government departments when dealing with third parties. It would apply to government departments, local authorities, retail law, employment law, business contracts, travel companies, financial products etc.\r\nAll terms and penalties in any contract or interaction must be visibly equal to either party.\r\nFor example, if HMRC fine you \u00a3100 for a late payment, then the HMRC would be liable for a \u00a3100 fine for failing to refund money within a specified period.\r\nIf a contract stipulates a cancellation notice period of, say, 30 days, this must apply either way.\r\nIf a bank can charge you set fees for administration on your account, you should have an automatic right to be credited fees for the same amounts for the same administration.\r\n",
