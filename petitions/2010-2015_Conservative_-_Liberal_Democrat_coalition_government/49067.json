        "additional_details": "These days every neighbourhood seems to be plagued with litter yet we have 3 million claiming unemployment benefit. I propose that those claiming such benefit and deemed fit for work be responsible for cleaning litter in their neighbourhood. As many of those are often the causes of the littering, they would soon adopt a more responsible attitude if they had to clean it up or risk losing their benefits. Many areas have litter wardens so they could police the cleaning and report to DWP any who fail to clean. The country would be cleaner and the unwilling would soon find some work or save the rest of us a fortune.",
