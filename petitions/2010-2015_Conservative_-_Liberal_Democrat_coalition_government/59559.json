        "additional_details": "Eric Gill's sculpture of Prospero and Ariel (from Shakespeare's The Tempest) which adorns The BBC's Headquarters on Portland square has a very disturbing history behind it.\r\n\r\nGill had an incestuous relationship with his sister, sexual relationships with two of his pubescent daughters and even his family dog.\r\n\r\nDespite everything that has happened since the BBC\u2019s number one asset, Jimmy Savile, being exposed as Britain\u2019s most notorious paedophile, the corporation remains unapologetic of its use of child abusers to host children\u2019s television programmes and its use of paedophiles to decorate its flagship building.\r\n\r\nThe BBC likes to think a naked boy submissively leaning into the raised leg of a wizard is simply a metaphor for broadcasting. To the BBC Eric Gill was a major British artist rather than an incestuous bestiality practitioner.\r\n\r\nIf you disagree and you want this statue to be removed: sign the petition today.",
