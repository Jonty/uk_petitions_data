Whether this be via microwave link, satellite or wide area wireless connection.\r\n\r\nA fast internet connection is now essential to running any business, maintaining contact with people, and underpins many other essential services e.g. cash points, chip and pin machines, and mobile phone signal.\r\n\r\nAs such, this issue demands an injection of cash from the government and pressure onto the internet service providers to supply such a service on an enhanced timetable.",
