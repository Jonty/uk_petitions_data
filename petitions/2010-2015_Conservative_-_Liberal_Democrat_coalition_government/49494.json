When politicians are asked, we see it easy to blame coalition partners or to simply state that there is no party manifesto until the next general election.  This is simply unacceptable.\r\n\r\nWe agree that each party in the House of Commons should legally have to produce a manifesto of their vision of the country on a yearly basis and independent to any partnerships be it coalition or otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf a party does not have an accessible and concise vision of the country then it is impossible for people to make educated opinions of how a party is doing either in Government or in opposition.
