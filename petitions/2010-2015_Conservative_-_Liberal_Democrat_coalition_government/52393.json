        "additional_details": "To go from 20 weeks of pregnancy to 40 weeks of pregnancy without an ultrasound is worrying and stressful, this is where many losses occur. During these vital stages of pregnancy conditions can be seen and potentially treated.  For those who have suffered a loss this can bring great reassurance. It will outline many risk factors that could lead to health problems or even death of the baby. A simple cervical check can see the likelihood of the mother going into pre-term labour; they can also look at the amniotic fluid volume which is essential to help the babies lungs develop. It has been seen that there has been many petitions asking for another scan to be routine for pregnant women however had the reply that it is not beneficial for the NHS, though I\u2019m sure if spoken with many parents you would find that the mental health of the parents would be greatly improved by the comfort given from another ultrasound performed during these weeks of pregnancy.",
