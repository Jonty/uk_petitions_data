        "additional_details": "\r\nWe see people from a certain religious group publicizing  their religion on the streets in UK, especially in London areas. It is so disturbing to hear someone criticizing our beliefs and urging us to convert to their religion. You can feel how disgusting the matter is when someone asks you to change your religion. If someone wants to change his/ her religion, they can do it by going to the Church, Temple, Pagoda, Mosque etc. It is unacceptable to see this type of behavior on the street of a Civilized country. So, please ban promoting religion on the streets or in public places. Thank you all\r\n",
