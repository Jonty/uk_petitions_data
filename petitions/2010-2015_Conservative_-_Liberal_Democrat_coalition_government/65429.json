When we tried to expose these unlawful actions, we were lied to and then ignored. We have given them ample time for response, which they chose not to do.\r\n\r\nHow can this be Justice?\r\n\r\nHow can the people trust such a system?\r\n\r\nThe government has to seriously investigate these accusations between the CPS and Courts to stamp out this corruption. If represent the people and they truly believe in a fair and lawful justice system, they must investigate.\r\n",
