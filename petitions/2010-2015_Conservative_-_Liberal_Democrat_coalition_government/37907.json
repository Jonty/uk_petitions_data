You are organising a celebration with Games Makers, we were also games makers many of who had little or no experience.  All we ask is that we be included because this is what the Olympic ethos is, equality, and diversity.  We could line the end of the parade, in costume, in daylight and this would give us the recognition and we feel LOCOG are ignoring us. The age range is very diverse, children aged 7+ with a lady in the Paralympic ceremony aged 80. Three of one family are in the Ceremony creating history for us and the 2012 Ceremonies and probably a first for GB. ",
