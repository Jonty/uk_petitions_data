        "additional_details": " The Dangerous Dogs Act 1991\r\nBSL has not prevented attacks on people, animals or discouraged irresponsible ownership. It has also failed in other countries where it has been evaluated, such as the Netherlands, Spain and Denmark. The law was intended to phase out these types of dogs. However, experts in this area suggest that, the introduction of breed specific legislation simply made the prospect of owning a banned \u2018dangerous\u2019 dog more desirable to the type of people who encourage their dog to be aggressive.\r\nBSL punishes certain types of dogs for the way they look and fails to consider a dog\u2019s individual behaviour when determining whether or not they are dangerous. As a result, dogs whose behaviour poses no risk are branded 'dangerous' just because of their appearance.\r\n\r\n",
