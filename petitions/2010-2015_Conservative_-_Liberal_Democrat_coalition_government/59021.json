        "additional_details": "I lost my brother last year to a car accident, luckily the media did not manage to get a photo of this and publish it. I would have been so upset and disturbed if I had seen such a sight.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately over this year I have been seeing more and more photographs of scenes of fatal accidents published by papers and local TV networks. In one case somebody had found out a loved one had died by seeing a picture of the car scene on the local news.\r\n\r\nI believe showing these kind of images cause distress, hurt and upset, and can cause serious psychological damage to friends and family involved.\r\n\r\nI want to stop local papers and tv channels being able to publish such photographs. I understand that there is freedom of speech, but this morally wrong and upsetting.  This is where someone has died, or sustained serious life changing injuries.\r\n\r\nStop this upset, no one wants to see these images!!",
