        "additional_details": "The majority of road users follow motorcycle where the the motorcycles maximum speed is below 60  they follow sometimes within a couple of metres as many motorcyclists are aware they are open to many elements that can throw the rider off if that does happen whilst being closely followed by a car then due to the velocity of the car the rider will end up being struck by the following vehicle sometimes its even 7500kg vehicles noq it is easy to understand the importance of this change.  I also would like a road safety tv advert displaying a similar scenario. ",
