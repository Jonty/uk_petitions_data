        "additional_details": "This cult manipulates minds, excommunicates members leaving them isolated from family and friends causing many to suffer with depression and resort to suicide, allows sexual abuse by keeping over 120,000 names of paedophiles at their headquarters (as seen on bbc panorama), not informing the police and allowing these criminals to carry on as normal, they still do not allow blood transfusions though they profess that they do. This is not just a typical religion this a dangerous, brainwashing cult that needs to be stopped. By banning it a lot less people will join and many that are in it will leave it. We need 100,000 signatures to get it debated and even if it doesnt get banned perhaps the police will look into the sexual abuse that is rife among these people.",
