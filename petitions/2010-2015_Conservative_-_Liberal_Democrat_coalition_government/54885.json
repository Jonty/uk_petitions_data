Using them tells pedestrians & other road users what your intentions are. Not using them could result in someone getting hurt, or worse. Many lives are affected by those who chose not to indicate.\r\n\r\nPlease support this 'drive' to make it law that indicators must be used when on the road.\r\n\r\nResponsible driving is not too high a price to pay for your freedom on the road.",
