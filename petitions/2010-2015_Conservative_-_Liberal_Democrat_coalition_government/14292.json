        "additional_details": "In the USA, drivers can turn RIGHT on a RED signal. Subject of course to priority being given to pedestrians and traffic going through GREEN. If the way is clear and there are no pedestrians or traffic going through, you may turn right on a RED.\r\n\r\nMy request is for the DoT to allow this to happen in the UK. Allowing traffic to turn LEFT ona RED makes sense.\r\n\r\nIt saves time\r\nIt allows traffic to flow freely\r\nIt saves cars from idling, thus saving emissions.\r\nIt is environmentally friendly.\r\n\r\nIt is already possible at some junctions with filters and give way signs, but this needs to be extended.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this it makes sense.\r\n\r\nThankyou",
