        "additional_details": "I am issuing this petition to all residents from 68-88 Snape Hill Lane, Dronfield. I, myself as a resident find it very annoying, inconvenient and just plain rude when other people knowingly park in front of your house as they have too many vehicles per house. According to the council it is one vehicle per household, however some residents park between 2 and 5 in the hatched bay which means the rest of us cannot park and risk parking elsewhere, which would void our car insurance if a break in, vandalism or a car going by causes damage. I also feel this issue is effecting residents on roads nearby having people parking outside their homes. I am asking you to sign this so that we can inforce 1 car per household in the hatched bay so we can all park outside our houses with ease.",
