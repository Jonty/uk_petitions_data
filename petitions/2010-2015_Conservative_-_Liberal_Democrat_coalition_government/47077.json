And on the 23 Oct 2012, it was further clarified.\r\nForums are showing that claims made in Oct/Nov 2012 have still not received any constructive replies, much less compensation.\r\nHM Government should enforce the EU ruling in order to ensure that where airlines that are at fault in these delays (and not down to acts of god), they cannot just sit on their corporate hands and drag out any compensation payment for as long as they can get away with it.",
