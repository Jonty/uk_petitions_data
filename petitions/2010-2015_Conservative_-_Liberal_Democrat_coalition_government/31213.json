        "additional_details": "Petition for a law requiring supermarkets to provide pedestrian walkways between every 2 rows of cars.\r\n\r\nCurrently, most supermarkets have only one such walkway, which benefits only the small number of people parked on either side.  The remainder of customers take their lives into their hands when accessing their cars, having to walk in the \u2018roadway\u2019 between 2 rows of cars, many of whom are reversing into the path of those customers.\r\n\r\nWhen you are fit, healthy and unencumbered, it is difficult enough to try and judge just where the next reversing car is coming from, not to mention those cars using the \u2018roadway\u2019 for access and egress. However, if you are elderly or handicapped or have young children with you, it is well nigh impossible to gauge where the next danger is coming from.\r\n\r\nThere have recently been several deaths in supermarket carparks \u2013 I feel sure that some of these deaths might have been avoided if pedestrian walkways had been available between every 2 rows of cars.\r\n",
