        "additional_details": "We need to see a change in the law with regards to parent and child parking. These spaces are reserved parking and should not be abused by people without children in the car and/or disabled badge holders.\r\n\r\nThere are laws to protect blue badge holders and it is time to have measures in place to protect people who have small children in the car. Parent and child spaces are sparse at the best of times and are often misused by people who do not meet the criteria for the space.\r\n\r\nI am calling for the government to issues badges for use when transporting small children.\r\n\r\nClear laws regarding parking without a child in a reserved space and fines for braking these laws.
