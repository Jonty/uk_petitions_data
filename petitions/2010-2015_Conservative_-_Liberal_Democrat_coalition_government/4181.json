        "action": "Ban the use of all forms of battery farming",
        "additional_details": "I propose the government should prohibit battery farming in UK, where egg-laying hens are stored within cages in order to produce eggs.\r\n\r\nIn addition, enriched cages (which are no significant improvement from conventional cages) also have no place in modern society where animals deserve respect, not torture. Animals which are confided within any variations of these cages are not living naturally and, due to a lack of exercise, often suffer from a form of osteoporosis. Research has also shown that hens grown in these cages often suffer severe behavioural disorders due to being stored in such confided areas. Despite the cheap value of eggs produced via the use of caged hens, the ethical reasons must be acknowledged. Other members of the EU, notably Germany, have acknowledged the cruelty of battery farming and have set official plans for all forms of battery farming to become prohibited. What is Britain waiting for?\r\n\r\nEnd of battery farming, switch to free range.",
