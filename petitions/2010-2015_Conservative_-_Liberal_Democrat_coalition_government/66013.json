        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call for the immediate suspension of the planned re-modelling of this junction from a roundabout to a traffic light interchange.\r\n\r\nWe believe that contrary to some reports there is not a problem with traffic congestion at the island as it currently stands and that changing to traffic lights would create queues where none existed previously and increase the risk of accidents.\r\n\r\nWe believe that any changes to this junction should only be in the form of adding free-flowing slip roads between the A49 and A5.\r\n\r\nWe also believe that there are other junctions in the Shrewsbury area in more urgent need of improvements if there is money to be spent in this manner.",
