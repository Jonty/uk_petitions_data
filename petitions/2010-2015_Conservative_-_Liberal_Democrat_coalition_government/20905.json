Different government departments have different schemes, and it looks like each will have to fight to defend or redefine their benefits.\r\nBut note that MPs have the best pensions of the lot: Just 20 years' service secures an index-linked retirement income of half final pay!\r\nSo sign the petition to insist that regardless of whether you believe other public sector workers should have their pension rights revised - MPs should lead by example and change their pensions in line with what they propose for teachers etc BEFORE looking elsewhere!",
