        "action": "Urge Russian government to end discrimination against LGBT citizens",
        "additional_details": "Russia is becoming an increasingly homophobic country. As a direct result of its regional 'anti-gay propaganda' laws and the more recent unanimous adoption in the Duma of a law outlawing giving information about homosexuality to under-18s, LGBT people in Russia are being literally beaten and murdered on a daily basis. Pride marches continue to be banned and freedom of expression is in grave danger. This petition calls upon the UK government to use its global influence to push for basic human rights for Russia's LGBT citizens.",
