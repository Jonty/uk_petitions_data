        "additional_details": "It is well known that Pets at Home have a bad reputation regarding the welfare and care they provide for the animals, fish and reptiles in their stores, as this was highlighted by the BBC Watchdog program in September 2012. Pets at Home responded to this by saying they disagreed with just about everything the program said and that they complied with all regulations and provided the best care possible but would put in place better checks and training.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this doesn't seemed to have happened and the conditions and care continue to be sub standard and detrimental to the health of the animals, fish and reptiles in their stores.\r\n\r\nAs it is quite obvious that Pets at Home are incapable of providing the care and conditions required, we the undersigned would like to petition to stop them from being able to sell any animals, fish or reptiles in their stores.",
