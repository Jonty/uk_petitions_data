        "additional_details": "We call upon our government whose responsibility it is to represent the citizens of the United Kingdom, to hereby resolve the on-going conflict between Gaza and Israel. We demand our government to call upon the United Nations to immediately deploy Peacekeeping forces and negotiate a truce between the two sides to end the humanitarian crisis. Any breach of the truce should be fairly punishable by the United Nations and not the parties involved in the conflict.\r\n\r\nWe demand that the siege upon Gaza be lifted so that the Gazan population may live a dignified life as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Israel must abide by its obligations enshrined in the UN Charter and UN resolutions.\r\n\r\nWe call for the implementation of the above for a gradual move towards a two-state solution.\r\n",
