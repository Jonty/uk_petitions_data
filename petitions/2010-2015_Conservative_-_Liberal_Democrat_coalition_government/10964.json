These withheld number calls are often to vulnerable people in society who may not know how to successfully deal with them.  Some of these calls go well beyond being a 'nuisance' and cause people genuine distress.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to speak to someone over the phone, you should be willing for the person being called to know your phone number.  Simple as that.",
