        "additional_details": "This petition is NOT against paying child support, its against the amount we pay, the 'Arrears' they say we owe, paying child support out of badly needed overtime pay or bonuses. I am currently paying 30% out of my wages which doesnt leave me enough to live on, after child support have taken there part i am bringing home the equivelent of \u00a33.50 per hour, if i do overtime to try and earn more money \u00a330% of that will also be taken. I know mine is not a unique case, i have heard of people paying 40% and having to leave their jobs as a result. It is also about 'arrears'.I dont believe the CSA should have the right to decide that someone is in debt,Child support shouldnt start until the child support agency contacts you and informs you that your case has been looked at and said amount needs to be payed per week, In this day and age, where jobs are rare and well paid jobs are rarer still, to be informed that you are in debt when its already difficult to make ends meet causes untold stress.",
