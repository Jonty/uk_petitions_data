        "additional_details": "In the light of the news that Levi Bellfield is to sue the prison service for breach of its duty of care towards him, I propose an end to the rights of prisoners to financial compensation for injuries suffered at the hands of other inmates.\r\n\r\nObviously nobody is advocating that other inmates should take matters into their own hands, but the types of crimes committed by the likes of Bellfield are bound to provoke strong and sometimes violent reactions.\r\n\r\nAlthough every effort should be made to avoid such situations, violent prisoners cannot expect a cast iron guarantee that they will be kept safe at all times.\r\n\r\nWhere lapses do occur, under no circumstance should financial compensation be awarded.",
