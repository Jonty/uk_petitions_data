Suggesting the striking worker should be executed in front of their families is an unacceptable statement, especially on a family show. His recent comments relating to suicide victims are crass and insensitive. When taken in conjunction with past offensive comments it is clear that retailing Clarkson on their payroll is only going to damage the reputation of the BBC.\r\n\r\nThe government should call for the BBC to hold those on its payroll to a higher standard and thus should terminate Clarkson's employment.
