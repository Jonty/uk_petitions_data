Approximately 45% of these young Adults will have some form of mental health episode, another percentage of these, our loved ones, will be sectioned. Another percentage will ultimately die of their addiction, some whilst still of School age. Only when our Children are educated around the affects of all the addictive substances, can they start to understand what harm can come from, what most of our young currently class as a 'bit of fun'.",
