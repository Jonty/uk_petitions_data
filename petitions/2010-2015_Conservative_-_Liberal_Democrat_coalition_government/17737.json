The nhs constitution states that all patients who need routine care should be treated within 18 weeks of being referred to a hospital from their GP.The number of patients waiting more than 18 weeks is rapidly growing and their pct's are NOT offering them faster treatment elsewhere.We demand that if a pct is unable to offer treatment within 18 weeks the pateint must be given the choice and funding to get treatment elsewhere.We feel it is unfair and inhumane for anyone in pain to be made to wait upto 9 months for treatment.
