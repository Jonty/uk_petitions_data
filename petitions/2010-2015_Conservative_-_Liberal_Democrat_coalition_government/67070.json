I am one of 30 staff and more ex employees of who have fallen foul to a so called \"businessman\" who buys ailing companies for a pittance and sells them off at a profit. Unfortunately the employees are the ones who suffer, as the \"company\" is in breach of contract and the staff are stuck between finding a new job (and not getting the money owed to them) or sticking it out until things come right. This is the second time this has happened to us with the same company, under the same CEO. His record shows that he has been doing this for years, and has been getting away with not paying the staff who have worked for him. How is this legal? Its time to put an end to these sharks and ask the government to do something about it. ",
