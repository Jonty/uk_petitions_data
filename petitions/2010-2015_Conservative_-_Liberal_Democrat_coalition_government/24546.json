UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES WOULD THEN FALL, MOST YOUNGSTERS WANT  THE CHANCE TO WORK,.. THIS WOULD GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK AND HAVE SOME SELF ESTEEM, WHICH MOST PEOPLE WANT...\r\n\r\nINSTEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT PAYING OUT FOR ALL THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS THAT THE CURRENT SITUATION CAUSES, BY MORE YOUNGSTERS BEING IN WORK, THE MONEY SAVED IN PAYING LESS UNEMPLOMENT BENEFIT,  WOULD PAY FOR THE EXTRA PENSIONS INSTEAD.\r\n\r\nTHIS REALLY IS A NO BRAINER. IT ALSO GIVES THE YOUNG A BETTER START IN LIFE AND ALLOWS THE ELDER MEMBERS OF THE COUNTRY TIME TO RELAX AND ENJOY THEIR LATER YEARS, WHILST THEY CAN.\r\n\r\nI",
