        "additional_details": "Is there anything more unethical than taking goods from vulnerable people to pay the government?\r\n\r\nIt is outdated and whilst families are struggling, Bailiffs are making huge profits in the process.\r\n\r\nIf you speak to anyone who\u2019s encountered a Bailiff, you will often hear of Illegal intimidating practices where there are no witnesses. Few people know they\u2019re rights and Bailiffs rely on this to exploit people. Common heard stories are, threats, illegal levies, overcharging & deception.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite the above, Bailiffs are still continuing to adopt the same illegal practices.\r\n\r\nBailiff Fees dramatically increased in 2014, despite 1 Bailiff Firm making \u00a31,659,836 profit and another Bailiff Firm affording to pay out \u00a31,136,878 in dividends and making \u00a3873,745 profit in 2012.\r\n\r\nWe Propose that debts with the council to go through the small claims and lead to county court judgements if left unpaid, as this is a much more ethical, and proportionate way to deal with debts.",
