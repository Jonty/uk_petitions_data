        "action": "Wanted: Equal Pay Auditing",
        "additional_details": "Laws on equal pay have existed for more than 40 years, yet women working full-time in the UK are still paid on average 14.9 % less per hour than men. At the current rate of change, a baby girl born this year will not achieve equal pay until she is 97 years old. Enough is enough.\r\nWe, the undersigned, call on the government to make equal-pay auditing compulsory from 2013 for all companies who employ 250 people or more. This information (the average wage of women employees and how this compares to men) should be made public, for example on companies\u2019 websites.\r\nWe believe that without this commitment from the government, the pay gap will be allowed to widen at a time when women across the UK are already finding it harder than ever to make ends meet.",
