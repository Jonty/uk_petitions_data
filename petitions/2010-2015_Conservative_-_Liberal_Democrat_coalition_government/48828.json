        "additional_details": "Officially there are around 900,000 illegal immigrants in Britain, but the real figure could be two million or more. Nobody knows. Their activities in the black economy are a continuing threat to the livelihoods of many British citizens. More worryingly, some of the illegal immigrants might be dangerous criminals or would-be terrorists. We demand that the British Government set a goal of expelling every illegal immigrant from Britain by the end of 2014, and that it provide the resources and manpower needed to make this happen.",
