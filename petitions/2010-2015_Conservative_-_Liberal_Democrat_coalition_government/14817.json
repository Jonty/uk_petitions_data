        "additional_details": "You'll notice that the 1p coin-pushing machines in blackpool's arcades are no more; replaced by 2p coin-pushers. Likewise, few stores will sell you individual penny sweets anymore. Generally the only use I find for these coins is to accumulate them in a jar.\r\n\r\nYes, the 1p coin has had a great history and I think some would be sad to see it go. However, it has reached the point where it costs more to mint the coin than the coin's worth.\r\n\r\nOther countries have gone through with plans to eliminate all their small change and their plans were a great success. I don't think we should jump into the removal of all our low value coins, just simply test the water with an end to circulation of the 1p coin.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, stores insisting on giving you change will have to start selling things at \u00a31.95 or \u00a31.98 instead which would be saving you money :)\r\n\r\nPlease, cease circulating 1p coins.",
