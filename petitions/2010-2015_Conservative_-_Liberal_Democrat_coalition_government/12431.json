        "additional_details": "The Government is petitioned to tender out the prison sentence to interested countries (possibly Turkey, Greece, etc) for habitual re-offenders.  The average cost per prison place in England is \u00a345,000 per year and the majority of nations do not spend this per prisoner.  This tendering would therefore be a cost saving measure to the UK whilst encouraging people not to re-offend.  With no change in criminal justice policy, by the end of June 2016 the prison population is projected to increase to between 83,100 and 93,600.",
