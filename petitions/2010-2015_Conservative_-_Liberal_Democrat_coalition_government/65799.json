        "additional_details": "I am highly disgusted with this new 2year grant as its only mainly for people on benifits or low income people. Why should our children have to wait to start education so nurseries can fit in children who qualify for this grant. My son whos name was put on a list a week old has lost his place starting preschool because of this and now has to start at 3years old. Its unfair this new system as to why our children are getting penalised just because we dont fall into any of the categories on the paper work!  ",
