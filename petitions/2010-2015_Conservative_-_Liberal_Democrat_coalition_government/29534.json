However it could be that the candidates do not represent the views of the electorate and hence the apathy!\r\nIn all elections voters should be able to register that they are not satisfied or are not represented by any of the candidates. There should be a box which states simple \u201cnone of the above candidates\u201d.\r\nThis would allow everyone to participate in the election and also register an important message to the candidates.\r\nAction required: I therefore ask that in future elections, local, regional and national we are given the real choice of \u201cNONE OF THE ABOVE\u201d to be included in all ballot papers.!\r\n",
