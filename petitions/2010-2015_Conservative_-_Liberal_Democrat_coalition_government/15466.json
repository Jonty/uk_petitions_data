        "additional_details": " It is morally wrong that the taxpayer has to pay excessive wages to the public sector. There is no way their salary should be  more than the Prime Minster earns, there should be a limit below \u00a3150,000. Also most public sector enjoy perks and pension that most taxpayer's can only dream about.. Every government department is run in the same way with overpaid management with no responsibility to the job and over inflated redundancy if they fail and the poor taxpayer picks up the tabs.\r\nWhat should be done !  Reduce public sector wages.\r\n Reduce public sector pensions failing that balance the private pensions to the SAME level.\r\n Stop the payments that public sectors get at retirement.\r\n\r\n",
