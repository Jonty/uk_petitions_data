        "additional_details": "Those on the electoral register should be allowed to vote electronically on all business in the house. You can pay your tax and bank electronically so why can't one vote on the future of this great state,giving everyone a democratic stake in the future of the country. MP's and the Goverment should enact legislation allowing this to become a true democratic process thus encompassing all of society. Allowing electronic voting would encourage a larger proportion of the electorate to be involved in the political processs rather than the lower percentage who vote in the current electoral process. MP's could still debate the issues involved and put forward arguements for or against those issues, thus giving guidance to those voting on those issues",
