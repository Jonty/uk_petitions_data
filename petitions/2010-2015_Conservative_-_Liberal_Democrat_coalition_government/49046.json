        "additional_details": "To make it compulsory for all bookmakers nationwide to  use a membership scheme using a swipe card that is linked to a national database- one that the staff member swipes - and also ones on the FOBTS- to ensure any persons that are self excluded cannot use them or place any bets. This will then alert the staff member who can then ask the client to leave the premises. This database will also log how much the non-self excluded clients spend, and the consistency, and can highlight if this person has a gambling problem. These membership cards will also have the clients photo on, and their name, which will need updating once a year.",
