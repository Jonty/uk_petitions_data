There must be a case for  investigating consipracy to defraud by senior management.\r\n\r\nA proper investigation will also send a forceful message..\r\n\r\no\tPPI has cost the tax payer perhaps ten billion pounds\r\no\tNo criminal investigation has been conducted\r\no\tNo one has been prosecuted\r\no\tThe SFO has indicated it does not wish to examine the issues\r\no\tSuch a major failure merits a proper criminal investigation\r\no\tEven if ultimately the investigation fails it will signal intent to pursue white collar criminals as far as can be done when they steal from the public\r\no\tWe therefore call for proper resources to be made available to investigate PPI and associated conspiracies to defraud.\r\n",
