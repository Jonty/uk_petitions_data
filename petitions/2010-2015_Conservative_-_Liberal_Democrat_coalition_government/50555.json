Having seen high profile murderers, terrorists and extreme activists in the media, the way in which they're treated for the horrific crimes is disgusting. The tax payer, who gets the brunt of costs to detain these inhumane monsters, struggle day to day with living expenses in the current economic state while murderers, terrorists and activists have a better quality of life than the struggling middle class family.",
