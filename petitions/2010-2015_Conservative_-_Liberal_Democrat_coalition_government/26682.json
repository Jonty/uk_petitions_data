Too many people in our country are experiencing inadequate care and diagnosis in our hospitals. This is unacceptable as people are losing their lives due to this.\r\nSign this petition if you would like the Government to examine our NHS hospitals and improve the quality of care for our families. We work hard and pay for the service so join me in making a difference with the support of our Government",
