        "additional_details": "This petition is to get a review of treatment and diagnosis of vitamin b12 deficiency/pernicious anaemia. For those suffering from b12 deficiency/pernicious anaemia misdiagnosis and poor understanding are preventing suitable treatment leading to ongoing suffering. Currently misdiagnosis results in unnecessary prescription for anti-depressants and anti-pyschotics which can result in long term dependency and addiction, leaving many sufferes on long term sickness benefit, this costs the government many millions of pounds. This may potentially be drastically reduced by investment in understanding and research.",
