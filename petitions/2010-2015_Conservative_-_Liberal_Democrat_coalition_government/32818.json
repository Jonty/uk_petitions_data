        "additional_details": "London weighting was started to deal with the discrepancy between the cost of living in London and the rest of the country.\r\n\r\nAverage rents outside London are about \u00a3600ocm.  In London the figure is twice that.\r\n\r\nI propose that London weighting should be implemented for all on an income of \u00a326kpa or lower, of \u00a3600pm to equalise accommodation costs.\r\n\r\nThis could be done in part by the government refraining from taxing those on \u00a326k or less living in London, until the benefit of \u00a3600pcm was achieved, alongside looking to increase the London minimum wage to a realistic level.",
