        "additional_details": "Home Office has recently introduced new requirements for Non-EU migrants \"Knowledge of language and life in the UK\". It is understandable that migrants should be able to demonstrate that they have good knowledge of English language by passing the English test at B1 level. Current pass rate of Life in the UK test is very low as Home Office has made it tougher and tougher from past few years. English people who are born and bread in the UK even don't know most of these answers. Life in the UK test is completely unfair.",
