The size of the population has implications for many aspects of our lives including energy consumption, the environment, housing, transport, schools, hospitals, food, water etc. Maybe the gradual phasing out of child benefit should be considered as a start? I don't have any answers to over population but I would like to hear the views of our politicians.",
