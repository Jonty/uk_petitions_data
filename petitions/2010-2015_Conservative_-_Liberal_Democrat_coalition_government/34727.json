        "additional_details": "Sri Lanka has yet to respond to the UN and UK's demand for an independant inquiry into the rape, execution and disappearance of 40.000 Tamil men, women and children in 2009 alone. Abductions and disappearances have actually increased since the end of the civil war in 2009 and one woman every 90 minutes is curently raped there with impunity. It maintains the largest military in South Asia at the IMF and World Banks expense (IE yours and mine) and the Police Force is no more than an extension of the military reporting to the Presidents brother the Defence Minister. Is it a fitting member of the Commonwealth, the President of whom our revered Queen is forced to shake hands and wine and dine regularly, the next time at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting scheduled to be held in Sri Lanka next time, or should it be forced to leave the Commonwealth until possible war crimes committed by its forces in 2009 are independantly investigated?
