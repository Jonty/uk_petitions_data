This means that the taxpayer is being forced to fund criminal and other illegal activities of individuals who KNOW that they are NEVER going to be held accountable or responsible for the outcome of their criminal acts.  IF WE ARE TO STAMP OUT CRIME IN THE NHS WE MUCH MAKE THOSE WHO COMMIT THE CRIME PAY THE PRICE - THE TAXPAYER SHOULD NOT PICK UP THE TAB EVERY TIME.",
