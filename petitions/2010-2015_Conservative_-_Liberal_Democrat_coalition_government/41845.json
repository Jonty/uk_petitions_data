This tax avoidance is anticompetitive and unfair to British companies who are headquartered in the UK and pay their fair share of tax. This petition calls on the government to make it illegal for companies who generate sizeable revenues in the UK to write down loses made in other countries or offset loses against profits made in the UK.",
