There are vast numbers of us willing to pay, but the big companies, Like Boots, Bupa and Lloyds refuse to administer to children, saying it is legislation stopping them (untrue).\r\n\r\nPlease help us to protect our children from this potentially fatal and easily preventable disease.\r\n\r\nOne solution might be to arrange for GP surgeries to provide vaccinations, for a similar fee, so we can protect our kids. Alternately, provide a Government-approved scheme for children via the major companies.\r\n\r\nPlease act fast, before another child dies for no reason.\r\n",
