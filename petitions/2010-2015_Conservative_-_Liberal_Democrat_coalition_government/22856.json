        "additional_details": "Right now, the US Congress is debating a law that would give them the power to censor the world's internet -- creating a blacklist that could target Youtube, WikiLeaks and even groups like Avaaz!\r\n\r\nUnder the new law, the US could force internet providers to block any website on suspicion of violating copyright or trademark legislation, or even failing to sufficiently police their users' activities. And, because so much of the internet's hosts and hardware are located in the US, their blacklist would clamp down on the free web for all of us.\r\n\r\nI urge FCO to bring this to international media attention and to bring this up in national and international forums as a matter of extreme urgency.",
