        "additional_details": "Twitter is a fun place where people can share ideas and thoughts. It has a fun little feature where you can put a hashtag before a word which can let you see who else has also put a hashtag before the word.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a fundamental flaw with the hashtag system. One cannot hashtag a hashtag. This is massively detrimental to the system as it reduces the fun factor and makes people who Tweet miserable.\r\n\r\nSigning this petition will show your support for lonely hashtags who can't find partners due to the fact that you cannot properly hashtag hashtags.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading, and I hope this issue can be looked into for the good of all Tweeters and of course, all single hashtags.",
