By greying the meaning/scope of avoidance, Government ministers are also greying what is lawful. A key duty of governing is to set clear boundaries and avoid ambiguities in the Law. Otherwise we have a failure of leadership and governance.\r\nGovernment should clearly lay out how the taxman will determine what is in and out the scope of tax law.\r\nMr Alexander has said 100 extra staff will be used to spot avoidance.  Mr Alexander should be called to the House to answer, \u201cWhy are you authorising the expenditure of public funds, to investigate tax avoidance? Why are you not using scarce HMR&C resources on tax evasion?\u201d Ministers must justify, correct, or clarify these matters, to ensure clarity for both governance, and ministerial direction to government departments.
