On many occasions in the newspapers you see families who have no intension of finding work, being payed to stay at home.\r\nThe streets of this country are dirty and graffiti is rife. I would propose a program in which benefit claimants must work to attain their benefits by cleaning up our streets. I believe there would be far fewer people who *cannot find work*. i also believe benefits should not be payed in cash but vouchers for food and clothing. Not alcohol, flat screens and cigarettes. The education system should also have more power to deal with disruption and institutionally challenge antisocial behaviour sooner than an ASBO. The NHS is also long due an overhaul, the essential employees are being punished while bureaucrats are rewarded there is a need for the reality of being profitable to be considered. Fully commit to our big society.\r\n\r\n",
