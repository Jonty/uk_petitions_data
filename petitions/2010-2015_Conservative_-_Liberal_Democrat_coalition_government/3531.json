However the risks from glass, debris, pedestrians not looking/listening, shopping trolleys, drivers who park on them, and the fact they are stop-start makes progress near impossible at times.\r\n\r\nIf we are to give cycling real progress in the UK these issues strongly need to be sorted out. Give us safe routes that work.",
