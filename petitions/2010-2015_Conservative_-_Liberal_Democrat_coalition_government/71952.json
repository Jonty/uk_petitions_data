        "additional_details": "Although animal testing is cruel and barbaric, it is an almost impossible task to abolish it from the UK for good. Therefore, this is our proposal to reduce and discourage animal testing:\r\n\r\nA percentage of all profits made from sales of products tested on animals is given to the RSPCA to help with the prevention of further cruelty to animals.\r\n\r\nThis would not only increase the money being put into the prevention of animal cruelty, but would also discourage the animal testing, as it would decrease the profit margins of the companies using animal testing.\r\n\r\nYour signature is one signature closer to bringing this to the attention of parliament. Help us to take one step closer to preventing animal testing.\r\nThank you ",
