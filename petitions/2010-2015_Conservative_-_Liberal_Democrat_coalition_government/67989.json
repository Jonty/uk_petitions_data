This petition widens the question to a general point. It should be the responsibility of the governement to check whether politicians in a position of responsibility, on select committees, have a basic grasp of the topic in hand. That is good governance, and is a responsibility of the government.\r\n\r\nThis point is triggered by the spotlight shone on this poor practice by David Tredinnick sitting on the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, as he clearly does not understand how science works. Any quick check of his statements in favour of astrology, homeopathy and the effect of the moon on blood clotting will confirm this.\r\n\r\nThis question is general, though triggered by a specific example. David Tredinnick's positions highlight a flaw in the current system and this should be fixed to avoid further problems.",
