        "additional_details": "We, as fans of the great game, appeal to the Government to request the Football Association to not give any further broadcasting contracts to ITV.\r\n\r\nTheir coverage is so poor they should actually be charged with bringing the game into disrepute.  There is massive evidence to show that whenever fans have a choice of viewing the same game on ITV or BBC then BBC wins by a mile every time. So why do ITV continue to be given games where there is no choice and spoil the fans' viewing.\r\n\r\nAdrian Chiles really knows very little about football and just comes out with pre-prepared, benign lines that show up his ignorance and belittles the discussion to no more than playground chatter.  The supporting cast of failed managers and ex-pros do little to raise the standard of the coverage.\r\n\r\nPlease FA, let's keep all live football on the BBC. Our national sport - our national broadcaster.",
