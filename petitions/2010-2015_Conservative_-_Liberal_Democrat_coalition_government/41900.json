        "additional_details": "After the shambles of the PCC elections which saw a turnout as low as 13-20%, it is time for a root and branch review of UK democracy. We, the undersigned, believe that apathy on a landslide scale is a real threat to our democracy.\r\n\r\nWe believe in the democratic principle and in the right to vote no matter your race, religion, or whether you're young or old or rich or poor, able, disabled, gay or straight.\r\n\r\nThe current system has failed and needs to be dragged into the 21st century. In order to ensure the survival and credibility of our democracy, we need the following reforms:\r\n\r\nThe right to vote for anyone aged 16 or over\r\n\r\nOnline voting for all elections\r\n\r\nOnline voting can be done securely and to reduce the cost of introducing such a system, it could even piggyback off existing secure online systems, such as online banking, which would have the advantage of verification of identity.\r\n\r\nMake it happen.",
