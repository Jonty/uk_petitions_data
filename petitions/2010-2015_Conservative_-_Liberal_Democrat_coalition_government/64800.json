        "additional_details": "Further to one of the leading groups of scientists investigating \"aluminium and human health\" concluding that aluminium contamination in baby formula is currently too high and should be reduced to the lowest possible level, the Government must legislate to ensure manufacturers reduce the amount of aluminium contamination present in formula. The same leading researchers claim exposure to aluminium has been linked to cancer and Alzheimers later on in life and that babies of less than six months are especially prone to absorbing aluminium and not being able to get rid of it. Unnecessary aluminium contamination must be reduced.",
