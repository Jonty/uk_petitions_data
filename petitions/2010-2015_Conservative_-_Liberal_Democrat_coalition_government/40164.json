        "additional_details": "There is an increasing trend amongst youngsters today to survive by drinking 3 or more cans of energy drinks (such as Red Bull or Monster) daily to be able to 'survive'. This is having a drastic effect on their ability to learn at school and to concentrate, or sleep and, hence, a detrimental effect on their health. By placing these with an age rating (of either 16 or 18) the damage to these youngsters would be avoided. I believe it is time to act now before too many more youngsters become addidcted to these.",
