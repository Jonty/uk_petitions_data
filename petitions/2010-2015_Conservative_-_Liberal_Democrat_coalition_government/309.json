        "additional_details": "There are about 24 tolls in England and Wales (there are none in Scotland or Northern Ireland) that drivers have to pay to use certain roads or river crossings including at Dartford, the Severn, the Mersey and the Humber.\r\nAs all drivers in Britain pay the Government around one billion pounds a week in fuel and other taxes, it is unfair that drivers, by the accident of where they live, have to pay more when they travel to work or to visit their families or go to shops and hospitals etc.\r\nTolls are a very inefficient form of tax and their collection causes delays, congestion and increased pollution.\r\nTolls harm the economy in the areas where they are located as they create a barrier to free movement for people and businesses.\r\nThe Government should remove all the tolls. To do this they would also have to acquire, at a fair price, privately owned tolls such as the M6Toll.\r\nWe realise that the Government currently has a deficit, but the benefits to the economy would outweigh the costs.",
