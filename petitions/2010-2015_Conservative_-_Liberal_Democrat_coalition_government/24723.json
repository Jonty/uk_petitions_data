        "additional_details": " The government is 'encouraging' more free schools and academies to be created. There is no evidence that these schools improve results and they break links with the local community i.e. academies only have to have one parent governor. We feel this is bad for the teacher parent relationship and could lead to important decisions being made without parent being fully consulted. In addition to this teacher's pay and conditions aren't insured and we feel no teacher should work in a state of limbo as regards to their pay. We are calling upon the government to scrap their academies and free schools programmes and their destruction of the education system. ",
