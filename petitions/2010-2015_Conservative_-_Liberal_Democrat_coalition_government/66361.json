        "additional_details": "To stop the trend in business today of issuing no payrises to their hard working staff and taking advantage of the down turn in the job marketing making it harder for people to go and find another job if they are unhappy with the one they have giving them 'no option' but to put up with it.\r\n\r\nI want government to introduce a compulsory inflation payrise which all firms have to pass to their staff yearly, and then if the firms deems fit they can also have extra performance rises.\r\n\r\nStaff are being wrung out to dry by greedy firms wanting more profit and taking advantage of staff by insisting they do more work for no reward. This system exists in Belgium and as an employee of a world wide company it is frustrating knowing someone in the same sector and company as me gets a standard payrise while we get nothing.",
