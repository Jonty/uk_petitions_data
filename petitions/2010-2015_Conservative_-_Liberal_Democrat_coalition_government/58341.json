        "additional_details": "Following the conviction of Marine A there is sufficient concern to call for a review of the armed forces Court Martial system.  It is clear from this case that a jury formed of serving members of the armed forces, aligned in rank seniority and presided over by a former senior member of the armed forces is unable to provide the independence of thought so common in the crown courts.\r\n\r\nCan I request that you forward a call for the suspension of the armed forces court martial system for cases where, if found guilty, a defendant would be referred to a civilian prison and no longer a member of the UK armed forces.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that if armed forces members are to be discharged from the forces and/or housed in civilian institutions then they deserve the right to a civilian trial.\r\n\r\nI also note that the judge advocate Blacknett himself has voiced concerns over the legitimacy of the court martial system (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23003483).",
