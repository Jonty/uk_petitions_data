        "additional_details": "Ant-theft alarms create high levels of noise pollution. They are rarely acted upon, rarely set of for any real reason and are therefore ineffective. The noise, particularly in residential areas causes stress to those in hearing range and many car alarms are triggered simply by vibration of other passing cars, or gusts of wind. Silent alarms, linked to mobile phones are a more effective deterrent as thieves can never be certain whether they have been triggered.\r\n\r\nAudible alarms should only be for purposes requiring immediate emergency action, such as fire.
