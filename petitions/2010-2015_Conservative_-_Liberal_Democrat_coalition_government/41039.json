        "additional_details": "This petition is to make Banks to be taxed on the billions they make each year. People who put money there in the first place you should get a reasonable interest rate, But as it stands right now Banks make their money and don't pay any sort of tribute or reasonable interest rate to the people that makes the Bank operate in the 1st place. If everyone choose not to use a certain Banking Corporation and only use a Building Society, the banks would be out of business within a year.\r\nBy taxing every Bank in the country and abroad would raise trillions every year for science research, medical research, cleaner and more efficient energy ( rather than just keeping burning fossil fuels with can  diminish or the worst case scenario erase the human population through global warning). Although the government ( which is a Corporate body) is failing to maintain a stable state of continuous evolution towards mankind. ",
