Our lily-livered political electeds have abrogated their responsibility to protect their people against the preferential treatment foreigners gain through our membership of the EU - so much so that this country is now the planet repository for heinous criminals of all nationalities.  Foreigners are what they are, they should not be entitled to the benefits inferred upon the citizens of a land merely because they are here.  Treatment of a foreigner in his own land is NOT a matter of concern for people in this country.  Don't believe me? - give us a referendum on Europe where you will be given the resounding truth.",
