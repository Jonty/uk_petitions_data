        "additional_details": "In the heart of the Clyde Valley is a rich beauty of scenery and wildlife interests as well as several species of plant life. This can be enjoyed by walking the Clyde walk Way from New Lanark to Glasgow following the path of the River Clyde\r\nThe local town of Carluke sits high on the hill of the valley before descending down onto the walkway, one main route to the walkway is by the General Roy monument, this has now been blocked by the new landowners of Milton Lockhart Estate, who erected a fence to prevent local people gaining access to the Clyde Walkway. I would ask the Government to support South Lanarkshire Council is pursuing the landowners to open up the access path and allow the area to be accessible by all who wish to use this path and enjoy the countryside.",
