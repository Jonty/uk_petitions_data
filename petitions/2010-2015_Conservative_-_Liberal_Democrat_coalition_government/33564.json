        "action": "Raise awareness of disability, and the way in which people with disabilities are marginalised and stigmatised by the media",
        "additional_details": "A disability is a physical or mental impairment that interferes with a person\u2019s ability to perform a task to the capacity considered normal for a human being. People with disabilities are often rejected from society for being different to the norm; this is reminiscent of the \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019 mentality that was prominent during the slave trade. This is totally unacceptable in the modern era, a time in which we are taught to have an unconditional tolerance and respect for everyone; no matter their culture, beliefs or impairments.\r\n\r\nIn order to challenge the media stigma and marginality associated with disability we need to raise awarness of the issue by getting this petition to 100,000 signatures, and therfore discussed in the House of Commons",
