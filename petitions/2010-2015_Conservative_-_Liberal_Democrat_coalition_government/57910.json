        "additional_details": "I appeal to the people of GB to demand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer scrap the plans to increase the retirement age beyond 65 years of age.\r\n\r\nThese plans are nothing short of theft and will deprive honest and hard working people from pension funds that they are entitled to receive and have budgeted to receive at 65, especailly individuals that have paid the minimum 30 years NI contribution for the full state pension.\r\n\r\nIf the pension pot is empty then this is down to Government mismanagement of funds and they need to look at other options to increase the pot and stop penalising the tax payer everytime.The propsed increases will also stop the youth of this country gaining full time employment becuase the older generation will still be working and therefore depriving the next generation of work.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to STOP these unfair Government changes from affecting YOUR future NOW - thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
