        "action": "The New Union facility time agreements are wholly inadequate",
        "additional_details": "The new facility time arrangements are wholly inadequate and not fit for purpose.  The unions undertake fundamental work on behalf of their members and the new agreements ensure that the employer has an unfair advantage in grievances and workplace code of disciplines.  This does not allow the employee appropriate support that is impartial and independent.  It also does not allow for union representatives to undertake workplace Health & Safety inspections that are essential to ensure employees are not placed at any undue risk.  The facility time agreements must be revisited and changed so that they are not rigid to pre-prescribed time limits and allow all the time that is necessary to support employees in their place of work.",
