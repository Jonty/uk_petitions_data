The current tv rates are not only daylight robbery but victimise the poorer patients who cannot afford to watch. Long term patients who are already without a wage due to being unable to work may also struggle or be unable to pay the costs. Many tv's dont work and it disgraceful that patients are charged through the night or when they are not watching tv.  THIS MUST CHANGE IMMEDIATELY ! ",
