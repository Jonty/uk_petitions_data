In doing so, the OFT indicates that the 'Competition Commission's analysis can also help inform the Financial Conduct Authority's work to determine whether to use its power to cap the cost or duration of credit once the transfer has taken place'.\r\n\r\n...DEMAND THE SECTOR IS REFERRED TO THE COMPETITION COMMISSION.\r\n",
