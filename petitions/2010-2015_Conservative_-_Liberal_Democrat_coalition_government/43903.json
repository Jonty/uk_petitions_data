        "additional_details": "We aim to stop unfair and unethical child labour occuring in third world countries as often, these children are denied their human rights, and consequently do not have a good quality of life. However, many of these children are forced into child labour in order to provide for their families and so have no choice in the matter. The children are denied many basic rights, such as the right to education, which we feel is incredibly important and should be available to every child.\r\n\r\nWe would like the Government to tighten the policies allowing UK companies to sell products which may have been manufactured using child labour so that it is made illegal to sell products manufactured in this way. Furthermore, we would like the Government to set up international schemes providing these children with other means of making money whilst also gaining an education. ",
