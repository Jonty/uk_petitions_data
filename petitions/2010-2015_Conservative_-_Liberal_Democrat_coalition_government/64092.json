        "additional_details": "I was born 13th August 1954  Female and under new laws to claim my state benefit will be July 2020.  Why is it that if I was born 13th August 1953 Female I would be able to claim my state pension November 2017.  Why is there a 3 year difference?  I am sure there are a lot of people including myself that would like a reason for this.\r\nI have read people live longer but I think you will find people in 1954 actually started work at 16 years of age!\r\n\r\nThe action I would like is to reduce the 3 Years and have pension paid sooner rather than later. Thankyou",
