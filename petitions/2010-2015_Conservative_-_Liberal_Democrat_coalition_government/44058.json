        "additional_details": "Goverment should look at creating more reservoirs which can be filled with piped water from swollen rivers which flood on a regular basis therefore containing the flooding problem for thousands of people. These same reservoirs can then supply drought hit areas by piping water in the dry times. This may be costly but so is building flood defences which then cause flooding elsewhere as the water still has to go somewhere. ",
