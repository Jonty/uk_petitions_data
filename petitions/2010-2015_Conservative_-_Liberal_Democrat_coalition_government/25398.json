        "additional_details": "The last few years has shown how personal debt has spiralled into sovereign debt crises, which now risk expanding into continental debt problems.\r\n\r\nFiscal policy is being seized from democracies in Europe setting a dangerous precedent. Bond markets are threatening nations that had nothing to do with the original debt. We have reached a precipice where debt liabilities are trampling on democracy and sovereignty.\r\n\r\n\"Give me control of a nation's money supply, and I care not who makes its laws\"-Mayer A. Rothschild\r\n\r\nThe world's taxpayers should not be accountable for the insurance of bad loans that they had no liability for, or we will one day wake enpoliticiand by debt created anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nPlease sign to agree that:\r\n\r\nAt the point where a sovereign nation becomes incapable of debt repayment, all unpayable debt owed by that nation, and debts owed by the lending entities relating to that debt, throughout the entire path of the debt tree, must be absolved from all accounts.\r\n",
