        "additional_details": "6 weeks is too long making it difficult for working parents to cover with childcare and few would consider going on holiday for that long.  Likewise 2 weeks at Christmas is not long enough for those with family in distance countries, like Australia and NZ, to visit them over Christmas without spending most of the holiday with jetlagged children. Most people would prefer to have a holiday to ANZ when it is winter in the UK and summer there.\r\n\r\nAlso, for those in the UK who suffer from SAD, more time to spend away in winter would be preferable.\r\n\r\nThis would give parents 2 options as to when they could take a long holiday abroad instead of this always being limited to summertime.  This would also make it easier on businesses who would lose less staff over the summer period.\r\n\r\n6 weeks is a long time to be away from school, the longer a child is away makes it more difficult on them when they return as the routine of school is a more distant memory.",
