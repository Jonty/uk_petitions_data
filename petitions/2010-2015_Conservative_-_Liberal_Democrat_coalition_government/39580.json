        "additional_details": "We want street lights to be on all the way through the night to ensure that crime can not happen so easily but more importantly to ensure the safety of the people of Bexley (especially women). We feel that this is something that is important because it is street safety and figures show a reduction in crime when lights are on. It also makes people easier to identify if they committ a crime and allows CCTV a better chance of catching the offender. ",
