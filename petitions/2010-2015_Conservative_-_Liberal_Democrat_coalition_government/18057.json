This would produce more jobs and crack down on crime before the wanted person can do anything again. The Police are way to over stretched dealing with this. I think the Agent should have ONLY the information they need to arrest the wanted, and work in partnership with Police force in that area. Have the same laws set out for them as US bail recovery agents but what the Police says GOES!\r\n\r\nPlease sign if you agree with this.",
