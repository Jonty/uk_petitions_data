        "additional_details": "This petition has been written in the hopes of reversing the impending academy status of Marriotts School, in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. Parents, staff and students alike are concerned at the increasingly dangerous attitude of the government towards the education of our young people. Education is an important right for all,  and every last student in the country should be educated to the best of their ability. We feel that the needs of us as humans and as members of our society, and the desires of private businesses who exist for profit are mutually exclusive,  and a marriage of the two will merely undermine the vital education of the young people either attending Marriotts or other schools across the country.\r\n\r\nEvery week we see more schools nationwide unfortunately embrace academy status, and all of us - with various connections to Marriotts School - strongly disagree with this happening in our case.",
