If a camp was tough, it would offer everything needed to turn a  RIOTER around and give him/her discipline, respect for authority and self-esteem unrelated to gang culture, bling, phones, guns, and drugs.  It's the simple therapy of hard work, imposed demands and structure.  Boot camps would be cheaper than schools or prisons and get better results for those who are hanging off the edge of society and desperately in need of someone to care enough to tell them what to do and how to do it.  AND the camps would create jobs.  ",
