The current chance of surviving an SCA in UK is only 6% but immediate access to a defibrillator can raise this chance to 74%.\r\nI therefore believe strongly that defibrillators should be mandatory in all schools.  This should be a piece of compulsory health and safety equipment fitted in all schools.\r\nPlease sign this petition today to ensure the safety of children in our schools, where they spend a large part of their everyday lives.\r\nThank you so much ",
