        "additional_details": "Highly exploitative aspects of Television broadcasters the way they work with contributors for TV shows.  1920's Musicians would be paid a few dollars to make a single and in some cases sell millions, the Artist only paid a small fee.   We now consider this wrong and companies such as PRS look after Artists. I'm an Artist and performer and have entertained millions of people, my work has been in books, adverts, dvds, sold around the World and repeated on TV. As a Contributor to shows like Blinddate and Come dine with me. Contracts signed gives ITV and Channel 4 100% rights to your material, image to do with as they please. They profit hugely from the material. Whilst its sold around the world and used in anyway the companies wish.  Making a huge profit whilst the Contributors get nothing in return. my aim to try and make a change in the industry to look after the rights of the contributors.  Making sure their work is looked after by a TV version of PRS.\r\n\r\n",
