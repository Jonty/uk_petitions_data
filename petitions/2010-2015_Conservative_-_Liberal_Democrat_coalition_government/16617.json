Once signatures go over 100,000 \u2013 as has been the case for a petition for cutting benefits for rioters as well as one seeking the release of documents on the Hillsborough disaster \u2013 the issue is supposed to be debated by the House.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the group that is supposed to get a chance to discuss the issue, the Backbench Business Committee of MPs, is complaining that it hasn't been given it any extra time to deal with e-petitions.\r\n\r\nWe need to the government to actively debate all e-petitions that reach the threshold.\r\n\r\nTo not debate them, is to bring into doubt the democracy that we supposedly have in the UK.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
