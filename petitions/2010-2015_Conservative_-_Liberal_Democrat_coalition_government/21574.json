        "additional_details": "In this day and age our children in primary and secondary schools are still being offered and fed substandard school meals.To make it all worse, local councils are subcontracting various catering companies who employ evasive techniques, such as computer meal analysis, etc. to show how the meals are supposedly balanced and nutritious. The truth is that in many schools across England all vegetables are cooked from frozen, no fat is used at all in cooking,meat and fish dishes are re-heated, not cooked from scratch, puddings are prepared from powder mixtures, margarine is spread on low quality bread, food is served almost cold...It is time to stop this scandalous practices and give our children better meals in schools and bring England in line with majority of developed and less developed countries, where children meals are of a much better standard.",
