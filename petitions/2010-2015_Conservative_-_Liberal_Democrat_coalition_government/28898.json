        "action": "Reform the Honours System with stricter criteria by Elliott Adair",
        "additional_details": "We petition HM Government to reform the honours system to ensure that government have stricter criteria in it's selection of individuals for honours including knighthoods. So that honours are no longer dished out and treated as hand outs for those favoured by governments.\r\n\r\nThe aim should be to ensure that honours are indeed for honours (above and beyond) and not for doing a job or for length of service. It is wrong that individuals are honoured for doing a job, when millions of people do their jobs and are not honoured.\r\n\r\n",
