They are a group of incredibly clever and charming politicians, David Cameron being most of all.\r\n\r\nThe polls say it all...Labour are by rights the most popular and supported party in the United Kingdom...Why shouldn't they have overall power, as the people want? Give it up Cameron, hand over the baton, and let Labour do the rest. Our faith is gone, not that I myself had much faith to begin with, but the public have spoken. It's time for the Tories to go.",
