For an example, if a lenders terms and conditions of a consumer credit agreement state they can charge you \u00a350 a day for late payment, as long as the lender has followed the Agreement, the FOS will not uphold a complaint that they are unfair or unlawful.\r\n\r\nThe FOS can make up their own rules as they go along and defeats the purpose for what it was set up to do: An Informal Alternative to court with no time constraints where you do not have to meet the other side.\r\n\r\nThe Adjudicators are untrained, very few with any sort of Legal Qualifications and come from a variety of backgrounds including Finance and Banking.",
