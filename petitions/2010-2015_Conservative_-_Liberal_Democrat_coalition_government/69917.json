        "additional_details": "The Bank of England provides central banking services for the United Kingdom, not just England. The recent Scottish independence referendum has also highlighted a level of negative feeling from some areas regarding the union of the United Kingdom, with some individuals feeling that England is disproportionately represented. The name of the Bank of England would seem to support this feeling.\r\n\r\nThis petition promotes the changing of the name of the Bank of England to something more reflective of the union it operates within.",
