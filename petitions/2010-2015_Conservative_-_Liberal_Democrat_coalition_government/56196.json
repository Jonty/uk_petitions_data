Rapist, Murderers, Peadophiles, Vandalism, low life scum who pray on the weak and innocent stealing at knife/gun point. It is about time we brought back real punishment for real crimes. The Goverment need to stop working on statistics and remember every person and family who is affected by these crimes are traumatised physically, emotionally and mentally.\r\nIf you are with me share this and get signing to protect our community ",
