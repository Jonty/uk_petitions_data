        "additional_details": "An e-petition to save the remaining buildings of the original Whittingham Hospital from demolition for 650 houses and an industrial area. We believe that due to the historic significance of Whittigham Hospital and the damaging environmental hazard that the re-development poses, it is best for the area to retain its heritage and make the most of it. The plans violate regulations set by the Council themselves in 2004 under the 'Local Plan - Development in the Countryside' document part 5.17 and Policy DC2 and the development would take place on \u2018Green Belt\u2019 land. Each of the buildings have contributed to the vibrant history of treatment for the mentally-ill and the world wars.\r\n\r\nThe government must stop this re-development from taking place due to the obvious environmental damage it poses.",
