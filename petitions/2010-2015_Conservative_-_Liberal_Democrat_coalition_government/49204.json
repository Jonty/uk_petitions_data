        "additional_details": "We the people of Britain ask the Government to see sense and to STOP the Benefit cuts, this is in direct violation of those people who are on benefits for a reason. Cutting Housing Benefit and Council Tax from those on \u00a353 per week is wrong as it is not enough for them to live on each week. If you add up what needs to be paid out currently it would show that a normal person living in britain would really be living on \u00a30 per week under the current system that the government has put in place an example is shown below\r\n\r\nIncome:\r\nBenefit: \u00a353\r\n\r\nOutgoings:\r\nWeekly Shopping \u00a315\r\nBedroom Tax \u00a314\r\nWater Rates \u00a38\r\nGas \u00a310\r\nElectric \u00a310\r\nHousing Payments (overpayments) \u00a37\r\nCurrent total \u00a364\r\n\r\nTo live on per week \u00a3-11 (Minus \u00a311)\r\n\r\nIt is time for the government to see that taxing the poor and cutting their benefits is wrong. Give the poor and those on benefits a break and re-instate the full benefits with immediate effect",
