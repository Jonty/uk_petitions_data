I understand that this is not for the first time that this man has aired threats and massages of hate and intimidation openly while on the British soil. This a matter of grave concern for millions of people here in the UK and abroad.\r\nThese activities mount to criminal offence that should be dealt with according to the law but this man has never been tackled by the law enforcing agencies and he continues to use UK as a safe heaven.\r\nI therefore request you, that in the greater public interest and safety and to uphold the rule of law, kindly look into this as matter of urgency.\r\n",
