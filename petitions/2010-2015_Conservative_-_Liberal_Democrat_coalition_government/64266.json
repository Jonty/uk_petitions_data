        "additional_details": "Gender Biased Laws like 498a, child custody and domestic violence have become tools of legal extortion in India. Blatant violation of Human Rights is taking place, while political will is at its weakest. Corrupt legal system is making matters worse. Words of wife are taken Prima facie and husband & his family can be arrested under such laws. The situation is also affecting residents of Indian origin in UK & negatively impacting their work and life. Many such UK residents travel to India and get trapped in false cases. We request the Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister to help:\r\n1. Offer travel advisories like in USA for people travelling to India.\r\n2. Offer options to fight false cases and punish misusers of the laws.\r\n3. To discuss with Indian counter-parts, to make laws gender neutral, to stop its abuse.",
