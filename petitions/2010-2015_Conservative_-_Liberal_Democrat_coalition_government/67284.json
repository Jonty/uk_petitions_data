        "additional_details": "Police, NHS, Firefighters and other Key Workers are being priced out of London.\r\n\r\nThe average key worker makes about \u00a330,000 a year and often has to spend over half of their salary to live in reasonable quality accommodation a reasonable distance from their place of work. The average property in London costs over 15x the annual salary of a Key Worker.\r\n\r\nMuch of the original accommodation used for this purpose has been sold off. New accommodation is vital not only for quality of life for Key Workers but would ensure Key Workers could get to to their place of work quickly to respond to a Major Critical Incident\r\n\r\nI Propose:\r\n-Build new Key Worker accommodation, that is reasonably priced, is in accessible and central locations and is suitable for not only single persons but for families also.\r\n\r\n-In the same way the Councils are responsible for ensuring social housing is available borough residents, the same should apply to Key Workers who need to be near their places of work.",
