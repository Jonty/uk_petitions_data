        "additional_details": "Skin cancer is one of the fastest growing disease in the UK..Yet there is not enough warning or precautions! There are millions of children that are vulnerable to over exposure of sun rays but yet we have to pay high price for protection against the suns damaging rays. When the cost of a product can be so minimal but be so effective then there is no need for sun cream companies to make such a large profit!  Skin cancer hospital admissions leap by 40%!!! More than 13,000 people each year are being diagnosed, the rate is increasing but yet not enough prevention that can be easily solved with sun cream, protection and good awareness of exactly how deadly this is.  I just ask and pray for a change that can make a difference to over 2,000 lives a year that are lost from simple sun protection which should be available to all.\r\n For the small price for sun protection will surely out way the price of the huge cost to the NHS for treatment of skin cancer.PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE!",
