        "additional_details": "Please ban animals being sold or advertised on selling pages on social networking sites. Animals are being treated as disposable items that can be easily sold on when no longer wanted.\r\nBreeding is becoming an even more serious business as animals are easily sold. This is causing over breeding when animal rescue centres are already full.\r\nThere is currently a huge rise in animals being used for fighting and bate which is being fueled by the ease of access to animals.\r\nAnimals would hopefully have more of a chance of going to a life long, safe home if some thought had research had gone into finding them. Not just seeing a cute picture on a local selling site that you could pick up that same day on the spur of the moment.\r\nBy reducing the quickness of being able to get a pet we would also reduce the amount of illegally imported animals being brought into our country.\r\nEbay bans the selling of animals, so please stop other auction and networking sites..\r\n",
