        "additional_details": "The contribution made by the automotive and motorsport industries to the British economy is hugely significant. We profess to support a rebalancing of the economy and a drive towards hi-tech manufacturing, but in reality the UK automotive sector has largely stagnated over the past ten years. Motorsport allows the industry to showcase it's best talent, and F1 commands significant audience shares in the UK, partly thanks to the fantastic coverage by BBC. F1 may be an expensive sport, but we must continue to showcase our best talents in this sector, and allow the world to see that British engineers remain the best in the world, while encouraging new entrants.  \u00a3 for \u00a3, keeping F1 free to air is good value for the British economy. It's time we did something for the automotive and motorsport sectors.  It's time to get our priorities right within the BBC.  It's not time to give up the BAFTA award-wining, 43% audience share grabbing Formula 1 coverage.  Keep F1 free to air on the BBC!",
