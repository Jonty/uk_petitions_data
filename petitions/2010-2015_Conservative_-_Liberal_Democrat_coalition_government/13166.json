Some meters are used as a local hub to the neibourhood and are even more hazardous than the standard. In shared buildings with many meters in a group, with a family the otherside of the wall there are likely to be instant health concerns.\r\nThey are also an intrusion into our private lives to an unprecedented degree.\r\nAll properties must be fitted with these devises by 2020 by government decree - this must be debated again especially in relation to the health issues and stopped.
