        "additional_details": "Over the years there has been much speculation into the possibility of merging the fire and ambulances services in the UK. In this part of the world these services are fundamentally different, and this proposition threatens both services alike. Any threat puts the public in danger and a collapse would lead to privatisation.\r\n\r\nThe ambulance service does attend incidents with the fire service, such as road traffic collisions and house fires, but for the ambulance service this accounts for only a fraction of their work load. The rest of the time they are treating medically ill people and other times of crisis in the community, and many would suffer from a decrease in the care that they bring.\r\n\r\nBoth services have improved year on year, although the UK media wouldn't have you believe it. Help to save both of these incredible services of ours and sign.",
