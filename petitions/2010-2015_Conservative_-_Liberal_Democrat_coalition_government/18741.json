        "additional_details": "This petition requests the removal of Robbie Savage from all BBC broadcasts related to coverage of Association Football.\r\n\r\nMr Savage continuously engages in deliberate antagonistic sensationalist public behaviour. His journalistic output on publicly funded broadcast is ill researched, perpetuates factual inaccuracies and is often fictional. He is not suitable for public broadcast.\r\n\r\nThe government has an obligation to protect the general public from known misinformation in the media and to promote basic standards in publicly funded industries and corporations such as the BBC.\r\n\r\n\r\n*This is not a personal attack on Mr Savage, only a campaign for the public to highlight their dissatisfaction and request an improvement in the publicly funded BBC coverage of the most popular sport in the UK. The BBC regrettably does not offer a forum for public democratic expression.",
