        "additional_details": "The National Lottery has and remains the Government's personal piggy bank to fund its pet projects, which have a limited audience in spite of national spectrum of contribution.  To date the Royal Opera House, which is often frequented by the wealthy, has received a total contribution of \u00a378.5 million.  The National Lottery has now pledged a staggering \u00a32.175 BILLION of funds for the Olympics, collected under the guise of \u201cGood Causes\u201d, in spite of the majority of UK citizens being unable to obtain tickets.\r\nIf \u00a32.175 billion was allocated to the NHS perhaps we would not have such long waiting lists for certain procedures?  The government must no longer be allowed to dip into OUR funds to pay for projects it cannot afford and deprive REAL good causes.\r\nThe definition of good causes must be refined and a reasonable capping applied for the maximum amount that may be allocated to a single good cause.",
