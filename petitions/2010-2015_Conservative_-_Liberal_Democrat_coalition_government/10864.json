        "additional_details": "In light of the recent disorder in the UK, it is clear that concrete steps need to be taken by the government to address the issues of violent disorder and looting, particularly the consequences of young persons engaging in such criminality.\r\n\r\nThe very moving speech made by Mr Jehan, only a day after his son, along with two friends were killed, demonstrates how in touch he is with the workings of society. His comments have stuck a chord with ordinary law abiding persons up and down this country. The prime minister and media have commented favourably on his statements. Senior police officers have also acknowledged that his statements have prevented further disorder occurring in Birmingham.\r\n\r\nVery simply, make him the Young Persons/Youth Czar and see the effect his presence could have on the attitudes and behaviour of young persons. If some good is to come out of this tragedy, i believe we should seize the moment and show he can make a positive impact on young people. ",
