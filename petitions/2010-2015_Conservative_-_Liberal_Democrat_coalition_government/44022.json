Further to this, it has been shown from data of over 850,000 incidents that darker colour cars are much more likely to be involved in an accident.\r\n\r\nOn the premis of these data, it would make absolute sense that cars, (not cyclists) should be sporting hi-vi, and reflective colours.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.monash.edu.au/miri/research/reports/muarc263.pdf\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ctc.org.uk/file/public/pedestriansbrf_2.pdf",
