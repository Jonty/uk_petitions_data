        "additional_details": "The proposal to limit Contribution Based ESA for those in the Worked Related Groups in unfair.\r\n\r\nThis prosed change means that people who have made the effort to work and have paid contributions, some for more than 40 years,  are being treated unfairly, as those who have never contributed will continue to receive benefits.  This makes a nonsense of the whole system as hard-working people who may have lived a modest life in order to have a self-sufficient retirement will be forced to live off savings.\r\n\r\nOne of the particularly incidious elements of the this proposal, unlike others, is that this change to benefits will be backdated, so that some people will suddenly find themselves no longer eligible benefits from April 2012.\r\n\r\nThe Government needs to remove this new proposal immediately as it is bltantly unfair and will impact once again on people who have worked hard to save and not rely on the State for support.\r\n\r\n",
