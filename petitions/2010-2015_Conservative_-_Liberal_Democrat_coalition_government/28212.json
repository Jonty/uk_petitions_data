        "additional_details": "The House of Lords have voted NOT to fully support the Governments Welfare Reforms and CAP the maximum benefits any one family can receive.  This is a disgraceful act and serves only to confirm that they are completely out of touch with the majority of the population in the United Kingdom.  The Government should therefore abolish the House of Lords. By supporting this petition we, the people, can make change happen.",
