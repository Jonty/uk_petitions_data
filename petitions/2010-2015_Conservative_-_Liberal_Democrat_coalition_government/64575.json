I disagree with these groups \"demanding\" that food outlets have halal only options. I am all for these people to have their own beliefs and if they wish they should have a halal \"option\" but my beliefs and needs are just as important as theirs.\r\n\r\nIf i walk into a subway / KFC i want to be able to have ham, bacon pork products if i choose too. They shouldnt be allowed to force the UK government to put pressure on companies to remove these products.\r\n\r\nPlease sign to get our god given right to eat pork put back on menus across the UK. As i said im all for them having the option of halal but why should we then miss out on pork when we want it???",
