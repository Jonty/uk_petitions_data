        "additional_details": "North Korea is known to have nuclear weapons, has provoked South Korea numerous times and is extremely volatile. Their actions can and will affect the UK. We, as signers of the UN Human Rights Bill, have a duty to condemn North Korea for their imprisoning and murder of millions of their own people. My proposal is for the Government to pay far more attention to the North Korean issue, act upon working closer and building our relationship with China in order to force human rights to the North and stability on the Korean peninsula to ensure the UK's future safety, the safety of the North Korean people and to prevent need for future military action.",
