From next season we have to sit at home on a sunday bored because we cannot afford Sky Sports. I'm 18 and i'm in full-time education and i love formula one watch every race, every weekend and with the new deal i will not be able to see half of the races which has made me totally gutted. It feels like none of the sports i follow are now on FTA television. Which isn't right.",
