        "additional_details": "Our legislators legislate for the public good.\r\n\r\nThe current system of a \"free for all\" where penalty charges are issued like raffle tickets by public and private authorities and their sub-contractors to law abiding motorists needs to be addressed.  There is no regard as to whether the ticket is correctly justified leaving the motorist to run about to challenge the penalty charge or join in the culture of paying straight away at a reduced rate forfeiting the right to challenge the penalty charge.\r\n\r\nThe action I want the government to take is introduce a law in the United Kingdom whereby public and private authorities should be fined a mandatory fixed penalty charge for example GBP 100 when it is proved that they have issued a penalty charge notice incorrectly.\r\n\r\nThe revenue from this fine should be shared between the registered owner/keeper of the vehicle and HM Government.\r\n\r\n26 October 2012",
