        "additional_details": "The reasons I think trading these days should cease are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 When Sunday and Bank Holiday trading was first introduced retailers promised they were not mandatory days to work. Do you think you\u2019d be employed now if said you don\u2019t want to work Easter Monday?\r\n\r\n\u2022 Retailers have trapped themselves and their employees into working these days and ironically net profits are probably no greater than if they all remained shut.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The majority of Boxing Day, for at least one major high street store, is taken up with customers exchanging their presents for cash or other items!\r\n\r\n\u2022 If you view is, \u201cDon\u2019t do shop-work if you don\u2019t like the hours\u201d, please consider the increasing numbers of people grateful for whatever job they can find.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease extend your admiral UK benevolence toward shop workers by giving them (and you) some extra time to get out there and live life. In signing this petition, as with all selfless acts, you will feel happier as a result.\r\n",
