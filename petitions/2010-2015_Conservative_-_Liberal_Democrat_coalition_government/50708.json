        "additional_details": "I call for our Government to re-introduce capital punishment for all premeditated acts of murder and terrorism.  I believe that the United Kingdom is technologically advanced enough e.g. DNA profiling and responsible enough to decide where capital punishment can be applied.  Where the jurors or judge have no doubt as to the defendant's guilt, then the prosecutor has proven the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and the defendant should be pronounced guilty.  I feel that in this case the death penalty should be applied for all premeditated acts of murder and terrorism. ",
