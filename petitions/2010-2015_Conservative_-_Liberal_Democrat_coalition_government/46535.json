        "additional_details": "The Public Service Pension\u2019s Bill, currently being debated in parliament, has an exemption for Fire & Police Services to receive their pension at age 60, rather than seeing their retirement age rising with state pension age. The Ministry of Defence Fire & Rescue Service and Police were not included in this exemption, due to an oversight when the original pension reform report was written. Lord Hutton, who was the author of the pension reform report, on which this Bill is based stated that if he had known of the MoD Fire & Police Services he would have specifically included them as uniformed services in his final report, giving them equal status on pension age.  The Government should give us parity with our counterparts, so that the MoD Fire & Police Service have a normal pension age of 60 rather than rising along with the state pension age. Therefore we are calling on the Government to treat us fairly and equally and allow us to receive our pension at age 60.",
