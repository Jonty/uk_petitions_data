A lack of opportunity for the disadvantaged young is undoubtedly a causal factor for social unrest and we have recently witnessed.\r\n\r\nHaving interns drawn from socially deprived parts of the population will show by example a cultural change needed in the UK where those at the top directly help and engage with those at the bottom.\r\n\r\nSocial mobility exemplified by hiring well to do next door neighbours sons as interns is no longer acceptable.",
