        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, urge the government and road safety minister Stephen Hammond to scrap any plans for an increase in the speed limit for HGVs on single-carriageway roads, as it poses a significant threat to the safety of British citizens.\r\n\r\nThe government is considering increasing the speed limit for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) from 40mph to up to 50mph with a decision being made by February 1 2013.\r\n\r\nIf a car is hit by a HGV, the occupants have little or no chance of surviving. Innocent drivers, their families and children will be victims.\r\n\r\nEvidence shows any increase in speed limits results in an increase in deaths.\r\n\r\nRoad safety charities are furious the government is considering the move, mirroring the views of the pro-HGV Road Haulage Association and other HGV lobbying companies and not those of road safety experts.\r\n\r\nWe urge the government and Mr Hammond to cease any plans to pursue an increased limit for trucks on single-carriageway roads to save lives.",
