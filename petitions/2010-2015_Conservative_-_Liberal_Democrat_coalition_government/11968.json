        "additional_details": "The eviction of unconvicted rioters from their council properties punishes those who have not been found guilty of any crime.\r\n\r\nIn addition, some council tenants, including the first tenant to be served with an eviction notice, face eviction on the basis of acts allegedly carried out by their family members. To punish a person who has not been accused of any crime is surely grossly unfair.\r\n\r\nThese evictions also punish council tenants in a way that is not possible for private tenants or home-owners, creating a two tier justice system.\r\n\r\nThe eviction of council tenants as punishment for their alleged crimes will only create a displaced and angry underclass, exacerbating the issues which lead to the unfortunate incidents of the past week.\r\n\r\nWe demand equal justice for all, and a measured and thoughtful response to these issues. No more evictions of accused rioters.",
