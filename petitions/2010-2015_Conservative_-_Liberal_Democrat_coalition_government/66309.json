Failure to react would have massive ramification for the citizens of iraq and neighbouring countries, just as was seen after the first Gulf war and would imminently threaten any progress achieved in Afghanistan. We owe this response to every man, woman and child who lost their lives attempting to deliver democracy in this most fragile of territories.",
