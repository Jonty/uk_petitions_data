        "additional_details": "I would like to see the existing taxation of fuel changed to a much more simple pence per litre figure rather than the existing percentage fuel duty PLUS VAT method. The existing method multiplies the effects of crude oil price increases during these turbulent times, and also allows retailers to hide behind tax and fuel duty reasons when fuel prices don't go down when crude oil does.\r\n\r\nI believe that making this change would be much more fair on both citizens and companies alike. Changing the fual taxation to a simple pence per litre figure rather than having percentages on top of percentages like now would protect people from crude oil price shocks.\r\n\r\nI believe simplifying fuel taxation would also lead to more competition in this sector and would also make collecting these taxes more simple for the government.",
