Rather than being taught traditional humanist values to support the society which is supporting them, children are being given every opportunity to escape responsibility. The problem we currently have is due to generations of benefit dependency culture. I suggest we  make parents criminally and finically responsible for their offspring, as is done in some other countries to good effect!!\r\nI'd be happy for someone to re-word this for me....but you get the idea?",
