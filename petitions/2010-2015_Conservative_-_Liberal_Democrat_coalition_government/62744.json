        "action": "Create a specialist police unit to seize dogs and arrest owners",
        "additional_details": "This is for introduction of a new police unit, nationwide, specialising in the seizure of mistreated or dangerous dogs, and the arrest and prosecution of the owners.\r\nEngland is beginning to lose it's grip on how dangerous dogs are seized, and how badly dogs are being bred.  Owners are interbreeding dogs, leaving the puppies with genetic defects and behavioural problems.\r\nThe local Dog Wardens do a great job, but their powers are limited, and they are needing to call for police more frequently.\r\nIt makes sense for the police to tackle it and begin to control it.\r\nThe US have their own police departments who focus on animal rescue/arrests of irresponsible owners, and it works.\r\nThe frequency of attacks/fatalities from dogs is alarming. The only way forward is law enforcement.\r\nPlease sign this petition and help restore our country and bring back our good name of animal lovers, and we can eliminate the bad ones. Thank you ",
