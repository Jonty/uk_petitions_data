It would be their's to live in for the rest of their life, to look after and to maintain but when they die the property reverts to the company because YOU DID NOT ACTUALLY OWN THE PROPERTY, THE COMPANY DOES!!!!\r\n\r\nThis practice is not regulated at all by the FSA or any other government organisation.  I want the Government to investigate this and to start forward thinking about what is quickly becoming one of the largest segments of our population?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
