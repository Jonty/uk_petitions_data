        "additional_details": "Having to participate in a court proceeding which is being filmed for the purpose of television is against an individuals human rights, whether that individual is a witness, jury member, criminal or defendant.\r\n\r\nSuch a move will result in individuals refusing to participate in court proceedings, making the courts a place for reality TV and not a fair place for justice.\r\n\r\nThis is a move that at some point could affect any member of the UK public.  As such and within a supposed democratic country a law like this should not be passed without a majority of public support.\r\n\r\nThis petition asks the government to review its stance on televising court proceedings and at the very least create a referendum to seek whether there is public support for such a move.\r\n\r\nIf it is found that public support is not given, this view of the public should be the deciding factor on whether such a law is passed.\r\n",
