        "additional_details": "The Youth Service is being re-organised with closure of youth centres based on school sites.\r\n\r\nOne of the suggestions is to close Stoke Park Youth Centre down.\r\nThis mean there will be no youth clubs or projects running at the centre during the day, after school, in the evenings or during school holidays.\r\n\r\nIf the SPYC closes down there is a worry of where the youth will go and what will they do but also who will they turn to for help if/when needed, as there are no other youth centres in this area!\r\n\r\nThe SPYC has supported a lot of youth over the years and we need this to continue! The youth centre and workers play a big part in community and young people and their families..\r\n\r\nThe cuts are being made in the wrong places, the decision to close SPYC and other centre are not being made for the youths benefit",
