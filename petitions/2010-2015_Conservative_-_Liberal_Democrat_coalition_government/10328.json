        "additional_details": "The Liberal Democrats have gone back on every word of their General Election manifesto but have also influenced the Conservatives negatively in denying us the following:\r\n\r\n1: Vote on membership of the EU\r\n2: A debate on tuition fees\r\n3: A debate on immigration issues\r\n4: A debate on multiculturalism\r\n\r\nInstead this coalition have given us\r\n\r\n1: A pointless referendum on FPTP or AV\r\n2: A liberal/non conservative government we did not ask for.\r\n3: A referendum where 70% of a 37% turnout voted for more powers for Wales and should've been invalidated.\r\n4: More money for Bankers\r\n5: Riots on the streets\r\n6: A biased left wing BBC.\r\n7: Paying more money to the EU\r\n\r\nNeed I go on. I call for the Liberal Democrats to be kicked out of Government because they are enforcing more than they should in this Government where I have listed above plus the fact that we did not vote them in to power. If this can't happen then we should call for a General Election",
