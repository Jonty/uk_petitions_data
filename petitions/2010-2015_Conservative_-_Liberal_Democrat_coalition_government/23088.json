        "additional_details": "Ticket touts exploit fans of sport, music, theatre and other live events \u2013 as well as the hard work of the businesses, organisations and charities putting on those events - by buying up large amounts of tickets to sell on at an inflated price, mainly over the internet. We therefore call on the Government to take action to make sure that the ticket market works in the interests of fans first, the industry second, and touts last.",
