By their actions they caused the death of 6 children and a sentence of 17 years (of which they may only serve half) is not enough.  That equates to just over 2 years for each child's life.  What message does this send out to others.  The sentence should be life with parole only considered after 20 years served. ",

It also only takes one person to make such a request.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Phillpot, Phillpot and Mosley, the Attorney General\u2019s Office has already requested the papers from the Crown Prosecution so one of the Law Officers can decide whether or not to refer the sentences to Court of Appeal as being unduly lenient."
