        "additional_details": "It is acknowledged that there is a need to cut the cost of the prison service and it's related departments. I would suggest that it would be prudent by the Ministry of Justice to apply a opportunity for all staff to retire on full pension after serving 25 years within the service, thus giving the MOJ a chance to reduce costs by employing lower paid recruits. The stress of working with offenders is increasing as time goes on and the numbers of staff on the landings is reducing. I would ask that all colleagues sign this petition to give us the same opportunities as other public servants, do not forget we give the prisoners all the care they need to get bigger and stronger through the gym system and at 68 I do not want to be faced with an aggressive and built up young person who wishes to hurt myself and colleagues.",
