        "additional_details": "At present Child Support claimants are not means-tested, and those being claimed against are not being allowed to contest claims due to affordability. The purpose of the CSA shpuld be to ensure that children are adequately provided for, but if a claimant is sufficiently well-off to support any children living with them, whilst the person against whom they are claiming can barely afford to live, then this shpd be taken into consideration. In many cases a mother secures a very favourable divorce settlement, meaning they have no mortgage to pay. A claimant could effectively be a millionaire, whilst their former partner barely earns enough to survive, often with children to support themselves (possibly children shared with the claimant if the children are split between parents), yet the CSA will still take a percentage of the second person's income. The current system is NOT in the best interests of children involved in the case.",
