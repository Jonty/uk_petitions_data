        "additional_details": "Advice in which advisers/counsellors have financial interests about the need for a proposed medical treatment should be objective and free from conflicts of interests be they from private abortion providers, GP budget holders or dentists. Private profit making companies may give bias advice about the need, importance, relevance & effectiveness of the services they propose to provide. Take an analogy of a private company being given an open cheque to repair a car. If not properly supervised by the customer, this may result in creative accounting by the private company for performing unnecessary expensive work. Even frontline healthcare professionals who themselves (not the managers) interview & appoint new healthcare professionals may also develop services that duplicate and over-manned healthcare services. Not only do the politicians, Judges, executives, police, media need checks and balances, so do dentists, NHS professionals (like nurses) and GP budget holders.",
