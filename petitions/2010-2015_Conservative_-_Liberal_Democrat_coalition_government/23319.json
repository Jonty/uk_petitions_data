        "additional_details": "Certain events across the world have triggered a knee-jerk reaction from large governmental bodies to try and censor the internet- not just for vunerable parties- but for everyone. 'SOPA' is an American Act that is being debated at this moment in time about whether the internet should be controlled by companies and copyrights- but why should it? We have the freedom to say and do what we like- its part of our human rights! So let's not allow the same thing to happen in the UK. Vote NO against the censorship of the internet and of the future. If we do not say no now, then when?",
