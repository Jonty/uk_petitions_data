The DWP should take more notice of medical professionals who are treating disabled people.\r\nThe new changes are going to cost the Tax Payer more money and cause more stress to the vulnerable of society at a time of great financial strain.\r\nThe Govenment should make sure the most vulnerable are always protected with each benefit change.",
