DfID is another layer of bureaucracy that gives away a significant amount of money without necessarily linking into, and sometimes working against HMG aims.  Foreign Aid is a useful tool, but is not a means to an end, so should be a sub-section of the FCO, rather than a cabinet department on it's own.",
