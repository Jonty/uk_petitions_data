Currently the operator of the wind turbine is allowed to use electricity from the grid without paying for it.\r\n\r\nSome of the functions that use free electricity are:\r\nYaw mechanism, blade-pitch control, lights, controllers, communication, sensors, metering, data collection, heating the blades, heating and dehumidifying the nacelle, oil heater, pump, cooler, and filtering system in gearbox, hydraulic brakes, thyristors, magnetizing the stator and using the generator as a motor.\r\n\r\nAny electricity that is used from the grid should be properly metered and paid for by the operator of the wind turbine at the same price available to normal consumers.",
