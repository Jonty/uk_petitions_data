        "additional_details": "With the gates open to more countries joining the EU, the Government should consider ensuring all new immigrants to have to pay into the UK tax system before being eligible to claim benefits, eg 5 or 10 years, which should include no free access to the NHS until 5 or 10 years tax contributions. Alternatively, immigrants may choose to pay a lump sum equal to 5 or 10 years  tax contributions as would be expected if a UK citizen would be expected when emmigrating to another state's tax system.\r\n\r\nThis would help to ensure only those capable of supporting themselves in the 5 or 10 years could enter the UK. This in turn would remove the burden for supporting immigrants from the UK tax payer.\r\n\r\n",
