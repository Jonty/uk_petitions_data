From sleeping with friends spouses to spitting at people and now racially abusing other proffesionals (among many other scummy aspects of his personality).\r\n\r\nYou don't be a non-Chelsea fan or even like football at all to feel that this (so called) human being should not be in a position to be looked up to by thousands of impressionable young children and adults alike.\r\n\r\nEven more of a national disgrace is the fact that this appalling person is captain of England! He is the face and voice that represents our green and pleasant land, an ambassador of the national game abroad!\r\n\r\nThe sooner the man is banned from the beautiful game the better shape society will be in and more enjoyable all aspects of life will become.\r\n\r\nI hereby urge folks to sign and share on facebook, twitter, among friends, work colleagues, family etc.\r\n\r\nLets make this happen!",
