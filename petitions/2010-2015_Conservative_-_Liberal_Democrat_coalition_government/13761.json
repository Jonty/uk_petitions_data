This completely nullifies the point of the garage and my legal access and prevents me from getting to gigs which could potentially lose promoters 100s of \u00a3 if I'm driving the other acts.  Clamping wont give me access to my car and I cant afford to tow it.  I think I should have the legal right in this situation if the owner cannot be found to smash the driver near side window, release the handbreak and push the car out the way!",
