        "additional_details": "By banning the Niqab, the UK will be in violation of Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. I am unaware about how this can proceed despite UK being subjected to EU law. If this however occurs, let us not forget, the people should not be scared of the government, the government should be scared of the people.\r\nParliament is only sovereign due to the notion of rule of recognition. In other wards, if the courts and the people intend not to incline with this legislation, what chances do the government have to enforce it upon us? My sincere advice is to sing this petition as it is currently being discussed in the Parliament, so let it be abolished in the Parliament by signing this petition.",
