        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to call an election before the 1st January 2014.\r\n\r\nThe reason is simple. The UK is a democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2010, people voted for political parties. There was never an opportunity for the people of the UK to vote for(or against) the coalition agreement. The people of the UK did not vote for the present Governments policies and that must question the mandate that this coalition government has.\r\n\r\nAn example of this is Fixed Terms Parliaments:\r\nThe LibDems had it in there manifesto but not enough people voted for them.\r\nLabour had it in there manifesto but not enough people voted for them.\r\nThus, there is no mandate for fixed term parliament.\r\n\r\nYet it was included in the coalition agreement.\r\n\r\nIt should be the voters who decide how we are governed, not political parties.\r\n\r\nI call on all political parties and movements to support this campaign and let the people of the UK decide how we are governed.",
