Arresting those with minor amounts of cannabis, and LSD, as well as MDMA has cost the UK millions of pounds to enforce, while being shown that these three drugs have been proven time after time to be safer than tobacco and alcohol respectively.\r\n\r\nDebate on drug laws based upon scientific evidence is needed. Past drug laws have been passed upon the basis of mothers and news outlets calling for the ban due to a drug death that was never caused by these drugs, but instead a contaminant or its mixing with alcohol.\r\n\r\nReform on drug law should include the taxation and control of drugs such as Cannabis, LSD and MDMA, through government registered dispensaries, which could be taxed at a similar rate to that of tobacco products. Further laws could be put in place to help educate people.",
