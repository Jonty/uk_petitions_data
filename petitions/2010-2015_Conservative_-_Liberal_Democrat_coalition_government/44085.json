        "additional_details": "A huge problem in our economy at the moment is that banks arent lending to business because they are to  worried about making mistakes and losing money. The goverment is trying to encourage banks to lend and is devoting a lot of money to it, but it is having little to no effect. If the goverment was to give loans directly to business at low interest rates this would give business more money to invest increasing demand in the economy. It will also mean that there would be increased competiotion to banks and this means that they will need to lower interest rates and it lend more to make money further increasing investment",
