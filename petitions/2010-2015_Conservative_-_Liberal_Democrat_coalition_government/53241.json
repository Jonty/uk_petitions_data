        "additional_details": "Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Austria, Hungary, Lithuania, and Latvia all have laws regarding the first aid training of anybody operating a motor vehicle on the road. This includes a first aid kit in all vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe UK does not have any rules regarding a first aid kit, and/or first aid training during the process of learning to drive.\r\n\r\nThis petition proposes that basic first aid be mandatory for all new drivers & motorcyclists, and that a basic first-aid kit be stored in all road-going vehicles.",
