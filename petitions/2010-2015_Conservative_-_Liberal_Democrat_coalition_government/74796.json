Patients particularly on limited income, spend agonising time living with cancer.They can do with all the help and support to make their lives more tolerable.Young patients could face the prospects of their lives being extinguished before they realise what has hit them.As a rich,civilised society we can't just let people die in pain.lets get our priorities right and invest in improving patients quality of life, whats left of it!",
