        "additional_details": "In the wake of the death of PC David Rathband, who placed himself in harms way to protect all the decent members of public. It about time we started to realise what the hard working members of the emergency services do for this country. They really do not get paid enough for what they do for us. And when we have been assaulted, burgled, injured or trapped the first thing we do is call 999 and help comes.\r\nI believe that all frontline members of these services should receive a tax free pay increase of \u00a35000pa. This might seem a lot to some people but when you consider that the average wage of an MP is \u00a377000, even with this increase this would not bring any of the recipients close to the wage of an MP.\r\nThis would only be awarded to the members that are front of house public contact only.
