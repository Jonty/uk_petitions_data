        "additional_details": "Each year many newborns die from Asphyxia at birth or are left with severe brain damage and disabilities including cerebral palsy. Research into the use of cooling blankets where a newborns core body temperature is lowered to a mild hypothermia state for 3 days can lower the severity of brain damage and allows the body to heal itself. This treatment means the quality of a childs life can be improved significantly. Some babies like my own made a full recovery with no brain damage. This pioneering treatment should be made more aware to people and needs more funding to be able to progress and expand to more hospitals accross the UK. This treatment was pioneered byProfessors Marianne Thoresen and Andrew Whitelaw who continue their research.",
