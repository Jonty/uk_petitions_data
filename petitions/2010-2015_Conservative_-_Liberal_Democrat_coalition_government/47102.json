        "additional_details": "The NHS changes have been both promoted and fought as a national issue. However, they are actually part of the preparation for a corporate-interest US/EU Free Trade Agreement.\r\n\r\nHealthcare has been specifically mentioned as a form of trade to be included in the \u201charmonising regulation\u201d of the Agreement, which aims to prevent \u201cfuture trade barriers\u201d in keeping with the demands of transnational corporations.\r\n\r\nIncluding the NHS in such a deal will effectively turn a globally-respected universal health service into a cash cow for transnational investors. Once such a trade deal has been agreed, the resulting privatisation will be irreversible.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to ensure the NHS is exempted from the US/EU Free Trade Agreement as a condition of the UK\u2019s agreeing to participate.",
