Not only is that person not paying any tax or national insurance contributions in the UK due to the stated low income, they are making a mockery of the government.\r\n\r\nThe loophole in the system needs addressing in order to provide justice and fairness, not only for the resident parents, but also for those non-resident parents that declare their incomes and pay the correct amount of maintenance for their children. A tougher system needs to be implemented to stop those who are determined to find a way to shirk financial responsibility for their children.",
