        "additional_details": "For centuries, the United Kingdom has operated under the assumption that we have a constitution, albeit an unwritten one. This is based on the notion that Parliament can make any law whatsoever, and no court can challenge those laws. Although there has been development of so-called \"consitutional statutes\" such as the Human Rights Act, and the European Communities Act, the absence of a formal written constitution still allows our Parliament to enact any law that it sees fit which in modern Western civilisation is against the notions of democracy and liberty.\r\n\r\nThis petition is calling for a law should be enacted, and relevant reforms made, which restrict the powers of Parliament which are deemed to be 'unconstitutional' and the Supreme Court given the formal power to strike down any law made by Parliament deemed to be 'unconstitutional'.",
