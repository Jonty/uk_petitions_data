        "additional_details": "It has never been established whether certain people possess abilities such as predicting the future, yet people in desperate situations are turning towards them in 'false' hope for help.  The 'Psychics' perform a cold reading, which could easily be explained through psychology rather than any supernatural power. In turn, these 'psychics' are taking advantage of the most vulnerable of people and charging them a lot of money for the 'service' they offer through online transactions ,sending money by post, and over the telephone/text. I am dubious that any of them pay any tax on their earnings. It is a trap for those in vulnerable positions and  a law should be imposed banning such practice.",
