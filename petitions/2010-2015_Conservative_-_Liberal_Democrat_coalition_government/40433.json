Furthermore, acts like this contradict the essence of coexistence and peace among humans. Labeling these acts as freedom of speech is similar to labeling murder as freedom of expression!\r\n\r\nWe all know the chaos such acts can cause, but it's difficult to answer the question: What do they contribute to our nation, or humanity in general?",
