        "additional_details": "The volume of Herring Gulls in coastal areas has now increased so much that residents and children are now being attacked in even greater numbers during the gulls 10 week breeding season. The gulls wake residents at first light with their shrill cries, scavenge rubbish bins leaving the area in a shocking mess and block rainwater guttering. Their foul excrement is to be found everywhere with residents continually having to wash the mess away using countless gallons of water to do so. Car paintwork is being damaged and residents are now being forced to fit roof spikes and covers on chimney pots all at considerable cost. Those of us who have to live with these birds have just about had enough. IT IS NOW TIME THESE GULLS LOST THEIR PROTECTED STATUS. ",
