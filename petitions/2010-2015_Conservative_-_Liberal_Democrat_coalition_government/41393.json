        "additional_details": "There are still many in England and Wales that know very little about the Police Commissioner role, what it means for them and the candidates involved.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was meant to be information via the post, for many residents many have not received this and elections are only 7 days away (as at 8th nov 2012). Further, the internet and social networking sites are laden with citizens asking what the meaning of the elections are, and with such poor understanding and poor communication of this scheme this does not seem to be a good foundation for the elections to take place.\r\n\r\nThis petition requests that the communication of the Police and Crime Commissioner elections is reviewed  and in the meantime the elections are postponed (or that the votes are not considered until a second election which allows those currently in the dark to, in that time, become more aware).\r\n\r\n100,000 votes are required in the current week for this to be considered so please sign if you agree.",
