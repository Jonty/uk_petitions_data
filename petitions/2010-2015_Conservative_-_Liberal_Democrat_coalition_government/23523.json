        "additional_details": "Why when you work 38 hours on the minimum wage are you paying tax on a THIRD of your earnings?\r\n\r\nThis petition is to force the Government to discuss and work towards raising the Tax Threshold to \u00a312,000 sooner rather than 10k in 2015 and thus encourage people to want to work and to help themselves instead of relying on benefits to top their income up.\r\n\r\nMr Cameron promised a tax threshold of 10k but I think it should be higher and SOONER!\r\n\r\nThe minimum wage has risen nearly 90% since it was introduced but the threshold hardly at all! The result is that the workers on the lowest wages now are contributing more than they ever were and the costs of life's basics are rising massively.\r\n\r\nPensioners and low wage workers should be able to earn \u00a312,000 a year before paying income tax!\r\n\r\nITS THE MINIMUM THEY EXPECT YOU TO EARN BUT FEEL ITS ENOUGH TO TAX YOU ON!\r\n\r\n12k Threshhold . . . its the least we deserve!\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and lets show them how we feel.
