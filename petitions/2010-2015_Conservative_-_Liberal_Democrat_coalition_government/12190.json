        "action": "Introduce a two year compulsory national service for young offenders ",
        "additional_details": "In light of the recent riots we feel the Government should introduce an alternative system to offenders under the age of 26 years.  England needs society to change, this will only happen when offenders are treated firmly.  Two years of discipline would give them a structured, disciplined lifestyle which many of them lack, they would get the opportunity to learn skills such as IT, engineering and languages which they can use to gain employment at the end of their service, in many cases most of the offenders do not have any qualifications.\r\n\r\nRe-offending rates for those who serve under two year sentences are in excess of 50% according to MoJ statistics and those who serve less than 12 months are not subject to probationary services upon release.\r\n\r\nOur Justice Secretary Ken Clarke made a statement saying  \"It is a national scandal that nearly half of all offenders re offend within a year of release,\"\r\n\r\nWe request urgent reforms on a problem that has been deteriorating for many years",
