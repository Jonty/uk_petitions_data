        "additional_details": "There is a growing trend for car stereos to be so loud as to be heard streets away. There appears to be little or no work being done to limit, or even control the amount of noise coming from vehicles. It is bad enough when you have these vehicles pass you on the road, but when you are constantly bombarded with it day after day whilst sitting in your own home it becomes unbearable.\r\nI am asking for some legislation which will actually be enforced by law, to limit the decibel level of stereos within vehicles. for the sake of the environment and the sanity of the people.",
