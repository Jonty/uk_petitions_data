        "additional_details": "The Youth Parliament, especially the Warwickshire constituency, are currently campaigning for a Political Awareness/Education being introduced into secondary schools. Government are very close to passing votes at 16 which means year 11/school leavers will be able to vote. We find that many of the older generation do not understand the basics of the British political system and how/why to vote, never mind 16+ year olds, although they are members of society and able to work so they should be able to vote. By signing this petition you are backing our campaign in trying to introduce the basic knowledge of British politics and voting into secondary schools. Thank you!",
