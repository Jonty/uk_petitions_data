        "additional_details": "Currently the capacity of the Eurotunnel Shuttle service from Calais to Folkstone is governed by the ability of The UK Border Agency to check passports.  This results in completely unnaceptable delays at peak times.  Recently some travellers had to queue for 5 hours or more, most of it on the A16 motorway in France, before getting onto a Shuttle.  The economic and human cost of this is unacceptable and needs to be addressed urgently.  One way of speeding up proceedings would be to require passengers to leave their vehicles and pass through passport control as in an airport, including face recognition passport readers for those with appropriate passports.  Then only the drivers of vehicles will have to have their passports checked whilst in their vehicles, greatly speeding up the throughput and reducing the queues.  More passport control barriers for vehicles would also help.  The misery and economic cost of the curent arangements is disgraceful.",
