        "additional_details": "Teachers within all schools within the United Kingdom should only be allowed to take holidays outside of term time as this is unfair to parents and sets a bad example to students.\r\n\r\nThis would also show that the government is being fair across the board as a teacher will not be fined for taking holidays during term time, which many parents have expressed is unfair as it disrupts the education of their children.\r\n\r\nI put it that if parents are REQUIRED BY LAW to make sure their child is in education, then it should be REQUIRED BY LAW that the teachers at that school should have to be in 5he school to TEACH and also adhere to the same fines as set down in law if they FAIL to maintain the education of the children in their class.",
