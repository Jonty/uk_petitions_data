But we were aided by the enormous inflation over our working lives that enabled us to borrow real pounds and pay back the debt with inflated ones. Who did we borrow from? Our parents and grandparents. In doing so we robbed them of the savings they had built up; and they had done so with much greater difficulty than that we laboured under,  under a far less generous tax regime than we enjoyed for the last 20 years of our working lives.\r\nWe should not bequeath any more debt to our children than necessary. Whenever there is a suggestion that my generation should have some benefit reduced \u2013 winter fuel allowance, bus passes, RPI linked OAP, free flu jabs, there is an outcry.  I find this ridiculous and indefensible. Vote against it! Fair shares between generations.\r\n\r\n",
