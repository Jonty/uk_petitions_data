        "additional_details": "Fast food restaurants and fast food outlets create a lot of waste that could be recycled such as the card and paper used for packaging. Currently very few, possibly none, of the big chains have a recycling facility that would enable customers to recycle the packaging from their food. This needs to change.  It takes 70% less energy to recycle paper compared with making it from raw materials and on average, 16% of the money you spend on a product pays for the packaging, which ultimately ends up as rubbish.",
