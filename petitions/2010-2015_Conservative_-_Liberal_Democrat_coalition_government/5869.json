        "additional_details": "It is the duty of government to protect the public from cartels and monopolies. They do have the legislative powers but do not choose to use them.  Large parts of the British economy are controlled by cartels and monopolies to the detriment of the general public.  One definition of a monopoly supplier is one that controls more than 25% of the market in a particular commodity or service.  Sugar production, groceries, brewery and banking are obvious examples. Cartels are formed by companies agreeing on a uniform price structure or the division of a market into a set of defined monopolies e.g.geographically.  Insurance is the prime example.  This government claims to support capitalism, free trade and competition.  Why don't they practise what they preach?",
