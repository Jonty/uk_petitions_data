        "additional_details": "To introduce proper discipline into todays modern day youth by the re-introduction of physical disciplining similar to that of cane into schools, for those who do not behave themselves and cause disturbances etc. It has been proven for too long that suspensions and being expelled act less as a deterrent and more as an attraction to misbehave and modern youth have no discipline, fear or respect for elders and those in charge. This has been ever so proven by the London Riots.",
