Recently the medicines regulator had to take action to remove the licence for Teva Levothyroxine 100mcg tablets since their dissolution rate was too low. A low dissolution rate means that the full dose of the drug is not absorbed by the body and as a result sufferers may die due to insufficient medication.\r\n\r\nThere is clear evidence in the public domain that other Generic brands of Levothyroxine suffer from the identical problem.\r\n\r\nThe Petitioners request that the Department of Health undertakes a full review of the bio-equivalence of all brands of Levothyroxine in all strengths and ensures that only those that pass fully retain their licence.",
