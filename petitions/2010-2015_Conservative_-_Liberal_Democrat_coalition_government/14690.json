        "additional_details": "Its about time that the government looked at the Specific Gravity (Strength) in Beers and Lagers, and brought in an upper limit of 3.5, most of the trouble with drink related crime is caused by young drinkers who can't handle these so-called Extra Strength beverages, increasing the price penalises those responsible drinkers in society, so reduce the strength instead, and cut out drink related crime. This would also have a beneficial effect on general health & Alcoholism.",
