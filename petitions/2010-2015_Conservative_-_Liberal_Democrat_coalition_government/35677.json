        "additional_details": "Israel is breaking almost every rule in the UN's book in its illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. Since the 'Six Days War' the Jewish state have established settlements both in the West Bank and Gaza Strip- both Palestinian areas of land. This is a blatant disregard of the fourth Geneva Convention. Not only this, but Israel also make profit from their illegal occupation of the lands by selling Palestines natural resources such as fresh foods such as dates and potatoes to UK supermarkets such as Tesco, they are labelled 'Israeli Settlement Goods'. Selling goods that do not belong to them, is absolutely atrocious.\r\n\r\nBritain has had a rich heritage in being resolute and standing up to metaphorical 'bullies' such as Hitler's Germany and Sadam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. It is about time Britain looked to its past and saw what was right in all of this, and stand by Palestine in seeing Israel out of their territory, whether this be by through trade sanctions or UN resolutions.",
