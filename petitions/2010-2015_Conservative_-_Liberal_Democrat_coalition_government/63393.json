        "additional_details": "Currently any man or woman, photographer or not can take pictures of our children in public places and do what they like with them such as posting them on their websites, posting them on facebook (with any comment they like) and we as the parents have no say in this.  All we can do at the moment is ask them to take it down and there is nothing to make them do so.\r\nMy aim is to get enough signatures on this petition for someone to take note and change the laws regarding this, to enable people to be punished if photos are taken without parents permission.",
