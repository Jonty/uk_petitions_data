        "additional_details": "We call for the plans to build a \u00a315 million museum as a dedication to Margaret Thatcher to be scrapped.\r\n\r\nShe is a massively ontroversial figure and so an expensive homage to her seems inappropriate. After the taxpayer has already forked out \u00a310 million for her state funeral, this seems highly distasteful.\r\n\r\nThis money would be better spent on public services or going back into the art's council which has recently received major cuts.\r\n\r\nWe do not want a Thatcher museum nor do we want money to be thrown around so carelessly when the general public is already suffering at the hands of Conservative's austerity measures.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the plans for the museum to be scrapped and the government to think more carefully about where they are placing their funds.\r\n",
