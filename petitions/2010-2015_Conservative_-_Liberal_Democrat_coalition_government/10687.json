This unit offers respite for children with various disabilities and medical conditions.\r\nThis respite allows families to stay together and allows the children to stay at home rather than being sent to a residential unit full time.\r\nThe families feel let down as they were reassured that the unit would not close but now it seems promises have been broken and the unit is to close. Please help save respite services for these special children. We need  as many people as possable to sign.",
