In light of Labour's plan to introduce an annual punitive tax on higher value properties that will have an impact on all family homes because of the consequential need to revalue every UK property, we want to see a debate in the House of Commons to look at all current family home taxes, including council tax, stamp duty and inheritance taxation and to ensure the oppositions plans for a Mansion Tax does not hit the statute books.\r\nFor more details email contact@fairhometax.uk\r\n",
