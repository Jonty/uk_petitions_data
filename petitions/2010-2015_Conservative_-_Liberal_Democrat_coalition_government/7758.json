        "additional_details": "In the past twelve months we have seen protest marches being hijacked by groups of individuals whose aims are to cause disorder and/or commit criminal offences.  These groups use masks or scarves to hide their faces to prevent  police officers from identifying them and holding them to account.  We have witnessed the same attempts to hide identity in the recent riots by criminals.\r\n\r\nA law should be introduced banning people from hiding their identities in the pursuit of activities which are not in the public interest.  The police should be able to disperse such individuals from a given area or arrest them if they fail to comply. ",
