        "additional_details": "It is time the United Kingdon held a referendum on continued membership of the EU. The last referendum on the subject was held in 1975 - two years after joining.\r\nSince that time membership of the EU has become far more envasive and burdensome in relation to the UK. Our financial commitment has escalated significantly, EU laws (now estimated to be 70%+ of UK legislation) flow unchecked from Brussels and European Courts regularly override British Courts.\r\nAt the same time the benefits of continued EU membership become less apparent by the day.   .\r\nOur politicians appear not to want to accept the way  the majority of the UK population feel about continued EU membership. A referendum would allow all political and economic arguements to be presented to the public, who could then make a informed decision.\r\nMake no mistake this is a massive issue for the future of the UK.  If you agree that it is now time to hold a vote on the UK's continued membership of the EU, please sign the petition",
