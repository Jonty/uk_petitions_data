        "additional_details": "Royal Mail has announced revised collection times from 50,000 boxes throughout the UK. In many instances these times are ridiculous - 9am Mon-Fri and 7am Sat seem commonplace.\r\n\r\nWe are told that there will always be a box with half a mile. That's a one mile walk - not clever if you are elderly or disabled, especially in bad weather.\r\n\r\nThis comes from Moya Greene who has a salary of \u00a31.35 million and fails to understand that this will further reduce the letters carried by Royal Mail.\r\n\r\nThe petition calls upon the government to censure Moya Greene.",
