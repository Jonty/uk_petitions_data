This fear can be directly attributed to the youths who currently 'control' our towns and city's.\r\nYouth lawlessness and aggression must be curbed at source. Teachers, policemen, citizens must feel that they are able to deal with youths in a way which will hand back control to the state and indeed the adults and inflict an instant and understandable punishment.\r\nLet us 'clip the wayward children around the ear'. Let us stop this 'Lord Of The Flies' society and regain control of our streets.\r\nThe Government needs to review all acts and treaties that prevent the application of Corporal Punishment particularly by Parents, Teachers and the Police.",
