        "additional_details": "The introduction of permit parking offers no benefits whatsoever to residents or shops-all it will do is financially penalize everyone concerned and kill off trade in the already struggling St Albans Road.Daytime parking is not the issue it is in the evening and at night with all the street lights off too makes it dangerous too. This gives no one the right to park outside their house and will not change a thing. The council will benefit by the yearly revenue they will get, in exchange for doing nothing why do home owners have to pay to park in the area they live why cant they AS TAX PAYERS  ALREADY HAVE A FREE TICKET TO SHOW THEIR A RESIDENT. The\r\nCouncils always ignore government and should be made to provide parking for new dwellings as well as adding car parks and not keep adding to the problems.",
