        "action": "Enquiry into expensive and unfair fees on credit agreements",
        "additional_details": "It is about time action was taken against finance companies who charge customers incredibly expensive fees on top of interest charges that can often run into thousands of pounds. Examples are 'documentation fees often costing hundreds of pounds, 'option to purchase' fees at the end of agreements of several hundred pounds and any change in mid term circumstances demanding again expensive fees. This petition moves that all finance agreements charge the agreed interest and these fees be kept to a more reasonable level if not abolished altogether. It would appear many unscrupulous companies are making millions for printing out a few sheets of paper and I move that this practice must be stopped in the interest of fairness and transparancy",
