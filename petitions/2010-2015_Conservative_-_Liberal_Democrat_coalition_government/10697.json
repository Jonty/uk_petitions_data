        "additional_details": "It seems that all convicted people who claim benefits should be required to do full time community service -(litter collection, graffite removal, improving derelict areas, helping by doing anything to improve the environment etc.) This would get the claimant into the pattern of getting up to be at work for a certain time, doing a full days work and receiving their benefit at the end of each week. Refusal to opt onto the scheme would be an option but ofcourse they would  then receive no benefits. This could also be a step back to the idea of work and restore some pride in their own environment..",
