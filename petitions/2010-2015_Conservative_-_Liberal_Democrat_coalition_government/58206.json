        "additional_details": "Guant\u00e1namo Bay is a prison who takes suspected terrorist and put them away with out bring tried.\r\n\r\nWhen Shaker Aamer was detained by Afghan forces in November 2001 he was a healthy man in his early 30s who lived with his wife and four children in Britain. Shaker is now 44-years-old and has spent nearly 11 years behind bars at the notorious prison camp in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. He is riddled with arthritis and other health issues, the result - he and his lawyers claim - of years of brutal torture and solitary confinement, as well as inadequate medical care. He has endured all of this despite being cleared for release in 2007 and never being charged, tried or convicted of any criminal offence.\r\n\r\nWe would like to see the government doing a review on Guantanomo's British Citizens health and treatment while in there and ensure the public that no torture is happening and if there is then conduct a review on the Extradition Deal between the UK and the US.
