        "additional_details": "We call upon the government to be fair in protecting the rights of non-EU migrant workers who are already present in UK by:\r\n1. Not restricting the rights of current Tier 1 Post Study Work visa holders by forcing them to switch to Tier 2 (Tier 1 General is now closed).\r\n2. Not restricting their rights to settlement as this has already been factored into their decision to come to UK.\r\n3. Not requiring Tier 2 visa holders who have been granted unrestricted CoS initially to have to go through the Residential Labour Market Test if they incur a change in salary (through a promotion for example). This adversely affects Tier 1 PSW switchers into Tier 2.",
