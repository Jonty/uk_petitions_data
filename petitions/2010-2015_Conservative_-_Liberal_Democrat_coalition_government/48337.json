Polyamory is not all about a man having a harem nor does it have anything to do with less rights for women.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned believe that anyone should be allowed to have a committed relationship with whoever they want and as many people as they want, so long as the needs of all partners are fulfilled and all parties are in agreement.",
