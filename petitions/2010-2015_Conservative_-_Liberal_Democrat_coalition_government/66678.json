        "additional_details": "We want the terrorist killer responsible for the murder of our dear sister Nahid Almanea who was brutally murdered in a vicious and vile Islamaphobic terrorist attack in Colchester UK to be extradited to the Saudi Arabian authorities.\r\n\r\nNahid Almanea who was a 31 year old female student from Saudi Arabia living in the UK studying English ahead of her PhD suffered 16 seperate stab wounds to her head, body neck and arms. She died on Tuesday 10th June 2014\r\n\r\nShe was attacked for wearing her (abayya) robe and (hijab) scarf both symbols of the Islamic faith.\r\n\r\nAll Muslims across the UK are outraged and saddened that this attack was not portrayed as a terrorist attack by the the media as it has similarities with the case of Fusilier Drummer Lee Rigby. Muslims are all to familiar with this discrimination and bias of the medias reporting on every case where Muslims are the subject. ",
