If they give the all clear and there is terrorist activity (the possibility of such being greatly increased due to UK funding of worldwide terrorism via the Foreign Aid Budget) resulting in deaths or serious injury there is EVERY likelihood that lawyers will be trampled in the rush to litigate for compensation for the relatives.  THERE MUST BE LAWS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE TAXPAYER FROM THIS EVENTUALITY BEFORE ANY ADVICE REGARDING TRAVELLING TO EGYPT ON HOLIDAY IS GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE.",
