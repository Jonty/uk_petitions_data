        "additional_details": "The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 has been in place for 36 years.  However, manufacturers and retailers of children's clothes and toys still adhere to the outmoded and ridiculous notions that all girls love pink, want to be princesses and have no idea what a hammer or a microscope is, whereas boys want to be superheroes and do not belong in a kitchen.\r\nI would like the Government to make it illegal for retailers to market children's toys to specific genders.  I would also like the Government to encourage the production and selling of non-pink items for girls.",
