The law at the moment says that public service employees annual pay rises are limited to 1% per annum.  There is absolutely no justification for MPs to be awarded any pay rise above that enjoyed by the greater group of public service employees.  It should also be a criminal offence for any MP to be given greater access to the public purse through tax free allowances and expenses, to get round the law which is in force at present.",
