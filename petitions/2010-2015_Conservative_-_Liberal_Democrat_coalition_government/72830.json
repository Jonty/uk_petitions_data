The usual economies of scale do not apply to Dentistry, as there is nothing more efficient and pleasing than a relatively small practice owner trying to 'make it big'.\r\n\r\nProvide Dental contracts to smaller companies and individuals if you want to inject passion and care into NHS Dentistry.\r\n\r\nSource: Personal experience.
