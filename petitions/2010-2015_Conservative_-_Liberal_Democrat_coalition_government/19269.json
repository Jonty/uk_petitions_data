        "additional_details": "Have you ever had a debate on the internet where people take you to task for going off topic, bringing out a straw man or not substantiating your claims? I want this to happen in the House of Commons. If a question is asked, and the points it raises are not addressed, the speaker should caution the MP answering the question. If he goes off topic or distracts from the question by answering a different question he should be cautioned and even punished if there are repeated offences. Debate in parliament is almost worthless under the current system where it is impossible to pin an MP on a difficult point. This MUST change. I want rules of debate codified and implemented. This would be a great step towards transparent government.",
