        "additional_details": "The mass killings of 9/11 were, as well as being a crime of mass murder, also a gross violation of the right to life of nearly 3,000 people.\r\n\r\nIt was the duty of the government where this event took place to investigate this violation, to establish the truth of this violation and bring those responsible to justice. To date, nobody has been brought to trial for participation or complicity in these mass killings.\r\n\r\nAccording to the official account, all 19 alleged perpetrators of 9/11 died in the crashes of aircraft they allegedly had hijacked. Consequently, they were not prosecuted and their guilt was not determined in accordance with the rule of law.\r\n\r\nThus, the right of the victims\u2019 families to have the truth established under legal scrutiny, and the perpetrators identified and punished has not been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe UK government should therefore investigate the deaths of the 67 UK citizens killed by the events of 9/11.\r\n\r\nMatt Campbell (brother of Geoff Campbell killed on 9/11)\r\n",
