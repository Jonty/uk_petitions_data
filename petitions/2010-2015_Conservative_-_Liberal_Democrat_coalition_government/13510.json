        "action": "Reduce Microwave Radiation exposure to the population",
        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the Government to honour the European Resolution 1815 whereby\r\nthe Precautionary Principle is implemented with respect to Microwave Radiation emitting from Mobile Phones,\r\nWIFI, WIMAX, SMART Meters etc.  We ask this for the protection of every human being, every animal, wildlife,\r\nbirds, bees, and trees. We ask for the BioInitiative Report to be used as a basis of referral as other European Countries have done.  Additionally the Resolution urges each Member State to provide areas\r\nfree from microwave radiation so that  people adversely affected (Electrosensitives) have a place\r\nof refuge from microwaves and thereby can recover and continue to recover from microwave sickness/overload\r\nin a low emission environment. As it is estimated that 50% of the population will become Electrosensitive by the year 2017 we believe an urgent reduction in microwave radiation is imperative.\r\n\r\n",
