As in the news of late the Orange Lodge is discipling two members for attending the funeral of a murdered catholic police officer. To enter the Orange Order you must be a Protestant to be a member how ever what if you are a catholic and have the same views of the lodge, you will not be allowed to join, This is oblivious Religious Discrimination and possibly sectarian. I want the equality commission to have a review and investigative the management and rules of the Orange Order.        ",
