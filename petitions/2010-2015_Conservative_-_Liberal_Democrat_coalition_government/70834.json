This system is a pandemic rooted deep within our socio-political strata. Causing disspropotionate loss economically, politically and socially. Politics, democracy and constitution is the convenience under which these \"so called\" politicians harbor themselves whilst theriving their individual interests.\r\nToday, people of pakistan under the leadership of Imran khan have decided to rise against this mockery we call politics. With the prospect to abolish Nawaz sharif and his aides from the government. A government that came into power with false promises and a stolen mandate.\r\nSo, lets all play our part in making this change a reality by signing this e-petition.\r\nP.S Forward this e-petition to as many people as possible. Thankyou!!!",
