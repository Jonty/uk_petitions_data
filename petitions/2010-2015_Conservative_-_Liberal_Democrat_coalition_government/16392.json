        "additional_details": "Funding for personal care in England is currently means tested.  Whilst it is recognised that costs to the taxpayer need to be kept to a minimum, this discourages saving and can result in unnecessary cost to the taxpayer.  It can increase stress on both the individual and their family as well as resource costs for reassessments and appeals.  I propose a basic level of care, eg shared room and facilities, meals, personal care and nursing, is agreed nationally and this is funded jointly by NHS and social services.  Anything over and above this basic level of care should be funded by the individual.  This would bring those with care needs equal to prison inmates and meet the recommendations of the 1999 Royal Commission.  Income from state benefits and pensions could be treated as overlapping benefits, but existing savings and private pensions disregarded and a residency criterion applied, eg min 5 yrs in England. This would negate the need for assessments other than proof of residency.",
