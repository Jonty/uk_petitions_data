        "additional_details": "The deregulation bill, in particular clause 44 schedule 15, will devolve further powers into schools enabling them to set their own terms dates and it is unlikely there will any guidelines for schools to follow when setting their terms. The traditional six weeks holiday in the summer will be lost and the bill is likely to be passed shortly, with it coming into affect as early as September 2015.\r\n\r\nIt is currently unknown what impact this will have upon the education system, economy, industry and tourism as it appears that no consultations and impact assessments have taken place.\r\n\r\nWe petition the government to conduct an independent assessment into the impact on businesses, tourism and jobs particularly those who are employed within the tourism industry.\r\n",
