We do not agree hard working parents should be targeted by over zealous council workers, for one, and travel companies hiking up prices knowing parents have to pay. By all means target persistent truant children, and their parents who chose to stay in bed, but all cases should be seen by there own merits. When all is dead and done, why punish the many for the sake of the few??? And as for the court case, that is just beyond a joke. It should NEVER  have gone that far. ",
