        "additional_details": "As it stands in Scotland there is no legal rights for grandparents to see their grandchildren. the government need to change this outdated law.Often when parents separate, grandparents can be forgotten about. They can lose contact with the child or children and therefore miss the chance to watch their grandchildren grow up. The grandchildren can also miss out on this beneficial relationship.\r\nThe law was reviewed prior to the Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006. It was decided that no change was needed in Scotland, so grandparents still don't have automatic rights to see their grandchildren. In order to seek contact they first need to apply for Parental Rights and Responsibilities.\r\n\r\nA spokesman for the Scottish Government recently told the Herald Scotland that \"Rights are given in relation to children in order to allow a person to fulfil his or her parental responsibilities, not to ensure that person's continuing relationship with the child\".",
