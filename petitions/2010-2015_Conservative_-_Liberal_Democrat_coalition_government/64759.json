        "action": "my child recives less CSA payments then she should",
        "additional_details": "The names in this petition are made up. I am a single mum to Ami; and Ray is the father. Ray moved out and was making full payments to Ami via the CSA. Ray then moved in with another woman, Gem and her child, Bee. Bee also receives CSA payments from her birth father, Jay. After Ray moved in with Gem and Bee, the payments that Ray was making to support Ami were reduced as the CSA said as Ray was living with Bee, then he should support Bee and payments to Bee should take preference over payments to Ami. This means that Bee now receives more financial support from Ray than Ami does. Bee is now receiving support from both Jay and Ray who is not related to her and does not have any legal responsibility for her. The payments made by Ray to support his own child, Ami have been reduced as a result. This is wrong and the law needs to change. Payments to Ami by Ray should be a higher priority than payments to Bee from Ray especially when Ami receives less support now as a result. ",
