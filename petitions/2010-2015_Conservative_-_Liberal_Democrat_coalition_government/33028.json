The broadcasters can control who receives their programmes. Freeze the TV licence and abolish it in ten years which enables the BBC to become self reliant by that time. It also gives individuals the choice of    which broadcasters they which to receive and pay for.The TV licence is just another tax.Abolishing the licence would be a vote winner.",
