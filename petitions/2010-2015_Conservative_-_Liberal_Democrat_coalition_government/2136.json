So if the pump says: 132.7p, the duty we pay on that is 57.95p and the vat 22.12p.\r\n\r\nYou think, maybe the oil companies and causing this? No! Fuel duty is higher than the cost of the product!\r\n\r\n\"If a litre of unleaded cost 132.9p, it would be split in the following way: Duty - 57.95p, Product - 47.8p, VAT- 22.15p and Retailer - 5p.\" - http://www.petrolprices.com/.\r\n\r\nThis is a joke and the prices are increasing at a steady rate! In November 2010 the cost of unleaded was 118.7p. That's a hike of around 14p in less that 6 months! The average price for unleaded is now 136.51p, the least you are looking to pay nationally is around 130p and the most is 150p.\r\n\r\nThe cost of fuelling our vehicles is too high. This petition is to get the government to do something about it.\r\n\r\nSources: http://www.whatgas.com/car-finance/fuel-duty.html and http://www.petrolprices.com/",
