        "additional_details": "There have been numerous collisions and 3 fatalities now on the Uxbridge Road. This petition is to get permanent speed cameras on the road as occasional mobile speed vans are simply not enough - hopefully this will reduce the amount of collisions and prevent further fatalities. The A412 is a well known stretch of road for speeding vehicles. Please share and  show your support by signing this petition, Thank you.",
