This could include any community paid job, eg, litter picking, charity shop working, cleaning.  This would still allow time to look for jobs, attend interviews and it would also save money on national and local goverment jobs.  I think it would be an excellent deterant from people who think claiming benefits is an easy life, but people who are genuine would not mind.  It would also give people skills they may need to get a job!",
