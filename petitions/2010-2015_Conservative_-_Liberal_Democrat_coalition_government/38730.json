ISPs have contracts with their customers called good practice Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs), which they have recently strengthened, about what may be hosted on their servers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, complaints about a particular website\u2019s content should first be directed to the site\u2019s manager. Most AUPs already contain a general clause which allows ISPs to remove sites or content which contain offensive or objectionable material, even if it is not illegal."
