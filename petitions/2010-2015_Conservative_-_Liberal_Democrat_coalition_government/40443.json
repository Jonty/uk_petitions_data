As a human being and a mother I feel physically sick at the lack of information we are provided with concerning the sex offenders that are placed in our communities. I cannot believe these individuals are allowed to live amongst us and our children. They are monsters, predators and extremely dangerous.The government either cannot be bothered to go through the process to make sure these people never see the light of day again or they can't due to the Human Rights Act. Please Please sign this petition to make sure yours and every other child in this country has less chance of being destroyed. ",
