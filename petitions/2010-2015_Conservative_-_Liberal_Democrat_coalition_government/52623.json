Given the state of the nation's finances, the amounts involved and the need for companies that hold Governmental contracts to correctly bill the Government for work done, the Police should investigate to see if any criminal offences have been commissioned.\r\n\r\nThere should also be an inquiry as to why the contractors were allowed to bill so much work before anyone at the responsible department noticed.
