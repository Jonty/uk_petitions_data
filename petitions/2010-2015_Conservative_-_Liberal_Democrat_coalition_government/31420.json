The membership process is increasingly devised to obtain more gaming from the punter. Limitations must be applied to limit the number of available variations within a single membership or domain area to allow the customer a distance from the other available games on offer. The businesses often may be running from near shore but out of UK legislation so perhaps other thoughts on those laws already elsewhere.  ",
