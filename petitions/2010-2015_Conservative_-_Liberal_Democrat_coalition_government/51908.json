        "additional_details": "Well it's very simple, a very substantial amount of uk citizens want cannabis to become legal and to be sold in dispensaries and shops all over the country.\r\nIt would greatly improve the countrys' economy because to be sold in shops it needs to be taxed which will in turn bring in more local business all across the country.\r\nIf cannabis is made legal then crime will drop by a substantial amount, the missuse of harder substances such as class A and class B drugs will drop.\r\nI know it sounds very unprofessional but the sales of food throughout the whole country will go up which small businesses and little chains can thrive off and become very succesful.",
