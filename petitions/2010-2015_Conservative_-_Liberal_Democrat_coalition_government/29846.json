        "additional_details": "A second girl in Doncaster was murdered this week by a psychiatric person. The first was murdered after the woman in question was released (was it the right time if she stabbed a girl to death?). The second was also stabbed to death by a woman known to social services and at least 4 psychiatric institutues. I  believe better checks should be in place before a member of the public is allowed to be out unsupervised.",
