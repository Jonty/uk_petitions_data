        "additional_details": "With tensions rising in the waters around the Pacific, a new wave of piracy and terrorism spreading across the west of Africa is it really wise that the United Kingdom has reduced it's fleet of destroyers from 12 to 6. Whilst the Type 45 is arguably the best destroyer in the world, a ship can only be in a single place at once. With military staff past and present pointing out how having such a small fleet is affecting our defence capabilities I therefore think that a further 6 Type-45 Destroyers should be built, as was originally agreed with BAE Systems.\r\nThis will signal the end to fleet reduction, enable us to counter upcoming threats effectively and sustain thousands of ship building and other highly skilled jobs.",
