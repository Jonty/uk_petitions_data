        "additional_details": "For too long poker has been the domain of large casinos.\r\nPoker is now mainstream, yet dictated by a law from the 18th century.\r\nSmall clubs are friendly, but cannot afford the large fees that casinos can.\r\nBy making poker legal this would secure jobs for thousands of specialised poker dealers, keep thousands of people in work and encourage competition in the market place.\r\n\r\nBY putting a 5% Tax on poker, this could amount to millions per year revenue, plus saved money on benefits for those employed in the industry\r\n\r\nOr have a separate license for poker games that is economically viable for independent poker clubs.\r\n\r\nWe are not against fair and regulated gaming for ALL\r\nWe are not against large glamorous casinos\r\nAll we want is to be able to have the choice to play poker in small LEGAL poker clubs\r\n",
