Driving at 15-20 mph slowing traffic and causing tailbacks and frustration, veering across lanes on roundabouts, turning left from a right hand lane and vice versa, impatient overtaking, forcing the vehicle into traffic, no indicators and much much more.\r\n\r\nI call for a resit of whichever licence you hold every 20 years to eliminate bad drivers who clearly don't know the current rules of the road and to reduce accidents.",
