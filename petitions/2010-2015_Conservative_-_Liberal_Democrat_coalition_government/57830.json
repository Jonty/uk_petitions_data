        "additional_details": "We,the undersigned,ask the UK govt to ensure that the Jersey justice & administration systems are brought up to internationally acceptable standards.The lack of separation of powers on Jersey has led to political interference & incompetence in the courts,with victims being denied basic human rights; guaranteed under Int. law - as subscribed to by UK Est.\r\nRecent examples are: (i) misuse of data protection act to silence those attempting to expose coverups of child abuse (ii) conflicted judges & jurats consistently delivering judgements biased towards the establishment,& inimical to the human rights of the islanders (iii) illegal suspension & sacking of officers who attempted to reveal & enforce the law in relation to child abuse & its subsequent coverup.\r\nWe ask for a full,open & objective enquiry into how Jersey has been administered over the last decades,& why it still fails to afford the islanders with the human rights to which they are entitled.",
