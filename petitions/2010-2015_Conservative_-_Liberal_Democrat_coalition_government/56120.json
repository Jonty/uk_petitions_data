These poor dogs can end up as bait dogs or fighting dogs and generally have a tragic life before they are released from their hell by their deaths\r\nWe need to value animals and protect them against cruelty and harm. We wouldn't be able to stand in a street and sell or give dogs to strangers so why can we on these sort of sites..There is often no true history about these dogs or puppies,no behaviour history many have no health checks no vaccine cards. Dogs need to treated humanly not given to a life of hell.Criminals are making money out of the suffering of dogs...It MUST be STOPPED. We have to speak for those with no voices.",
