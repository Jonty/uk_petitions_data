        "additional_details": "HMS Ganges was a training establishment for the Royal Navy first started in 1865,and finally becoming a \"stone frigate\" at Shotley,Suffolk.It provided basic training to thousands of new entrant (boy) sailors before closure in 1976.Since closure,the site has been subjected to shameful neglect and significant decay by it's current owners.The figurehead and most important feature of the site is the main mast,which stands at over 140ft and is as much an integral part to the history of HMS Ganges as it is a proud and visible feature of the local community. The mast is also a Group II Historical Monument,and as such it is ours and the governments responsibility to ensure it's preservation.The current owners have no liability to ensure it's preservation,so I call on the government to  ensure that the mast,which is now in significant danger of collapse,is restored for future generations and to preserve it as part of the history of the site, and the local community.",
