        "action": "Ban conspicuous religious symbols in public places",
        "additional_details": "In France, despite the majority religion being Roman Catholicism, the Church and the State are kept strictly apart. This includes the wearing of conspicuous religious symbols. In the UK, however, there are overlaps with religion and the public domain. This is wrong.\r\nOf course, we must allow freedom of religion, but the outward expression is seen by many as offensive and imposing. As a result, we call for all conspicuous religious symbols to be banned in public places, which incorporates any government-owned/controlled building. This includes:\r\n-government-funded schools, colleges and universities\r\n-shopping centres\r\n-government-funded parks etc.\r\nThe conspicuous religious symbols criteria includes:\r\n-conspicuous crucifixes\r\n-hijabs/burqas/niqabs/veils\r\n-elaborate turbans\r\n-yarmulkes\r\n\r\nWe demand for Britain to become secular in order to adapt to the modern era.",
