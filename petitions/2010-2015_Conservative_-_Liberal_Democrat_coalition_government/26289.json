        "additional_details": "For too long now, England has never been recognised as an individual state within the United Kingdom. And unlike Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland amongst many other things It has no national anthem for its people.\r\nLand of Hope and Glory was written by Sir Edward Elgar and has been voted many times in polls across the county as a popular choice by the English people as a suitable anthem for England. I would like to call upon the British government to debate this issue and fix this ongoing wrong against the people of England  and give Land of Hope and Glory the status as the Nation Anthem of England.",
