The impact of these rises is significant to everyone.\r\n\r\nWhat gets my goat is that my local petrol price has remained at \u00a31.37 over the past month, however the oil price has decreased by 9% over the past month.\r\n\r\nSo why am I not seeing a price decrease at the pumps.\r\n\r\nI want the government to explore a mechanism where prices at the pumps are more realistically aligned to oil prices and better regulation of fuel retailers to ensure fairness all round.\r\n\r\nWe will not tolerate being ripped off by fuel retailers.",
