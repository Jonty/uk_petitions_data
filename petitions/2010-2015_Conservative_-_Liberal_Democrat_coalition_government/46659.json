        "action": "Reject further accession to the EU until free movement of labour is reformed",
        "additional_details": "There is deep discontent in the UK regarding mass economic migration from Eastern Europe and the claim by the Government that they are powerless to stop, impede or regulate it. However, the root cause of  this modern diaspora is opening up EU privileges to countries whose economies and social welfare systems are profoundly undeveloped compared to true 1st world countries such as the UK.\r\n\r\nThis petition therefore calls on this and future governments to stop pleading impotence and commit to  rejecting all further expansion of the EU until and unless Free Movement of Labour rules are reformed.",
