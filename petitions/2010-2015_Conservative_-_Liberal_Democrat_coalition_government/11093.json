        "additional_details": "DEFRA is considering the effectiveness of a badger cull (mass slaughter) of badgers in order to combat bovine TB in England. We, the undersigned, want a parliamentary commitment to stopping the slaughter of badgers in a misguided attempt to control this terrible disease. The Krebs report has shown, demonstrably, that culling does not work, and in fact can make the problem worse. Culling will cause sick badgers to leave their territories for new ones and spread infection. If a cull is announced, it is estimated that the damage to the economy in ten year's time will be around GBP two BILLION pounds. Also, there is the risk of a new bloodsport being developed. Culling didn't work in the 1970's, it will not work now. Inevitably, healthy badgers will also be culled.",
