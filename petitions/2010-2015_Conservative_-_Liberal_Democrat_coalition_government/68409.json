        "additional_details": "We ask the government to introduce new legislation under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 to limit the age in which any equines are broken/backed to ride.\r\nAs a horse welfare campaign group,we are regularly sent images by upset & angry people who see young horses,even 8 week old foals,being sat on by people or fully tacked up.This is abuse.\r\nHowever,as there is no minimum age requirements as to what age a horse can be broken to ride,there is no law in which any welfare or police can act on,thereby allowing the horse to be in pain & irreparable damage to be inflicted on these horses & damaged physically/mentally for life.\r\nCurrently any ridden competition at a show or event has minimum age of 4.This does not stop the abuse happening at home.\r\nWe ask the government to introduce a minimum age of at least 2 yrs of age before a horse can be broken in to ride.\r\nWe request this is a prosecutable offence under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 & the police to enforce this legislation.
