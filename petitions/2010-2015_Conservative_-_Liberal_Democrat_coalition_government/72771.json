        "additional_details": "As soon as the health service are aware that a person is suffering mental distress, either during or after pregnancy, a mandatory care plan and risk assessment needs to be drawn up by a psychiatrist. This is to prevent any type of harm to the mother or baby, whether that be mental harm and/or physical harm.People who chose to come off their medication, especially anti-psychotics need to be close monitored as the delusions and/or hallucinations are at a very high risk of returning. Please stop turn a blind eye to the lack of care and treatment given to such people and please lead an independent enquiry into the circumstances surrounding Charlotte Bevan and baby Zanni Tiana.  ",
