        "additional_details": "Eighty nine families in the WV12 area of the West Midlands have recently been notified that their homes, built in the early 1970\u2019s are sited on what is now considered to be seriously contaminated land. The contaminants are rated as highly carcinogenic and the incidence of serious cancers in the affected area appears to be unusually high.\r\nA period of consultation is being led by Walsall MBC. It is hoped to identify the original polluter - the party responsible for the extensive clean up costs.\r\nIn the meantime anxiety is high, properties are worthless and health concerns are on the increase.\r\nPlease support our bid to have the land treated and the properties restored to a safe status and ensure a re-sale value which does not fall below market value. We do not feel that the residents should be in any way liable to meet the costs of this work.",
