It is one of few channels many of us Brits watch due to the fantastic range of programmes on this channel for the younger audience including -\r\nTop Gear, Russell Howard's Good News; Bad Education, Family Guy; Dr Who; American Dad; Sun, Sex and Suspicious Parents and Snog, Marry or Avoid.\r\nTony Hall the director-general of the BBC is considering axing the BBC Three TV channel as part of a cost cutting move.\r\nWe must save BBC Three! If BBC Three is axed, I know for a fact the BBC will face a big backlash and potential loss of viewers from the younger audience.",
