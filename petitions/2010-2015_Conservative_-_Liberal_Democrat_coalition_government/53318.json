        "additional_details": "Whilst we have no stance on the licencing Private Investigators, we are concerned that legislation may have an inadvertent effect on Mystery Shoppers.\r\n\r\nMystery Shoppers are engaged, normally via agencies, by retailers, hoteliers, publicans and other customer-facing businesses to report on how staff are engaging with customers. Amongst other things, they may check that retail staff are operating legally, not mis-selling, or pressuring customers to purchase.\r\n\r\nIn the course of their work, mystery shoppers may use covert methods, including, but not limtied to, hidden cameras, audio equipment, covert observation, assumed identities and persona, and written and oral reports.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, sincerely hope the government will not inadvertently cause problems for workers in this trade whilst imposing legislation upon private investigators.\r\n",
