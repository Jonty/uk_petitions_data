        "additional_details": "The British government should seek to allow anyone who is able to (in terms of ambition, abilities and suitable previous courses taken) to train for any profession at any age. This will go a long way to solve the skills shortage in UK, rather than having to employ overseas professionals (like medics, engineers, scientists, plumbers, etc). This is apart from empowering individuals to fulfill their ambitions and aspirations in life.  Education is a lifelong process and both the able and less able should be helped. Therefore, encouragement, funding and approval should be given to the Open University and other Universities/colleges to put this into effect. After completing successfully the required exams and assessments for the profession concerned, then it would be up such graduates to prove to prospective employers their ability to fulfill the requirements of the specific job on offer.",
