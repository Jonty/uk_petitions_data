        "additional_details": "We wish to protest against the proposal by Malvern For All to build a cable car upon the historic Malvern Hills, which the tax payer will ultimately end up funding. Drilling so deep into the ground will polute the spring water and the increased footfall will disturb several endangered species native to the hills, such as adders and doormice. The base of the cable car would mean levelling a large area and creating a car park, which is simply not feasible. The increase in traffic on a already congested roads simply has not been thought through. Also, it is against the law to permit any overhead cables upon the hills. This is not a realistic or lawful option for Malvern, no matter how much Malvern For All wish to sugar coat the issue.",
