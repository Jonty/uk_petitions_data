        "additional_details": "In response to Mercosur's ban on all shipping flying the Falkland's flag in their ports and Argentina's continued efforts to isolate the Falkland Islands, we the undersigned request that the British government lobbies the European Union for a formal declaration of support for the Falkland Islands as a British Overseas Territory and to demand the lifting of all Mercosur sanctions against the Falkland Islands.\r\n\r\nThe population of the Falkland Islands wishes to remain British, but Argentina is successfully mobilising support against this, both from Latin America and the USA. Britain needs to pursue support for its claim.\r\n\r\nIn considering this request, the EU should consider the wishes of the population of the Falklands and also the value of the Falkland Islands' resources, oil and gas in particular, as part of the EU economy.",
