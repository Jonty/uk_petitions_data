        "additional_details": "According to the latest FOI request, there are over 1,500,000 photo-ID licence cards which have expired and not been renewed. This is increasing at 100,000 per month.  The expiry date is shown at section  4b on the face of the card. All these drivers are breaking the law and are un-insured.\r\n\r\nThis petition requests that the DVLA amends it policy, and takes active steps  to  publicise  the need to renew the licence when it expires after 10 years.\r\n\r\nCompliance with the regulations will generate an additional \u00a320m of revenue per year for DVLA,  which should be sufficient to fund the publicity programme, and employ the staff to process the applications.",
