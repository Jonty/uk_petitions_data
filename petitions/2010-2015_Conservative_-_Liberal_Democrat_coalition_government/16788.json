        "additional_details": "Public Sector workers are an easy target. Why are the bank pensions schemes not being looked at? Many of these are NON-CONTRIBUTARY and give much higher final pensions than other schemes. Public money has been used to bail out these companies with poor management and 'fat cats' get bonuses for putting banks in serious jeopardy yet no-one is penalising them - why not? Stop using public sector workers as scape goats & look at the real source of these economic problems and punish the right people for once.",
