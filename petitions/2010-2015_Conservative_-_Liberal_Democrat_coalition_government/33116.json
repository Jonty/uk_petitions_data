        "additional_details": "Addison Lee drivers have bee told to use London's bus lanes by the cab firm's owner, John Griffin. The pugnacious call to action, as well as his anti-cyclist comments, further threaten the safety of cyclists on our roads and threaten the good work that has been done in encouraging thousands more cyclists who help to cut carbon emissions in our city. Griffin's highly irresponsible comments and call to action is basis enough for the Addison Lee license to be revoked.",
