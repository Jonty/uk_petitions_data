The UN Charter obliges all member nations to promote \"universal respect for, and observance of, human rights\" and to take \"joint and separate action\" to that end. The UN MUST enforce action against states not doing this (e.g. currently, Syria).\r\n\r\nThe Council countries that veto action, e.g. China/Russia (with dubious Human rights) would no longer be able to hinder the UN from conducting its core duties.",
