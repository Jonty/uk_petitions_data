        "additional_details": "The need to cut the length of the school holidays.  All these holidays only interupt the education of our children and put more pressure on parents to juggle commitments to work along with child-care.  It would be more beneficial if there was less holidays, especially all these in-service days.  Any training that has to be undertaken should be done during the summer break.  No other employees in the public or private sector get this amount of holidays.  The length of the summer break is ridiculous, almost 8 weeks and only the first 2 days are used for preparation.",
