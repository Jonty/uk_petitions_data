        "additional_details": "Shaker Aamer is the last British citizen in Guantanamo Bay. He was captured in Afghanistan whilst working for a local charity and was taken to Bagram. It has been over 12 years since he was taken to Guantanamo. Previously there was a petition in 2012 that reached the 100,000 signatures but the debate amounted to nothing in the end and Shaker still remains in prison without charge. We call on the British government again and new Foreign secretary Philip Hammond to secure Shaker's release immediately to the UK",
