Soon US hedge funds and private investors will own up to 70% of the Co-op Bank and force it on the stock market. This will end over 140 years of independence.\r\n\r\nThe government could step in and bail them out, just like they did for the RBS and Lloyds. If there is enough money to save giant banks then surely there is enough to save the Co-op.",
