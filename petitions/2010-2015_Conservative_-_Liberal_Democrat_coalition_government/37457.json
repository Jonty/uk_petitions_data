We hear every day how the recession worsens and that the people are being punished for this either in benefits or ammenities. It's time for the people to say that they have no confidence in what his happening to the UK before it's too late. We have given the coalition 2 years now and it has NOT worked. We, the undersigned cannot take another 2 years of this. We need to tell them there is no confidence in them and request a general election be held",
