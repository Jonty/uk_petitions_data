        "additional_details": "The Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 is a terrible piece of legislation which takes powers away from Parliament and gives them non-restricted to Ministers.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government currently has a sparsely filled legislative timetable and has time to repeal the Act. Both the Conservative Party and the Liberals were opposed to the Act and planned on repealing it but have yet to do so.\r\n\r\nWe the petitioners call on the Government to bring forward a Bill to repeal the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006.",
