What is so damaging within this assesment that the government is over-ruling the decision of the Information Commissioner.\r\n2. What purpose does the Information Commisioner serve when its rulings can be vetoed by the subject of its judgements?\r\n\r\nA full and frank discusion of the points raised and appropriate answers must be undertaken and provided by the government.\r\n",
