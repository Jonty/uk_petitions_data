        "additional_details": "The proposed badger cull will be carried out without any pre cull testing of badgers to identify which setts contain bovine TB infected badgers.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this petition is to ask the Government to conduct post mortems on all badgers killed in the trial areas, to test for the presence of infection with bovine TB and to assess whether or not the badger was killed humanely as the trial requires.\r\n\r\nThe petitioners also request that the results of the postmortems are published on the DEFRA web site as soon as they conducted and; that if it proves to be the case that either badgers are not being killed humanely or that more uninflected badgers than infected badgers are being killed, that the trials be immediately suspended.",
