The fact that these were sold off primarily to foreign corporate entities whose only incentive is profit and not the provision of a secure, functioning and affordable service that is in the public, economic and national interest for the citizens of the UK.\r\n\r\nThis petition is aimed at requiring the house to debate the re-nationalization of  these vital public services which is not limited to water, electricity, sewage, roads and public transport. Successive governments have been driven by false belief that  de-nationalization would bring competition and thus lower prices. They have not achieved anything of the sort. In fact they have led to governments to bail out network rail when they went bust. The same as the banks. These are vital services to the well being of the economic and social success of our country.     ",
