        "additional_details": "Recent evidence has proven that not only is cannabis a non-lethal drug but it has been proven to be far better than alcohol and tobacco,therefore i see no reason for this drug to be illegal and therefore i and many others within communities wish for this drug to be decriminalization and legalized for medical use (anything from stress,pain,anxiety,depression etc).\r\n\r\nWe thoroughly believe that there has been a lack of true information on this drug and therefore media has discredited the drug,cannabis has great potential in benefiting both the community and people who are suffering.\r\n\r\nAlcohol has to be one of the worst drugs i have ever seen,not only have i witnessed violence because of this drug but i and many others have witnessed people who are going suicidal because of the bad affects of alcoholism.\r\n\r\nArresting people for the growing of this plant is outrageous,especially when tobacco is legal.\r\n\r\nLegalize Cannabis,you'd be stupid not too.\r\n\r\n",
