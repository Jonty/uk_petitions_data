        "additional_details": "UK residents who approach Indian High Commission,London office are often faced with staff being very rude and not approachable. We need this to stop so that we Indians as well as other foreign nationals who require the services don't consider it as a nightmare. No one I know including myself has had a good experience  from the staff who work at the Indian commission London. Changes have to happen for the betterment of the public. I request the government do something about this so services improve and staff are polite and considerate to customers.",
