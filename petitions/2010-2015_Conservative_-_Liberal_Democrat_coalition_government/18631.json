        "additional_details": "This petition seeks to strictly limit companies involved within the NHS in the new Health and Social Care Bill currently before parliament to be in the charity or not-for-profit sectors. This petitioner believes that there is no room at all for profitable companies and she also believes this is the majority opinion of the people of Great Britain. I am asking you to sign this petition to force parliament to debate this motion and to pass into law this petition together with the Health and Social Care Bill. This is in order to save the NHS from the predatory companies currently operating in countries like the U.S.A. Please help me to save our NHS. Thank you. ",
