ONCE AGAIN THE YOUNGER GENERATION PROPOSE TO DISADVANTAGE THE GENERATION WHICH HAS HELPED TO CREATE THE COUNTRY'S WEALTH (upto mid 1990's).\r\nTHE PENSIONER IS A VULNERABLE PERSON WHICH THE UK GOVERNMENT STILL SHOW LITTLE IF ANY REGARD FOR.  OTHER CULTURES RESPECT & SUPPORT THEIR ELDERLY! NOT THE UK!\r\nI AM SURE WE SUPPORT AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF THE STATE PENSION, BUT THIS MUST BE ACROSS THE BOARD - ALL PENSIONERS GETTING THE SAME, NOT A TWO TIER SYSTEM.\r\nMANY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO NI FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS ANYWAY.\r\nCONTACT YOUR MP TO SUPPORT A MOVE AGAINST THIS DISCRIMINATORY SITUATION. SIGN THE PETITION FOR TO ACHIEVE OVER 100000 SIGNATURES  ",
