This man has in no\r\nway damaged the name of the Royal Marines, who am are 100% behind him.  Don't name him, just set him free.  Shame we cannot give him a medal for his\r\nwork.  This man, in the eyes of most people, is not\r\nguilty.  Wonder what the Taliban man would have done to him, if the positions were reversed.  If justice rules, then let 'our' soldier free!",
