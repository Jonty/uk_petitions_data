        "additional_details": "As reported in November 3rd Sunday Express by Journalist Geraint Jones - A Grace Kamara (77) was buried in ex-paratrooper grave. His body lay (disgracefully) in a mortuary 11 years before it was found in 2011.\r\nSouth Yorkshire police, which said there was \"no realistic prospect\" of conviction for misconduct or the prevention of a lawful burial and the C.P.S. concluded there was insufficient evidence to press charges...so that's alright then.!!!!\r\nMr. Alder nor Grace Kamara can speak for them selves perhaps someone with a conscience, at a senior level in government can?! Their respective families are grief stricken.\" devastated\"\r\nPlease sign this petition.\r\n",
