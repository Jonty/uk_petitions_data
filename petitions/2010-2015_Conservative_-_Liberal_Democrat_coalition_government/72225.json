        "additional_details": "I propose that the UK government speaks with the Governments of Canada, USA, Australia and create a visa that would allow citizens to move freely to the other countries permanently.\r\n\r\nThe new visa would give green card/permanent residency if you buy a house in that country with in 3 months, financially support yourself for 5 years and donate a set amount to charities per year for 5 years and pass background checks.. Benefits would include housing market, charity income, tax and economy.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the countries chosen are (History between countries, language, culture)\r\n\r\nI accept that this might be rejected and might be hard to implement but it would be worth it in the long term. For some people it is hard to meet the current requirements for permanent residency so by creating a new visa with different requirements would give a different avenue for people to try.",
