This man's continued affronts to British national culture are the greatest threat we as a country face today. Keith Jones must be STOPPED!\r\n\r\nAs a first step, the moderators of this site must ban Keith Jones from posting any more e-petitions. If this should prove innefectual then the government must take legislative measures to put a stop, once and for all, to the activities of this serial-petitioning fiend.",
