        "additional_details": "My unborn child has incomplete Shone's syndrome (complicated heart condition) this was not picked up at the routine 12 wk and 20 wk scan but at my growth scan at 32 weeks. I feel that without this scan then I would not be getting the support, information or treatment needed for him once he was born as it would take too long for his condition to be figured out, meaning precious time would have been lost. This petition is campaigning that a 32 week scan should be done on all women to help detect any problems not picked up in the 20 week scan. ",
