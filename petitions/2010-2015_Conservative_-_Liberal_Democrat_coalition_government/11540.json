        "additional_details": "There is mounting and compelling evidence that Foreign Aid payments made by our Prime Minister WITHOUT a mandate and in defiance of the majority of the country are being siphoned off to fund the lifestyles of despots and, most recently, it has become known that payments have been made to Taliban terrorists in Afghanistan.  To fund the Tabliban is to facilitate the murder of thousands of innocent Afghanis and hundreds of British and American soldiers killed in the line of duty.  Mr Cameron is complicit in these killings by virtue of his unique stance of ringfencing foreign aid to these people.  This must be stopped.  He must be stopped.  He MUST be put before a court and tried for the murder of thousands.",
