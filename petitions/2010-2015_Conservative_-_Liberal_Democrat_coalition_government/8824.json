The Rspca and other organisations have reported this in recent years too. It is proven that this type of offender often goes to commit  similar  offences against children or vulnerable adults. These people should be psychologically assessed and given appropriate sentences. A six month  or less prison sentence is not adequate for these crimes  in which the offenders  have a high rate of reoffending.",
