        "additional_details": "On July 1st 2014, Microsoft Corporation, a company in America, obtained a court order to take over Noip.com web domains on a technical claim that it was essential to shut down malware servers. Instead of shutting down the domains, Microsoft had in advance prepared numerous servers to capture all the the traffic from all innocent Noip users. The internet for at least 4 million domains which had serviced billions of users clicks had been routed to Microsoft servers along with copious amounts of information which has security and privacy value.\r\n\r\nTo deter foreign entities from hijacking internet domains owned by UK citizens, where no crime has been committed in the UK by the domain owner in the UK, or its customers that use domain services in the UK (who have been entirely innocent parties), then they should be entitled to compensation from foreign parties that have hijacked the internet domain despite laws that have evolved to become legal domain hijacking in a foreign country.",
