        "additional_details": "Recently a Police Constable empounded a mans car and left the visibly disabled man in snowand  -7c to find his own way home because the police computer said this man was not disabled. Laster after going to the station will all the documents to prove his case, the man had to wait 3hrs and still pay the costs to get his car back as the Police Constable  did not file any paperwork.\r\nFinally the inspector has said that he will get his \u00a3200 back and Taxi fares in, 28 days, but in the meantime, he can't pay his rent!\r\n\r\nSo the Police Constable may blame the computer, the Police inspector  blames the system.  The Police  have no shoulders it seems, but each Police Officer is maintaining the brand image of the Police force - one bad apple undoes the good work of all the others.\r\n\r\nWe need to hold that a Police Constable is personally accountable for his actions - he cant blame a computer database.\r\n\r\n",
