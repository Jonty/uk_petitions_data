        "additional_details": "There is a trend in the motor industry to supply new cars with a puncture repair kit instead of a spare wheel. This is not safe and puts lives of those visiting remote areas at risk, especially in winter. Please specify that new cars have minimum space saver spare. There are areas near cities that have no phone coverage. A blown tire in one of these is impossible to repair or renew. Spare would get one home. ",
