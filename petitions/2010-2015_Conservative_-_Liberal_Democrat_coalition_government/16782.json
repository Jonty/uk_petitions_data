        "additional_details": "Far too many children with autism in England are not getting the quality education they need and deserve. Too many parents have to fight the system to make it work: Many parents say they have to wait over a year to get the right support for their child and for some parents it is much longer. More and more parents have had to go to tribunal to get the support their child needs. The government speaks about parental choice this is not happening in the majority of cases. Parents want a real choice of educational provision. Choice means more than one option being available for every child locally and a system that works with the parent and not work against them. This means an education system designed to meet their child\u2019s needs and not the needs of their Local Authority.\r\n\r\n",
