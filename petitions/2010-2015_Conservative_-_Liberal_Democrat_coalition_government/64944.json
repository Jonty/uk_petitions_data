Russia who got boo'd all evening scored 89 points gaining 7th place!?\r\n\r\nIt is time to stop funding, and spend money on things closer to home more worthy.\r\n\r\nTime for the UK to Pull out and Stop Funding the Eurovision Song Contest.\r\n\r\nEnough is now enough, if Terry can pull out so can we!!",
