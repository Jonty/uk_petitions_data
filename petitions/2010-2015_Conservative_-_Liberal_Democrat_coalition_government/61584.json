        "additional_details": "No political party should be allowed to use a national flag or symbol to promote its identity e.g. the Scottish National Party and the Saltire. A national flag or symbol encompasses the whole of the population in the area affected, regardless of the disparate political or other affiliations in the country. A political party using such flags or symbols is traducing the identity of those who do not agree with its objectives and creates an environment where people feel pressured into compliance so as not to appear disloyal to their country. Any media published using such flags or symbols appears, wrongly, to carry the full weight and support of the whole populace.",
