        "additional_details": "Hello,\r\nI hope you take the time to read and think about my petition. On November the 19th 2014 mine and my sisters dad died due to causes related to alcoholism. During the 16 years I got to spend with my dad he had faced a struggle battling not only his mental issues but he had been fighting an on going battle with alcoholism which the NHS and other health proffessionals did not take seriously. In the last year of his life he had been in and out of hospital (in one instance with internal bleeding) with obvious signs of battling alcoholism and not once did anyone offer him any help for his underlying illness. I remember vividly seeing my dad crying because he felt so on his own and helpless against his addiction, which is a memory we shouldn't have to have if the right help and support was there for him. Not getting enough support from proffessional services has sadly played a part in him passing away leaving his three daughters and two grandchildren behind. Please Sign.",
