        "additional_details": "A request for the nationalisation of car insurance.\r\nFairer and more reasonable insurance premiums are needed.\r\nToo many of the comparison website show a massive disparity of their premiums. Why do prices vary so much.\r\nFor younger drivers, many who may not be able to afford their premiums have to pay over the course of their policy by paying instalments and therefore interest added.. .\r\n With some younger people not being able to afford car  insurance the risk of 'take and drive' crime is more pronounced  I feel.\r\nAnother point is insurers and the law should go after those who DO NOT PAY insurance instead of simply bumping up the cost to those who do\r\nWhy should a higher premium be based on where someone lives or on what job they do.?\r\nI therefore feel that the only way forward is for the nationalisation of car insurance premiums so that each individual who drives a vehicle pays fairer premiums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
