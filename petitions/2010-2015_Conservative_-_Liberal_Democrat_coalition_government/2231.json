        "additional_details": "We the undersigned posit that after Iraq and Afghanistan, British constitutional law should be changed to require that all future acts of war, and all deployments of the UK armed forces of any significant scale, henceforth be ratified directly by the people.\r\n\r\nIf possible, a Referendum should be issued before military action is taken. If, due to necessity of quick action, that is not possible, said referendum should be organized as soon as possible, and must be completed within 60 days.\r\n\r\nWe suggest that this be enshrined in our uncodified constitution as a requirement of the people on the Government, Prime Minister and Queen, before they embark on any significant military campaign.\r\n\r\n",
