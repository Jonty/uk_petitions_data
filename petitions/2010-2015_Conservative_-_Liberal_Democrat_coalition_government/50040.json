        "additional_details": "Altaf Hussain (leader of MQM Pakistan) delivered a very furious, provocative and inflammatory telephone address on 13 May 2013 from London to his followers in Karachi inciting them to kill innocent people. He threatened the establishment and government to separate Karachi from Pakistan. His ongoing speeches are a big danger to the sovereignty of any country. Altaf Hussain is carrying out all his sadistic urges from the comforts of his office in London using his Sofa and a Telephone. An enormous no of people have registered complaints against him to metropolitan police London.\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/urdu/pakistan/2013/05/130513_met_complaints_fz.shtml\r\nhttps://www.change.org/en-GB/petitions/house-of-commons-uk-arrest-altaf-hussain-for-spreading-terror-in-karachi-2\r\nMr George Galloway MP in house of commons has previously raised this issue.\r\nWe urge British Govt. for his exile and deportation out of UK as he is molesting the British Soil.",
