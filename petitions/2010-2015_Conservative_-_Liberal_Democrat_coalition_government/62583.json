        "additional_details": "Southampton City Council has decided to close Millbrook Youth Club to save money. This means that the people who attend will not be able to go there anymore and will suffer. The Youth Club is invite only, and helps children with their confidence and behaviour. Without it, they could lose out on their school work due to the lack of confidence. Please help us by signing the petition and save The Youth Club.",
