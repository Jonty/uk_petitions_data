        "additional_details": "Mr Matthew Orford, MP for Hendon is calling for a ban on the sale of use of electric shock collars for dogs. He presented a 10 Minute Rule Bill to The House of Common on 22 Jan 2014.\r\n\r\nMr Orford revealed that the government department responsible for canine welfare commissioned research using tax-payers' money which clearly showed that shock collars are detrimental to the physical AND psychological health of dogs!\r\n\r\nYet DEFRA continue not to act in banning shock collars!\r\n\r\nThe Bill was well received by all members of the House of Commons. Let's follow what the Government of Wales has done and make horrible shock collars ILLEGAL.",
