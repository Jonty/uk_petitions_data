        "additional_details": "CRB checks for individuals who are and will be working with children or vulnerable adults is correct. Yet I believe the requirements needed for the CRB checks need adjustment. As an example, my sister-in law who is a school leaver wants to pursue a career in child care. A CRB check is needed for the relevant college course, this is difficult for a school leaver as most dont have the documentation requested due to their age. School leavers/ Age 16 to 18 adjustment! Please support this petition.",
