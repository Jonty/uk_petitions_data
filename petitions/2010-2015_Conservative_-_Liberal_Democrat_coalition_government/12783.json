        "additional_details": "It has long been the case that as wholesale gas and electricity prices INCREASE, so do our utility bills. However, when wholesale prices REDUCE, these reductions are far slower (if at all) to hit customer's bills.\r\n\r\nWe need to stop this practise immediately. We need to directly link the cost of gas and electricity on our bills, to the wholesale cost of gas and electricity from the fields from where they are extracted.\r\n\r\nIf we can achieve this (in law), then the nation's households can be confident that as wholesale costs fluctuate, we continue to pay a fair price for the fuel as we receive our bills.",
