        "additional_details": "At 16, people are allowed to leave school, start work, pay tax, be married, join the army, join in with the national lottery. Why can't a 16 year old have a chance to vote? A 16 year old is supposed pay the taxes the government has put on the country when working in a job , they join the world of work but have no say over who runs their country. The 16 year olds are classed more or less adults in todays society and must be given the right to choose who and how their country is run, seeing as 16 year old upward are the people who will begin to feel the challenge of adulthood. Please allow 16 year olds to vote in the elections.",
