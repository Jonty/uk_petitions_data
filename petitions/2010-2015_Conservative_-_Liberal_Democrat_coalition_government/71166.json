        "additional_details": "We call upon the Government to implement a compulsory breeding license in order to\r\ntackle the many issues associated with the current non-regulation of dog breeding: the soaring number of abandoned dogs, dogs being euthanised for space, overwhelmed rescue centres, the rising number of dog attacks/thefts & the use of home breeding as a tax-free income supplement.\r\n\r\nMajority of professional breeders already breed responsibly and care deeply about the welfare and future of the dogs they produce. Many would welcome new regulations which would improve overall animal welfare across the UK. In the same way many new owners would prefer to buy a dog from a reputable licensed breeder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
