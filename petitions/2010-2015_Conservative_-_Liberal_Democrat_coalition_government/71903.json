        "additional_details": "On Thursday 9th December 2010, the coalition won the vote to raise the tuition fee cap to \u00a39000 per annum from the academic year of 2012. Despite all our pleas and cries the Government have stood adamant. Students from poorer backgrounds have been hit the hardest. Many of them are discouraged to go to University due to the sky soaring fees. Thousands each year are deprived of the right to an education. We, youths, need to convey our message to the Government. This e-petition is a bid to urge the Government to lower the tuition fees to a reasonable amount. ",
