        "additional_details": "The idea of socialism is a good one yes. But its ideals and consequences are not. Now that it has been tried and has ultimately not prevented the poor from suffering, just kept them in a trap for generations to come, it is time for change. The welfare trap is the governments fault, and ultimately people may disagree, but it is the governments duty to protect these people from generations of it. The Welfare state is used as a hammock not as a safety net, and that is wrong for people who are stuck on it, and the people forced to pay for it. The action that I would like to see, would be the reduction in the amount eligible for out of work benefits, disability benefits, child benefits and the disposing of the state pension for anybody who has yet to start paying into it, in return making it law to have a private pension. With in the long term aim of taxes to be lowered, yet in the mean while the money saved here, to be directed in helping the country become more prosperous.",
