        "additional_details": "The Home Office should assist the reunification of British families rather than further obstruct family reunion by delaying the movement of necessary papers required for the issuance of visas.\r\n\r\nIn the situation where an Immigration Judge has allowed an appeal against UKBA's refusal to issue a Spousal Visa and the determination was made on Human Rights grounds the Home Office should not delay further process by not forwarding the necessary paperwork.\r\n\r\nIt is common practice for the Home Office to use this delay tactic which forces families to remain separated for months after the determination.\r\n\r\nDelaying paperwork is unacceptable and against the spirit of Human Rights Law concerning families and natural justice.\r\nPapers should be transfered between departments within days not months.
