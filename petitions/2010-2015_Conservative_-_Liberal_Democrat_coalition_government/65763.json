        "additional_details": "Car alarms, shop alarms and house alarms should all be banned, forcing owners to invest in more effective measures that don't disturb people unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nNobody ever pays any attention to these alarms when they go off, since most of the time they have done so by mistake, and many sound for an unnecessarily long time.\r\n\r\nIn areas with lots of shops and parked cars, these alarms can be an almost daily occurrence and cause real nuisance to nearby residents and workers.\r\n\r\nThe health impact of these alarms is well known, causing costs in turn to the NHS and lost economic productivity.\r\n\r\nI really do think the country would be a better place without sound alarms, and that this could be easily achieved with a ban on these devices.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you agree.\r\n",
