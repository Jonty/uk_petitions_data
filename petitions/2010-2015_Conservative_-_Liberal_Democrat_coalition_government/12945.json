        "additional_details": "If we pay the same type and amount of benefits as those in France and make immigrants responsible for paying for their own health care we can reduce the numbers of immigrants coming here for a free ride and help reduce our budget defecit without cutting services.\r\nThis would also be beneficial to the French as immigration camps in Calais would cease to exist: immigrants would no longer view England and the land of plenty with free housing, money and health care.\r\nToo many people travel many of thousands of miles through safe countries. This is because they know that they will be provided with money, housing and health care here. No other country in Europe gives as much as we do. We are a small island with finite resources and an infinite amount of people travelling here to access them.\r\nStop paying money to those who are only here to cash in on benefits you have worked to pay for.",
