        "additional_details": "We believe this country's cultural identity is built upon freedoms, not rights. We believe that one of the greatest legacy this country has given to the world is the idea of separation between judiciary and legislature and the freedoms of the press. We believe the government must resist the calls of a special interest pressure group to enforce the recommendations of the Leveson report, which would undermine the freedom of the press and the cultural heritage of this country.\r\n\r\nIndeed how can we as a country push for more freedom in what we regard as oppressive states when we are enforcing a more Orwellian society at home? All of the victims who's horrific experiences gave rise to the enquiry were subject to criminal actions which can be dealt with through existing legislation.",
