The children that nobody has tried to help because they simply were not aware of it? 2-3 people for each primary school will sent down with a child for 5-10 minutes just to have a chat about family life. Children at these ages are vunerable and are not going to think twice about telling someone the truth about something to them is so trivial. If something is said that raises concerns, the worker would get the address of the child from the school office and report it. We simply want to save more children that are being overlooked!",
