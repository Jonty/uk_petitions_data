        "additional_details": "just recently the government has announced with the sia that they intend to move the regulation of the security industry to a privatised body and let employers be in control of checking crb's for employees etc. do you think that is safe? look how many security firms flaunt the law at the minute[whilst the government is the regulator] how do you think they are going to behave when a privatised body with less powers is in charge?\r\nmyself and many others say no! keep the sia for all of our safety, just regulate better.\r\nimplement a fitness test, educational requirements [gcse's grade d and above in 3 subjects], ensure that licenced individuals have been a uk resident for more than 10 years so a full crb can be done on them [ crb's dont show if an individual has been a criminal abroad]\r\n\r\nwhilst we are posting this petition we felt it nessascary to point out that security staff need more powers!\r\npowers of arrest to stop criminals running\r\nproper reasonable force guidelines and permissions",
