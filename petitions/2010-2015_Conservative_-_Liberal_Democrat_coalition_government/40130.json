The wining party would be able to elect the PM and 45% of the cabinet seats, the would have to offer 32.5% of the seats to the party coming in second and 17.5% to the 3rd party and remaining 5% to all others.  In doing so there is still a reason for the parties to look to win the election.\r\n\r\nIt stops a single party running away with their own agenda.  It forces the parties to work together to bring together their collective expertise.  It spots fighting decisions simply because its the other parties idea and not their own.  The rest of the party mp's all sit in opposition independently and push their own parties beliefs and values so that they may be elected in as the leading party to steer the government for its term.  It will also allow all votes in elections to count for something, even for independents as they will all have a chance to contribute.",
