        "additional_details": "Westminsters greedy,corrupt,arrogant and unpatriotic politicians have abandoned the values,heritage,beliefs and ideals of our native people by allowing and encouraging mass immigration to the U.K.The natives of these shores are being subjected to a blatant tyranny that is causing unnecessary suffering to its people.Our oppressive and cruel governments both past and present have blatantly ignored the British people and are turning the U.K. into a unwanted and unrecognisable foreign land.Politicians continue to ignore the vast majority of the general publics fears and concerns and instead continue to concentrate on there own personal greedy agendas.Mosques are dominating our skyline,halal food is being served without warning,terrorists are being born and bred in the U.K. and all the while native Brits are being treated like second class citizens.Therefore politicians should be charged with treason for crimes against Britain and its people.",
