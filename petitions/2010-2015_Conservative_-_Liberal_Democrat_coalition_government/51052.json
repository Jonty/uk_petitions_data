        "additional_details": "There is a nation wide issue confronting Mother and Fathers of babies and toddlers, that is that more and more bus companies find it acceptable to leave a person with a pram stranded on the side of the road in all sorts of weather. This is being done for various reasons. We are Mothers and Fathers with young children. We are tax paying citizens. We pay for our tickets, so why is it ok that the youngest and part of the frailest part of our population is regualrly left sitting on the sides of roads nation wide in all sorts of weather. Laws should be put into place where prams are allowed priority on buses the same as wheelchairs, as our circumstances are the same. We can not travel with out our prams, and we shouldn't suffer for it!",
