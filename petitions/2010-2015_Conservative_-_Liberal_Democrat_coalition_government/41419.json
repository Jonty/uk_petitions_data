Jobs involving Police, doctors, nurses, teachers, care workers you could be classed as a TAINTED individual no matter how long ago you were cautioned/reprimanded.\r\nthis is a very important issue of individual rights and freedoms. Since discussing this issue I am amazed how many people have been affected by this. It is unfair for a child or anyone in the same situation to be penalized for the rest of their lives for a minor mistake made when they were young.\r\nPlease go to Govyou.co.uk to see how many people have been affected by this.\r\nPlease sign this petition to help the many decent children and adults affected by this.",
