        "additional_details": "VAT for energy saving products and measures is generally 5%.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Energy Saving Trust, one of the most cost effective and carbon reducing measures we can take in our homes is to replace single glazing with double glazing. This will reduce heating bills by at least 15%.\r\n\r\nAccording to section 2.18 of HMRC notice Notice 708/6 (Energy Saving Materials), double glazing is specifically excluded and attracts VAT at 20%.\r\n\r\nTarget45Plus note that installing solar panels saves 0.5-1 tonne per year (5% VAT) and fitting double glazing saves at least one tonne per year (20% VAT).\r\n\r\nThe one-off cost to the treasury for reducing VAT on an average double-glazing install of \u00a32000 would be around \u00a3300.\r\n\r\nThe cost to the treasury of 5% VAT on a \u00a312,000 solar PV install is \u00a31,800, to save around half the amount of carbon.\r\n\r\nI call on the Government to remove this discrepancy and help lower bills and cut carbon emissions by reducing VAT to 5% on energy saving double glazing.",
