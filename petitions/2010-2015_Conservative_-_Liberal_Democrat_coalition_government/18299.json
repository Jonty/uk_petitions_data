        "additional_details": "From 1 December drivers will be fined for parking on single yellow lines and will have to pay to park in metered bays from 6.30pm to midnight. The charges cover the whole of the West End as well as Mayfair and much of Marylebone.\r\n\r\nDespite the idea of Westminster to reduce congestion, it will directly impact all London businesses within the affected zone. The result being less and less consumers entering London during 'off-peak' hours and ultimately driving all forms of trade out of the West End.\r\n\r\nI want the Government to review and abolish this decision of change to charging.",
