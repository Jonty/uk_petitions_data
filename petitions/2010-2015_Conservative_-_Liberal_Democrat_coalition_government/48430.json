        "additional_details": "Working couples of all ages should be priority on the social/councils housing lists as we are paying what we should be paying into the system.\r\nExample - me and my girlfriend are 20 and 22, we have both been working since we left school and paying all of our taxes into the country, We do not want kids until we have our own home and have a steady strong income and we both like many others that we know are happy to pay taxes and pay for property rent prices but we still get no priority whats so ever. We have been told by tower hamlets council that we would not be considered for atleast 4 years despite us being a working couple and that the council do not check if people are working or not. It just seems like people who do not work or couples who have kids very young get this priority of couples that want to do it all the correct way.\r\n\r\nus and many others feel this is so wrong and we want to change this.
