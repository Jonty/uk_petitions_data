        "additional_details": "We see our brave military personnel being aggressively targeted in public too often.\r\n\r\nThreatening, abusive and insulting behaviour is absolutely unacceptable in a civilised nation.\r\n\r\nWe have legislation which prevents antagonism based on racist & religious grounds. Our heroic military personnel deserve equal protection.\r\n\r\nWe need a robust & moral stand against any individual who openly attacks our Armed Forces ~ verbally; through signs or over the Internet.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to secure primary legislation (a full range of offences akin to religiously aggravated offences) with stiff penalties to deter & incarcerate people with intolerant attitudes towards our military personnel.\r\n\r\nOur Armed Forces are a significant part of our heritage & proud history. They have protected our freedom for centuries. They deserve our support.",
