These things typically have very small (5-600cc) engines and, with modern engine systems, are very green. It would only be fair then to also tax them according to their emisions group rather than the full tax taken at present. Even if they are not eventually measured, common sense will tell us they must be among the greenest vehicles so should be zero or very low rated   ",
