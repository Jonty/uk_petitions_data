Leaving the non-resident powerless.\r\n\r\nIf the parent with care (resident parent) is receiving CSA paymetns, they should be forced to allow the non resident parent contact with the child they are paying for.\r\n\r\nCSA payments should still be enforsed, but if the non resident parents wants contact and can prove that the resident parent is refusing to let them see their child. They should not be entitled to any payment until it can be seen that they are encouraging contact again.\r\n\r\nThe CSA system is being abused by resident parents, who simply want to cause the non resident parent emotional harm.",
