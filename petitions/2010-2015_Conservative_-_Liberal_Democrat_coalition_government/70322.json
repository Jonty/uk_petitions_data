        "additional_details": "This petition is to ask for the routine use of ultra sound scans during labour to decrease the risk of stillbirths.\r\nThe use of ultra sound scans would help the medical staff see the position of the umbilical cord, the size of the babys head compared to the size of the mothers pelvis, the position of the placenta etc. It would help assess the need for a c section sooner and prevent unnecessary c sections.\r\nThe UK has one of the highest still birth rates within the developed countries. This is shameful when such a simple procedure could save thousands of babys lives every year.",
