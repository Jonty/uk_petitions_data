However in the present financial global state we find ourselves in. We have slashed all departments and cut wages and social security etc. Causing poverty and hardship for many of our own citizens can we really afford to be paying billions in foreign aid? I say this is a good idea in times when we have the cash to spare but why are we paying millions in interest to simply give money we do not have to other countries? Simply suspend all aid till we can afford it.",
