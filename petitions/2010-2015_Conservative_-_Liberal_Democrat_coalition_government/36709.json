        "additional_details": "I have ALWAYS worried that thieving shopkeepers could try to swindle people out of winnings by telling ticket checkers that they have no winning numbers and then offer to destroy the ticket.  Actually, there has now been another case when a thieving shopkeeper attempted to swindle a punter out of a million pound prize.  If the ticket machine rings a very loud bell every time a winning ticket is checked - NO MATTER HOW SMALL OR HOW LARGE THE AMOUNT CONCERNED - then thieving shopkeepers cannot get away with it any more.  Refusal by our government to install this protection for punters will indicate just how little concern they have over the possibility of the 'little people' of this land - those whose only hope is a win on the lottery - being ripped off.",
