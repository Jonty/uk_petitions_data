        "additional_details": "Constant adverts promising people compensation have been responsible for a compensation culture here in the UK.\r\n\r\nTo deal with this problem, advertising for compensation should be restricted. Because of the complicated nature of restricting advertising, I would suggest that for now, we should just ban all television adverts that promise compensation, and leave other forms of advertising alone for now.\r\n\r\nIf we ban TV advertising for compensation, it is a step in the right direction for clamping down on the UK's ridiculous compensation culture.",
