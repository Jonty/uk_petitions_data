        "additional_details": "Energy companies are getting meter readings wrong. It might be the number of units used or in my case the unit type (m3 instead of ft3) despite it being right for years with the previous suppliers.\r\n\r\nInstead of correcting the problem they are hiding behind incompetent policy driving automated computer systems that are extracting as much money from the customer, often before it is due, in the hope customers won't notice.\r\n\r\nThey are doing this by using the easy direct debit calculation route, which all too often does not reflect the actual use, despite historical usage data.\r\n\r\nI suffered a year of harassment; wrong bills, continued threat to legal action, credit rating, etc despite them knowing their error. Switching did not solve the problem as they passed on the error!\r\n\r\nIf you have similar problems and want the government to:\r\n1. Make the energy companies pay for their errors, and\r\n2. Make them pay for the harassment that they inflict on innocent customers then please sign.",
