        "additional_details": "Money is tight for everybody and fuel retailers are doing little to assist. Retail fuel price are constantly raised as soon as the market prices rise but they take 3-4 weeks to lower prices when wholesale prices come down and even then the whole amount is never passed on. My proposal is three fold: A cap on how much profit retailers can make on a Litre of fuel (i.e. 3p max). A fairer system to be introduced to adjust prices and that is to ensure that all price adjustments are made at the end of day's UK  stockmarket trading with any price rises/falls are adjusted by the retailers that evening, lastly any form of profiteering to be dealt with by way of a prison sentence for the head of the Company as it is they who are ultimately responsible for the actions of there company.",
