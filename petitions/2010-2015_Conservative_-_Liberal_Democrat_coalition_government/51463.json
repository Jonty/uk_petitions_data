This could be done by allowing the house of lords  to put  legislation up for referendum that it is against but believe the public should have a  say on . It would also make the house of lords more democratic  and stop the  house of commons pushing through laws and disregarding the second house. The lords could get a maximum referral each parliament and any referendum would be held at the same time as the next general election.  ",
