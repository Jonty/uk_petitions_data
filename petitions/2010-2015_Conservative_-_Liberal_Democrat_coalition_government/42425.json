        "additional_details": "Following the astonishing news that three foster children in Rotherham were removed from their foster parents/carers because they were members of a political party (UKIP), the children had to be separated from each other (1 brother from his brother and sister), which is deeply upsetting. The membership of a political party should not be a factor when CRB checks and other safeguarding measures have already been completed. At the end of the day, political belief is an opinion and everyone may have their opinion about ALL political parties. The children should be returned to what has been reported as a \"loving household\" and this kind of misjudgement should NEVER be allowed to happen again.",
