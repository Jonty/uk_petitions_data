        "additional_details": "This law is being misinterpreted and has been used to convict predominantly young men for crimes which they simply did not commit.\r\nExample:\r\nBeing in the same locality with an individual who was carrying a knife is used in a very lax way to convict MULTIPLE individuals of the actual use of the knife. The intent is questionable and this is essentially guilt by association.\r\nThe application of this law needs to be ring-fenced and regulated to prevent any further instances of injustice.\r\nThis could very easily be your youthful naive brother or cousin as they do not need to commit a crime just be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Just think about your teenage years and think how this law could have been used against you/your child/brother/sister\u2026. ",
