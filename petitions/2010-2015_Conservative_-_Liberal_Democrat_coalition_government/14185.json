        "additional_details": "Ireland plans compulsory, full sleeve day-glo jackets for riders and pillions, France is debating compulsory reflective day-glo clothing. In UK, headlights are already compulsory for most motorcycles, and still careless drivers pull out in front of them. High vis jackets will make no difference to motorcycle accident rates.  We say the blaim should NOT be passed on to the victim and wearing of reflective clothing should be a matter of choice, without prejudice.",
