        "additional_details": "How dare Cadbury's not use Dairy Milk Chocolate in their Cadbury's Creme Egg. This is the equivalent of knocking down a listed building. Their argument is that they are not called Dairy Milk so they can change the chocolate.  Cadbury's is synonymous with Dairy Milk. This is the thin end of the wedge. The now American company that run Cadbury's has no understanding the importance of the traditional Cadbury's taste, Dairy Milk, to the British palate. This lack of respect for British values must be stopped now. This is the thin end of the wedge. ",
