        "additional_details": "We the undersigned note with alarm that a petition is gathering strength in the USA to have Piers Morgan deported back to the UK. Despite agreeing with his sentiments about gun control we believe his return to the UK would be further evidence in a decline in our Nation's standing. Piers Morgan is a nasty disingenuous creep and, as such, has much to commend himself to members of The National Rifle association in the USA.\r\nThis Country is far better for his absence and we implore Her Majesty's Government to block any attempt to repatriate him.",
