        "additional_details": "Gravity is a force which exerts a pressure of 14.7 pounds per square inch which is universal across the entire earth - therefore gravity is an energy source and based upon the laws of nature there must be a way to harness energy from this source.\r\n\r\nThe continuing burning of fossil fuels is contributing to global warming which is bringing an increasing volume of floods, volcanic activity, earthquakes and freak weather and yet still everyday we continue to add to the problem - we must invest now in pure green energy if mankind is to survive and finding a way to harness energy from gravity can provide a 100% green energy source as well as giving low cost energy to the population.\r\n\r\nNature is creating an unlimited natural energy source so vast that the answer to all of humankinds energy problems is right in front of our nose and instead we choose to overlook this source and foolish continue destroying our habital.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to get the goverment to look into this.",
