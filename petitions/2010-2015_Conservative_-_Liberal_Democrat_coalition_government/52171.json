The lads at Mellish Sports Centre are all young, qualified and enthusiastic about sport and helping people in their quest for fitness.\r\nThere are many classes and with a bit of promotion I'm sure that we would be able to create an even bigger membership.\r\nPlease sign and help keep our local gym and save jobs.\r\n",
