We want the government to put pressure on companies and councils to invest in AEDs that can be accessed by anyone in an event of a cardiac arrest.\r\n\r\nWe are aware that the National Defibrillator Program is in place but money is very limited. We are also aware of the work the British heart foundation is doing but more needs to be done.\r\n\r\nCardiac arrests account for a large amount of deaths in this country every year.\r\n\r\nWith basic life support skills and an Automated External Defibrillator someone chances of survival during this event can dramatically increase. Yet AEDs are not readily available and accessible to the public. People often die because help cant get to them quick enough. Cardiac arrests are time critical and people are dying unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
