        "additional_details": "Students who are aged 19-24yrs have no government financial support. We have a 21yr old in Further Education and he is not entitled to free NHS eye, dental care or prescriptions. These students can't apply for loans or grants and the banks won't even consider them because they aren't in full time employment.. They aren't eligible for JSA because they are in full time education. If they're lucky enough to get a job, they don't have the time to complete coursework and it still doesn't cover costs. Many are seriously stressed due to financial worries or the sheer embarrassment of parents giving them hangouts. Many will be industry/trade ready when they qualify and in a better position to repay student loans. Unlike the vast majority of graduates, who are fully funded and arrive in a saturated market. Most of whom end up claiming benefits. Where is the justice, particularly when the Government say the country desperately needs more skilled workers? Time to say enough is enough!",
