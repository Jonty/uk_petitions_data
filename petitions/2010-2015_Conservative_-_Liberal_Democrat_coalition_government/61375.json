        "additional_details": "As a motorist that doesn't do many miles myself i feel the tax pricing system is getting out of control. I feel that  the tax disc should be abolished and instead the Road Fund Licence should be added to the price at the pump. Why? It will work like a pay as you scheme. The more you use the roads the more you wear them so therefore the high milers pay for overall maintenance compared to daily shoppers doing less miles. Carbon emissions and engine cc is completely irrelevant. If you were to think logically it will change driving habits, save money both personally and for the government long term. So if you feel that this statement is relevant please sign it   ",
