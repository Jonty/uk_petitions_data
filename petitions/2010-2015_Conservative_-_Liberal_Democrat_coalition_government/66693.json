        "additional_details": "Train drivers, taxi drivers,  bus drivers, car drivers, air pilots who follow Ramadan fast. During Ramadan, adult Muslims stop eating,\r\ndrinking, and smoking each day between dawn and\r\nsunset.   Unfortunately in Northern Countries such as the UK the period of fasting is more extreme than that of equatorial countries from where these beliefs originated from. There is the iftar rush hour when they break their fast after sunset.  Muslim drivers,pilots, doctors  etc who take part in this fasting should refrain from working during this time,  due to the fact they will be severely dehydrated, low blood sugar, irritable, tired or fatigued  and in no mood for work of any description.The dangers of fasting for aeroplane pilots, drivers of public service vehicle, including pedestrians are obvious and serious. Have a look at the  Adverse Effects of Islamic Fasting,  it is worse than drink driving ! ",
