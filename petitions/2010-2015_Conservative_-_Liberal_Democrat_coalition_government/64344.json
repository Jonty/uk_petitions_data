        "additional_details": "My 14 year old son is alive today because his friends had attended CPR sessions at school. I can think of no more useful thing to learn than life saving skills and cannot believe that it is not part of the National Curriculum. It is a skill that we may all need or need to use.  In addition to CPR and first aid skills the advancements in easy use and availability of  automated external defibrillator devices (AED) could be easily learned and used by children to give them the confidence to save lives.  I would like it to become an annual update session within PSHE for the teachers ,staff and pupils to do together and for every school to have an AED on site. I realise time and budgets are tight but what is more important than this ? ",
