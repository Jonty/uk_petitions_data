        "additional_details": "For everybody in the 50% tax bracket meaning they earn above \u00a3150,000 has to pay \u00a31 per month to the football administration fund and everybody else has to pay 5 pence per month. This fund will be used to bail out all football clubs in the United Kingdom that enter administration. Football clubs provide us with hundreds of jobs which help keep out economy ticking over which is very much needed at present.  Not only that but they make people forget about all their troubles and allow them to enjoy themselves without a care in the world and it is a great blow to the whole footballing community if a club ceases to exist.",
