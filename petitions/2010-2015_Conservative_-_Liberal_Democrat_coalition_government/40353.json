I consider myself, alongside other ex-pat but passionate Scots, one of these people.\r\n\r\nAs such, I think it's imperative to change the definition and allow the vote as detailed above.\r\n\r\nYou'll note, I haven't expressed which way I would vote. It's not about trying to sway the result - just ensuring all of the people of Scotland have their say.",
