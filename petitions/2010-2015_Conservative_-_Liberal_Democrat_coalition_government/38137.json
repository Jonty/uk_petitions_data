        "additional_details": "We, as a nation are sick of going to various supermarkets (or smaller independant off licenses, of which need to be kept in mind in such a knackered economy) and finding that our beloved alcoholic beverage; Red Stripe, is only generally sold in packs of 4 cans, which can be very costly when bought in large quantities. We want it to be sold in crates, where a much more convenient sale price can be achieved due to the larger quantity of beverages being sold per transaction. This would provide all Red Stripe lovers with much needed access to cheaper Red Stripe, which seems to be the only alcoholic beverage in a can that isn't sold in crates on a mass scale. The time for change is now",
