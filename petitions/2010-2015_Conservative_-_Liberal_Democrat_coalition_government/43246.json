The leaders of the governments army divisions and the president himself should be tried, the president's brother and whoever else from the \"top brass\" is alleged to have been involved in the slaughter of innocents should also face justice. May the 10's of thousands of innocent people who were murdered rest in peace. Thank you, and spread the word.",
