I propose a form of sentencing that would keep the most persistent offenders off the streets whilst remaining proportionate.\r\n\r\nI suggest  \u201cRecycled Sentencing\" in which the courts sentence as they do now, but each subsequent sentence includes all previous sentences as well.\r\n\r\nSuppose for a first offence a person gets a \u00a3100 fine.\r\n\r\nFor a second offence they might get 1 month in prison for example, PLUS the \u00a3100 fine again.\r\n\r\nFor their third offence maybe they get 6 months in prison, PLUS the one month again, PLUS another \u00a3100 fine.\r\n\r\nEven if they are bound over to keep the peace, having been convicted they would risk getting all previous sentences too.\r\n\r\nPersistent offenders will automatically end up with progressively tougher sentences, and will be kept off the streets for longer and longer. This method is humane and proportionate unlike 'three strikes' and similar drastic ideas.",
