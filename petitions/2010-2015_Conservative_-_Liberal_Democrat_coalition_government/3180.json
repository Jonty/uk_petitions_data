        "additional_details": "Mountain rescue teams in England and Wales are currently funded by voluntrary contributions with some small grants. The teams are like the lifeboats considered as the fourth rescue service and use vehicles with blue lights etc. Members usually fund personal equipment themselves as well as team equipment. Scotland however has funded teams. The government needs to redress the balance and provide suitable funding as soon as possible. ",
