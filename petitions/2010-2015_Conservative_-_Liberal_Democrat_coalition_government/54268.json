We strongly believe the UK government has misled the British people (largely sustained by the news media).\r\n\r\nWe believe the UK government\u2019s stance on Syria is narrow-minded, ignoring \u2018inconvenient truths\u2019 about the Syrian rebels, exacerbating the conflict in Syria. We also believe the actions of the UK government (through possible collusion and intervention) to be undemocratic, immoral, and illegal.\r\n\r\nWe call for an independent enquiry into the government\u2019s policy on the Syrian Civil War.\r\n",
