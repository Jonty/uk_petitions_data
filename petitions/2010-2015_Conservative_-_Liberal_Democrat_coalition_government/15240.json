        "additional_details": "Many users of home heating oil only use it because they do not have access to other sources of energy like Gas. Since 2008, the cost during the summer months have risen from 32p a litre to 57p a litre a real term rise of \u00a3250 on 1000 litres of home heating fuel which people can no longer afford.\r\n\r\nBecause the home heating oil companies are unregulated they not only control the price of the fuel but can artificially increase it as they did during the winter of 2010/2011 and then refused to lower their charges in line with costs per barrel. Furthermore, even when the ships carrying the fuel arrive in the UK, they are held off shore to artificially increase the cost by causing a shortage nationally, this should also be made an offense.\r\n\r\nWe ask that the government regulate the UK home heating oil industry and ensure cartels are not formed, and ensure when the price of global oil comes down, this industry follows suit in real terms.",
