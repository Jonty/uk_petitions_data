        "additional_details": "UK debt levels are equivalent to \u00a316,000+ per person. This petition asks the Treasury to sell some of that debt to tax payers. In exchange they will give tax payers a low income tax rate for a defined period of time. With interest rates at a low level, it is more cost effective for savers to exchange savings for lower tax payments. And it will help the Government reduce the debt burden quickly.",
