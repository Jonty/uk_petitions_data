There are many videos showing it has raised the immune system meaning people have better fought off cancer.\r\n\r\nI wish for the department of health to enforce all doctors to be forced to get more education on healing by the use nutrition in food, and support groups that help with this and general excise motivation. Nutrition Facts dot Org is just one website that uses peer reviews to show the truth behind this.\r\n\r\nI think far too often it feels like doctors just want to sling shot pills down patient\u2019s throats and kick them out the door rather then heal the patients. This would show that they\u2019re not all just drugs sales men and have a good understanding of how food and excise affects the body.\r\n",
