        "additional_details": "Three people die every day in Britain waiting for urgent organ transplants, and there are currently 7,450 people on the waiting list.\r\n\r\nMore than four in 10 families reject requests for their relatives' organs to be donated after their death.\r\n\r\nDonors opt in. They consent, they carry a card, they are taking a conscious decision. This shouldn't be denied after their death.\r\n\r\nNot only does asking families to make this decision reduce the number of vital organs available for transplant it also puts them in a unnecessarily stressful position. In the immediacy of death parents are being asked to make a very emotional decision and if they overrule the family member's wishes they may come to regret that in the future and have to come to terms with denying their child's final wish.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to help make this important change.\r\n\r\nClick here for a recent article on the subject http://ind.pn/VgxY1H\r\n",
