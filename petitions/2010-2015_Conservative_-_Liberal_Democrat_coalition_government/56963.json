        "additional_details": "This is a petition to collect as many signatures as possible to have the ministry of justice take a good hard look at the 'Marine A' case.\r\n\r\nMarine A is going to get locked up for murder for killing an already seriously injured terrorist in Afghanistan. This is a man who has devoted his life to protecting us, the people of Great Britain so the least we can do for him is to get a true government awareness of how we feel about this.\r\n\r\nMarine A and his comrades put their lives on the line, see each other get blown up, get shot and even beheaded. Yet when Marine A kills a terrorist (his job) he gets locked up. This is another case of EU madness and an eye opener as to why the Geneva Convention needs to be looked at. Thank You and please show your support.",
