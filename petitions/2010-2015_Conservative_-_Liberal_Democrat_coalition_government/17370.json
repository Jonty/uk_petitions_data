Supreme Court failed to deliver justice on a technical matter rather than common law and common sense, although Lord Phillips has said that Bank Charges could be assessed for fairness under different regulations.\r\n\r\nWhy has the OFT not persued this angle in the name of justice for consumers?\r\n\r\nWhy have all governments who showed support before election all gone quiet.\r\n\r\nWe understand times are hard but a wrong is a wrong and without putting it right, people continue to suffer these charges from hard earned wages and deducted from benefits causing financial hardship for hundreds of thousands of people.\r\n\r\nRefund charges anything charged in excess of \u00a312 going back to July 2001 plus statutory interest.\r\n\r\n",
