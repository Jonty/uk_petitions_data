        "additional_details": "Introduce a proper rigorous difficult driving test that can only be passed by competent to skilled drivers. Holders of this license will be allowed to travel at peak times. Those who don't have it must wait until say 10am to drive. The rationale is that incompetent drivers actually obstruct & endanger all road users. The result will be massive reduction in congestion as competent drivers will be at work before the incompetent ones are 'released'. The test will generate the economy also.",
