        "additional_details": "I believe that the Epilepsy Clinic at SMH that is run on a monday morning should not be closed, as myself and all the other epilepsy sufferers would have nowhere to go.  I have a complicated medical history, and I prefer to see someone that I trust, than a neurologist that I don't.  Most people take Anti-Convulsants that are dangerous to interfere with, and the specialist that myself and others see, is the only one for NW London, so please don't close the clinic otherwise the consequences are going to be dire.  My neuro was told that he wasn't seeing enough \"new\" patients, but how can a patient be referred to a specialist clinic, unless their GP has heard of the said clinic? I never heard of Dr White, untill someone told me about him at a meeting 11 years ago, so there's my point. Leave the clinic alone.",
