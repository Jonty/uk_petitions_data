        "additional_details": "A number of studies demonstrate that men and women do not receive equal pay. There is one simple way of changing this. Grant equal compulsory maternity and paternity leave to both men and women. This way, a company will not be taking a greater financial risk by employing a woman instead of a man and a father\u2019s role will be appreciated. Until we have equal rights in the home, we will not have equal pay in the workplace. This subject requires serious attention and debate in the Houses of Parliament.",
