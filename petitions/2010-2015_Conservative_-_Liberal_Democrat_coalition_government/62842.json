        "action": "Discriminatory amendment to British law",
        "additional_details": "It has been reported in the press today that Islamic law is set to be enshrined in the British legal system under guidelines for solicitors on drawing up \u201cSharia compliant\u201d wills. Guidance produced by The Law Society will allow solicitors to write Islamic wills that deny women an equal share of inheritances and exclude unbelievers altogether. The documents, which would be recognised by Britain\u2019s courts, will prevent adopted children and those born out of wedlock, from being counted as legitimate heirs. Anyone married in a church or civil ceremony, could be excluded from succession under Sharia principles, which recognise only Muslim weddings for inheritance purposes.\r\n\r\nI demand that the Government stop this discriminatory   amendment which violates not only women's rights, but the basic human right of each individual to fair and equal treatment before the law.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to ensure that we force the Government to stop this ill considered and unnecessary change.",
