        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the BBC Local Radio to give more support to up and coming musicians from niche genres. In recent years, the BBC have axed many popular country, folk, easy, jazz and indie radio shows across the country. In addition, on the shows that are still available, there is no objective, stringent criteria for airplay, leaving the system open to abuse. As a result, many musicians are struggling to get their music heard and make a living. This petition calls for a fairer system of airplay on BBC Local Radio, as well as greater support for niche artists and genres in general.",
