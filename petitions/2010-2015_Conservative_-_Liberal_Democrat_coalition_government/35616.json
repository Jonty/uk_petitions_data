        "additional_details": "Parents use tax free childcare vouchers for childcare and preschool education, but what about when the children leave school at 18 and want to go to University?\r\nI propose that parents should be able to continue to save and bank tax free vouchers in the scheme to help pay for university fees and accommodation costs in the future.\r\nIf the child decides not to enter higher education then the money is repaid to the parents with the tax deducted but a rate of interest paid.\r\n\r\nI would like the Government to make this tax benefit available.\r\n\r\nBetter still - the Govenment set this scheme up themselves.",
