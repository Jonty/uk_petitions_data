        "additional_details": "While condemning the criminal actions of looters and rioters, the undersigned call on the government to concentrate on fostering methods of increasing social inclusion, opportunity and community spirit in the areas affected by unrest and to reject shortsighted calls to remove benefit entitlement from convicted rioters who can be punished adequately under existing laws. We ask the government to present proposals to build on the community involvement shown by the volunteer cleanups and other support systems organised through social networking, to prevent a further cycle of deprivation and exclusion that would foster future violence.",
