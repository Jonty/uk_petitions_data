        "additional_details": "GP's are going to be paid \u00a355 for every patient they diagnose with Alzheimer's. Why do they need a cash incentive to do what they should already be doing as part of their job, for which they are already highly paid. What else will suffer? GP's say there are not enough hours in the day as it is, so where will this additional time come from?  There are many people who have Diabetes which goes undiagnosed, should the GP's get paid extra to diagnose this disease also? where will it end? Many GP's are against this payment and it should not be allowed to continue. Unless I have been asleep for the last God knows how long it appears to me that this has been proposed and passed by whoever within Government without out any knowledge by the general public.\r\nPlease sign this petition to get it revoked.
