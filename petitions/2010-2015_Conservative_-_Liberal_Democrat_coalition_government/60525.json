        "additional_details": "Id like to propose families should be allowed to take upto 5 days each year as 'family days' to be used for family events.\r\n\r\nTeachers take INSET days each year which causes educational disruption and inconvinience to families, so there should be compromise.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamilies could take 1 week each year for such things like a term time holiday, as some of us work in professions where term time leave is just not possible and would hopefully resolve some of the issues surrounding the astronomical price rises in the term breaks by travel companies.\r\n\r\nFamilies would not be able to take these 5 days during exam periods nor would they affect the schools attendance statistics.\r\n\r\nBy reducing summer holidays from 6 to 5 could be a further compromise to allow this proposal.\r\n\r\nFamily time is a valuable commodity in todays work life balance world, with patents working longer hours.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to show there are other ways to deal with this than criminalising parents.\r\n\r\n",
