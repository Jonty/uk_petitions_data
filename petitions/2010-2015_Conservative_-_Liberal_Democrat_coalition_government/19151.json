It is now planned to close the facility over night from 1st November 2011 in a bid to make financial savings. It is then planned to close the facility altogether.\r\nThis is unfair on the local residents as part of the promise to provide 24 hour A&E in Pontefract that was what people were told time and time again.\r\n",
