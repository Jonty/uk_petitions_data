Half of Stocks and shares ISA just for not wanting to take on risk.\r\n\r\nI believe it should be one allowance for all at \u00a311,280, which is increased each tax year in line with inflation. Individuals should be allowed to allocate their assets in their ISA as they see fit.\r\n\r\nThis would reduce complexity for all and hopefully increase the uptake of ISAs by tax payers.",
