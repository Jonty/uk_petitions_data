They should then assess which parent the child should reside with based on interviews with the parents, relatives and neighbours.\r\n\r\nIf a residency order is then followed up in court the child is not separated from their primary care giver for the duration of the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe child should not automatically be kept with the parent who has essentially stolen them.",
