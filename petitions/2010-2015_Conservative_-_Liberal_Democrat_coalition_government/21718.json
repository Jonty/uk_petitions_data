        "additional_details": "It is proposed that lessons on the history of science and basic geological and astronomical principles should be mandatory for all pupils up to the end of Key Stage 3 (Year 9). The key scientific evidence for the great age of the earth and universe should be presented in an easily understandable form, and should comprise a substantial part of this teaching in order to refute unscientific ideas such as young-earth creationism. The syllabus should stress that the age of the earth and the theory of evolution are two separate issues.",
