Cycling on wet painted pathways and lines leads to a considerable amount of cyclist accidents or near misses every year purely as a result of man made dangers caused by slippery road paintings. With technology as it is and an ever increasing number of cyclists on the roads, it should be a  legal requirement for councils to ensure ALL painted pathways and markings are completed with non Slip (Grip) paints.",
