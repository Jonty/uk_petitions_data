        "additional_details": "Rail companies are subsidised by the taxpayer and passengers pay a lot of money to travel by rail - yet the level of service received is poor.\r\n\r\n- rail passengers should not be penalised for not organising their lives months in advance.  Affordable tickets should be made available shortly before trains run, as well as on the same day.\r\n\r\n- train companies should not be looking to catch passengers out.  e.g. tickets should not be printed separately to seat reservations (it is hoped passengers will lose at least one of these and have to pay for an additional full fare)\r\n\r\n- those purchasing tickets online should have full protection. Tickets purchased online should be subject to a 100% refund within 7 days of purchase with no refund fee.\r\n\r\n- we believe that trains should compensate for more than delays. Passengers should be able to claim more compensation than the cost of the ticket.",
