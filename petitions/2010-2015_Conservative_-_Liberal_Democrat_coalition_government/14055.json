Once an Asylum Seeker enters the Country, makes their request and is denied, then they should be removed immediately. No ifs or buts, just out.\r\nThis amendment will not only save billions in costs, but dramatically slow down the overcrowding that is occurring in the UK thanks to to the ignorance of successive governments.
