        "additional_details": "The creation of three seats within the House of Commons, each seat would deal with a specific branch of HM Forces (R.Navy, Army and RAF). The aim of this would be two fold; 1) Service personnel or their families on deployment often do not have access to a local MP\u2019 who they can challenge / question and as a result do not take an active part in the election process, whether that be general or local, due to lack of the perceived benefit, and 2) Local MP\u2019 are ill equipped to deal with or understand the problems that may arise from Service life. The creation of these seats would enable Service personnel to actually feel that they benefit from the democratic freedom which they, through hard work and sacrifice, provide us with. These newly created Ministers would not have any say on Budget or matters of policy but could obviously voice concerns or questions on these topics\r\n",
