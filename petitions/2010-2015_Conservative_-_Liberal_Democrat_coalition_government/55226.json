        "additional_details": "Currently the revenue from parking charges and parking penalties is retained by the same local authority / council that imposes the regulation. We the people believe that this is a conflict of interests as it forms an incentive for local authorities to increase the number and size of charges indefinitely and without control, as has been exposed by recent reports.\r\nWe ask of the government to review current policies and so that there is no longer an incentive for local authorities to make parking charges a revenue generating business.",
