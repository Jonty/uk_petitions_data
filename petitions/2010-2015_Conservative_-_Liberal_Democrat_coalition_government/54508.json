        "additional_details": "We the undersigned, wish to argue for the creation of an alternative student loan system, based on Shariah-compliant financing.\r\n\r\nWe believe, despite the claims that interest-based loans do not deter students, the opposite is true. We advise ministers to conduct further investigations so they are able to witness the repercussions that the increase in fees has had on students' lives. We believe that if education is truly meritocratic, then our concerns should be taken into consideration, so education fairly reflects all students\u2019 needs. We strongly believe that an alternative system for funding is feasible and that all avenues have not been considered to allow this change in legislation.\r\n\r\nWe therefore argue for the Department to seriously consider the urgency needed in this matter and request passing the legislation through promptly, before many more students slip through the net and fail to achieve their ambitions, solely due to financial constraints.\r\n",
