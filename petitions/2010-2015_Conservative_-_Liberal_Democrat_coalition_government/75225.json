        "additional_details": "Children are having to move back in with their parents or can't move out as they cannot afford to get properties of their own, even though they work hard and pay their taxes.  In London a small 3 bedroomed terraced house is likely to be well over the inheritance tax threshold, so when parents die, the government is effectively making those adult children homeless.\r\nI do not expect it will ever be abolished, but can at least be at a level which does not penalise ordinary people so badly, people who have never claimed benefits, who have worked hard and gone without to provide a roof over their family.\r\nIt should either be raised to a level compatible with the area ie. London houses would have a higher threshold or raised nationally to at least 1 to 1.5 million pounds or maybe the Government should consider no inheritance tax on the family home - that should then at least cover most ordinary people in fear of loosing their homes.",
