        "additional_details": "Bengal Brasserie recently opened a restaurant in Wetherby (West Yorkshire). Since it has opened local businesses and residents have suffered. Bengali Brasserie is now planning to open a take away on 2 Victoria Court Wetherby LS22 6JB   despite local authorities\u2019 public document stating they cannot open a takeaway!!\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of conflicting information which Bengali Brasserie are not adhering to and do not have permission by local authorities.\r\n\r\nI was browsing on the Leeds City Council to see what was happening in the local area, I was shocked to find how dare the group come into our community and not have respect for rules or regulations?? I certainly signed it and I recommend you take a look on this link https://publicaccess.leeds.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=LW3AJUJB0FZ00.\r\n\r\nPlease help the Wetherby we know and love. Say No to Bengali Brasserie!! By signing this petition.\r\nThank you\r\n",
