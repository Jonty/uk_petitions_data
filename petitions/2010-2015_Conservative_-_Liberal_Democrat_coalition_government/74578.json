        "additional_details": "We demand that Southern Rail be held accountable for its rising fares and diminishing customer service, which cause misery to thousands of passengers daily. We request an immediate fare freeze until performance improves. Please review Southern Rail\u2019s contract against these four areas specifically:\r\n\r\nRELIABILITY: Trains are consistently late, cancelled, overcrowded and unreliable, causing unnecessary stress and delay to passengers.\r\n\r\nON-TRAIN EXPERIENCE: Consistent overcrowding and standing-room-only leads to cramped and unbearable conditions. Jostling for space and seats leaves passengers degraded, frustrated and stressed.\r\n\r\nVALUE: Prices increase every year, whilst service declines. Delay Repay is not enough.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION: Poor communication of delays, cancellations and alterations. Live service updates are not accurate. Platforms are displayed at the last minute causing a stampede for trains, which carries health and safety risks and is a stressful experience.",
