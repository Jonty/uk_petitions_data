        "additional_details": "Currently a 16 year old can ride a 50cc motorbike that is limited to 27mph. This is dangerously slow as other drivers will cut you off and force you off the road and you can drive on roads where the limit is 50mph. The restriction should be lifted to 50mph, this would make things safer and easier for both the moped rider and other drivers.",
