The party political structure must be dismantled to allow genuine and positive change for our country.\r\n\r\nEach MP should be an individual partyless representative of their local area, working towards resolving the issues that matter to the people of Britain; that should be the function of government surely?\r\n\r\nEach MP should be legally required to have no demonstrable business interests of any kind, working as a professional representative of the people and nothing more.\r\n\r\nA consortium of the brightest minds in our nation must be gathered to draw up plans to further remove corruption from our society and improve the democratic process that is now totally failing.",
