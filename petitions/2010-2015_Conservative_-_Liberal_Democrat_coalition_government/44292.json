        "additional_details": "The sad truth is many of our bovine friends around Europe are not happy cows, with standards of animal welfare varying greatly across the EU. But we can do something about it & to do this, we need your help!\r\n\r\nHow can we help the cows I hear you say!? Well, as there is currently no specific legislation covering the welfare of Europe\u2019s 23 million dairy cows, as there is for pigs and hens, we want to call for the UK government to help make Europe\u2019s cows happier.\r\n\r\nWe want all our Europe\u2019s cows to be happy by lobbying for a specific European Directive for dairy cow welfare. Please show the cows some love.",
