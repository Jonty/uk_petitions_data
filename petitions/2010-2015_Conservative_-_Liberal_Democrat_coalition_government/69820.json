        "additional_details": "Most of the parents of children who are excluded from school have little or no concept of the critical role they could and must begin to play in their child\u2019s behaviour management alongside the work done within the S.S.S.(short stay school or 'PRU') each day.The problem is that what ever progress staff make with a PRU pupil during the day, the process of un-learning that starts again as soon as the pupil leaves for home because the parents aren't continuing those same or even similar behaviour management strategies at home. Governent needs to refer a parent/carer to compulsary parenting/bahaviour management sessions as soon as the child is excluded, where they need to liaise regularly with the PRU that their child has been referred to in order to work together to turn their childs behaviour around and also build their own capacity as parents/carers.  These training sessions could also include provision like mentoring/councilling for the parent themselves. ",
