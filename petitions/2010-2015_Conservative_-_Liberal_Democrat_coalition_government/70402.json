        "additional_details": "Following a recent report of the ban of all pork products from the menu and replacing of other meats with halal versions at two schools in Rotherham, we ask that the Department for Education rethink this decision.\r\n\r\nThis petition is in no way intended as racist and should not be considered as such.\r\n\r\nFreedom of choice should not be taken away from the mouths of babes.  Schools should not force ANY religious beliefs onto our children.\r\n\r\nNational nutritional standards and dietary requirements should come before ALL  'religious beliefs'.  It would have been a better option to include Halal rather than replace the regular meat options with Halal.\r\n\r\nWe are not selective with the schools curriculum for fear of upsetting any culture or way of life choices and neither should we be changing school menus for the same reasons.\r\n\r\nSchools are meant to educate, not dictate, otherwise, where does this end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
