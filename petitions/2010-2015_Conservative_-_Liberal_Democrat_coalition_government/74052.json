Our hungry desire for more products are costing the lives of people in countries such as India, China and Bangladesh to name a few. We feel it is a necessity that we stop these companies from abusing workers to meet demand. We have to make sure these major corporations loosen their hold on factories in LEDC's. We must stand up for the basic rights of people that have become consumer slaves.",
