It CANNOT therefore be legal for those councillors who are employees of council tax payers to deny access to information to those same council tax payers.  If councillors want to hold information which they can deny to council taxpayers then those councillors should pay for it - out of their own money - to be gathered and stored outside of the control of the council.  COUNCIL TAX PAYERS HAVE A RIGHT TO SEE HOW THEIR MONEY IS BEING SPENT AND IT SHOULD BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE FOR COUNCILLORS TO DENY THEM ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT IT.",
