        "additional_details": "Although over 50,000 Members of Bomber Command lost their lives during WW2 they are the only Branch of men serving in the war not to receive a Medal, these young men ,all volunteers, were war-time Heroes undertaking hazardous Missions often at the request of the then Prime Minister Winston Churchill but once the war was over they were completely disregarded .A Monument is at long last being erected to honour them but the majority of these aged men are not mobile enough to go to see it and surely even at this late date their bravery should be acknowledged and I would like to see Members of Parliament supporting my Petition.",
