It is not justifiable to ask a parent to put themselves and their child through this emotional trauma.\r\n\r\nThe potential loss of earnings and the expense of putting their children into these settings prove too much as the expenses and loss of earnings that can be claimed would not cover much of the cost and could mean putting the family into hardship.",
