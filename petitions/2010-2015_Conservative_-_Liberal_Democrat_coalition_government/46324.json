        "additional_details": "This petition is for those who want the voting age lowered to 16.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons as to why sixteen year olds should be allowed to vote:\r\n\r\n-Most of the political parties allow youths to become junior members. If they are allowed to support a political party, why can't they vote for them?\r\n\r\n-Many sixteen year olds are more mature than eighteen year olds. Age shouldn't determine whether you can vote or not - maturity should.\r\n\r\n-Sixteen year olds are citizens of the UK just as much as anyone over eighteen. Why should they have lesser rights?\r\n\r\n-Many sixteen year olds have jobs and therefore have to pay tax. Should they not get a say in how their money is spent?\r\n\r\nWith education and guidance on how democracy works, sixteen year olds will be perfectly capable of voting for their chosen political party. By signing this petition you could help lessen the ageism in today's society!",
