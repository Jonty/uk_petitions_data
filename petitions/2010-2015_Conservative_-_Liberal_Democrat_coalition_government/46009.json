        "additional_details": "The government should not be seeking to reduce pay levels for a group of skilled workers who are responsible for very expensive machinery and the welfare of animals on large farms and they must reverse their policy to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board. The vast majority of workers involved in animal husbandry do so in a caring manner and work often long hours to ensure proper care is provided.\r\n\r\nThe result of this abolition will inevitably mean that new agricultural workers will face the prospect of having the National Minimum Wage as their only protection.\r\n\r\nThe Tolpuddle Martyrs were the foundation of the modern trade union movement and this action is a direct attack on that movement.",
