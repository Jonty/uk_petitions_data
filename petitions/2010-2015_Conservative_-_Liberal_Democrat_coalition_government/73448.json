I propose that dog owners have to pay a yearly tax (like we do for cars) and that if a dog is sold, a slip of paper has to be posted off to Defra so that the new owner is registered.  Vouchers can be given by the government for those on low income etc, to help pay for the dog tax.  This could create more jobs for Civil Servants and it would generate revenue for Defra. Tougher regulation is more than over due on this matter.",
