        "additional_details": "This summer thousands of young people have had their faith in the English examination system seriously challenged.  Their predicted and their actual results were unusually different.  This has had a devastating effect on their future career paths and leaves them feeling confused and even duped.\r\nThe Education Select Committee have begun to take evidence on this issue and representatives of the teaching professions have asked for OFQUAL to re-grade the disputed papers and called for an Independent Inquiry.  OFQUAL cannot investigate this issue themselves as they have had an active part to play in it.\r\nI feel it is my duty, as an adult, to get to the truth and make adequate redress for our young people and their futures.\r\nIf you feel the same, please sign this petition demanding an Independent Inquiry of this year's GCSE grading from the Secretary of State for Education and invite others to do likewise.
