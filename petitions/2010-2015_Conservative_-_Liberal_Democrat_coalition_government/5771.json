        "action": "That political parties must declare their coalition partners before the election",
        "additional_details": "This petition is for Parliament to debate that political parties must negotiate with each other before beginning their general election campaigns, then decide and declare who they would enter a coalition with in the event of no single party winning an overall majority in a general election.\r\n\r\nThis would be so that the electorate have a better understanding of who they may be voting into power.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this would restore public trust and confidence in the electoral system and in the integrity of individual parties.\r\n\r\nWe also believe that this would prevent relatively small parties being able to have influence beyond the mandate given to them by the public - the present system allows the representatives of a very small proportion of the electorate to decide the overall outcome of a general election in the event of a hung Parliament.",
