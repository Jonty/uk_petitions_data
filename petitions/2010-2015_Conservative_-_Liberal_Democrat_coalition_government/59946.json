We want to do this as we believe that everyone over the age of 13 is capable of doing light work and the majorty of young people that we have asked including us belive that they are capable of carrying out work. However we feel that we are being turned away because of our age and we feel that this is unfair and we are being discriminated against .\r\nWe would like the goverment to think about this and ask the anyone over the age of 13 whether they would like to work and if the majorty agree then i belive the goverment should change the  law.\r\nThankyou for reading ",
