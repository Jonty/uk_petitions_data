        "additional_details": "Throughout history, the glorious county of Yorkshire has been oppressed, both by those governing from Westminster, and other groups throughout the United Kingdom. Yet despite all this, it has risen up to become one of the greatest parts of Great Britain - the 5th biggest by area, and 7th by population. However, we still need to redress injustices of the past: especially the unspeakable crimes perpetually commited by the Lancastrian scum (predominantly during the Wars of the Roses).\r\n\r\nThe solution? To right the wrongs of history and balance out the illegal and immoral rise of the House of Lancaster to the throne in 1487, Lancashire must fall to their benevolent Yorkshire overlords. This is in their best interests as well - how can a county so incompetent as to let a 14 year old vote be allowed to continue to manage itself. Furthermore, everyone there is born on the wrong side of the Pennines.",
