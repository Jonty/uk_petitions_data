        "additional_details": "In an effort to reduce the length of time road works take place, I would like to propose that all road works must erect a large clear sign showing the start date and the predicted end date. This will draw attention to road works that have taken an excessive amount of time to complete and will effectively name and shame those responsible.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this petition is to put some light pressure on the organisations and councils involved in the road works to help speed them along.\r\n\r\nAlongside this, changes in the predicted end date should also be shown to publicise any delays/failures/complications.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple piece of legislation to put in place that would be cheap to implement and have a positive effect towards public awareness and hopefully on the timescales involved.",
