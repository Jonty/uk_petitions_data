        "additional_details": "I believe that Hendre Fourie should be allowed to stay in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nHe and his family are being deported after he has been forced to retire with a shoulder injury, rendering his visa invalid.\r\n\r\nHe has been in this country for 8 years with his wife and has a son born in this country. If he had been able to stay here for another 2 years, he would have got residency.\r\n\r\nFourie has won 8 caps for England, always paid his taxes and never claimed any benefits.\r\n\r\nIt is a travesty that we allow many thousands of people to stay in the United Kingdom, yet the authorities feel it is necessary to remove a man who has played for his country.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you agree.",
