In fact cannabis can slow cancer down and possible even stop growth.\r\n\r\nI want to live in a country where if I want to grow a plant there shouldn't be a law telling me I can't. I want to live in a country where if I want to smoke a natural substance I can.\r\n\r\nI know a lot of people are against the use of cannabis but think how much money can be saved by people who are in prison due to cannabis related offensives. How many people have been injured due to cannabis drug war, if it was legal this will all stop and one last question to ask yourself, compared to alcohol. How many people have died from cannabis related death? Cannabis - 0. Alcohol - 700,000 a year. Has anyone seen someone put a joint down and start a fight unlike those on alcohol. I want to chill and smoke, no harm given. No harm done. ",
