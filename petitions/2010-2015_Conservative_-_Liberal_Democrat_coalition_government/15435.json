I would like to see a legally binding and enforcable set of rights for NHS patients to be drawn up by the Health Department in consultation with all patients and their representatives who have experienced a bad and neglectful service from the NHS. In addition both NHS staff and all NHS Trusts should be made to be more accountable/liable for their actions or lack of directly to patients and their representatives.",
