Alchohol, on the other hand, is not vital and costs the nation a vast amount of money every year to deal with the consequences of alchohol abuse.  A doubling of the price of duty on Alchohol would cut down on drunkeness and Alchohol abuse.  You've taxed the Smoker almost to extinction,  now it's time to hit the drinker and relieve the motorist.",
