Although the government is already discussing this matter, there is no harm in a petition to establish the need for such a service and accelerate the plans and pressure for creating an ELIB.\r\nThe ABI had concerns that an ELIB would cause less employers to obtain Employers Liability Insurance, but this is ridiculous considering the fines that can be imposed on employers by the HSE.\r\nJustice needs to be done!",
