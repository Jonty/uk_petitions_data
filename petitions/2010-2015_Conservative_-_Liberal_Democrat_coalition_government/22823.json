        "additional_details": "Why should we pay people for being unemployed? The state should not give people money because they don't have a job, if they need or want money the unemployed should and must find a job to get money themselves or suffer the consequences. The employed should not be given a incentive to not find a job. Employed live permanently on the money given to them rather than use it to seek a job. In such austere economic times, sixty pounds shouldn't be weekly dished out in their hundreds of thousands, to people who give next to nothing back to society. I wish I could be given \u00a367.50 per week for doing practically nothing, but (at the rate payers expense) that would be immoral. Money should not be given to people do not persistently exert themselves to find a job (if they did, then they would have a job) but instead be reserved for the people who constantly work hard. And this is why all Jobseeker's Allowance should be removed and reviewed by Parliament.  ",
