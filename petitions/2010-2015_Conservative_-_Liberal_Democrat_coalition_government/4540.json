        "additional_details": "Justice is split into three levels to deal with different levels of offenses.\r\n\r\nThe first is Community Justice and replaces ASBOs. This means that relatively minor antisocial crimes can be administered by communities. The perpertrator can serve the community for an appropriate amount of time.\r\n\r\nThe second is more focused system of rehabilitation and is designed to deal primarily with drug addicts and those who commit crimes to pay for drug habits. It can also extend to people with other types of addiction or personality flaw and will be re-educated and given every chance to turn their lives around within a controlled environment.\r\n\r\nAttendence is compulsory but the idea is to stop these people being further crimilized by association with more serious offenders.\r\n\r\nThe third level is Solution Justice and deals with punishing, incapacitating and putting serious offenders on long term rehabilitation programmes utilizing innovative measures.",
