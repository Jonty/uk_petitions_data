        "additional_details": "The governmnet is proposing to take away child allowances from anyone unfortunate enough to pay higher rate tax. Even going \u00a31 above the limit could cost a person with three children about \u00a32500 per year. In the present economic climate, with increasing costs and possible interest rate rises in the offing, this is a massive assault on family life.  This proposal must be scrapped.",
