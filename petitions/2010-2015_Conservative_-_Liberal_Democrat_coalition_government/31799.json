        "additional_details": "In the 2012 Budget, Wednesday 21st March 2012, it was proposed that Child Allowance be withdrawn proportionately if a member of the household had an income of \u00a350,000 or above and withdrawn completely should any member of the household have an income of \u00a360,000 or above.\r\n\r\nIt is manifestly unfair that a family where both wage earners have incomes of \u00a350,000 and retain the allowance whilst a single wage earning member of the family is penalised if earning above the \u00a350,000.\r\n\r\nI propose that family income should be taken into consideration and that the joint incomes of both wage earners should replace that of a single family member.",
