        "additional_details": "The plans announced to deregulate school term times will cause increased childcare costs for parents who have children in different schools which may choose to set different term times. It will not only cause significant inconvenience to parents, but also to employers who will have to allow parents more flexibility in their working hours. This may lead to reduced business productivity or efficiency, and increased stress and childcare costs for parents. The plans to deregulate school term times is ill conceived, and should be abandoned.",
