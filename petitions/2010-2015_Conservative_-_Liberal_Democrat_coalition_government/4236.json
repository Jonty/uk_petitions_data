Even when taking into account the rise in wholesale gas etc costs, the bills we're faced with every month are shocking. Too many people in this country are now faced with the unsettling choice of whether they can afford food or heating.\r\n\r\nI suggest that the Government take a look into these companies and do anything that's in their power to help lower these bills.",
