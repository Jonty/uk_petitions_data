        "additional_details": "Safe nuclear does exist with China leading the way. Their scientists claim that hazardous waste will be 1000 times less than with uranium and that it is less prone to disaster.\r\n\u201cThe Thorium reactor has an amazing safety feature, if it begins to overheat, a little plug melts and the salts drain into a pan.  The reactor saves itself\u201d.  Said Kirk Sorensen, an ex NASA engineer and a Thorium expert.\r\nWhy do we have to rely on other countries to do the development? Let the UK do it and have safe energy.",
