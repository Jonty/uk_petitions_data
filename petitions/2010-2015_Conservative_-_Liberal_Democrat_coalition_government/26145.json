        "additional_details": "With 279,000 long term unemployed for over a year, HMG should allow those long-term unemployed wishing to do courses (professional or vocational) that they are qualified & motivated to take. Such courses should be likely to enable them to obtain employment after the training. They should still be able to claim JSA. Loans schemes for the training can be paid back like for student loans for undergraduates. For example, a builder train to become a plumber; driver can train to become HGV, coach, driving instructor; a lawyer train to become a barrister; a nurse train to convert into other branches of nursing or health professions; a science graduate train to become forensic scientist, engineers, pharmacists, PhD, etc. By enabling long-term unemployed to retrain in a difficult period of budget austerity & labour saving IT systems & robotics, it will go a long way to solve the skills shortage in UK in key areas & the long queues of people wasting their life & skills as unemployed.",
