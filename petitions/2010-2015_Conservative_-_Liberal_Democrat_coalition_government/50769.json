        "additional_details": "To strip British citizenship from individuals that were not born in the UK and are convicted of a serious crime. To extradite them back to their country of origin after they have served their time in Jail. This will then bring a balance to the justice system. The balance to the convicted individual's rights versus the rights of their victims.\r\n\r\nThe UK has a long history of asylum which we should be proud of, but where the UK's charity is abused there needs to be a balance. Examples such as Hamza needs to be addressed, or the recent Woolwich killing, the balance is wrong and will ultimately create more extremism at both ends of the spectrum.",
