With the shortage of Dentists doing NHS treatment, it would be fair if all newly qualified Dentists had to work in local NHS dental centres for 5 years before being allowed to work privately.  In this time they would be working under the supervision of experienced Dentists in units equipped by the NHS on a salary basis, roughly in line with the training regime for Doctors.",
