        "additional_details": "We ask the Coalition to reject the weak propostion of Ring Fencing put forward by bankers-The Banking Commision. We demand a 3 point plan of action.\r\n\r\n1) Breaking up the banking system which goes beyond the simple To Big To Fail TBTF proposal. Hence, this petition is asking for a returning to a modern day Glass-Steagall via 21st a century legislation that creates new fire walls. Moving beyond a simple separation between commercial and investment banking and create a system that can accommodate\u2014and separate\u2014the many different kinds of financial operations now in existence.\r\n\r\n2) Banning Investment, Commercial banks & broker dealers from doing any kind of short-term borrowing. This would make the financial system less interconnected, and less prone to chain reactions. .\r\n\r\n3) Finally, Retail banks should not offer any form of collateral, underwriting or loan that finances any exotic financial instruments & stocks or shares.\r\n\r\n",
