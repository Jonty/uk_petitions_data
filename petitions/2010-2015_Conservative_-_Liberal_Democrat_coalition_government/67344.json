It\u2019s about Israel feeling able to commit war crimes with complete impunity. It\u2019s about the world media indicating that Palestinian lives are worth less than Israeli lives. It\u2019s about the fact that Palestinian children are being killed at the rate of one every three days. It\u2019s about millions of Palestinians living under illegal occupation. It\u2019s about the brutal siege on Gaza, and the third military assault on a trapped population in less than 6 years. It\u2019s about more than 60 laws that discriminate against Palestinian citizens of Israel. It\u2019s about Israeli racism and apartheid. It\u2019s about ethnic cleansing. It\u2019s about colonisation, and over 500,000 settlers. It\u2019s about Israel\u2019s systematic violations of international law and Palestinian human rights.",
