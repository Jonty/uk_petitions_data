        "additional_details": "Abandon the idea of changing Britain to Central European time.  The appropriate time zone for Britain is GMT+0, defined by the longitude of the country - in fact, most of Britain is west of Greenwich.  Almost all countries use a time zone which makes noon approximately 12:00 on the clock, and there is no good reason why we should use a time zone based hundreds of miles to the east.\r\nThe current proposal to remain on BST all year is only the beginning: soon after would come a change to GMT +2 in summer to \"conform with the rest of Europe\".  At the expense of making it a bit lighter in summer evenings when it is light anyway, most of Britain would suffer many more dark mornings in Winter.",
