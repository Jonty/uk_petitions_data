        "additional_details": "We call on the British Government to impose a nationwide Ban on Big Cat Cub Petting, including all Big Cat species in UK Zoos, Parks, Sanctuaries and Habitats.\r\n\r\nCub Petting has NO conservation value whatsoever. Once a Cub has become accustomed to human contact, it can never be rehabilitated & introduced to the wild.\r\n\r\n2013 saw two UK Zoo's closely linked with a South African Canned Hunting Farm - where Lions are bred for Canned Hunting, for \"sport\"\r\n\r\nArticle > http://focusingonwildlife.com/news/white-lion-breeding-at-uk-wildlife-parks-linked-to-canned-hunting/\r\n\r\nCombating this cruel & barbaric industry from outside South Africa is a must, this will help drive down this industry's revenue, thus affecting the industry as a whole.\r\n\r\nPlease also read Patrick Barkham's Guardian article here > http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/03/canned-hunting-lions-bred-slaughter\r\n\r\nMore on the Canned Hunting industry can be found at www.cannedlion.org & www.lionaid.org\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you!",
