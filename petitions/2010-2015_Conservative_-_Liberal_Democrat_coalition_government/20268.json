        "additional_details": "It is a nuisance to other drivers when overtaking vehicles are using sometimes minutes to complete the manoevre because they are travelling at a maximim speed which is only marginally faster than the maximum speed of the vehicle which is being overtaken.  Rather than limiting them to certain lanes or banning overtaken at certain times of day, the problem could be solved by requiring vehicles which are speed-limited to ease off and temporarily slow down from their maximum speed to allow overtaking vehicles to complete the manoevre more quickly (say within 15 seconds).  It must be obvious to drivers when an overtaking vehicle is creeping past their vehicle and yet they seem to think it makes better sense to keep going at the maximum speed to which they are limited and cause inconvenience to others, rather than sacrificing a few feet of road speed.
