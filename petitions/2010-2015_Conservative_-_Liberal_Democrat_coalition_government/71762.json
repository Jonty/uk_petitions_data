        "additional_details": "Each year, children and their parents are injured by fireworks.  Moreover, a great many animals, both wild and domesticated, suffer dreadful terrors from the noise of the explosives.  If the sale of fireworks was restricted to organised displays only, with clear and proper notification given of the dates and times of the displays, there would be fewer injuries sustained by private individuals and a great deal less stress suffered by innocent animals.  We wouldn't allow the purchase of gunpowder over the counter so why do we permit private individuals to buy this dangerous material with no limits on its use? Please sign this petition to ensure that only those with the requisite experience are permitted to release fireworks. Animals would then only be subjected to the gunpowder terror for a very limited time and not have to endure more than two weeks of abject fear.",
