        "additional_details": "I believe the DWP jobseekers allowance is not suited to dependants of the armed forces. A dependent will always stand by their partner and be forced to leave their job when their partner is posted. The DWP penalise them for this as they are seen as voluntarily leaving the place of work. Dependents have to be flexible in hours as their partner can be sent away at a moment's notice. Leaving problems with child care. Again the DWP do not understand this. A dependent is forced to take poorly paid part time work as the DWP think the armed forces earn enough to support an entire family and dependants can't claim income based allowance.  I believe dependents should be paid a weekly armed forces allowance equal to or more than JSA . ",
