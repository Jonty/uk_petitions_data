        "additional_details": "In each county, local government collects \u201cCouncil Tax\u201d to fund a variety of public services such as street cleaning. The current system advocates paying council-tax from the \u2018income that was already taxed by the national government\u2019 (post-taxed income).  Thus, the two types of taxes are currently being charged in sequential manner \u2013 meaning that first the national government receives tax directly from the gross income/salary and then local government receives council-tax from the post-taxed income.\r\n\r\nTax payers could save significant amounts of money if all the taxes are paid from gross income, instead of paying it in a sequential manner. A parliamentary debate will be useful to explore whether citizens should pay the council tax from the gross income.\r\n\r\nThis petition does not suggest avoiding the taxes. It recommends creating a more efficient tax system, while council-tax payers could save money.\r\n",
