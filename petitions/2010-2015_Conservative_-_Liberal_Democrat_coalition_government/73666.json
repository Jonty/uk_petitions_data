        "additional_details": "The average cost of production for 1 litre of milk is around 30pence. Currently there are very few farmers who are breaking even with the price they are getting for their milk with some farmers getting less than 20ppl.\r\nThese dairy farmers are some of the hardest working people working every day of the year from early hours til late evening. If this continues the increase in dairy farmers selling up will continue and there will be less British milk and an increase in imported milk when there is no need.\r\nWe are petitioning for a minimum price per litre paid to dairy farmers and for a guarantee that if the dairy company they are selling to goes bust that they are still paid for their milk.",
