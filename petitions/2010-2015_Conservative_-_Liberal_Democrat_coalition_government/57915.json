        "additional_details": "Since 28/10/13, claimants who disagree with a DWP decision are required to go through a mandatory reconsideration before they have the right to appeal. This process takes several weeks, during which time claimants whose benefits have been stopped are left without any income. This is causing severe hardship and misery to many.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the government to reinstate the right to appeal a decision without going through a reconsideration.",
