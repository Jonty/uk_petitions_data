RELAXER damage is often the link between irreversible hairloss and damage within the Ethnic community...Instead of using relaxers due to a lack of hairducation on the part of parents and carers we want to deliver training and hairducation classes teaching parents and carers how to handle their childrens hair and also manage it themselves as teens.",
