        "additional_details": "We want to ban all pet shops from selling ANY animals! The Pet Animals Act 1951 is 60 years old (although it was revised slightly in 1983) and there are many things that have changed that make these outdated licensing conditions easy for animals to be mistreated and neglected by pet shop owners. There is also no legislation on WHO can buy an animal, which allows people to go into a pet shop and, on a whim and without considering all the implications and responsibilities that owning a pet entail, purchase a pet which they later neglect, abandon or surrender to already stretched charities. People should be encouraged to \"Adopt Not Shop\"! This would discourage people breeding without licence and remove the outlets that puppy farms sell to, hopefully resulting in puppy farms being closed down! Currently breeders and pet shop owners are monitored ONLY by the local authority who issues them with a licence. There should be a central body that monitors ALL pet shops and breeders!",
