        "action": "No Cuts to British Defence Spending During Wartime. ",
        "additional_details": "It sickens me to hear of defence budget cuts during a time of war. Yes Britain is in an economic situation in which federal spending cuts are a deficit-reducing necessity; but of all the departments in which to make cuts, defence is an incredably callous and dangerous department in which to make them.\r\n\r\nFederal defence cuts result in lesser and poorer equipment for british troops in Afghanistan that every day risk their lives in the name of counter-terrorism and national security. For their own government to then reward such bravery with swinging cuts that directly enganger their very lives and yet at the same time increase foreign aid spending is disgusting. I therefore propose that when Britain is engaged in war, the Ministry of Defence be immune to federal spending cuts. Nobody can price bravery.  ",
