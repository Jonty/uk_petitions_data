        "additional_details": "The A351 road from Corfe to Swanage is We believe a dangerous road not just for cars with all the potholes. Though this road is very dangerous for walkers , runners and cyclists aswell. There are a few campsites dotted along this road and if tourists wishing to walk must do so by taking there lives at risk. There are hardly any footpaths which makes walking on the main road very dangerous. I understand the speed limit is 50 to 60 mph and there are mainly blind spots. We the undersigned would like for footpaths to be put in place or for the speed limit be dropped to 30mph. Not only is this a safety issue but and enviomental issue too.\r\n",
