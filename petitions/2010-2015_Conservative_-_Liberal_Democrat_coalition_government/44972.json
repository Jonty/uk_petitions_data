        "additional_details": "There are thousands of employed people who pay income tax on their wages which are way under the GBP26,000.00p cap on the amounts which can be handed over to those who don't have a job. (There's a contradition there, don't you think?).  So if employees on over GBP50,000.00p are to be given money to help pay for their childcare there MUST be a case for also giving money to those who are  employees and are on less than GBP26,000.00p, and paying income tax on it, so they can be lifted out of the poverty trap - in much the same way the government seems hell bent on making sure that anybody who doesn't work and who is in receipt of benefits doesn't languish below the poverty line - while continuing to contribute nothing!",
