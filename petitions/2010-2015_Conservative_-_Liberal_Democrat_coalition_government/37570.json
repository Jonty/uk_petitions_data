This is because international delivery costs now are spiralling out of control, it impossible to get shipping for lower than \u00a360 now on any item. This bumps up the value making every import chargable even those marked as gift and those who's value is less \u00a315.\r\nWe feel this is unfair and the only thing that should be taxble is the contents of an import and not the cost of its delivery.
