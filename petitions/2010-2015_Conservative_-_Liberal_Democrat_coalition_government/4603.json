This is a system of \"presumed consent\", where it is assumed that the individual wants to be a donor unless they express their preference to the contrary.\r\n\r\nOver 95% of Britons have expressed a desire to be on the register, but only 29% of us have actually registered.  This change in the law would meet the ever-increasing demand of donated organs.\r\n",
