        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, request that the Department for Transport review the automatic cut-off settings for refuelling pumps at MT departments and garages and to legislate to reduce the allowable fuel level in tanks. The objective being to reduce the amount of fuel, particularly diesel, that is spilled onto roads, often at junctions and roundabouts. Such spillage is wasteful but, more importantly, very dangerous and potentially lethal to cyclists and motorcyclists.\r\n\r\nA campaign of awareness including but not restricted to TV, advertising and mandatory signs and notices on refuelling pumps should go hand-in-hand with this.",
