        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the government to insist that all schools, that have sufficient grounds, and that all new housing developments should be required to plant trees that produce edible fruit, such as apples, pears, mulberry, and plums. This would help ensure that even those communities where there is poor nutrition and food poverty that there would be availability of fresh food, and it would also have an environmental benefit as it would provide habitats for a wide range of birds and insects. It may even have employment and educational benefits as it would raise awareness of food and habitats and help improve the health of people, so reducing costs to the NHS.",
