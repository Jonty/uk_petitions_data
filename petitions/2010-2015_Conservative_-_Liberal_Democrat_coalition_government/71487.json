        "additional_details": "Owing a personal number plate should be encourage for better identification of vehicles. Personal plates are easier to remember. If the law allowed spacing to be changed, the more chance that number plates would make sought after words. This would also increase revenue for registration plates.\r\n\r\nThe plates need to be legible in order for ANPR cameras to function properly, and to allow police units to qucikly identify the cars, however, allowing the spacing between groups of figures to be change will not affect recognition, yet the memorisation of a plate would increase.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call for the law to be relaxed, and not to jeopardise our investments over a very minor matter.",
