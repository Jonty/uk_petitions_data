As such the majority of us are incapable of obtaining justice in our civil courts when the opposition is well funded e.g. a large company.\r\nI would like you to sign this so our government changes the way civil law works in the UK to ensure that our civil courts are made fair with equal support and knowledge on both sides and decisions made on evidence beyond reasonable doubt not hearsay.\r\n",
