        "additional_details": "The number of UK dogs born each year far exceeds the loving homes that can be provided for them. Breeders who indiscriminately churn-out puppies for profit are the reason for this. They flood the market with dogs, selling them to the first buyers who come along. Many of these dogs sadly end up being dumped & then put down. The whole cycle causes huge suffering & the needless loss of life for thousands of dogs each year, particularly bull breeds. It also places a heavy burden on the charitable and voluntary dog rescues & causes a huge cost to the taxpayer.\r\nThe Dog Rescue Federation calls on the government to take urgent control of the national dog population. We want to see:  1. Compulsory spaying & neutering of all dogs, unless licensed for breeding. 2. Stricter licensing so that all dog breeding, regardless of the number of litters involved, is under proper local authority control, inspection & annual review. 3. Stricter enforcement to weed-out irresponsible breeders. ",
