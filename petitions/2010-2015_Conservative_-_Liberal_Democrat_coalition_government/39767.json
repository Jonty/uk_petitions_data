        "additional_details": "Another application for a skate board park has been declined by Lichfield Council (Staffordshire).\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of children and parents that would like a skate board park to be built within Beacon Park Lichfield (as this is where the City's main play areas are already located). This area is central to the City and for parents with more than one child, would be perfect location for them to supervise a child at the park and another at the skateboard area without worry.\r\n\r\nMany other areas/towns/cities have skate parks and have seen a reduction in anti-social behaviour and reduced crime from teenagers. This is because they have somewhere to meet and enjoy themselves. Unfortunately, Lichfield Coucil would prefer all young people to leave the are and instead build yet another block of retirement homes.\r\n\r\nNIMBY's (not in my backyard) residents should not be allowed to stop the majority of children and parents from having their views ignored.",
