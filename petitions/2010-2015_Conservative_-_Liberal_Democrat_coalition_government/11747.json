        "additional_details": "Currently only Armed Forces personnel and members of the Emergency Services who have served a minimum of 5 years will receive the Diamond Jubilee medal.This excludes thousands of brave young men and women who serve their country. What message does that send to the young soldier who has lost limbs or the exhausted police officer who has been on riot duty? It tells them they are less valued than their more experienced colleagues, even though they face exactly the same dangers. Please do not exclude those whose careers have just begun...it is both demoralizing and insulting to them. Medals for each and every one of them.",
