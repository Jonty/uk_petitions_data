        "additional_details": "40 years ago Summerland leisure complex in Douglas, Isle of Man burnt down taking the lives of 50 men, women and children. The site is now derelict, owned by the Isle of Man government and for sale for redevelopment. No decision can be  made on a sale until the IoM govt reconvenes on 22nd October.  This site of national significance should be recognised and dedicated to all those who died, suffered injury or mental trauma.  After the fire an inquiry report stated \"There were no villains here\", yet many mistakes were made by many people in the IoM govt, Douglas Council and Trust Houses Forte in its design, construction and operation.  No-one was held responsible, successive IoM govts have not addressed this shameful event in Manx history or recognised the importance of the site.  I would like the UK Government to help in stopping the sale. This national tragedy at the time caused the greatest loss of British lives due to fire since 1929.",
