They obviously love him dearly and are trying to find whatever treatment they can to save him.  What has UK government done for them?  Locked them up and kept them away from their dying child while he lies alone in a Spanish hospital.  It's despicable and needs to be stopped now.  Let them do whatever they need to do for the benefit of their child.",
