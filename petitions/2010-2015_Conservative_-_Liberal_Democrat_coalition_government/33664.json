        "additional_details": "The government today has shown us that their reforms of the United Kingdom have failed. A coalition which the people of the country didn't even vote for have decided to take action without our permission on issues that have lost all relevance in the world of today.\r\nEducation reform, welfare reform, tax reform and so many more reforms have affected the people of this country so badly that the average person is set to lose thousands and thousands of pounds because of this new legislation, while the rich benefit from an undeserved tax cut.\r\nWe need to take action against future policies that the people are obviously opposing yet the government is ignoring.\r\nBy signing up to this petition you will be guaranteeing that the demand for a motion of no confidence will go through parliament and MPs opposing the coalition will be sure to agree with us. Thank you. ",
