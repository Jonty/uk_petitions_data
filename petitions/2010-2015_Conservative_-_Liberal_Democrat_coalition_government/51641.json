        "additional_details": "There needs to be fairness in prescription charges, who determines a price on a persons health? should a recovering heroine addict get free methadone, yet a depressed person has to pay for the vital medication to keep them from suicide.... The current legislation is far from equal, a person in Wales gets all prescription medication free, yet cross the bridge into England, if a person doesn't meet the right criteria then they have to pay for their medication. No one is prescribed medication without a real need for it to live a healthy life, is this fair? No it isn't. the NHS would obviously suffer if all prescription were free... so maybe there should be a fee for everyone, at a much lower rate, therefore creating fairness and equality, without the NHS suffering.",
