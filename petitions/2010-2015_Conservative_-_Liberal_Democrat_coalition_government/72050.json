        "additional_details": "Can legally ride 125 with CBT as long as display L plates,does not seem much point in taking A1test,you can remove L plates+use motorways+carry pillion but it\u2019s easier+cheaper to remain on CBT.New riders likely to have accident in first year,training makes safe capable road user but most will just stay CBT,removing most basic training- Motorcycle License test!CBT taken on twist+go moped done within hours not thorough!Indirectly the changes encourage 90% of new riders not take test and start riding without training not able to use a geared bike safely!With almost 0 training 0 experience are likely to get themselves into trouble.They now more at risk on road than before,not knowing the Highway Code,road rules or how to operate bike.Keep the engine size on a CBT to 125,but at 17 option to take motorcycle test to ride motorcycle with no more than 33hp as before.Keep the staged system;change the A1 to 33hp as before to add reason for rider to take test therefore training and safer road user",
