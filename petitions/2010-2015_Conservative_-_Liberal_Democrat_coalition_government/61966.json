Without it Gavin and Stacy, little Britain, and more recently bad eduction and Russell Howard's good news and many more would not have been the hits they are.\r\n\r\nThis channel is made for the younger generation and this is why it is most likely being axed. The bbc believe that the younger people not make a fuss over a tv channel. There are many other ways of saving money across the bbc eg : merging bbc2 and bbc4, merging cbbc and cbeebies and I'm sure much more. The channels stated have broadly the same Style of programs, bbc3 Stands apart from the rest.\r\n\r\nSign this petition and force th to reconsider ",
