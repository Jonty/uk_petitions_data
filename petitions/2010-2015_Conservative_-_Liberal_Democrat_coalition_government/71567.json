        "additional_details": "The number of UK deaths linked to so-called \"legal highs\" has risen in recent years - from 10 in 2009 to at least 68 in 2012, figures show.\r\n\r\nWe believe that substances sold as \"research chemicals\" need to be more heavily regulated and not able to escape through a loophole by labelling as 'not fit for human consumption'.\r\n\r\nSellers know the intention of buyers, and also know that these chemicals are dangerous. Yet through a weak legal system, they are readily available for anyone who desires to take them.\r\n\r\nI am appealing to the Attorney General, in the hope that this issue can be discussed.\r\n\r\nAn ideal outcome would be that these products need license holders, and that effective audit and regulation can be put in place. We would like to see that these are banned from being sold by normal retailers and are only able to be distributed by professionals who know know how to handle them.\r\n\r\n",
