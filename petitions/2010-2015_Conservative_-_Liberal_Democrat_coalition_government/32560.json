        "additional_details": "The modern police seem to think it is a priority to police distasteful language and unpleasant views.  I want the Government to assert that the job of the police is to go after criminals and stop criminal behaviour - such as assault, rape, burglarly, robbery, fraud - acts which damage people and from which people, - all of us - need protection.\r\n\r\nIn particular, it should be no part of the police's job to get involved in playground spats between young children.  Children are children, adults in training.  They are not sophisticated mature adults who are aware of all the implications of their impulsive acts.  Police should only get involved in schools where there is, or has been the threat of physical damage of one child by another, and then proper criminal proceedings should be implemented.  ",
