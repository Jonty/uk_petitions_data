        "additional_details": "London Borough Tower Hamlets is proposing to close all 4 public day nurseries i.e. John Smith, Queen Mary, Mary Sambrook, Overland. All are a fabric of the local community, and are fantastic in supporting all children, and parents/carers, parents with children with SEN. Why close? Only high-quality early education can narrow the gaps between the poorest children and their peers. 48 % of families in Tower Hamlets live below the poverty line (IFS 2011). These cuts will affect the vulnerable parents, children in our Borough. We urge The Government, Local Authority to review their cuts, and to support our children, our future generation, to achieve and receive excellent care. Parents are concerned about the impact the closures will have on the children, the local community, cohesion, diversity and choice, affordability and placing families on low - medium incomes, students out of work, as they would not be able to afford fees in private sector. Closures are driven by financial cuts.\r\n\r\n",
