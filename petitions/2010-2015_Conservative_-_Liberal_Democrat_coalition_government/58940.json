        "additional_details": "Since Global Radio rebranded Choice FM in October 2013, changed its name to CapitalXtra, which resulted in specialist programmes such as reggae, gospel, soca being dropped.\r\n\r\nOur community for whom this licence was granted has struggled to hear the music that reflects their African and Caribbean culture on this commercial station.   Music that was enshrined under the provisions of the original licence granted in 1990.\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t want to have to search the airwaves to hear our music or listen to it at anti social times\u2026 then join the rally and sign this petition.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s get Ofcom, the regulator that gives out radio licences to enforce the licences Global Radio currently holds in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf you still want to hear our music: calypso, dancehall, gospel, reggae, soca etc\u2026 on a commercial music station then join us.\r\n\r\nHave your say \u2026 Let\u2019s show them WE care about our music and our community news.\r\n\r\nAfterall, we have a VOICE and this is our CHOICE.\r\n\r\n",
