        "additional_details": "Abolish parliament (both houses) and all paid politicians in favour of a paid council of selected qualified and experienced governors elected by a smaller unpaid lay electing body which has power to select or remove council members annually. Power of veto remains with the Crown. This takes out the random vanity, personality cults and ill qualified nature of current politics, and gets the work of government done efficiently by professional appointees.\r\n\r\nRemoving the terrible waste of parliament and adversarial politics is surely essential. The power of the UK government is now a sideshow when viewed internationally. So to manage this small state we need a small efficient professional governing body created and appointed by an elected quorum. This way we take the personalities out of politics and enable a chamber of qualified and experienced people who will be held accountable by the unpaid quorum.",
