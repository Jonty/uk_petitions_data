        "additional_details": "The proposed Government changes are unfair. Whilst single earner families with one higher tax rate payer will have child benefit withdrawn, t dual income families with no higher tax rate payer but possibly earning nearly double the income of a higher tax rate payer will still receive the benefit. Also, married couples will be disadvantaged by the change. We implore HM government to to ensure fairness in the payment of child benefit. ",
