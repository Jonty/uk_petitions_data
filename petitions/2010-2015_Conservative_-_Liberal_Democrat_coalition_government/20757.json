        "additional_details": "\r\nIntroduce a monthly question time in parliament. In the 21st century most if not all people on the electoral register have access to the internet, have a web site where people can pose their questions, and the top ten questions become those asked of politicians that month.  We could have a roster of the top five politicians so we know who we are asking questions of, the results of the poll to be shown to the said person prior to having to answer them so they have time to work out their answers, there is NO evading the questions. Have it televised, and if possible to ensure truth, hook them up to a lie detector machine. Its time the British public got some truth, the whole truth, and NOTHING but the truth.",
