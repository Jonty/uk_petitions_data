        "additional_details": "Income and Critical ADL & ADW protection policies have fluffy definitions that have resulted in the FSA, ABI & IFA's going on record at their frustrations with these policies yet they are still being sold. The definitions include being able to hold a pen in either hand, read 18 point print, speak and hear all with the use of assistance or aids. Its on record that 55 percent of claims made against these policies are refused leaving critically ill policyholders with no income and let down after paying premiums for many years. We have started this petition after fighting for 2 years to get a payout and its about time that all policyholders had fair definitions, fair claim handling and clear wording at what policies will pay out for. Please sign this petition and hopefully we can stop another family who bought one of these policies in good faith going through this and hopefully make the government stand up for consumers and end the sale of these policies.",
