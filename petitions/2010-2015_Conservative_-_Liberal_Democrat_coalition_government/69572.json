Summerfield Development have reportedly illegal permission to build on land next to a clean water storage area, which acts as a sump for water flooding down from the Quantock hills.  We believe proper surveys were not conducted to ascertain potential rare wildlife in that area.\r\n\r\nLocal residents have been asking Sedgemoor District Council for several years to specifically pin-point where in the inspectors report that land had been sanctioned but to no avail.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned demand that Eric Pickles intervenes and stops this illegal development.",
