        "additional_details": "Workplace bullying is a serious issue and one which is so often overlooked. Though many workplaces employ procedures to deal with cases of alleged bullying, few take proactive steps to safeguard their staff and prevent incidents which may so easily get out of hand. When individuals take the brave step to report bullying in the workplace many are made to feel alienated or troublemakers and incidents may be brushed under the carpet by management who wish to \"diffuse the flame\" as soon as possible. Workplace bullying may lead to serious health concern and must be taken seriously. An Anti-Bullying Charter, which companies can choose to sign up to, shows dedication to ending workplace bullying. An Independent Anti-Bullying Review panel, responsible for investigating alleged cases of workplace bullying, will ensure transparency and fairness in all investigations. ",
