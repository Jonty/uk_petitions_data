        "additional_details": "I would like to see the government make provision for every school leaver to have a full time job.\r\n\r\nI saw a recent scheme where prison leavers were guaranteed full time work to prevent a life spent in a cycle of crime. This is very commendable but we should surely be making provision to prevent this in the first place.\r\n\r\nIt costs \u00a365,000 to imprison a person in this country once police, court costs and all the other steps are taken into account. After that it costs \u00a340,000 each year they spend incarcerated. A lot of people never reach this income in an annual salary.\r\n\r\nThis money could be put to better use towards business subsidies and grants toward school leaver futures as resposible adults contributing to the community.",
