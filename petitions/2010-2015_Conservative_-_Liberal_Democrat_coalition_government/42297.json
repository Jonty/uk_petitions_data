        "additional_details": "Cannabis should be removed from the Misuse of Drugs act (1971), and regulated in a similar manner to alcohol and tobacco.\r\n\r\nA new progressive stance on Cannabis would transfer the flow of money from the black market to the regulated market, generating much needed tax revenue, and restoring civil rights.\r\n\r\nUS states Colorado and Washington have recently legalised cannabis for recreational use, and others are now considering the measure. Now is the time for the UK to lead the way in a new progressive approach towards the failed war on drugs.",
