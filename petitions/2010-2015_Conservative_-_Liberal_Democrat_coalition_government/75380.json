Nothing changes without pressure.\r\n\r\nSign the #UpForSchool Petition. Act Now.\r\n\r\nWe, the world's youth, teachers, parents and global citizens appeal to our governments to keep their promise, made at the United Nations in 2000, to ensure all out-of-school children gain their right to education before the end of 2015.\r\n\r\nWe are standing up to bring an end to the barriers preventing girls and boys from going to school, including forced work and early marriage, conflict and attacks on schools, exploitation and discrimination. All children deserve the opportunity to learn and achieve their potential.\r\n\r\nWe are #UpForSchool.",
