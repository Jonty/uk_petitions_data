        "additional_details": "The recent surge in road traffic accidents involving cyclists has prompted me to pay more attention to the behavior of cyclists using our roads.  I have witnessed many breaking rules as set out in the Highway Code, which is there for all road users to abide by.  My main concern is cyclists who wear headphones.  These individuals are completely oblivious to what is happening on the roads around them and ultimately lowers their concentration and reaction to events.  I think that there should be on the spot fines for cyclists caught wearing headphones, using mobile telephones or committing any other traffic offences such as going through red lights etc.  It should be the responsibility of ALL road users to make the highways as safe as they can possibly be.",
