        "additional_details": "Our mission is to change the law on prosecution of people who commit emotional child neglect.\r\nAt the moment the law makes it difficult for judges, social workers and police to take affect when emotional neglect occurs.\r\nLeftToRight is our campaign name as we aim to take the children that are left alone and make it right.  Through the action of petitions, whilst working alongside NSPCC and Action for Children we want to use e-petitions to increase our current printed petitions and present them to the government to make it possible for parents or carers who emotionally neglect children to be taken to account for their actions.  We want the Law to be changed, and the Children and Young Person Act of 1933 to be reviewed and assessed whether it is relevant to the needs of children in this area.",
