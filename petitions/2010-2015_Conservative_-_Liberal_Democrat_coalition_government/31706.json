        "additional_details": "We the undersigned demand that any increase in National Non Domestic Rates (Business Rates) should be no higher than the Government\u2019s target rate of increase for the Council Tax.  If the Government has identified that households cannot bear an increase why does it think that businesses can?  The Government should follow its own advice and target a zero increase in Business Rates.\r\n\r\nNational Non Domestic Rates are, by the Government\u2019s own standards, inherently unfair as they bear no relation to a business\u2019s ability to pay.  At a time when the Government is looking to small businesses to lead the country out of recession the 5.6% increase in rates has a disproportionate, negative affect on the economy.\r\n\r\n",
