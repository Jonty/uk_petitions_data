        "additional_details": "A proposal currently exists that would levy penalty fees on student loan repayees who opt to make additional early repayments. We the undersigned petition the government to reject this proposal. The proposal is made on the grounds that it levels the system by stopping those on high incomes paying early. We, however, believe it is a mechanism for profit by forcing repayees on all incomes to accrue interest for longer. Think-tank CentreForum has also made an announcement claiming that early payments are not even necessarily made by those on higher incomes, but by sensible people trying to simply reduce their debt burden.",
