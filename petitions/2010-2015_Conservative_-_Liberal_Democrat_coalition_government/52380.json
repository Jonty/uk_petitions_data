        "additional_details": "With those aged 16-24 the most likely to be sexually assaulted and enter into a violent relationship I believe they should be taught about these issues when they reach secondary school. They should be taught exactly what the law says about these issues, about every single place they can go after they have been affected by one of these crimes, be taught of what can happen to them mentally after being affected by these crimes and not to judge victims and they should be taught what exactly happens when they report the crime and how all evidence is dealt with after collection. The Government need to educate those who are most vulnerable. These issues will just fester. The sooner we can get pupils in secondary school talking and learning about these issues the better. To make victims and survivors keep quiet sends them the message that we don't care. Well I'm putting out this petition so people can show those victims and survivors that we DO care and we WILL make a difference in society.",
