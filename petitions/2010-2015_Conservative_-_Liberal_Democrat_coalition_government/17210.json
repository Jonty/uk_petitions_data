        "additional_details": "Nickel allergy is the most common contact allergy in the UK and is already banned in most jewellery.  It is, however, common in clothing - jeans studs, belt buckles (even the buckles on nurses' belts) and so on.  It's time its use was banned in any item that might come into contact with the skin, saving tens of thousands of people from misery and discomfort, and the health service from unnecessary costs",
