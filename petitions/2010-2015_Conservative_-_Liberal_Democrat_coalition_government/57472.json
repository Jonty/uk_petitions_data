If the use of mobile phones is allowed during a flight then an already uncomfortable experience will be just made worse.\r\n\r\nSurely the world will not end if a phone call cannot be made (or received) while on board!\r\n\r\nPlease BAN mobile phone calls from boarding the aircraft to getting into the terminal on arrival.\r\n",
