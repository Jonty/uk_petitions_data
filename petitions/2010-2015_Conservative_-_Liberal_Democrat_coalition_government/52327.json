        "additional_details": "Godfrey Bloom MEP, champion of women in business and member of the EU\u2019s Gender and Equality Committee, would like to see Jane Austen, the consummate businesswoman of her age, on British bank notes.\r\nIt's the bicentenary of Pride and Prejudice, arguably her best-known novel, so getting her on a bank note by the end of the year would be rather appropriate.\r\nShe has made fortunes for British TV and film and brought that era to light for many. She championed women and mocked the establishment.\r\nHowever, she will face stiff opposition from the Guardianista Feministas and so-called social campaigners from the Left as Austen freely admitted that she wrote for money, seeing it has a marker of self-esteem.  Surely, that is better than the social campaigners who mainly came from money? The new Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, must resist such nonsense.\r\n\r\n",
