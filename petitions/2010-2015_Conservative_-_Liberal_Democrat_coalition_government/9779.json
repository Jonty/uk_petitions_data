        "additional_details": "In addition to existing nature conservation, the British environment can be enhanced by recreating true wilderness. With 90% of our population now urban and agriculture more efficient than ever, there is room available - particularly in Scotland - if large areas of lightly-used land are set aside and farmers paid to relocate. Careful vegetation management can restore the ancient species mix, already accomplished on smaller nature reserves. Britain once had a variety of wild animals comparable to America, or ultimately Africa. Beavers, wild boar and reindeer have been successfully returned to parts of the UK. Future reintroductions should include elk, wood bison, wild horses, Heck cattle, lynx, wolves and bears; possibly even elephants and lions, as replacements for the extinct woolly mammoth and cave lion. As a wealthy, developed nation, Britain could lead by example: show the world that a richer and wilder natural environment can be restored for the future.",
