        "additional_details": "The 2% above inflation escalator on beer tax should be scrapped. It is a tax on jobs, it  penalises responsible drinkers who use licensed premises, and it is inflationary. Not only is there no justification for the escalator but there is no justification for directly linking beer tax with inflation, which is heavily influenced by fuel prices.",
