        "additional_details": "We urge the Government to consider introducing measures to restrict lorries from overtaking on dual carriageways between 06:30-10:00 and 15:00 - 19:00. Currently, lorries overtaking accounts for the majority of slow moving traffic on dual carriageways, increased commute times, pollution levels, stress levels and road traffic accidents.\r\nSeveral European countries have effective measures in place. The benefits far outweigh the detriments. The Government is urged to conduct effective research on the benefits, including through the use of pilot schemes in the worst affected areas, with a view to introducing effective restrictions.",
