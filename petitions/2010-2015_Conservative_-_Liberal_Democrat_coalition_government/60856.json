        "additional_details": "Simple alternative ideas should be considered to reduce waiting time to see GP. Many people find it difficult to see GP when they want to see. Many working hours is lost due to this problem (eg. waiting upto 1 week to see GP to get antibiotics for a chest infection or water infection) causing monetary loss to self employed patients as well as economic loss to the country. A vast majority of people do not mind paying a small fee (say \u00a310 to \u00a315) to see a private GP same day and get prescriptions under NHS. Government can facilitate private GP's and retired GP's to work from home or in an office for a small fee of \u00a310 to \u00a315 per patient.  ",
