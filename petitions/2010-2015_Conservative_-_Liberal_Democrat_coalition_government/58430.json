        "additional_details": "Due to the amount of deaths and accidents on the current zebra crossing and most recently on the 17th December 2013, I feel that the Government should now step in and now replace the dangerous zebra crossing with a Pelican Crossing.\r\n\r\nThe local council has known how dangerous this crossing is. It is badly lit, near schools and is a major road network for HGV's and the majority of traffic entering and leaving Shaw.\r\n\r\nIt is now time for someone to do something about this to avoid anything happening again in the future. If the local Council would have listened last year when there was a death and a serious injury, that poor girl would still be here.",
