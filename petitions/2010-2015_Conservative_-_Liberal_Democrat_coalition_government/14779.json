        "additional_details": "There is debate over prostitution and how to reduce surrounding crimes such as sex trafficking, abuse, money laundering, running of brothels etc.\r\n\r\nThe key way to do this is to make paying for sex illegal and reducing demand for such services. There is an arguement that this could make it more dangerous for workers. However I believe the law should reflect what is expected of people, and I do not believe it is ok to pay for sex. This is a change in society that is needed and it will not happen on its own.\r\n\r\nJust because something has always been that way does not make it acceptable. I also believe that more people should be educated on this industry as many clients delude themselves into believing that the majority of the workers choose to be be sex workers, also that they enjoy the encounters.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eaves4women.co.uk/Documents/Recent_Reports/Men%20Who%20Buy%20Sex.pdf",
