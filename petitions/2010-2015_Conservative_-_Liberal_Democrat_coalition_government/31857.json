        "additional_details": "The Government should revise the operation of the ESA system to prevent discrimination against people with variable, long-term medical conditions, such as ME (Myalgic Encephalopathy, formerly known as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis). The current medical assessment procedures, together with proposed time limits on claims and ending of GP's role in issuing sick notes, frequently and unfairly restrict the ability of people with ME to receive the benefits to which they are entitled as citizens of the UK.",
