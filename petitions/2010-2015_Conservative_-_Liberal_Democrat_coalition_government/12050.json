        "additional_details": "Scotland's shops don't close on a Sunday and I think we should follow suit too. This way the country could get back out of the red by allowing people more choice and freedom of shopping and working on a Sunday at any time that suits them or the employment establishment.\r\n\r\nIt may be regarded as a holy day but if people wish to participate in religious offerings they may do so. Other's have to suffer because of the request from the church to only open shops on a Sunday for 6 hours, this has to change, let the people decide, we need this country to grow and it needs to be open 24/7 for business/leisure/pleasure.\r\n\r\nPlease review the Sunday Trading Act 1994 and revoke the maximum 6 hours trading allowance for the benefit of everyone.",
