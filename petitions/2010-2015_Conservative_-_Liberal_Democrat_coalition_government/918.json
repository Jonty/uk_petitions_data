        "additional_details": "The average plastic bag takes 1000 years to degrade. According to an article in the Daily Mail: \"Britain's coastline is awash with plastic bags, with 70 littering every mile\". This has a devastating effect on wildlife, both in the sea and on land. Animals often mistake our litter, including plastic bags, for food, and will most likely die in agony.  We cannot afford to ignore this any longer.",
