        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned believe that the Postgraduate system in the UK needs an overhaul of its long-term investment and a more secure funding system to be put into place for prospective postgraduate students who wish to study postgraduate courses at UK Universities, who will secure and support the future of the UK's economy.\r\n\r\nThe 7 Research Council's, Charitable funding schemes and CDL's are not enough to encourage more prospective UK postgraduates onto courses. The unknown insecurity on being able to afford such courses deters new enriched, valuable minds and skill sets away from postgraduate study.\r\n\r\nThis puts the UK at risk of falling behind in research and devlopment. Thus a gap will develop in innovation and expert advise of academics the UK economy will desperately need if it is to survive.",
