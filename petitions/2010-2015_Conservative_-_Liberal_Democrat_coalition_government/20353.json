We want the children we love dearly to be returned home where they should be and the correct children taken in to care, and we want proper guidelines that social services have to follow and give a copy to all parents when they file for proceedings.\r\n\r\nWe want to make sure that the court case takes as long as it takes and that social workers are made answerable to the Law, The law should not change to all proceedings taking less than 6months unless the case is extreme and there is definate evidence from police and hospital and not the local authority whos representatives lie to get the good children into care instead of supporting the family",
