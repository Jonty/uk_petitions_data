        "additional_details": "Any goods over the value of \u00a318 imported through the post into the UK from outside the EU are liable to import VAT.\r\nRoyal Mail currently charges a 'handling fee' of \u00a38.00 for collecting even the smallest amount of VAT.  This handling charge is frequently far larger than the amount of tax collected.\r\nWith many people purchasing small items internationally, a good buy on eBay at \u00a320 can be turned into a very expensive one when a \u00a312 fee is demanded before one can receive one's own property.\r\nAllowances on postal imports have not been increased in a long time, whilst the Royal Mail handling charge has more than doubled in the last decade.\r\nWe call on the government to increase allowances to a level where VAT is not payable on postal imports when associated handling charges would be disproportionally large.",
