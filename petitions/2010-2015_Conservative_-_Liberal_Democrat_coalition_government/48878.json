        "additional_details": "Apart from being one of the best British footballers of the past 50 years, Kenny Dalglish has worked tirelessly since the catastrophic events of April 15th 1989 to help bring truth and justice to the families of the 96 Hillsborough Victims. Being the modest man he is, Dalglish will always downplay his part, but we believe he is fully deserving of the title Sir Kenneth Dalglish.",
