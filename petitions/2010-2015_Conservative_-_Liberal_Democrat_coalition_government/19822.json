        "additional_details": "it is deplorable that all major political parties are forcing their MP's to vote against a referendum on Europe.  Over 100,000 people signed a petition to enable a debate on this and to stifle the debate is to go against democracy.  I urge the party leaders to allow a free vote on this.  To not do so would make the petition system pointless. It says to the people we dont care about your views.  The government should allow free votes on all petitions allowed to go through.",
