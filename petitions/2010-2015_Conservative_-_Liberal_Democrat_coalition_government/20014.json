        "additional_details": "In the wake of the EU referendum debacle this week this petition will show the members of parliament that the UK population is fed up with being treated with contempt and ignored on our views in relation decisions that government make that effect all of our lives. This will force the government to ensure that all MP`s accurately represent the constituents and not the party line whether the MP`s like it or not. It should be illegal to force an MP to vote against the majority of the constituents views. This will show that MPs represent the citizens of the UK not a handful of people in government who think the collective population are not intelligent enough to make informed decisions.",
