        "additional_details": "it should be made illegal for restaurants to automatically add a service charge to the bill for groups of 6 or more diners.  Recently I had a \u00a330 service charge added to my bill.  It shouldn't make a difference if customers sit 4 to a table or 12 it takes the same amount of waiting on and cooking.  Often the money is added to the restuarants profits and not shared out amoung the staff.  Tips should be given as a display of satifaction by the customer not compulsory to boost profits.",
