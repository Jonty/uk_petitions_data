This is an essential public utility,not a luxury.\r\n\r\nWages, state pensions and the CPI are all rising at an annual rate of between 2.5 and 2.7%, one quarter of that demanded by the energy industry.\r\n\r\nAction required: effective from 1st January 2014, all energy companies must be required to provide supplies linked to the Consumer Price Index (2.7%).\r\n\r\nAusterity is for all, not a chosen few.
