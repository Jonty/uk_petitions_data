The earlier we learn how to spot when things are wrong, the higher the chance of survival\r\n\r\n- Learning to form good healthy habits is a key priority to reducing the number of us getting cancer as half of all cancers are caused by our lifestyles\r\n\r\n- With an innovative and creative approach there is huge opportunity to to add to the existing curriculum to teach these lessons\r\n\r\n- It is our duty to ensure that all student teachers are equipped to teach young people how to look after and manage their health\r\n\r\n- By educating and empowering young people we can combat late diagnosis and improve survival rates. The Department of Health\u2019s own document says that, in the long run, early diagnosis doesn't cost the NHS more. It is a proven cost-neutral way of increasing the survival rate.\r\n ",
