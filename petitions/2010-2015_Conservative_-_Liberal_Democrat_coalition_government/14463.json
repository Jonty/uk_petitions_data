        "additional_details": "It should be the right of every parent to bring up their children. The government thinks absent fathers should only contribute financially. When parents split the mother is given preference to bring up the child involved. Isn\u2019t this sexual bias, and against a fathers human rights a loving father who wants to be part of their child\u2019s life should be given the opportunity and not frozen out by the family courts like they are today. Equal rights means being treated equally, under today\u2019s family court rulings mothers get everything they want and the father has to put up with this. Under rulings for ethnic, religious and any other discrimination the offender can be locked up. Unfortunately fathers don\u2019t come under this type of protection as the government only want the father to pay to bring up the child so the government doesn\u2019t have to contribute. WE WANT TO BE WITH OUR CHILDREN please sign this petition.  ",
