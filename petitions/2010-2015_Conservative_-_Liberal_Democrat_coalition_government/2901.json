        "additional_details": "I propose that they way duty is charged on alcohol should be changed to help struggling pubs and clubs. I believe that duty on alcohol sold in pubs and clubs should be reduced to help lower the cost of a pint; to compensate for this the duty should be increased on alcohol purchased from an off license. This would help increase the price of cheap alcohol sold by supermarkets which would satisfy those concerned by the low prices, and encourage responsible drinking in an environment where you can be refused a drink if too drunk or aggressive.",
