        "additional_details": "We live in the year 2011 & every time you turn on a TV or read a newspaper, death through war is always there. Has 10,000 years of history taught us nothing? How much longer should we continue to kill our neighbours on Earth through military violence for the supposed 'good of mankind'? Would it not be great for the UK to go down in the annals of history as the first 'Super-Power' to remove all Armed Forces? It may be idealist to some, but if you don't pose any military threat to another country then that particular country will have no reason to inflict military violence against you...AND WE COULD SAVE \u00a334 BILLION POUNDS A YEAR TO HELP WIPE OUR NATIONAL DEBT OF \u00a31.1 TRILLION POUNDS...Then we can look to scrap the farcical & corrupt organisation known as NATO.",
