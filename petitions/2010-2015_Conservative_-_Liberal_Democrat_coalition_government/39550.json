Some have been bonkers, some brilliant.\r\n\r\nWe congratulate our Government on a successful experiment and ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Internet is helping reshape the way live and democracy should not be left out, but for now we will settle for a few gradual improvements.\r\n\r\n1. Allow e-petitions users to create an account, so that they don't need to spend time filling in their details for every petition they support\r\n\r\n2. Allow users to vote AGAINST petitions too, so that our leaders can be confident they are answering the true majority and not just a loud minority\r\n\r\n3. Writing petitions takes passion, which also comes with bias. When a group will be affected by a petition, allow them to explain their position so voters can make more balanced decisions\r\n\r\nImproving e-petitions will help encourage people to engage in democratic debate and make our country and fairer and happier place to live.",
