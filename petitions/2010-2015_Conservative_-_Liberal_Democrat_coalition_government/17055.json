        "additional_details": "Stop compulsory homework for primary school children. The amount of pressure felt by parents of young families, not to mention the pressure on the children themselves, is becoming a national issue.  It is always more than the prescribed amount, takes longer, stresses both children and their parents, can cause arguments between work-stressed spouses, almost ALWAYS requires parental assistance, is often ill-targeted, robs families of already decreasing opportunities for stress-free quality time, and - worst of all - undermines the chances that children will acquire a love of learning. It is an educational policy which negatively impacts a massive number of families.",
