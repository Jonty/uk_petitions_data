        "additional_details": "To the House of Commons.\r\nThe petition of John BUTLER declares that by your action the country could maintain an indigenous capability to profitably manufacture satellite and rocket booster propellant tanks.\r\nThe petitioner therefore requests that the House of Commons consider what actions can be taken to maintain the skills of those who embody this strategic asset.  The lease on their design and manufacturing facility runs out in July 2012.  Afterwards the foreign owners of the company will relocate some staff and fill orders at their German facility.  To retain this strategic asset sufficiently large clean room(s) and engineering spaces are required near to Wolverhampton.  Perhaps a source of investment capital could be found and the UK government could offer advice to the company management that it would be worth their while not to relocate so far away.\r\nAnd the petitioner remains, etc.\r\nFurther information on the ex Dowty Boulton Paul company can be found at www.mt-sat.co.uk\r\n",
