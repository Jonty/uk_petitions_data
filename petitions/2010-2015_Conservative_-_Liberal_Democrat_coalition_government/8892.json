        "additional_details": "The 2010 Equalities act Sections 158 and 159\r\nmake it legal for employers to discriminate against\r\nBritish males in favour of female and ethnic minority\r\ncandidates solely on the grounds of their gender and/or ethnicity.\r\n\r\nLegalized discrimination in the workplace is divisive and absurd.\r\n\r\nChoosing applicants because of their ethnicity or gender patronises and mocks both the merit and subsequent achievement of the applicants.\r\n\r\nIt will also lead to resentment amongst those whom it is to discriminate against and instil the perception that female and ethic minority candidates can only be successful because of this legalized discrimination.\r\n\r\nNaming such a blatant discriminatory practise 'equality'  is an insult to the intelligence, ambition and dignity of the people of Britain. It was sought to fulfil the pseudo-Marxist social engineering schemes of the previous labour government and has no support amongst the British people.\r\n\r\nRemove this absurdity from British law.",
