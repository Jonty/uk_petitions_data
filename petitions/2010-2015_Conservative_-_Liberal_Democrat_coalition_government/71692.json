In 2014, British Prime Minister David Cameron hosted the annual Diwali party at his official residence which is widely acknowledged by over 8,00,00 Hindus living in the UK.\r\nWe would like to request relevant department to launch a commemorative stamp for Diwali similar to yearly Christmas stamps that were first issued in 1966. Diwali stamps can capture the essence of festival\u2019s key themes are light over darkness and bring prosperity and happiness for all human beings and pass it on to the wider world in their own special ways.\r\nThis small step surely helps to drive a message that UK is a multi-cultural, tolerant country that strongly believes in bringing all communities towards an inclusive society.\r\n",
