        "additional_details": "Stop the student loan discrimination!\r\nStudents should not be disadvantaged because of their parents' financial circumstances. Each student should be financed equally regardless of household earnings, why should students from poorer households be given more, whilst those from from wealthier backgrounds receive less? It's discriminating and taking away opportunities from others without justification. Not all parents are willing to support their child, financial equality would help ensure a fair start for everyone in student life. ",
