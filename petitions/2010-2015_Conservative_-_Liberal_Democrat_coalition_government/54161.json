        "additional_details": "In Nov 2012 my Mother was diagnosed with Terminal Cancer. In Feb 2013 I moved in with my Baby to become her full time carer, after verbal agreement from Gallions Housing Association that I could become Co-Tenant with immediate effect given the circumstances. Gallions then advised that I had made myself and my son intentionally homeless by doing this and that I must reside for 1 year before gaining rights to the tenancy. On 9th August 2013 my Mother sadly passed, Myself now being 26weeks pregnant am being informed barely 1 week after her passing that they wish to terminate the tenancy. Please sign this petition to stop Gallions Housing Association evicting myself and my 20month old son from a family home of over 20 years because my mum \"unfortunately died within the year\", And support me gaining rights to the tenancy.",
