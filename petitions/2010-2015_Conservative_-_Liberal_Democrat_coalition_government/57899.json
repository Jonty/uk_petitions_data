        "additional_details": "This is a petition to keep Honeyfields, Hextable care home open. The head office decided that they want our home closed down. Our residents will be moved in a 20 mile radius, but the ones who pay private have to sort themselves out. This is their home, they have dementia they are settled they know the staff and they are happy where they are. All because Honeyfields isn't like these new homes that just feel like you are in a hotel but thats what makes our home a home.. It is not like that it is a home it feels like a home and everyone who visits says the same thing! Why should they be moved about, they may be diagnosed with dementia but they aren't stupid .. Some of them have been with us for years and the head office are just going to take that all away for them. Everyone must stick together and not let this happen. They are apart of our lives and we have a duty of care, our duty of care says we must protect and look after our residents so we need a petition. Please help!!",
