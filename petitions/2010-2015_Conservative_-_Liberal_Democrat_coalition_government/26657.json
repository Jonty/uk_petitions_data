This policy will start taking effect this January 2012. This policy is currently subject to public consultation by HMG, due to the introduction of universal credit in 2013. This policy of not paying over 2 years mortgage interest relief to jobseekers allowance (JSA) claimants will result in more homelessness and add to the current 8 million people in social housing and the 1.8 on waiting list for social housing and should be abolished.",
