        "action": "Reforming young offenders' institutions: learning from boot camps",
        "additional_details": "We propose scrapping current young offender institutions and replacing them with institutions that combine military training, community service and education. We propose that such institutions have significant input from retired officers and we believe that such institutions have a better chance of serving a rehabilitative function. In effect we hope to instil the discipline, sense of social responsibility and sense of self-respect that is lacking. This scheme is based on the need to both punish and rehabilitate (the latter is extremely weak under the current system). This scheme will be both cheaper and more effective than the current system: barracks style accommodation in the countryside; military trainers; a minimum of creature comforts to be counterbalanced by a strong drive to keeping young offenders busy in a meaningful and productive way: military training, community service and education. Ideally they will hate the institution on entry but will be grateful to it on departure.",
