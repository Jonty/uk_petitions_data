A new site needs to identified and developed as soon as possible to provide the country with a state of the art, purpose built aviation hub capable of dealing with much higher passenger volumes as well as having much improved public transport links to the whole of the country.  Failure to implement such a plan will see the UK falling behind and loosing out to European hub such as Amsterdam and Paris.",
