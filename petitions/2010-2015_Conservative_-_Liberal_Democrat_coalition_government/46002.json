        "additional_details": "So we are in state where prison and no longer a deterrent and overflowing with inmates, the cost of incarceration is rising and there is no longer any fear of the justice system.in my opinion it is viewed as an inconvenience more than a punishment and this needs to change.\r\nWe need to stop allowing European courts making decisions regarding the treatment of prisoners, the high court in the uk should be where the wheel stops regarding governing our criminals.\r\nWith this petition I want the government to review prisoners rights, the luxuries which most people cannot afford should be removed, cells should be plain, no electronics, limited phone calls, meals to match nutritional needs as a standard, no requests no specialities.\r\nIt's time to make a change, the way things are they might as well be on the naughty step. Remove the rights of day release and open half way houses to bring people back into society, no open prisons but real incarceration.\r\n",
