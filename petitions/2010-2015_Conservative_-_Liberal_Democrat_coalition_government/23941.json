        "additional_details": "Many hotlines have various menu options where a voice asks you for example to press a certain number for a certain department etc. Often these hotlines are 0844, 0845, 0870 or similar numbers which will get you often charged 10p per minute or more. Sometimes the menu options are long and confusing and you can spend multiple minutes before you actually can speak to someone. Companies exploit this and purposely put up long messages to make money.\r\n\r\nI want that those that call these numbers are no longer charged while listening to those long winded and often pointless menu options. Other countries including Germany are currently putting in place similar laws.\r\n\r\n",
