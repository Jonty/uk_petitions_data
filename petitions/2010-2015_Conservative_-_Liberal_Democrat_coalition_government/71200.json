        "additional_details": "The North East of Englands new trend is 'Legal Highs' these drugs are worse than most class  B & C illegal drugs. I've spoke to regular users most 15-25, who says the addiction is not fictional there physically scared to stop and have actually stopped smoking cannabis as the legal highs are better! This should not be sound in our shops where our children have access! There's been a lot of case about young people dying/killing themselves under the influence of such drugs. The drugs that are trending recently have opiate in them which is obviously highly addictive and withdrawal could be life threatening.. 1000's of young people have had to be resuscitated because of the affect! Please take this off the street! ",
