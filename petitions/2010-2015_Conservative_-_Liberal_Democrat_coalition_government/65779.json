She clearly hasn't looked into how to care for a rabbit and it seems like her only intention is to gain publicity from it.\r\n\r\nRabbit's spend most of their time in warrens where they feel safe and otherwise they would spend time outside eating grass and plants and not spending time in offices and at fashion shoots.\r\n\r\nThere is a clear lack of care as seen when Cecile got stuck under the floor boards at one of Cara's meetings.",
