Having children is a personal choice either for single parents or for couples and every parent has the right to have as many children as they wish.\r\n\r\nHowever, having children is the parents responsibility, and it is not the taxpayers responsibility to help fund those parents who freely choose to have three, four or more. Furthermore the taxpayer cannot afford to help finance parents who wish to have many children.\r\n\r\nThe benefits system should therefor be changed so that financial assistance of any type is provided ONLY for the first two children in any household, so that whilst any individual can choose to have as many children as they wish, the government & taxpayer will provide financial assistance for only the first two.",
