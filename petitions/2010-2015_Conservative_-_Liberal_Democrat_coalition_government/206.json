        "additional_details": "For some bizzare reason the government does not consider contributions from non resident parents or the CSA when calculating how much benefit a person can receive. Therefore if parents seperate and the mother gets \u00a31000 a month off the estranged father, they are still eligible for full tax credits and benefits. The government is giving money away to those that don't need it. When calculating benefits all income should be considered and benefits adjusted respectively.",
