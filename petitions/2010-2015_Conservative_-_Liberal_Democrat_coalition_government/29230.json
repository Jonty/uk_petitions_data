        "additional_details": "Since the late 1980's a set of gates has barred public access to Downing Street. Since then a fundamental disconnect has built up between the public and the government. The gates across Downing Street are a symbol of this political malaise. We the signatories to this petition ask Her Majesty's Government to provide a form of limited access to Downing Street. The access should be subject to security checks, ticketing and be strictly time limited and only available during the summer parliamentary recess. A similar system currently works well for visits to Parliament.",
