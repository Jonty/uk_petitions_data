        "additional_details": "The general public are sick of mainstream political parties failing to deliver, or blatantly departing from,  their respective manifesto promises.\r\n\r\nAs many voters rely on these dossiers when placing their faith in prospective governments, it should not be acceptable under any circumstances to casually scrap key pledges the minute No.10 welcomes a fresh Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nI hereby urge a parliamentary debate to consider drafting legislation to make manifesto pledges legally binding.\r\n\r\n Any listed policy that fails to materialise during the lifetime of the party in government, for whatever reason, should trigger an immediate election.\r\n\r\n N.B: All parties must draft policies robust enough to survive a Hung Parliament and any subsequent coalition-government agreement. Under no circumstances can a party be permitted to use any such circumstance as an excuse for abandoning key election promises.\r\n\r\n The people of Britain deserve better; please support this petition.\r\n",
