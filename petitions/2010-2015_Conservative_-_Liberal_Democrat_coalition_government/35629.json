Let's change it back to how it used to be.  You would take a vacancy to the Job Advisor and they would call the employer and set up the appointment.\r\n\r\nWork Programme should be in the same building as the Job Centre, and both proactively looking to find work for the unemployed.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing like offering staff an incentive to get the unemployed figures down.\r\n",
