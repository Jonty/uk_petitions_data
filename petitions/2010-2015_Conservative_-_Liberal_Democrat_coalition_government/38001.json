Gone are the days where 'the people' actually wrote a letter to their MP to complain, or waved a placard, or stood on a podium and rallied their 'fellow countryman'.\r\n\r\nNow, if you don't like something, you can press a chubby finger onto a keyboard, it takes less time than making a cup of tea, and won't distract from X-Factor, therefore it must be the very best method of affecting the way the country is run, or influencing the decision of the Government.\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't work. It is just millibytes of data on a server, somewhere not even within a Government building. It has nowhere near the impact of thousands of letters landing on a desk, or haraguing an MP in person.\r\n\r\nIt's breeding apathy in the UK, and needs to stop.",
