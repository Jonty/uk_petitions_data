        "additional_details": "Given the feel good factor that has been generated this summer with the Olympics and the Paralympics and the fact that David Bowie's Heroes has without doubt been the unofficial anthem we petition the government to change the UK's national anthem to Heroes.  From henceforth at all sporting events let this be played rather than God save the queen. The country would take to it as it would evoke great memories, it is relevant, it has a great tune, great lyrics and is more likely to be sung with great gusto by more of the crowd!",
