        "additional_details": "Cities in the UK are pathetically low-rise compared to foreign counterparts. By building \"up\" rather than \"out\" we could make many more homes, thereby meeting the very high demand for housing that currently exists, whilst retaining our countryside. Skyscrapers are also more efficient in terms of energy and transportation than small scale buildings. We call on the government to encourage cities to build proper skyscrapers in lieu of new edge-of-town, greenfield developments.",
