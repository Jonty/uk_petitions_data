During the day, the charity will provide various services to local people in need of support as well as a pleasant, relaxing Coffee shop environment, which Linthwaite is lacking.\r\nIn the evenings it will be a classy wine bar which will also provide business opportunities to the other outlets on the stretch i.e.fast food & taxis.\r\nPlease sign the petition to help us to help others.\r\nFor more information on Ruddi's Retreat - please visit our website - www.ruddisretreat.org ",
