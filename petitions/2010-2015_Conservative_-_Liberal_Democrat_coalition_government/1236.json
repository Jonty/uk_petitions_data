        "additional_details": "Following a succession of Private Member Bills by the late Sidney Silverman MP from 1948 onwards, the abolision of Capital Punishment became law during 1969. The last hangings were during 1964, and the James Hanratty Case of 1962 was instrumental in bringing about Public Opinion against the retention of Capital Punishment.\r\nI would like the Government to debate the issue of a Public Reforendum on the Reinstatement of Capital Punishment and not leave it to our elected representatives with their various personal issues on the subject. If there is a clear majority in favour then the Public should be afforded the protection and the new legislation should be on clearly defined parameters with no loopholes.",
