Government has stated that they are working towards equal access for treatment for mental health problems, but there\u2019s still no agreed time frame for when mental health problems will see maximum waiting times enforced.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.b-eat.co.uk/support-us/get-involved/campaigning/waiting-time-equality/\r\n\r\nKnowing people who have been through recovery, I'm too aware that it's a tough road made worse by long waiting times and lack of sufficient funding. It takes a lot of courage to seek treatment, so to be then faced with months of waiting with little to no ongoing support is unacceptable.\r\n",
