        "additional_details": "The FA no longer represents the interests of fans or the grass roots level game but instead panders to the whims of the media/commercial sector.\r\n\r\nThe review must assess at least the following:\r\n\r\n1. Independence: Conflicts where FA staff share both club and FA affiliations must be resolved. A director of one football club should not have input over the decisions made about a rival club.\r\n\r\n2. Review of its campaigns: \u201cRespect\u201d needs an open process to improve the way in which matches are refereed. Thus players could offer the respect that officials rightly deserve, knowing the referees will still make mistakes but will strive to improve with the use of technology post-match and open discussion regarding the in-game decision making process. The opacity of the existing structure leaves many fans and players confused.\r\n\r\n3. Punishment VS Rehabilitation: Punishment for racism/homophobia misses the point; players need to be helped see these biases are unfair and wrong.",
