        "additional_details": "We the undersigned would like the government to look at making it compulsory for all Primary Schools to employ a full time multi-sports coach to teach all children sport from an early age. It is about time that we take responsibility away from normal class teachers to take charge of PE lessons and give trained and qualified coaches, to which there are hundreds, the opportunity to gain employment and pass on their skills and knowledge to the future sports stars of this country. Also we would like all children to be given a minimum of 1 hour per day compulsory Physical Activity time during school hours to help promote a healthy lifestyle from a young age and also help create a long lasting legacy from the already successful 2012 Olympic Games. The children of today are our future and deserve better now.",
