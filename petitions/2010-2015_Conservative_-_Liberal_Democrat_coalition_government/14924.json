        "additional_details": "This petition is a direct question set to the Prime Minister and his fellow members of parliament, to consider making all service pensions, both past and present, free from all forms of Income Tax.\r\nTo have served your country should be an honour. To then receive a pension for your devoted service, and then have a large percentage taken back through taxation, is both unethical and plain wrong.\r\nI am sure that there are thousands of fellow country man who feel the same, from both military and non military backgrounds.",
