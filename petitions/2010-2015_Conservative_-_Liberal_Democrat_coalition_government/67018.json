        "additional_details": " Offences of Animal Cruelty (as described in the Animal Welfare Act 2006) is triable only summarily (cannot go to Crown Court) and carry a maximum penalty of \u00a320,000 fine and/or 51 weeks imprisonment.\r\n\r\nWe demand that sentencing is increased to a maximum of 5 years imprisonment and a lifetime ban for serious or repeat offenders.\r\n\r\nAnimal cruelty , in extreme cases, can involve the inhumane torturing and regrettable death of an animal. These horrible acts can be carried out by 'human beings' in order to exhibit power and authority amongst other reasons.\r\n\r\nRecently a horrendous act occurred in Dudley, where a dog between the age of 1 and 2 years old had a metal chain tied around it's neck and was then hoisted 15 ft above the ground and suspended until it died. Investigators believe that the dog suffered dramatically for an extremely long time.\r\n\r\nSign this petition to increase the charge for animal cruelty. SIGN THIS PETITION TO DO THE BASIC HUMANE THING!\r\n",
