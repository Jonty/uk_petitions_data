If we want to inspire our countries youth to become more physically active and enthuastic about sport we need to take action now. It is strange that whilst people living all around the world can watch the premier league at little cost, many people in this country cannot afford to watch.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of the London 2012 games, we should be able to stand proud of our national sport broadcast to all.",
