        "additional_details": "With forever unfair increases in train ticket prices, and frozen salaries, no salary increases or drops in salary pay and raises in bills and food, people cannot afford the forever increase that the government and rail companies are putting on workers. People who work can no longer afford to travel to work, which will in turn make people stop using public transport or give up their jobs. This is totally unfair on workers in the UK, We have the worst value for money train service in the whole of europe and yet with the train company profits increasing our ticket fares are increasing at an even faster rate. Make the train companies pay for the investment and reduce the price now forced upon users of the rail network.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
