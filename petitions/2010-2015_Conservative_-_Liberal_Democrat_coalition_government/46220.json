The self-employed lose income and the employed either use up their holiday time or spend extra money on childcare.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to standardize all half term holidays for state schools and strongly encourage the independent sector to do the same.\r\n\r\nIf government were to action this petition, it would have far-reaching effects. Holiday activity clubs would be more inclusive extensive and focused.  Working families will be financially better off.",
