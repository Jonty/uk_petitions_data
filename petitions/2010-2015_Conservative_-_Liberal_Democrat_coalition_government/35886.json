That is a lot of people in a small A&E !!!\r\n\r\nWas there a hue train crash, was there a major terrorist incident or was there a riot at a local football match \u2013 the answer is no!!\r\n\r\nThe majority of the patients forcing the Ambulance crews to wait were DRUNK people.\r\n\r\nI believe the answer is quiet simple, let\u2019s keep the NHS free to those who need it, however I believe people who cost the NHS time and money due to drink and drug related injuries should be forced to pay for their stay and treatment.\r\n\r\nI know there are a lot of formalities to consider before implementing something like this, but in principal it is pretty simple.\r\n\r\nI hope common sense prevails.
