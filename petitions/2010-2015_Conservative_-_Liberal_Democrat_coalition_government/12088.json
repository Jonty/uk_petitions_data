Japan and Norway and other countries that still use Whale Meat for food as well as other uses should have sanctions against them not just from this country but world wide. There are enough resources world wide for those nations not to need whale meat. Cattle is easily farmed and the increase in cattle production would cost little, the loss of whales around the world is bringing some species to extinction. Stop trade or add high import export taxes to such countries.",
