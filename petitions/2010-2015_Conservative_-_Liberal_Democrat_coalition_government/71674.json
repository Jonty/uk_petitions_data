Invariably, when communities celebrate with fireworks, animal rescue  are overwhelmed by the \"fallout,\" which manifests in an increased number of stray animals and reports of injuries and trauma to animals.  Those animals who are reunited with their families must consider themselves fortunate.  Many injured or terrorized animals run away from their homes to escape the traumatizing detonations of fireworks.  Some are hit by cars and injured or killed, some are maimed for life, while others are never recovered alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
