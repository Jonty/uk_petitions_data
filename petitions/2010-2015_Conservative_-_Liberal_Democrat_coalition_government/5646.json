        "action": "Remove Michael Gove as Secretary of State for Education",
        "additional_details": "It is believed by many teachers that Michael Gove is not up to the task of Secretary of State for Education. His strategies to 'improve' education in Britain are based on his own narrow minded ideology and he refuses to accept that his plans will cripple the education system in Britain. He consistently ignores warnings from teachers regarding Acadamies and Free Schools which will be able to employ non-qualified people to teach our children. He claims that Academies are being created to allow schools more freedom when in fact the Academies programme results in schools being controlled by central government. This man is a liability to all children and young people in this country and must be removed as Secretary of State with immediate effect.    ",
