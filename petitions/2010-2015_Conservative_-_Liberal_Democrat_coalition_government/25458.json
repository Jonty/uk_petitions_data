In the words of senior academics responsible for drawing up the Alternative White Paper, the Government's proposed changes are \"a reckless gamble, a dangerous experiment in university funding with no precedent in British experience. Its different elements are incoherent\".\r\n\r\nThe Government has zero electoral mandate for pushing through the proposals outlined in the Higher Education White Paper. ",
