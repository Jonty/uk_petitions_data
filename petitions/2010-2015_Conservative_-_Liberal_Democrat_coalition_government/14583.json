        "additional_details": "I for one, am fed-up with turning up at car parks run by local authorities which do not give any change from their car park meters.\r\n\r\nIn recent years technology appears to have advanced to a point where you have to enter your car registration onto your ticket in order to receive your permit to park.  Yet the payment meters are still not able to give out any change.\r\n\r\nWe do however have the option of using our mobile phones (yet another cost) to call an office and pay with either your debit or credit card (potentially yet another charge).\r\n\r\nI don't see whats wrong with simply paying by cash.  It can't be that hard to organise.  After all coffee machines and food dispensers, in the work place, leisure centres and railway stations all seem to have machines which give change.\r\n\r\nThis is nothing other than profiteering by the local authorities!!!",
