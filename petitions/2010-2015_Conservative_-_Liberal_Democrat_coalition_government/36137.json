        "additional_details": "Proposal is that all personal household computer equipment (non gaming type) be free of VAT or at least decreased rate of VAT, allowing all families, individuals, students and children to have increased access to this medium to advance the state of the country for all our futures. Anything less, just holds back the learning and creative potential of our whole Nation from North to South, Rich or Poor.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m sure the loss in tax would easily be offset by the communication skills advance with the increasing volume of elderly, education leading to employment for the youth and the country being proficient with the Internet, thus reducing costs in governmental paper work and postage etc.\r\n\r\nOr, leave the status quo and have a lost generation of youth not reaching their potential, and increasing numbers of elderly left behind along with the poor. Now is the time for action on this before the tipping point comes and is lost with great costs to our society\u2019s future.\r\n",
