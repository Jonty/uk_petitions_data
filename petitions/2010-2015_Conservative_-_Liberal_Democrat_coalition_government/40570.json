We are lucky to have most of the main conveniences on our doorstop.   We do not want or need a new supermarket!!\r\n\r\nOur village is now under threat due to failures in the planning process.  A new supermarket and commercial veterinary practice are due to be built in the heart of the village.  Local traders and residents do not want them in the village but have been ignored by the planning committees at all levels.\r\n\r\nWe need urgent help to get the approved planning application reviewed at a senior governmental level before it is too late. Is it fair to ignore the residents of the village? We want the government to overturn the decision and help to SAVE OUR VILLAGE.",
