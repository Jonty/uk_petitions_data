        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned call on Government to rethink its decision to scrap the \u00a3347 million Local Welfare Assistance fund. This fund is used by councils to provide emergency support. Its removal - after April 2015 - will make it increasingly difficult to help vulnerable people facing short-term crises, as well as place an enormous strain on third sector organisations in local communities who exist to help those in need.",
