        "additional_details": "B&Q have decided to close their store in Hyde Cheshire making all the staff redundant. It seems this store is consistently meeting budgets and making a profit. Not only is Hyde losing an employer that has been in the town for 26 years it will have a devastating effect on the town as it attracts a lot of business for local shops etc. we are asking the government to apply pressure on B&Q to reverse their decision and keep people in employment and prevent the town of Hyde from becoming a ghost town.
