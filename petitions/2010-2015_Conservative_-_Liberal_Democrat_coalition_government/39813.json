        "additional_details": "We are asking the Government to change the law surrounding the pre-payment industry and to hold a Public Enquiry regarding Farepak & European Home Retail. 13/10/ 2006 Farepak went into Admin owing \u00a338M to customers & Agents who\u2019d pre-paid for goods that never arrived The Admin & subsequent Liquidation has cost approx. \u00a39M to realise just approx. \u00a35M It\u2019s unfair & unjust that those whose money was taken & used recklessly bolstering the parent company WITHOUT the permission or knowledge of the Agents & customers are to pay the \u00a39M bill accrued by BDO Then to add insult to injury the taxpayer has now been given a \u00a36M legal bill due to the Director Disqualification case collapsing. Then in a Times article Sir Clive Thompson Chairman & Director of EHR is going to sue for deformation of character Legally this maybe allowed but MORALLY IT\u2019S OUTRAGEOUS & LAWS NEED TO BE CHANGED We request a Public Enquiry is granted & held ASAP",
