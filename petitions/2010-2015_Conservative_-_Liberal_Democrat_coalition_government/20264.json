        "additional_details": "Child benefit has been removed for those earning over a specific amount. Child benefit is suppose to be for the child. Boys on average have more child benefit spent on them than girls due to sanitary products having to be taken into account when budgeting for personal items.\r\nGirls age 11, 12 or maybe even younger do not earn to pay for these products. Thoses in full time education should have sanitary products made available free of charge as Condoms are made available free of charge through health clinics.\r\nDuring this harsh era of austerity, families are struggling to put food on the table so make it fairer and easier on families who are unable to afford these products at best of times. Sanitary products are not a luxury they are a necessity and the Health Department should make provisions for families and care homes to be able to have access to free sanitary products. Girls should not be paying for an item that they cannot afford.",
