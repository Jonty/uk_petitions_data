        "additional_details": "A message to all politicians concerning the bedroom tax , this is no more than political bullying. There are couples out there who are in need of two bedrooms because of disabilities and other very important circumstances who are being forced to either lose benefits or move out. And all this is because the next wave of people from Europe is due in 2014. To be treated like a second class citizen off your own government? To say now you've brought your kids up move out is about as insensitive as you can get. A house is more than a home, it's your life, your memories. A place where futures Are planned and shaped. A place where your neibours are your freinds and have been for years. I say tell Cameron to stuff this tax and give up some of his properties to the people from Europe he thinks are more needy than his own countrymen. And by the way I own my own home so it won't affect me, but I still think its wrong!!  Please sign this petition if you want to safeguard our homes!",
