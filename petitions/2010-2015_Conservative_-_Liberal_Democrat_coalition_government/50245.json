        "additional_details": "The Honeypot Nursery, based in Moodiesburn, has been open since 1995 and offers early education for children aged between 2 & 5 years.\r\n\r\nOn the 17 May 2013 the parents were informed that the nursery will close at the end of the summer term in June 2013.\r\n\r\nThis resource is a lifeline to the Community of Moodiesburn.  If this facility closes there will be a shortage of 3 -5 places in the local community. A committee of parents are preparing to take forward a case to keep Honeypot Nursery open and maintain the number of local early years education places.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to show support to staff, children and families who will be affected by the closure of this Nursery!\r\n\r\n",
