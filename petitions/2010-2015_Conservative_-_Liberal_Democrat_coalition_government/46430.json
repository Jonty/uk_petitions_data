        "additional_details": "David Crompton, the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, in an email slated the campaigners of Justice for the 96 who lost their lives at Hillsborough.  He labelled  campaigners as LIARS.  Four days later, the Hillsborough Independent Panel published their report & the REAL TRUTH came out. The REAL LIARS are SYP & have been so for  24 years.  The force has not changed.  It is still corrupt, it still covers up, it still lies, under the jurisdiction of Mr. Crompton, who in his disgraceful attack upon the 96, the bereaved families & survivors, proves he is a willing advocate of such vile acts.  Mr Crompton is not fit to hold the position of Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police.  I urge the government to either offer Mr Crompton the chance to resign or he should be removed from the post by order of the Home Secretary.  Please sign this petition for the just cause in the pursuit of justice for the 96, the bereaved families and survivors.\r\n\r\nJFT96\r\n\r\nYNWA",
