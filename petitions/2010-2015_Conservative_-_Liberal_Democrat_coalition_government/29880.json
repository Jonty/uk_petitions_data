        "additional_details": "This petition calls for an end to classifying hate in categories of race, creed, colour, sexuality etc... in favour of a Humanism Bill, which would see all derogatory terms banned in public life.\r\n\r\nThe driver for this change is that because major categories such as race and sexuality have independent legislation, niche hate, for example, hurtful comments made regarding red hair, are allowed to prevail simply as a result that they are not legislated against, which leaves sections of the community vulnerable to bullying.\r\n\r\nWe should legislate against the behaviour of the perpetrators, rather than the sections of the community that are most affected.",
