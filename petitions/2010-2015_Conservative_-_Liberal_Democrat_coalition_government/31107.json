A car driven on the public highway by someone under the influence of either drink and/or drugs is as dangerous a weapon as a gun in the wrong hands\r\nThe Government must scrap the existing soft law of causing death by careless/dangerous driving and replace it with an automatic charge of manslaughter. Then stipulate to the courts that anyone found guilty should receive the maximum sentence allowed for the offence of manslaughter.\r\nThere is no charge of careless/dangerous use of a firearm and there should be NO charge of causing death by careless/dangerous driving.\r\nThen, perhaps our roads maybe a little safer for pedestrians and road users.
