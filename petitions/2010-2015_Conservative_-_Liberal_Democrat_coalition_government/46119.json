Evidence has shown non-medical interventions to be more effective, cheaper and safer. The government should review the evidence on the effects of psychiatric medications alongside evidence supporting non-medical interventions (e.g. Soteria, Open Dialogue), and accordingly make appropriate changes to government policy.
