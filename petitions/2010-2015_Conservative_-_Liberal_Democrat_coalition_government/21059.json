        "additional_details": "The most significant common factor in the cause of global climate change is the world's increasing population. As a 'green' world leader we should direct at least 50% of any budget relating to climate change to the control of population growth both in the UK and by de-incentivising immigration.  Any related budget should also be directed in this way. All foreign aid should be used solely to reduce the population of countries unable to support themselves by the provision of contraception and related training. ",
