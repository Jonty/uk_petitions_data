When developmental dysplasia of the hip is diagnosed and treated early in a young baby, the outcome is usually excellent. If treatment is delayed, the treatment is more complex and with less chance of being successful.\r\n\r\nIf your child's DDH is not diagnosed and treated early, they may develop early arthritis of the hip joint. This causes pain and reduced movement. The treatment of DDH gets more complex and with less chance of success once your child's bones have fully developed. Even at this stage though, treatment can still provide a long-term outcome which is better than the alternative of no treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
