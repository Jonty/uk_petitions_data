        "additional_details": "I work in retail and 23rd December is the busiest trade day of the year. Yet in 2012, that day fell on a Sunday had to cram that in just 6 hours due to the Sunday trading laws.\r\n\r\nIt should not be  fully relaxed, but instead of 6 hours of trade, 8 or 9 hours maximum. On Christmas Eve Sundays, suggesting to close at 4pm and opening say 8am.\r\n\r\nIt will save a lot of stress for both the customer and the staff that work in shops and supermarkets.",
