Receiving an honour must be seen as a privilege, not a right, earned through honesty as well as demonstrating outstanding ability in a given field. Becoming dishonest, disreputable and an embarrassment to our country makes a person unworthy of retaining an honour of any kind and it should be forfeited.",
