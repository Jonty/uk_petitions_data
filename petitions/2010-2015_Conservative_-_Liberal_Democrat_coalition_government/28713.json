MK has grid roads, which give us a pedestrian casualty rate far below the UK average, cleaner air as cars travel efficiently, and prosperity as working people can get in, out and across the city quickly. MK Partnership has, ever since 2005, ensured that, where they have authority, no grid roads have been created or extended, and that existing grid roads have been downgraded. If localism means anything, then MK Partnership must be abolished. They work contrary to the wishes of MK residents, ignore local transport policies, and go directly against the Core Strategy, which was published under the previous LibDem council and has now been confirmed by the current Conservative administration. Abolish MK Partnership now.",
