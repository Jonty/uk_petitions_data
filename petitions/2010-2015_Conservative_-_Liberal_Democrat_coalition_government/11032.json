        "additional_details": "We want the government to look at the structure of the parliment and have several representatives from members of the public, such as students, people who are working for organsiations, represetatives from the public services.  People who work with the public everyday and are intouch with the members of the public.  People who can truly represent the working population and the young generation.  This position should be voluntary. Reduce the numbers of MPs by half as most Mps are out of touch with the wants, needs and wishes of the community and they do not seem to serve any beneficial purposes for the country.",
