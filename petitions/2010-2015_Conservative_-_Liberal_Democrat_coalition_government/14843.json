Which is fair, but may not be possible in the current climate.\r\n\r\nA scheme of this nature would make more money for the government in future through increased payments at a higher interest.\r\n\r\nThis system should ONLY be considered for those living away from home and ONLY those who are entitled to the lowest maximum loan.",
