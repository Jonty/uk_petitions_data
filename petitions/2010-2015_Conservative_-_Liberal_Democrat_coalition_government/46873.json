        "additional_details": "Sandown Primary school in Hastings are desperately trying to raise \u00a3200K to save our swimming pool from having to close.  The building that houses the pool is in a serious state of disrepair and we have been advised that it may only have 18 months before it has to be demolished.\r\nSandown School has approached the local Council, the Lottery, Sports Relief and many other organisations and businesses, but we have been turned down on every occasion for grants or donations despite the fact that our pool is used by 2 other primary schools, Council run groups, mum and toddlers groups and many other people in the local community.  If our pool was allowed to close it would be a disaster for the whole community.\r\nLearning to swim saves lives....please help us keep our swimming pool open.",
