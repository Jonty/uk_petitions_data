        "additional_details": "Homeowners have Permitted Development Rights allowing extensions without the bureaucracy of the Planning Legislation. These rights are not extended to owners of flats so once again in Britain the richer you are the easier it is to extend your house and grow your family. This e-petition asks for Permitted Development Rights to be extended to Flats so we can have a fairer society where people who can\u2019t afford a house still have the same rights and opportunities to extend their property and grow their families as richer house owners.
