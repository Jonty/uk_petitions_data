As MPs are employed by us, and have access to alcohol through the house of commons restaurant and bars, we feel it is necessary to adopt random testing for drug and alcohol inline with what is accepted as the norm by other employers.\r\nWe would like to be sure that when MPs are voting on important laws that they are in a suitable condition to make such decisions and that their ability to do so is  not distorted by any chemicals they may have in their bodies.",
