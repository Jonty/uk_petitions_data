        "additional_details": "Appoint Mr Stuart Carnie to chair the child abuse enquiry which you have promised the public. His experience of working with child abuse victims as well as being appointed by 2 governments to head the enquiry into the whereabouts of over 25 thousand children who have been abducted and trafficked to the UK, as well as deal with the international arrest warrants which have been issued for those involved in the abuse and trafficking of children. Due to his years of experience in this field, as well as the fact that he is in no way connected to anyone within parliament or any police force, this gives him the necessary credibility to assure the public that he is not part of the establishment, and will not favour any particular party in this enquiry.
