        "additional_details": "Education minister Michael Gove is proposing to change the GCSE system from an A*-G grade boundaries to a Grade 1 - Grade 8 system.\r\n\r\n I feel that the reforms he proposes will create more competition for jobs and entry requirements for A levels which therefore will lead to less students being motivated and the economy will shrink again because employers will judge students based on a number especially when the grade boundaries are being pushed up too.\r\n\r\nHe also proposes to get rid of Coursework from the GCSE English course interiorly, Wales and Northern Ireland both don't want to adopt the reforms too it is confirmed.\r\n\r\n The aim of this petition is to get the minister to hold a meeting with the NUT who feel they have not been fully consulted on the proposals, as well as getting it ammended in the Commons Education Select Committee after it has been announced that Chairman of the Committe, Graham Stuart feels that Mr. Gove proposals are a 'rush'.",
