If public confidence of parliament is to be maintained any review of integrity of its members must be transparent and even handed. It should not be conducted by Members of Parliament.\r\nAs Independent Police Complaints Commision have recently investigated complaints against some Police and Crime Commissioners. There is now a precedent for elected Officials to be investigated by an outside agency.\r\nShould not Members of Parliament be subject to a similar scrutiny when required.\r\n",
