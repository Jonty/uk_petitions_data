        "additional_details": "This petition does not address whether or not the TV license is appropriate or well spent but rather criticises the conduct of the TVLA as the body responsible for collecting the fee.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned seek a parliamentary debate about the manner in which the TVLA presently attempts to collect the license fee from those who have not declared their television usage.\r\n\r\nThe threatening and accusatory tone of the TVLA letters and prospect of visits by so-called 'Enforcement Officers' could be seen as harassment. They are an unnecessary source of anxiety and worry for many, including those vulnerable people who do not require a license but may feel intimidated into getting one anyway. A presumption of innocence, not guilt, must be maintained. Letters using conditional clauses as a device to allude to court appearances and search warrants should be discontinued. Clarity should be given on the government's view of the TVLA requesting money when none is due.",
