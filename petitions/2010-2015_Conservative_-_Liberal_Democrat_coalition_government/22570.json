        "additional_details": "The EDL are a far right group originating from football hooligan firms. They claim to \"oppose Islamism\" but their actions have been nothing short of hooliganism, thuggery, and violence. They were responsible for criminal damage during their \"demonstration\" on October 9th 2010, injured four police officers on January 2010, and attacked black youths in Eltham under the guise of \"discouraging troublemakers\" during the Tottenham riots. They cost the tax payer money just to police them, they are a threat to the public, and should be banned the same way as Muslims against Crusades and Islam for UK got banned. I do not feel safe with these racist thugs being allowed to \"demonstrate\" in large groups.",
