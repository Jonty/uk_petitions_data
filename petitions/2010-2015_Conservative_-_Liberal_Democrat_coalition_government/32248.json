        "additional_details": "I have recently had to research Anorexia Nervosa for University. I was appalled to discover how many websites offered not only advice on how to become anorexic, but provided a way for young girls many aged 13-14 to \"buddy\" up with like minded thinkers. These girls choose starvation as a lifestyle, and they help one another by providing support and sharing tips on how to deal with hunger pains and hiding their anorexia from their families. The girls on these websites often state their ages. The creators of these websites are adults whom can make their own decisions on whether or not to starve themselves but the fact that children can access these sites without question and are persuaded that this is acceptable is disturbing. Anorexia Nervosa is a serious illness and these websites are practically recruiting new girls. Simply Google search for \"pro ana\"\r\nPlease sign this petition so government can stop these young girls from starving themselves with a minimum age restriction.\r\nThank you",
