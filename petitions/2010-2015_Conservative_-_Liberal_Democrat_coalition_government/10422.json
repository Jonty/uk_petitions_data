In the stocks, an offender's hands and head, or sometimes their ankles would be placed and locked through two or three holes in the center of a board.  Offenders were forced to carry out their punishments in the rain, during the heat of summer, or in freezing weather, and generally would receive only bread and water, plus anything brought by their friends. Public stocks were typically positioned in the most public place available, as public humiliation was a critical aspect of such punishment.\r\n\r\nPerhaps these could be located in areas where the rioters have looted?",
