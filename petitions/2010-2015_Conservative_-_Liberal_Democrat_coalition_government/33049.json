        "additional_details": "Currently there is no legislation protecting children from bullying via electrical means such as social network sites, e-mail or text messages. Cyber-bullying is so impactive because it can happen 24/7 with no respite at home like physical bullying. The Diana Award and The Childrens Research Centre at The Open University released a report in November 2011 indicating that 38% of young people experienced cyber-bullying and 78% reported that cyber-bullying is increasing with 16% feeling that it has stayed the same and only 6% recognising any form of reduction. Cyber-bullying ruins peoples lives and can make life feel unmanageable and torturous; these feelings have started to lead to suicides.\r\n\r\nThis form of bullying is one of the reasons that a young person between 10 to 19 years of age attempts suicide in England and Wales every 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nMaking Cyber-bullying a criminal offence will raise awareness of the dangers it causes and help prevent a lot of it happening.",
