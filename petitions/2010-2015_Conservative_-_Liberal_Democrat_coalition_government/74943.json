        "additional_details": "Over the years main stream tv has seen the decline of sporting events being showed on terestral tv, and have been brought over by Sky and Virgin media along with others. These companies are chargeing premium prices for pay to view tv. with Long contracts.\r\nThis country has many hundreds of sick disabled and elderly people whom cannot afford such luxury as paid Tv and yet we are forced to pay for a Tv service that constantly sell its rights for showing live sports.\r\nSports viewing is a right for all and not just for those whom can afford the prices that are charged.\r\ni ask that some concideration be given to those of us who cannot afford such prices and would like to see sports such as Golf, Cricket, Motor Racing ,and Ruby. Stop all future sales of sporting events to Sky and Virgin. we do not wont edited highlights we would like to see full sports event not what the BBC wonts us to watch",
