        "additional_details": "9gag is a US hosted website which profiteers from its users defacing pictures of people in order to humiliate and bully them. This website facilitates internet abuse which is sick and offensive and we petition for the UK Government to actively work with the appropriate US agencies to get it closed down. One recent example featured on the BBC referred to the abuse suffered by Heidi Crowter, age 16, who has Down's syndrome. The pictures of Heidi featured in the report were created by users from 9gag for the sole purpose to mock people with disabilities. Such intentional malice directed towards the most vulnerable of society cannot be ignored. ",
