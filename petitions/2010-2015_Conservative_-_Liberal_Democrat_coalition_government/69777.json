UK Parents are drastically punished when their young children and newborn babies are removed for fostering by strangers (relatives are sometimes assessed but usually failed and ignored contrary to the Children Act 1989)\r\nParents are being punished for crimes they have not committed and children have been removed from loving homes and placed into foster homes or adopted. This needs stopping now has many parents are grieving for there babies and children and its like a death sentence to them. Without evidence of abuse no children should be removed from families.\r\nAnd the authorities who do remove children without full evidence of a crime be punished and imprisonment to serve a minimum sentence of no less than five years.",
