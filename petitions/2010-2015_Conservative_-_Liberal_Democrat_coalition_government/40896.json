If the BBC cannot maintain a standard of service to make people willingly pay, then it should be liquidated. The same as any other failed business. It is grossly unfair to make people pay for a product they do not want. In the event of the BBC's failure, all assets should be returned to the public purse and used to effect tax cuts on things that are essential. Such as fuel. ",
