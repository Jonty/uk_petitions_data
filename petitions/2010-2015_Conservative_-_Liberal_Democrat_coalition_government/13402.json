They need a sense of belonging\r\nself respect and discipline.  If they want to fight, let them fight as trained soldiers.  At the moment they are being handed money for nothing and costing the country a fortune in benefits and giving nothing in return and as we have seen, running riot in the\r\nstreets. How long before they come out with guns\r\nand knives??\r\n\r\n",
