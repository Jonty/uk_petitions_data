        "additional_details": "Children and teenagers are currently being left stranded if they do not have an Oyster card or a valid ticket. On trains and the underground, children can be left stranded and slapped with a fine. This petition was created after being a victim of this atrocity and seeing it happen to other people; one boy as young as 11. Leaving children and teenagers stranded is completely unacceptable and one of the ways to tackle this is to provide \"free\" public transport to children aged 13 and below. ",
