        "additional_details": "It is ludicrous that a Teenager of 16+ years is classed as being in full-time education when only attending College for 12 hours min.  It should be no less than 30 hours as all school children.  If a Teenager is attending 2 - 3 days a week they can be earning the rest of the time and subject to NI and Tax, therefore no child benefit or maintenance payments should be applied to these young adults as they are capable of earning s much as an Adult working part-time or even full-time on miminmum wage.  By stopping Child benefit at 16 years how many hundred thousands of pounds would this save the Government each year",
