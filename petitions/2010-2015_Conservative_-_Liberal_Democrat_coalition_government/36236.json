Every time the duty is increased, prices increase and living costs increase.\r\n\r\nThis tax has increased massively since the introduction of the fuel tax escalator in 1993 and is seen as an easy way to get revenue by the treasury.\r\n\r\nFuel duty should be removed. We already pay tax on the price of fuel, why should we have to pay another tax simply for the 'privilege' of travelling to work, hospital, food shopping, etc. - where the government takes more tax from us?",
