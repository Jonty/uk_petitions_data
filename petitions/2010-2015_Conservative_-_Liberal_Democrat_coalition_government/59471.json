        "additional_details": "The state of Britain's teeth has been ridiculed for decades by other nationalities. Why? Because people cannot afford to go to the dentist anymore. We laugh at the idea of paying for healthcare, like in the US,  but why aren't we more outraged by the extortionate fees that dentists charge?\r\n\r\nObviously educating the young on the importance of brushing twice daily, flossing and mouth wash should be done and in an ideal world the future generations will have no need for extreme treatments. But in the mean time there are thousands of people who are not entitled to free care who don't dare smile for fear of scorn and judgment.\r\n\r\nIf NHS contributions were raised by a small amount a month wouldn't it be possible to have free dental care for all?\r\n\r\nIt's time we got our smiles back.
