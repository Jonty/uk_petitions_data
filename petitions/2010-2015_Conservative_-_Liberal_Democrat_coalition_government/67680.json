        "additional_details": "The current system of franchising and privitising the British Rail Network by John Major in 1993 has failed.\r\n\r\nFares have doubled and the infastructure is on the verge of crumbling; it is estimated by the Transport for Quality of Life think tank that there is a current wastage of \u00a31billion per year in the rail system. This money should instead be going to investing in our infastructure (avoiding the need for a massive new HS2 project) and driving costs down for people all over the country (helping people who are struggling with their stretched finances).\r\n\r\nNone of the major political parties (with the exception of the greens) have pledged to seriously tackle the issue.\r\n\r\nWe call for a national vote on whether or not to fully nationalise rail, making it a 100% state owned and operated country. This should be done at the next adequate opportunity (for instance, the May 2015 Paliamentary elections).",
