        "additional_details": "It is perfectly acceptable that people need to know about products such as sanitary towels, tampons, panty liners, Erectile Disfunction treatments and thrush cream. However, personally and I don't feel I'm alone in saying this, I do not want to see these whilst I am eating my dinner.\r\n\r\nNot only do I feel these adverts should at minimum not be shown during standard meal times. I also believe they shouldn't be shown during advertisement breaks within family films.\r\n\r\nWhat the aim of this petition is:\r\n\r\nTo stop the airing of advertisements for menstrual products (tampons, sanitary towels etc), erectile Disfunction treatments and things such as thrush cream, during common meal times and the airing of family films.",
