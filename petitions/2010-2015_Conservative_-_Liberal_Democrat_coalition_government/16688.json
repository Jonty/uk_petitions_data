This would bring it in line with the time frame of credit reference agencies.\r\n\r\nPublication of personal financial information is of detriment to the individual and causeS unwarranted distress.\r\n\r\nThe long term (103 years) public advertising of a persons financial history is excessive.\r\n\r\n",
