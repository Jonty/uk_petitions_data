Theft is a matter which is covered by the laws of our land and it is in the remit of our police forces that they, and only they, who can properly investigate matters of theft.  MPs and Ministers who steal taxpayer pounds through abuse of the MPs Expenses Scam MUST therefore be investigated by the police.  It is NOT acceptable for expenses theft to be investigated by other MPs who have themselves manipulated the expenses scheme for personal enrichment purposes and manipulate the rules as they see fit and who are themselves members of the biggest group of dishonest people outside the EU Commission but ahead of the House of Lords for levels of dishonesty.",
