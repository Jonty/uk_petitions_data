        "additional_details": "Norway is know for its unorthodox approach with regards to detaining prisoners. Norway, and other countries, have experimented with prisons which encourage inmates to take on responsibilities, to educate themselves and above all, to rehabilitate in order to reduce the chances of reoffending. The result of these new types of prisons is reduced crime and reduced reoffending.\r\n\r\nBritain still uses the approach of harsh punishments. The effect of continuing to use dated methods is that crime is not reduced and offenders are not rehabilitated so go on to commit more crimes when released and continue to cycle.\r\n\r\nSociety will never benefit from tougher approaches as they only perpetuate crime and offenders will keep on breaking the law.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to re-evaluate how it deals with crime and prisoners and start looking at new, effective, positive ways of dealing with criminals and reducing crime.
