Each displays a very small \"gamblingaware.co.uk\" print on screen.\r\n\r\nThe Website branding and name on each advert is displayed 4xlarger than the cryptic \"Gamblingaware\" warning.\r\n\r\nThese adverts should be required by law to prominently display the following clear and concise message larger and for longer than the company brand:\r\n\r\n\"THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME OF BETS IS THAT YOU WILL LOSE SOME OR ALL OF YOUR MONEY\".\r\n\r\nThis does not prevent these companies advertising or operating, but would prevent \"punters\" being misled.",
