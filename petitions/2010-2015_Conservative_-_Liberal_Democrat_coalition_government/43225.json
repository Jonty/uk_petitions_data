        "additional_details": "Delay the new 2013 Motorbike Laws. Currently the law changes on the 19th January, this is still in British Winter time. The roads and test centres are more often than not too icy for a test to be taken. In december the number of tests (in particular MOD1) being cancelled is rising. Ice and winter weather is a very dangerous hazard on the road, particularly for motorcyclists. Therefore the 19th January 2013 new motorcycle licensing  Law should be delayed, until safer road conditions are available for tests to be taken safely.",
