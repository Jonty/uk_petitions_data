        "additional_details": " I am calling for a reassessment into how epilepsy sufferers are awarded benefits and also that medical interviews should allow CARERS to have some verbal input as, whilst the epilepsy sufferer is having a seizure, they have no recollection/memory of what is occuring. Epilepsy sufferers also have 'absences', where they have periods of time when they have no memory AT ALL and no questions are asked concerning this matter. 'Absences' can occur at any time and for any length of time and are dangerous for the sufferer, therefore input from a carer is necessary and should be considered before a decision is made from the assessment board. At the moment input from anyone but the interviewee is not allowed and the 'questionnaire' does not cover the relevant problems epilepsy sufferers endure.",
