After having read about their plight and the unfair treatment by North East Lincolnshire Council who are also their landlords, I believe that if true, the Council is acting in a biased, underhand and undemocratic manner showing a complete abuse of its power and a total abdication of the Council's responsibilities with regards to upholding the democratic rights of its constituents.",
