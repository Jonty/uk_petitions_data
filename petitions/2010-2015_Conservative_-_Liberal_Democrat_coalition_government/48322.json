        "additional_details": "The UK Programme Action Committee of Soroptimist International of Great Britain and Ireland Limited (SIGBI UKPAC) will shortly be launching a campaign in partnership with Prison Reform Trust, to reduce the unnecessary imprisonment of women in the UK to make better use of community solutions that are more effective in reducing women\u2019s offending.\r\n\r\nApprox. 13,500 women are sent to prison each year across the UK, the over-use of custodial sentencing of women has both high social cost and impacts not only on vulnerable women, their children and families, but also on the wider society.\r\n\r\nOur campaign will run throughout 2013 to gather much needed information and add a strong voice from communities across the UK to press for, and achieve, long awaited changes. I am sure you will agree with me that this initiative is extremely worthwhile and worthy of your support www.prisonrreformtrust.org.uk .\r\n\r\nWe urge Government to reinstate the provision back into \u2018The Crime and Courts Bill\u2019.\r\n\r\n",
