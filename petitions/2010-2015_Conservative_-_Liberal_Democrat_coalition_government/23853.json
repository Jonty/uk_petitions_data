        "additional_details": "This E-Petition is simple. Tax bankers bonuses at a higher rate to increase revenue for the country.\r\nRecent studies have shown even a SLIGHT increase could pump an extra \u00a32 billion into the economy. At a time of cut after cut after cut this extra revenue could be used in a number of ways. This could be used to create jobs, secure the NHS, invest in education and countless other worthwhile interests, as opposed to the fat cat bankers living it up on the majority of the country's misery.",
