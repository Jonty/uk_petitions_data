This, in conjunction with an effective closing of all tax loopholes and safe havens would raise funds for the public good from those that can most afford it.\r\n\r\nThis policy will in part attempt to lessen the massive rift between the very very wealthy and the rest of society; with funds raised potentially being targeted at giving the very poorest in our society better education and job opportunities.",
