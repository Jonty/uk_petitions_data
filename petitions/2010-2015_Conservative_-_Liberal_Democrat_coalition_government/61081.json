Hundreds of thousands of jobs in the of Business, Tourism, Culture and Sport sectors rely on this strong identity.\r\n\r\nWe therefore ask DCLG to ensure that the name of the combined authority reflects this and is called either the \"Greater Liverpool\" or \"Liverpool City Region\" Combined Authority ",
