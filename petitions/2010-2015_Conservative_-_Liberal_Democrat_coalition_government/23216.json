        "additional_details": "This petition requests that MP\u2019s review the government\u2019s illogical decision to scrap child benefit in 2013 for any family where one income exceeds \u00a344000 and that it is replaced with a much fairer system based on total household income.\r\nPlans are to abolish child benefit, where ONE PARENT earns over \u00a344000 per year. BUT families with two parents on incomes earnings up to \u00a344,000 - which might add together up to \u00a387,999 - would keep the benefit!  What about those families where only one parent is able to work. How can this be right and fair? Why should families be penalised when ONE of the parents earns over \u00a344000, yet a family with both parents working and with a joint income of under \u00a388000 keep their benefits! This will affect at approx 1.5m families! Families with 3 children will lose up to \u00a32500 year. Please sign and bring pressure on your MP so that this unfair regulation can be reviewed and is fair to all families living in the UK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
