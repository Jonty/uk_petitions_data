        "additional_details": "The UK people receive appalling service at appalling cost from Royal Mail, yet they have no other choice of postal service. We demand Government and Ofcom deliver proper choice by lowering barriers to entry for competitors, as was done to break BT\u2019s monopoly.\r\n\r\nUK residents get a service where post is frequently lost or delivered at all hours. 'You were out' cards are posted with no attempt at delivery. Fragile items are routinely broken. No signature is sought for signed-for items. Bulky items are thrown over gates or stuffed behind bins in all weathers.\r\n\r\nDespite Royal Mail making \u00a31m A DAY profit, and announcing a further 53% increase in the price of stamps in April 2012, OfCom does nothing to improve services for ordinary postal service users. It allows competitors to cherry-pick profitable services while ordinary citizens pay the price. We, the UK people, demand a better service from Royal Mail, and a realistic alternative choice of non-business postal service provider.",
