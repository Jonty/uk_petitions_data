        "additional_details": "Who independently verifies evidence 'found at a crime scene', was genuinely there? With pressure on the police to apprehend those committing crimes, and many examples of wrongful incarcerations over the years from police corruption, it's amazing after all these years that NO INDEPENDENT PERSON ATTENDS CRIME SCENES TO VERIFY EVIDENCE WAS FOUND AT THE SCENE. With DNA stored by the police, this is open to abuse. This door needs to be firmly shut. A chain of custody should be included to ensure evidence found at the scene IS THAT WHICH IS TESTED AND SUBMITTED AS EVIDENCE. Lets stop this potential abuse and jail the REAL CRIMINALS AT LEAST! How many are jailed now where this will have occurred?!?!  ",
