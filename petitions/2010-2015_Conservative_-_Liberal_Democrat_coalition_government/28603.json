        "additional_details": "The North Wales Hospital is the best example of a Victorian asylum still in existence in the UK. Now it faces the threat of demolition, despite it being a Grade II listed building.\r\nWe believe that the work is not being carried out in a satisfactory or even legal way. A demolition team is carrying out the work which we consider to be unnacceptable considering the correct licences have not been sought. Bat roosts have been potentially been disturbed and the listed status of the building has not been upheld. We would like the goverment to readdress the ongoing work onsite, to have an independent official inspect and the use of a demolition company to be replaced by a restoration company. We would also like the buildings such as the chapel, and others pre dating 1900 to be off the demo plans.\r\nThe former North Wales Hospital needs urgent action to protect its future. ",
