It states quote \u201cno one will pay any more tax as a result of these changes\u201d  Well this is totally wrong. I along with every other tax paying pensioner are paying more tax.  Also I believe that upon reading this statement a lot of pensioners did not bother to sign due to the statement stating no one would pay any more tax.\r\n             I only have a small pension  which I accrued in 17 years. My tax codes for the last 3 year are 383P, 327P and 2014/15 is now 277P.  That means even more tax to pay, last year I paid \u00a396.80 extra tax..\r\n\r\n",
