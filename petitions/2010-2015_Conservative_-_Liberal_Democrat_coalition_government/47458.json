        "additional_details": "Currently grey imports are undermining both our economy and our potential to grow our economy in future. Although grey imports allow for low cost goods to be sold in the UK and providing cost savings it is actually damaging UK companies especially SME's who cannot hope to compete against them as they cannot establish companies outside the UK and import the products themselves. This practice is carried out mainly by large companies such eBuyer.com, Amazon and many others. In the majority of cases the UK government is also robbed of appropriate VAT and Corporation Tax which should be generated from the sale of goods and services in the UK. Please put a stop to this significant problem and support UK businesses who try to operate within the law and provide UK businesses and citizens with products and services.",
