        "additional_details": "So, according to the British Press , the alleged killer who beheaded the journalist [Foley] is a British Rapper named Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary. He comes from the Maide Vale district in London. He was indoctrinated by an Islamic preacher named Anjem Choudary.........................there is that name again, remember the guys who run over Lee Rigby in their car and attempted to behead him on the streets of London [Adebowale and Adebolajo], they were followers of Choudary too, I would say in my humble opinion that this makes Choudary an extremist Hate preacher, and so he should now be arrested and punished.\r\n",
