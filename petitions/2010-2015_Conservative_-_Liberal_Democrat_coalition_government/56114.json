        "additional_details": "People need to realize that we can't spend more than we have. You say that you are massively cutting our spending, but we are still spending over \u00a3160 billion more than we collect in tax each year. This is not sustainable.\r\n\r\nThe public must understand that we cannot expect a lifestyle of that we did not earn.\r\n\r\nI urge you to stop starting wars which are not necessary, reduce all benefits to the people who really need it. Reduce the number of public workers, in the height of British rule we only had 4000 public workers and now we have around 500,000. Stop bailing the banks, if they get in trouble they should have to deal with it them selves like any other business.",
