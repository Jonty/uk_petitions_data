So why do British Citizens have to pay to experience their own culture and heritage!\r\nSo many people complain about how we are losing our culture but when you ask them a question about British history or heritage they cannot answer! Keeping British culture is about learning about it, and what better way to do that than to visit the historical places of interest that tell the story of how we got where we are today!\r\n\r\nI want the government to allow British Citizens in for free or give us concessions!\r\n",
