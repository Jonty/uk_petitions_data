        "additional_details": "After reading and article in the Evening Standard, \"London bids farewell to tye historic Routemaster\" I was highly disappointed about the plans to scrap the old Routemaster buses from heritage routes 9 and maybe 15 in future sadly.\r\n  Of all London buses in history the Routemaster has been the mainstay, owing to its famous reliability, being built from aluminium, therefore not corroding at anything like the rate of a modern bus. The Routemaster is also known for its fuel effieciency of 17/18 mpg whikst the New Routemaster produces and average 6,74 mpg, therefore the old Routemasters are more economical.\r\n  So owing to the long use of these old Routemasters, both visitors and locals have gorwn up with these buses because people take these buses to their hearts like no other other buses, that's why the Routemaster is correctly seen as a symbol of London. I and \"London\" love the original Routemaster and we can't lose it.",
