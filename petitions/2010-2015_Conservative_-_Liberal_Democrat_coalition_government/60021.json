        "additional_details": "It has been quite a wide spread converstion between anglers over the past few years about Bass stocks in the UK, this PETETION is to try and introduce a bag limit and over selling rules for Bass caught in UK waters there has been a lot of talk about how we can help Bass stocks survive in the UK so instead of talking about it lets take action and get signing this petetion and hopefully get something done.\r\nif NOTHING is done in 10 Yeas time the most loved UK Fish the Bass will be GONE\r\nIf we can introduce the same rules and regulations as Ireland have then in 5-10 years time stocks will be much better, and all anglers shore and boat will benefit from it.\r\n\r\nWe are looking for the Government to introduce a Bag limit on Bass to a number of 3 bass for every 24 hours and to stop people over selling of Bass in the UK. And to ban bass fishing between the period of the 15th of may to 15th June for breeding.\r\n",
