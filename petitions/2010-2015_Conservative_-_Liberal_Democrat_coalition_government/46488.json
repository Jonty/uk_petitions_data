This will kill First Nation peoples, who still rely on the land for food. Also, this is the second largest forest in the world: evaluating the scale of tar sands devastation a director at NASA, James Hansen, has said that tar sands will mean \u201cgame over for the climate.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere is extensive evidence which needs to be considered, which should determine Britain\u2019s future policies towards tar sands and potential resistance options. These include: international lobbying; upholding treaty obligations to First Nation peoples; banning the product and banning investment by British companies and banks.",
