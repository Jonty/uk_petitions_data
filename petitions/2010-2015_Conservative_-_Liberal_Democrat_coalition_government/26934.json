        "additional_details": "On the 1st of Jan 2012 battery hens became illegal across Europe however 13 EU countries with 40 million hens do not meet the new law. UK farmers have been forced rightly to comply with the new law but it has cost them \u00a3millions. We believe that eggs and egg products produced in the EU from birds that are keep in batteries illegally should not be imported into the UK. Support the UK egg producer and the welfare of the bird",
