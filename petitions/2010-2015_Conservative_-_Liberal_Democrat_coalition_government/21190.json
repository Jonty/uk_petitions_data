        "additional_details": "It is a complete disgrace that the BBC are allowed to squander millions on elitist sports such as Tennis (Wimbledon), Rugby Union (Six Nations) and the Boat Race. These are sports and events that the vast majority of the country couldnt care less about and it is a complete waste of the license fee at a time when the BBC are meant to be providing the public with better value for money. It simply shouldnt be tolerated or allowed.\r\n\r\nNewspaper reports say that the BBC have agreed a new \u00a3120 million 3 year deal for Wimbledon. This works out as \u00a340 million a year for 2 weeks Tennis. In addition it is believed that they are going to spend \u00a3160 million on a new 4 year Rugby Union Six Nations contract, all for 15 games a year. The BBC also took the rights back from ITV for the Boat Race a couple of years ago. This amount of money should not be wasted on these elitist sports, particulalry when the BBC barely show popular sports like Football, Rugby League and F1.",
