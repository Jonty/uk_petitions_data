        "additional_details": "Recently we the public have noticed an increase in Freemasonic, Satanic & Occult symbolism in British television. From the All Seeing Eye to the reference to the pentagram and the number 666. From energy drinks to hand signs, logos and film titles such as Prometheus (Satan), Hannibal (Satan), and the eye of Lucifer within the big brother house (Astarte Queen of heaven is symbolised by the star in a circle which represents Venus also known as Lucifer in the Oxford dictionary), as well as others.\r\n\r\nThis symbolism is obvious when you understand the true meanings of the symbols and you don't want them being broadcast into your home fullstop. It has become some what of an irritation considering it is continuous and unwanted.",
