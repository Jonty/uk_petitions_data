        "additional_details": "I'd like to see the tax credit for families who do not work stopped . Surely tax credits should be a supplement for people who are on a low wage, irrespective as to whether they have children or not.  By paying so much per child amounts to paying people to stay at home and reproduce. Tax credits should be paid to people who are in paid employment only.",
