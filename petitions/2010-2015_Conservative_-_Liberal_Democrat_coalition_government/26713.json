        "additional_details": "I would like to suggest a debate on the possibility of setting up a limit on the length of the queues that are allowed to develope at anytime at the Dartford Crossing and once this limit is reached the toll gates have to remain open (free) to ease this congestion until such time that the traffic has eased considerably.  I do not beleive that the tools will ever be removed but by ensuring a limit on the lenght of the queues this will ensure that everything possible is always done to ensure maximum flow of traffic as opening the tolls for free to reduce the congestion will result in lost revenue.",
