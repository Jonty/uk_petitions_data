        "additional_details": "The Governement is due to start a trial of securing a bond of \u00a33000 for EVERY visitor from India to the UK on a 6 month visitor visa. This will severely restrict the travel of friends and family who will want to visit Indian Citizens settled/working/ living in the UK. 1/3 of NHS workforce is Indian. Majority of IT professionals are Indian. UK varsities gain several millions (if not billions) from Indian Students coming to the Uk to study. We contribute to the economy and pay tax which subsidises those native Brits who cant be bothered to go to work, sit at home and claim benefits. This is an insult to the Indian Sentiment. We urge the Government to STOP THIS NONSENSE NOW. ",
