        "additional_details": "Much of the work of Westminster MPs has been devolved to the Scottish and Welsh Assemblies.  We are also told that some 80% of legislation originates in the EU.  In these circumstances, Westminster MPs have clearly lost a lot of their responsibility and, therefore, it would seem that less MPs are needed.  Unless a referendum on EU membership results in our leaving EU, it is clear that we will need far less MPs at Westminster because of reduced work load.  The Government should be  prepared for such a reduction.",
