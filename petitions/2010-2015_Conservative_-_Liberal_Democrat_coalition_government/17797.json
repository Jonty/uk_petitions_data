        "additional_details": "I would like to see MP expenses and free use of tax payer funded credit cards scraped.  It is clear it costs taxpayers so much wasted money to cover costs of expenses claims and in policing any false claims.  The credit cards are also taken advantage of by MPs buying items that they should not be buying.\r\nMP's should buy their own items, food, taxi trips etc just like the Private sector do.  So I put forward that MPs should have a small wage increase to cover day to day REAL costs that they REQUIRE and all expenses are withdrawn.  This will stop cheating of taxpayers money, and save in multiple administration costs.",
