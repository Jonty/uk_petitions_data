        "additional_details": "The BBC must be made to retain the Formula One coverage in 2012 and beyond, to save the people of the UK millions of pounds.\r\n\r\nIt costs the BBC (UK tax payer) \u00a335 million to buy the rights and produce the program.  10 million people watch this program and are obviously very happy for their licence fee to be used in this manner.\r\n\r\nOnly 55,000 people can purchase SKY for the same amount of money and therefore this move will cost the people of the UK far more than the \u00a335 million it currently costs.\r\n\r\nThe most cost effective action for the people of the UK (not the BBC) is for the BBC to buy the rights for the collective benefit of the people - for just \u00a33 each.  It is the job of government to ensure this happens.\r\n\r\nTimes are hard and several million people who do not already own SKY are notable unhappy.  We will now be paying \u00a31.50 each for half a season of F1 and will have to pay \u00a3600 if we'd like the other half.",
