These people are very well paid in their jobs and any further incentive in the form of bonus is totally uncalled for and superfluous. They must work for the salary they get and not for getting  bonuses.\r\nThis bonus culture is socially divisive, cancerous and harmful to the country. The government must take steps to ban this practice and create a level playing field. ",
