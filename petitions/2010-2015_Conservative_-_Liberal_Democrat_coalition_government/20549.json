        "additional_details": "This petition is aimed at those who feel the ticket touting \"business\" is getting way out of hand in regards to the amount touts are raising the price of face value tickets.\r\n\r\nIt simply cannot be deemed fair to buy a ticket for 40 pounds and then sell that ticket on for 150 or even 200 pounds and above. These touts have no interest in the event and they are simply profiteering from desperate poor fans.\r\n\r\nIntroduce a cap that means touts can only raise ticket prices by a set, affordable amount.",
