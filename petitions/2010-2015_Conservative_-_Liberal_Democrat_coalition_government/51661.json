        "additional_details": "I have a visual impairment, Keratoconus. Keratoconus is a progressively degenerative lifelong condition of the cornea. Resulting in poorer vision as you grow older. There is no cure, reversal, and no known causes.\r\n\r\nVisual disability rules are still based on old Victorian times and make no provisions for other variable visual impairments, which are a disability and restrict the type of work you can do.\r\n\r\nFor a Keratoconic patient, contact lenses are just a temporary aid, likened to wheel chair for people without the use of their legs. Contact lenses can't be for long periods. They have to be removed to let the eye rest, and to oxygenate the cornea. Without them, we are partially sighted.\r\n\r\nWe would like the government to look at the current visual impairment rules/guidelines, and make changes to cover conditions causing variable visual impairment. Keratoconus and like other variable visual impairing conditions is a disability. They restrict you lifestyle and your employment.",
