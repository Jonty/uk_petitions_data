        "additional_details": "Your reasons for rejecting my previous requests for this e-petition are incorrect, since you state \"Dow Chemical is a Worldwide IOC Olympic Partner and therefore one of 11 \u2018TOP\u2019 partners for the London 2012 Games. The IOC has sole responsibility for negotiations concerning worldwide Olympic sponsors. Therefore, this is not a matter for the Government, or the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games\". I have a letter from Lord Coe dated 12 January 2012 in which he makes it quite clear that the sponsorship bid was initiated by LOCOG, with the full knowledge of the government and was independently verified by the Commission for Sustainable London 2012.\r\n\r\nIn view of  your invalid reason for your original rejection, please take this message as a formal request to re-instate my application for an e-petition on this subject.",
