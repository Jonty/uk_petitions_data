Since 27th, September, on midnight, more than a hundred thousands of HK citizens have been gathering in Central, around the HKSAR government office, to protest for a greater democracy and against the dictatorial rule by Beijing. On 28th, September, at around 6 pm, the police started shooting tear gas grenades to the gathering crowds, which mainly consist armless and innocent civilians. Rumors saying that the Communist PLA, under order from Beijing, is standing by to slaughter HK people anytime. Hong Kong, which used to be Her Majesty's territory, is now under a great threat. I, as a British citizen and a local Hong Konger, sincerely beg HM Government to give stress to Beijing and promise to protect HK citizens in the military way.",
