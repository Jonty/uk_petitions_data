        "additional_details": "The government announced that they will be providing 150 million into primary school PE and sport funding between 2013 and 2015, with freedom on where it is spent. Although fantastic for primary schools, the sole emphasis seems to be on the practical aspect, not the educational aspect. Could a certain amount of the funding not be allocated on education? I quote from Mr Cameron when the announcement was made, \"We can create a culture in our schools that encourages all children to be active and enjoy sport.\" There's nothing against getting children active and enjoying sport but do they know why? I recent publication from the department of health stated that 30% of children aged 2 and 15 are overweight or obese in England. I want the government to take responsibility and focus on educating children in schools as part of a PE session or alongside it so children from a young age can understand how health issues occur and how physical activity and sport participation impact on health.",
