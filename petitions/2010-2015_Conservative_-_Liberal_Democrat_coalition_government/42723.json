        "additional_details": "We are Gryphon School Students who are studying Citizenship for GCSE and this is part of our coursework.\r\n\r\nBoth Nathan and I, James, think that the death penalty should be bought back to The United Kingdom because it serves as justice towards victims. However we would only like to support this where it\u2019s suitable for example if it would cause more suffering, lifetime imprisonment may be a better punishment than the death penalty but we think there should be an option of the death penalty.\r\n\r\nWe think about the death penalty this way because we both want real justice in this country, the USA still has the death penalty and that\u2019s just part of their culture, they\u2019re used to it. We should bring it back to our culture, it used to be part of it, and now we want it back.\r\n",
