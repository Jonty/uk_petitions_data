        "additional_details": "It's about time that the Tyne Tunnel was free! If you live in east Tyneside you are penalised but in the west you get free access to bridges.\r\n\r\nThe approximate cost to commute through the tunnel this year will be over \u00a3700.  This toll cause hardship to those who have no choice but to use the tunnel each day. This particularly hits commuters who effectively have a reduced income.\r\n\r\nMany other large-scale transport and infrastructure projects are paid for in full by the taxpayer. For instance the 1.2-mile Limehouse Link at a cost of \u00a3450M. Or the recently built Hindhead Tunnel on the London-Portsmouth A3 road at a cost of \u00a3371M.\r\n\r\nAt \u00a3139M the Tyne Tunnel cost is significantly less than that of the two aforementioned tunnels yet the tunnel was constructed under a Private Finance Initiative.\r\n\r\nAt the very least this vital Tyne & Wear transport link should be subsidised by the government and I would like to hear their opinions on the subject.",
