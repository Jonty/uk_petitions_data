The badly behaved are normally the Alcohol & substance abusers. These people should be treated at separate units. When people are sick & below par, is it too much to ask to wait in relative peace.  Separate Clinics to treat substance abusers should be made available so that people with accidental afflictions can be treated without being surrounded by unpredictable people.\r\n\r\n",
