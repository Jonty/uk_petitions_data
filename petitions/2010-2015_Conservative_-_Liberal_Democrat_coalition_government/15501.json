        "additional_details": "At present, students are taught the classical Rutherford model of the atom as part of KS4 and to some extent at KS5 science. This theory is now outdated, known to be inaccurate and its use is limited.  I propose that aspects of the Bohr model of the atom are introduced at KS4 science to enable students to learn information that is more accurate and relevant to understand how modern science and technology has developed.",
