        "additional_details": "I believe videos of animals suffering abuse should be removed off the internet in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nSeriously, who wants to go on to a news website looking at stories to find VIDEOS of people brutally attacking animals? (daily mail is the provocative in this case)\r\n\r\nI want to have all animal abuse videos removed, its an extremely upsetting and rather traumatising, haunting and disgusting thing to see let alone come across randomly.\r\n\r\nDon't watch the video you say? Well I say remove it off the internet in the United Kingdom all together and don't give the people who film the attacks for publicity the opportunity to get what they want.",
