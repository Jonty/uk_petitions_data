        "additional_details": "This government has had its chance and proven that the leadership are so detached from the reality of normal life in the UK that they are now doing more harm than good. This has been made apparent by cuts across all sectors causing widespread unemployment, no economic growth and rioting. There is no way back for David Cameron or George Osborne without making a massive u-turn on policy which is very unlikely.\r\nThe vote called for by this e-petition must be a free vote for the entire house",
