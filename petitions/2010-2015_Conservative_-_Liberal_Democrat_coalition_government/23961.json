        "additional_details": "We are the group Money Madness, an AS Citizenship class at Priestley College. We are campaigning for reform in the public sector spending and cracking down on benefit thieves. It is no secret that the UK governments spending can be wasteful and inefficient and we want a crackdown on benefit thieves and illegal immigration. We want a points system introduced similar to the Australian immigration procedure where only people who would contribute to society will be aloud to settle in the UK. We would also like to see reform to the benefits system and a crackdown on benefit thieves, there are many people in the UK who claim benefits when they don\u2019t need them or because it\u2019s easier than getting a job, we want the government to do more to stop this from happening.
