        "additional_details": "Football fans all over the UK have been asking for safe standing. During this time many people have lost there outlet of going to football due to increased pricing safe standing will reduce over inflated ticket prices as well as giving a better atmosphere at grounds. IN the end people should be able to choose if they wish to sit or stand. In the current model in all grounds there is persistent standing which causes problems for stewards and for people who do want to sit. Its time to look at new ways to suit all fans. Maybe looking at the german model of safe standing.",
