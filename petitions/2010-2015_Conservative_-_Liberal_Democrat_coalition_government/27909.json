This is a question I ask myself everytime I read the news.\r\n\r\nSomeone who has worked all their life, saved and own their home, needs social care and are told this is available at the cost of \u00a3600 per week.\r\nSomeone who has never worked, been in and out of prison all their life is afforded the same level of care at no cost to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe government relies on the conciensious, law abiding citizens to control this but the scenario\r\nmakes me wonder...\r\n\r\nWhat kind of society are we promoting here?\r\n\r\nIs it better to do \"wrong than right\"?\r\n\r\nWe need to get tougher on crime by detering people from doing it in the first place.\r\n\r\nI believe criminals should actually \"PAY\" for their crime, this would be in the form of labour and offer rehabilitation! They can learn trades while renovating our empty derelict houses and tending to public areas.\r\nThis is simply paying back to society, promotes respect and offers a further deterrent.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
