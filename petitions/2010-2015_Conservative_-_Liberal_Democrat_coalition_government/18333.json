        "additional_details": "Some call centers are not providing warm or even cool temperatures when necessary for their employees. The reason for this is that 'apparently' call centers are considered to be governed by the same rules that apply to factories and such places. So there is no set temperatures, just 'guidelines' which are being neglected. I want the UK government to introduce exact working temperatures for workplaces, to make everyone's lives better.",
