        "additional_details": "Before I start, may I say that I am a cyclist too. As a cyclist and a car driver nothing irritates more than a cyclist that blatantly disregards the rules of the road. I know it's regularly a hot topic that is fiercely debated but it's about time something is done. It's usually debated by quite militant people on both sides of the fence, but now's the time for some rational thinking. Red light jumpers, pavement cycling and everything in between should be reported, and the offenders prosecuted. Please show your support, cyclists and drivers alike, and sign this petition.",
