        "additional_details": "Diane Abbott is a member of parliament who is mean't represent the public. Therefore she is paid a salary, at our expense, to represent her constituents and the public as a whole. She is also a shadow minister which means she is held in some esteem by her own party.\r\n\r\nShe is also no stranger to controversy!!\r\n\r\nToday it has been revealed that Diane Abbott has posted the following comment on twitter \"White people love playing divide and rule We should not play their game #tacticsasoldascolonialism\"\r\n\r\nShe has also in the past been quoted as saying that \"Black women make better parents than white women\"\r\n\r\nI for one am absolutely disgusted that this woman, is getting paid a salary at our expense and yet she harbours such racially inflamatory views. It is vile people like her that are the cause of cultural differences in this country. I would also like to know who this \"We\" is she refers to.\r\n\r\nI believe she should be sacked with immediate effect.",
