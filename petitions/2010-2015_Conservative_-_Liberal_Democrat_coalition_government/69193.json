        "additional_details": "Marwan Barghouthi is one of the most popular Palestinian leaders and is known as the \u201cPalestinian Nelson Mandela\u201d.  He has spent a total of nearly two decades of his life in Israeli prisons, including the last 12 years.  Marwan Barghouthi is a symbol of the Palestinian people\u2019s decades-long struggle for freedom, a unifying figure and an advocate of justice for Palestinians based on international law.  As efforts from the UK Government played an important part in the eventual release of Nelson Mandela and of all the anti-apartheid prisoners in South Africa, the UK Government should now urge the Israeli Government to release Marwan Barghouthi and all Palestinian political prisoners. His release has been called for by Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who opposed South African Apartheid and Jimmy Carter, former US President and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, among many others.",
