        "additional_details": "The recent disturbances in English cities, and the subsequent legal proceedings, have highlighted just how irresponsible and unco-operative the parents of some young people can be.\r\nMany of those who were involved in the riots will be back in school in a few weeks. Doubtless some of them will continue a pattern of disruptive behaviour, thus preventing the learning of the majority of children who wish to succeed and who want their teachers to be in charge. That disruptive behaviour is totally unacceptable.\r\nI call upon the Government to provide a new vision for education involving curriculum, governance and the need for firm, compassionate and consistent discipline, including the requirement that parents are legally responsible for their children, and the requirement that they support schools in demanding acceptable standards of work and behaviour from their children.\r\n",
