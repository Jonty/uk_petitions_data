        "additional_details": "Hard-hit rail commuters face average fare hikes of 8% in the new year, which in my opinion is unacceptable. The government are trying to promote rail travel in a bid to lower the country's carbon foot print, however many commuters are being priced out of rail travel all together. As a result of this, many commuters are resorting to a less-eco mode of transport, the majority using cars, which in the long term is more expensive than rail travel.\r\n\r\nThe Rail Minister says this eye-watering rise is required to help Ministers pay for the Crossrail and Thameslink construction , two major projects now under way in London.\r\n\r\nBut it is difficult to see how fares will be more \u201cequitable\u201d \u2013 or fairer \u2013 when London\u2019s interests continue to come first in this way. The rest of the country isn't going to benefit and London always seems to be the priority.\r\nBring back cheaper rail travel!",
