        "action": "Scrap car road tax and put it directly on fuel",
        "additional_details": "The tax disc to show motorists have paid Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) is about to be replaced by an electronic system, allowing motorists the additional option to pay by monthly instalments (for a 5% administration fee) and scrapping the need for the traditional paper tax disc.\r\n\r\nI believe the government should scrap VED altogether, along with the databases, government departments and administrators that exist to operate and enforce this tax, and simply replace it by adding an extra penny or two on fuel tax.\r\n\r\nThat way nobody can avoid it, all drivers (including vehicles from the continent) would pay directly in proportion to their use of the UK road network and vast amounts of police and government time and money would be saved in not having to operate, maintain, and enforce this outdated and unfair taxation system.\r\n\r\nPlease add your signature to this petition if you agree and maybe one day a fairer system of taxation for all vehicles will exist.  Thank you.",
