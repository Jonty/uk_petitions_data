No-one ever scientifically proved that animals can serve as models for humans before the law was passed,nor could they because it is not true; as a result resources and animals' lives are being wasted and a false impression is being given of the safety and efficacy of drugs:197 000 citizens of the European Union are killed by adverse reactions to animal-tested drugs every year (European Commission estimate 2008).",
