        "additional_details": "Affirmative action is a policy in which a candidate from a selection process is picked because they are part of a minority giving minorities more of an oppurtunity in the work place. However, this policy is in itself, racist.\r\n\r\nThe policy discriminates against those of use who are of a majority background, we are not being selected because of who we are, and not what we can do, which is what a selection process is usually about.\r\n\r\nI say Parliament should abolish affirmative action and make it illegal. A person should be picked for a job because of ability, not because of who they are.",
