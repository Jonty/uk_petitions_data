        "additional_details": "It is the custom that former Prime Ministers are awarded a knighthood seven years after leaving office.  For Tony Blair that would be next year.  It is my belief that he is wholly undeserving of such an honour due to his involvement in taking us in to an illegal war in Iraq.  The honours system should recognise those in society who deserve acknowledgement from Her Majesty.  The Queen should not be put in the position of having to contemplate honouring a man who could easily be indicted as a war criminal.  British troops lost their lives pursuing this illegal action and Blair should be prosecuted, not honoured. ",
