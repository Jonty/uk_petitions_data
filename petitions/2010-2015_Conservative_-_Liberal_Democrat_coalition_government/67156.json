However, as Muslim population in the UK is feeling squeezed between our media and those fanatics wanting to destroy the world. We are calling on the BBC to respect the vast Muslims in the UK and around the world by not using the term \"Extreme Islam\", Islam has no extremism within it, we want the BBC to stop using this term in all its news bulletins and programmes whether on a radio, TV or Online. Here is an example where that term is used: \"the Jihadists are following a part of Extreme Islam\" this in fact NOT TRUE, it's a personal interpretation by the enemies of Islam. Therefore, we are asking the BBC to be considerate to those vast Muslims and not use offensive terms. Thank you",
