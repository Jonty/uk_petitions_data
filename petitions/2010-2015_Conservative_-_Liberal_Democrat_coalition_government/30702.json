        "additional_details": "Every Leap Year we are given an extra day. As this day comes but once every four years I believe that it should be made a public holiday. As it's one day in 1,461 I don't believe that there would be any great cost to industry, in fact I think the opposite could be true. A National Public holiday could raise morale among the hard working people of Britain at what many people believe to be a depressing time of year. I believe that the government should act in the interests of it's people and make this day a holiday.",
