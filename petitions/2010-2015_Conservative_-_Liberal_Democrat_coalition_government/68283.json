There has been talk of bringing her back home as a tourist attraction, hotel, conference centre, entertainments venue which s a fantastic idea will certainly be revenue making but no one is doing ANYTHING and she is in danger of being scrapped. Please help us save this beautiful ship.  She holds so many memories for so many people privileged enough to have served or sailed on her.",
