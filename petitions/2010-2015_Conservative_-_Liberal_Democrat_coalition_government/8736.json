The choice should be either to enrol for traditional national service with the armed forces or, alternatively, to take part in a new community project/charity form of national service.  This would ensure that everyone plays their part, feels included in society and has pride in themselves and their surroundings.  It would also mean that benefits were actually earned. ",
