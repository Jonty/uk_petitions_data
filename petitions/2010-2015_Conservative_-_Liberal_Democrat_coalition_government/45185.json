This is also known as celery-carrot-mugwort-spice syndrome.\r\n\r\nReactions can include itching, swelling, upset stomach and, more severely, anaphylactic shock.\r\n\r\nCelery contains compounds known as furanocoumarins, which causes skin to be photosensitive. This can lead to severe sunburn.\r\n\r\nThese adverse effects paint celery as a potentially dangerous plant.",
