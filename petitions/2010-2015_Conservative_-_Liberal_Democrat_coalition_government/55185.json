Its inconsistencies are irrelevant relative to the power it represents to advance cultural, sociological and global liberal development.  It is no less fallible than any other text constructed by human beings, but its scope is unknown in size and power for the advancement of shared understanding and knowledge. It is free at point of use, non-profit and will become available to all people of the world as the internet reaches every corner of the globe. War is too often based on social, cultural and political misunderstanding. Wikipedia is the greatest advancement towards peace the human race has ever known.",
