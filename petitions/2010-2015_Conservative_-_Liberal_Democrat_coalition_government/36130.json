Each time the very wealthy leave the UK, we loose their\r\nIncome Tax, not to mention the VAT they would be paying on consumer goods.\r\n\r\nBy charging everybody a 10% rate of Income Tax, we would have a fairer system that would not deter people from taking promotions, or encourage them to engage in tax avoidance schemes.",
