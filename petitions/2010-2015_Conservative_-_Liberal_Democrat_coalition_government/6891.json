The official view is that the British public voted on membership in 1975 which gave them the authority to make us members of what we see now as a polital union of individual states.  I don`t believe we gave authority for such a body to be brought into existance and as such I would like the British public to have the opportunity via our represenitives in our parliament to put pressure on, in particular Mr Cameron, and have him stand down as Prime Minister as he has renaged on his promise to give the public a vote on our membership of  Europe if the Consrervatives were put into Government at the last election.",
