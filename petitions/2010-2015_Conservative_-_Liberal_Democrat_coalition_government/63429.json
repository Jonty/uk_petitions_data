        "additional_details": "When Labour were in Government, and the Tories were in opposition, Oliver Letwin was always in front of the media's cameras (one of the few Tories brave enough at that time), yet since David Cameron became leader of the party Letwin has been 'disappeared' (no doubt doing 'a great job' behind the scenes). Its about time the voting public got reacquainted with this epitome of the Conservative Party.\r\n Does anyone else want to hear the views of this long- serving mainstay at the heart of current Conservative thinking.\r\n He is, after all, a member of your Government, answerable to the people of the United Kingdom. If he can be involved in making decisions and policy that affect the ordinary public, then surely he is good enough to appear on Question Time.",
