        "additional_details": "Although the racism cards are being seriously overplayed, they must necessarily apply equally.  If someone had made a similar comment about black people they would be seriously dealt with.  As an MP, Diane Abbott has an obligation to be even more circumspect in what she says than most.  If she is not required to resign it will just reinforce what is a widely held belief amongst so many of the indigenous people of this country - namely that the racist laws apply only to protect ethnic minorities.  There is serious resentment already that the racial equality laws do not apply equally to the white population of this country.  If Diane Abbott is allowed to escape any penalty by just apologising, how does this make it any better than being told that footballers should just shake hands when a racist comment is made? This is not just a matter for the labour party, this is an issue that goes to the heart of government.  An MP is not above the law,",
