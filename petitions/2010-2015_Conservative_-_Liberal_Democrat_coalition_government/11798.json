There is no money to build prisons or correctional facilities to deal with the problem, prison should be reserved for serious crime.\r\n\r\nSomething has to be done, something quick, simple and cost effective. Unlike the ASBO which has become a badge of honor, or fining which has no effect to those on benefits. Shaming them in front of the public that they have tormented and abused would be very effective.\r\n\r\nStocks are easy to build, any damage to the criminal would be a dent to the pride and reluctance to do it again. Being covered in rotten eggs, fruit and vegetables whilst standing there in their underwear is not something that will improve street cred.\r\n\r\nSafety goggles would be provided to meet health and safety requirements.\r\n\r\nBefore anyone asks 'What about their human rights?' Most would agree that they chose to forgo them when they commited the crime.\r\n\r\nBring back the stocks.",
