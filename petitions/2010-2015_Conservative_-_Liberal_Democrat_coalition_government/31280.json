        "additional_details": "The UK government should acknowledge that the benefits for Wales from the precious resources of water, are not in line with modern day requirements. Flooded valleys throughout Wales, that provide water which is solely for use in other UK regions, is akin to going into  Saudi Arabia, drilling oil wells and piping it to the UK, as British Oil. It would never happen - so why has it happened in Wales? The government should redress the balance and install modern benefits for Wales as thanks for the precious commodity that is currently being taken at will. At a minimum, Welsh Water users should be appreciated for allowing the water to flow - and the Welsh economy should be benefiting to a far greater level.",
