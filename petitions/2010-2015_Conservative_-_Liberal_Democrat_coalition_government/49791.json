        "additional_details": "I have created this petition to raise awareness of raising the minimum age limit on social networking sites to 18. The current age limit for social networking sites in the UK is 13, with a large number of under 13's signing up under false details. Facebook in particular boosts about its high tolerance to the issue but there is no way of tackling it head on. If the age limit of social networking sites was raised to 18 then this would not be a problem. A way of ensuring this is for the user to enter debit/credit card details, as is a normal practice when proving your age online.\r\nThere is no way of knowing who you or your children are talking to on sites like these and are a haven for bullies and paedophiles as it has been proven countless times. It's time to take action.\r\n",
