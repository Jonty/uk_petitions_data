Really???  You read a whole sentence and despite being oh so clever you can only work to a set of redundant rules?\r\n\r\nPeople moan about the teaching standards and that more time should be spent teaching our children on the correct usage of the Apostrophe. What a complete waste of time and effort, ban their use, stop schools from failing to teach it and spend that time more wisely on something that will improve our country and the education of our children.
