        "additional_details": "If a British Citizen pays NI for 40 years, it is their right to retire at 60. It is better to pay a pension than have them out of work. Give the older workers some pride back in their lives. Older people are the Volunteers of Britain, jobs for all are a thing of the past and MP's know this. Give the few jobs that there are to the young and fit of this country. Older people slow down and are prone to sickness and take longer to recover.\r\nYOU KNOW IT MAKES SENSE!",
