The main conflict is in the area of  the Human Right to Equal Treatment.  There is currently a case where a convict, who is known to be a serious danger to others, who is applying to move to an open prison cannot be named because he could be in danger from the population at large.  It has not also been considered that not naming him allows him to be a danger to the rest of the population at large, WHO DO NOT KNOW WHO HE IS, are prevented by the law from taking steps to protect themselves, who are ALSO ENTITLED TO THE PROTECTION OF THE HUMAN RIGHT OF BEING PROTECTED FROM CRIMINALS WHO ARE KNOWN TO BE DANGEROUS.",
