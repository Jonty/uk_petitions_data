        "additional_details": "For those who don\u2019t know the BBC have excluded the Green Party from taking part in the TV debates in the general election next year even though they have allowed UKIP to join the debate alongside Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. The Green Party have responded by saying that the BBC have based their decision based on the party\u2019s past performance in the 2010 General Election rather than on it\u2019s present progress.\r\n\r\nHopefully by gaining enough signatures we will allow democracy to prevail and change the BBC's narrow mind by including the Green Party in the TV debates as they have the right to express their ideas and values like other parties.\r\n\r\nFor more information check the following sources:\r\n\r\nthepoliticalevolution.wordpress.com\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18btEWRwS7c- Daily Politics programme on this issue\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghGaYmlj5Z8- Video criticising the BBC about this decision",
