        "additional_details": "It should be the time to set a 'minimum' speed on the motorway. This is because If one was driving around 45 mph, it would create havoc and the person would be at risk of getting annihilated by a person who was doing 55 or 60 mph.\r\n\r\nSetting a minimum speed will make motorway more safer especially for lorries and people who wants to have a calm environment around them.\r\n\r\nWith slow driving, there would be huge tailbacks and this would cause the motorway to run in two lanes.\r\n\r\nAlso the definition of motorway is \"a dual-carriageway road designed for fast traffic, with relatively few places for joining or leaving.\" from google. In my opinion, under 55 MPH for me is not considered as a fast speed which the definition backs me up. Even the A road on the dual carriageway on this type of speed is faster than doing the same speed on the motorway.",
