Trying to maintain a positive relationship with her estranged father, her mother took her to Egypt in May 2009 where she was abducted by her father, she was returned in January 2010 to her mother who won and still has full custody in the Egyptian courts, although they were forced to stay in Egypt against their will due to a travel ban being imposed on Aishah. Aishah wasn't returned from an access visit in September of last year and her father claims not to know her whereabouts. The Egyptian authorities are not enforcing the court order which gives her mother full custody and because of this a little girl is suffering. We need the British government to intervene and get this little girl reunited with her mother and then ensure they are brought safely back to the UK.",
