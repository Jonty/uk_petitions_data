        "additional_details": "Until relatively recent times, various peoples and faiths have coexisted in Iraq and the Levant in a spirit of human understanding, freedom and rich diversity. Recent months, however, have seen the worrying rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Al Sham (ISIS), which seems intent on destroying the region's heritage of peaceful coexistence in favour of a totalitarian and oppressive regime. The latest reports indicate that ISIS is painting the Arabic letter 'N' (meaning 'Nazarene') on the homes of Christians, to signify that the occupants must either convert to Islam, pay a tax, or be executed. This petition calls on the Foreign & Commonwealth Office of HM Government to take as tough and courageous a line as possible in order to thwart the progress of ISIS, with a view towards working for the restoration of peace and freedom in Iraq and the Levant.
