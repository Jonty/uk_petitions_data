        "additional_details": "In the interests of sharing this Country's financial burdens equally across Society, members of both Houses of Parliament should have their salary and expenses means tested as follows: -\r\n\r\n1.  Peers who have paid employment and/or an independent income or assets should not be entitled to claim daily attendance expenses.\r\n\r\n2.  Members of the Commons who have other paid employment and/or any other income / assets should\r\n (a) be unable to claim any expenses, and\r\n (b) if their other income / assets amount to more than their salary as an MP or Minister, said salary should be reduced proportionately.\r\n\r\nSince this is the system applied to the vast majority of benefit claimants, and one which both Houses apparently deem to be fair and equable, we see no reason why MPs and Peers should not submit themselves to the same tests, in the interests of fairness and equality and of saving the Country a great deal of money in these difficult financial times.",
