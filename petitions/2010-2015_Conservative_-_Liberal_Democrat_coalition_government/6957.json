        "additional_details": "In light of the recent riots in Tottenham and also Brixton I feel it would be a good idea to bring back national service for delinquent and disruptive youths and draft them in to the military.\r\n\r\nWhen children as young as 7 can attack police and cause riots in London making it the scene similar to something out of the blitz; its clear these youths have no respect for themselves or anyone else.\r\n\r\nI feel military service would teach these individuals some respect, and how to deal with the general public and behave like decent people.\r\n\r\nThese riots have already portrayed London as the city that lets youths riot in the streets without consequences.\r\n\r\nBringing back national service would add some stability in the lives of these children, helping them to grow up in to decent people, with respect for themselves as well as the general public at large.\r\n",
