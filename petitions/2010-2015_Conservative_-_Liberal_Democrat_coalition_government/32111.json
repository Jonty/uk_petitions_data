        "additional_details": "Animal rights activists/luddites who terrorise, intimate & commit other crimes are not conscientious objectors/pacifists but criminals. Animals bred for specially for the sole purpose of experimentation or food are often kept in less cruel conditions than if those animals were living wild, fending a living for themselves. Animal experimentation is as essential as breeding animals for food & harvesting the by-products (like leather) of their slaughter. Animal rights activists are often ignorant of the importance of the need to study & understand in detail the effects of potential new drugs on a multitude of complex biochemical & pharmacological processes on suitable animal models. One of main principles of pharmacology & biochemistry are that drugs are agonists or antagonists. Analogues and agonists attached (like lock & key) to biological substrates (like receptors in cell membranes, DNA, enzymes) & can switch on or off certain metabolic pathways.",
