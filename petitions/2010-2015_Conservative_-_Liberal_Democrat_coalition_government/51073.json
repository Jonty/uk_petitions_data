The Department for Transport works hard to improve the safety of all road users for example, by improving driver training and continuing our THINK! road safety campaign to encourage road users to adopt safer behaviour.  Local traffic authorities have the flexibility to set local speed limits that are appropriate for the individual road, reflecting local needs and taking account of local considerations.  The speed limit on Dry Street is set by the local traffic authority and so any campaign to lower the limit would be for Basildon Borough Council to consider."
