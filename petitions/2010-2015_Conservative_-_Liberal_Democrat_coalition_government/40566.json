        "additional_details": "we believe that the death penalty should be reinstated for crimes such as murder, rape, peadophilia and other high profile crimes. for far too long the capital punishment of jail time has no longer been feared. the conditions inside many prisons across the uk are far better than those in some of are care homes. the death penalty should be served to those whom are convicted upon no reasonable doubt or evidence of their crime(s) DNA testing is so advanced and has had major improvement since the last over-turned murder conviction. any murder, rape ect crime that has been commited and charged upon a person since the year 2000 should be deamed as punishable upon death sentance. are jails are full and a drain on tax payers money, not only is this a solution but it is Fair justice aswell as a feared consequence of a persons actions",
