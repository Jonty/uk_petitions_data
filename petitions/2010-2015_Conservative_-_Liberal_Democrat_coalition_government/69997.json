It is now an integral part of the United Kingdom with its own National identity and deserves and is entitled to a fair representation on a new, modernised Union Flag.\r\nWe are aware that the current Union Flag has a lot of History and has been flown by the Nation and by the Troops and Service personnel of the UK over hundreds of years. We do not wish to de-value this glorious history, knowing full well that Welsh Troops have also served and fought and Died under the Union Flag as well.\r\nWhat we ask for now, as a Welsh Nation, is to be represented in a new and modernised Union Flag that represents the Welsh Nation as part of the UK.",
