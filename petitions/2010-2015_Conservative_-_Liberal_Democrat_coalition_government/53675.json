        "additional_details": "Building controls mean period properties cannot be restored in an appropriate way e.g with sash windows and single glazed front door. Furthermore, loft conversions mean original doors throughout the house must be replaced with ugly fire doors.\r\n\r\nWhile building controls are a good idea for new propeties, they seem designed to destroy the fabric of old buildings and prevent sympathetic restoration.\r\n\r\nI call on the Government to exempt pre-1940 buildings from building contols  apart from in relation to major building work.\r\n\r\nIts is unfair to prevent people restoring period homes. Nothing is done to force existing homes to meet these standards. ",
