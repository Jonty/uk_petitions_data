Therefore, we should use our public money for essential projects only.\r\n\r\nThis is not a petition to stop the creation of the said museum. It is a petition to ensure that the museum is created using only private money and charitable donations.\r\n\r\nIn a speech announcing the project,  Prime Minister David Cameron said, \"During her life Margaret Thatcher believed in action - and this memorial will produce real results for generations to come.\"\r\n\r\nTake action.",
