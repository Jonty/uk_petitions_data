        "additional_details": "Petition to campaign for the review and change of Warrington waste services. Through summer 2014 we have seen fortnightly collections which has had an adverse affect of quality of living. Bins smell and attract pests. In the sunlight they bake the contents and then this rotting waste is left to breed bacteria in our gardens over 14 days until emptied. We have seen bin men strike which resulted in bags being left in the street, bin lids being un sealed. This petition is to bring awareness to the council and ask we see the return of weekly collections of bllack bin or the addition of a forth bin that seals like tupperware for food and perishable waste products that would either be emptied weekly or will seal firmly to avoid smells and health risks from bacteria growth and be collected fortnightly.",
