        "additional_details": "\"Rule, Britannia!\" is a rousing and already widely recognised song that celebrates our nation, and Britons are proud to unite behind it.  I therefore propose officially changing the United Kingdom's national anthem to \"Rule Britannia!\".\r\n\r\nThe current national anthem \"God Save the Queen\" focuses on one person, great though she is, rather than on our nation, has a dirge-like and uninspiring tune, and is divisive (with the original version calling for rebellious Scots to be crushed).",
