Many parties states that the youth of Britain are uninterested in politics, lazy and complaisant. They use the low voting rates in the UK as evidence of these claims.\r\nPolitics in Britain continue to pretend there isn't a market for parties that wish to change and only for parties that stick to their traditional statements and tries to save the population money - despite several protests taking place such as:\r\n\r\nProtests when they increased student fees\r\n\r\nUKIP winning the EU election just this month.\r\n\r\nBy adding the option of a blank vote to all ballots and their count being listed alongside the other parties on the polls, the UK can show that they do vote, just not for the parties as they are today. It will send a clear statement to the parties and it will be an effective criticism coming from the people instead of other mediums which are often ignored.\r\n\r\n",
