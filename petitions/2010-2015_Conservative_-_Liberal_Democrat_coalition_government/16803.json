        "additional_details": "The government should remove time limits on all GCSE and A Level exams. The point of exams should be to test a student's knowledge and understanding of a given subject, and currently some pupils are prevented from demonstrating their full ability by overly punitive time limits. The removal of time limits would help students feel more relaxed, and it would give them the chance to show the full extent of their ability, thereby allowing the best candidates to stand out, and more clearly exposing those that have very limited ability.",
