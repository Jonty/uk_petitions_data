        "additional_details": "If you look at the underlying causes of the riots, it did not START as random looting and violence, there were several reasons, these people are angry and they need to be heard. For years the youth programs in Tottenham and other areas have been systematically shut down which leave the young with nothing to do but hang around on the streets, I propose the government open and fund now programs for youth in these underprivileged areas, these would also create a few more jobs and could be used to teach young people skills they need for work.",
