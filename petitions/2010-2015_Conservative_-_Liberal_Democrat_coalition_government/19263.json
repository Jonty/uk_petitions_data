The council has failed to make a proper assessment of local needs in respect of its library services\r\n\r\n2. The council has not satisfactorily addressed the specific needs of older people, disabled people, unemployed people and those living in deprived areas\r\n\r\n3. The proposed cuts will hit some groups of people in Brent harder than others, especially young people\r\n\r\n4. The council has not had proper regard to the needs of the borough\u2019s children\r\n\r\n5. There is a lack of logic around why some libraries were recommended for closure and not others",
