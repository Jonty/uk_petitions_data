        "additional_details": "It is currently an offence to feed dried Mealworms and other dried insects & crustaceans to domestic poultry.\r\nWe ask for this to be reviewed, it is recognised as a quirk within the legislation but no action has been taken to remove this ruling.\r\nWe ask that this ruling within the legislation is changed to allow the feeding of Mealworms & similar dried insects to domestic poultry.\r\nCurrently all domestic poultry are categorised as farmed animals & for this reason such products are banned.\r\nWe ask for this ban to be lifted, or for a separate category to be recognised, for domestic poultry, allowing the feeding of dried insects.\r\n\r\nIt is currently ok to feed live mealworms to poultry but not dried mealworms.\r\nThe current legislation is out dated and needs to be reviewed.\r\n\r\nIn contradiction to this ban, the EU are currently giving grants for R&D into inclusion of insect meal in poultry diets as an alternative to Soya imports.\r\n",
