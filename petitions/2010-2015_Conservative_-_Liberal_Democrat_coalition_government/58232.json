        "additional_details": "A policy that amends the 2011 act so that the greatest time between general elections post May 2015 should be every 4 years fixed.\r\n\r\nWith the rise in new parties throughout Europe and the UK pandering more to the extreme wings of politics 5 years seems too long.\r\n\r\nIn a democracy we should be able to vote as often as is possible within logistical reason.  In the past we have voted after 4 years. This was not a problem. It follows that the public should have the right to an election every 4 years.\r\n\r\nThe coalition created fixed terms, which do increase stability in democracy.\r\n\r\nA 5 year term is always less democratic than a 4 year term with no negative problems apparent.\r\n\r\nParties may argue that they need time to put their policies in place. But, this is an admission that the policies they wish to implement are going to be unpopular, and against the democratic wishes of the public.\r\n\r\nA 5 year term reduces the democracy of the public without good reason.",
