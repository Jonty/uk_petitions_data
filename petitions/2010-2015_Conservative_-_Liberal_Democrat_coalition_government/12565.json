        "additional_details": "The recent riots point to several things: Boredom, lack of work and lack of money. The lack of money is due to government cuts.. EMA is one essential benefit that  has been cut. In addition, children are bored. D of E could combat both of these if kids were made to do it to earn benefits. For example: One child has to volunteer at a local charity to complete D of E. This helps the 'Big Society' idea, and also helps build values through getting the children to work for money. Would also take up hours in the day spent by children doing less productive things.",
