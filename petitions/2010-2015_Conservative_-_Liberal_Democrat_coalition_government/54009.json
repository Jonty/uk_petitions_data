        "additional_details": "In the UK there are 100,000 people living with HIV, a quarter of whom are undiagnosed. With people living longer with HIV, there are increasing numbers ageing and growing older, requiring additional support with health and social care. Sadly people living with HIV still face stigma and discrimination,  which impact on their equitable access to good quality care and outcomes and is part of the reason many stay undiagnosed and/or present late.\r\n\r\nBy signing this petition I call upon the Government to ensure equitable access to treatments, health and social care for people living with HIV in the UK, regardless of age, race, gender, sexuality or place of residence; to ensure meaningful patient engagement in informing service change, standards of care and integration of services.  To achieve this, we urge the UK Government to develop a cross-departmental national HIV strategy, and ensure effective levels of funding for HIV treatments, health and social care at national and local levels.\r\n",
