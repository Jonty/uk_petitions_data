        "additional_details": "Dentists selling their NHS contracts privately is big business,with many NHSpractice owners making millions.At present the NHS contracts are with select few dentists,reducing competition,thus keeping cost higher to NHS. Government should allow more dentists to treat patients under their own NHS contracts,rather than dentists having to work for other NHS practice owners,under owners contract,with owner deciding how NHS work is distributed /paid to other dentists.Each year NHS funding should be offered to all registered dentist applicants who can offer good service at best rate to government,rather than it staying with the same few practice owners. This will be fairer.Take away NHS financial safety blankets from dentists,increase competition, getting the best value for tax payers.Give more dentists opportunity to treat NHS patients with their own contract,without them having to pay large sums privately to buy NHS contracts from dentists",
