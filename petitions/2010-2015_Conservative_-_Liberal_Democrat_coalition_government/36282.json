        "additional_details": "Want to stop people gambling in unsafe environments? Want to have a self-enforcing industry truly concerned for its players well-being?  Why not private members clubs that allow their members to play poker against each other and not roulette or table games against the house?This e-petition is proposing an armistice for private member \u2018Poker\u2019 Clubs such as the recently shut down International to legislate for them and not against them. A one off piece of legislation to sign up clubs to a code of practice, appropriate tax band and a series of high standards sure to be maintained in order to keep a newly formed licence. I propose we legislate for what is not a problem but for a solution to this countries desire for a legislated micro poker industry done not in a casino with ample opertunity to play table games and be pressured into gambling beyond your means but in a safe private members club",
