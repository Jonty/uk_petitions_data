But why are polititions who removed thousands from the public purse still in their jobs?  Why has no senior bank offical been jailed for the millions lost from their ilegal dealings including the PPI scams?\r\nIt seems the UK, like America has the best justice system money/privilage can buy.\r\nI would like the government to debate and coment on this clear two tier system?",
