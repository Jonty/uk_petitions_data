        "additional_details": "This petition has been created due to the propaganda being displayed on the \"Britain First\" Facebook and Twitter sites.\r\n\r\nThey violate a number of Facebook and Twitter polices, yet have not been removed.\r\n\r\nThey now advertise as a political party, giving you the opportunity to sign up and become a \"Street Activist\". They frequently upload videos of clashes with other far right groups from different ethnicities and race and glorify their Street Activists that have taken part.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative that the Government is made aware of pages like Britain First on Facebook and Twitter, so they can be removed or moderated swiftly.\r\n",
