        "additional_details": "Did you know there are over 59,500 children in the foster care system? These statistics are saddening and deplorable considering that there are a number of good quality and caring families wanting to expand through the gift of adoption.\r\nA large portion of children in the foster care system are from minority ethnic backgrounds and a majority of families wanting to pursue adoption in the UK are white British families. This should not be a problem, but unfortunately due to 'political correctness' and various other unacceptable excuses, these children are not placed with families whose race and culture do not match theirs.\r\nAs a result thousands of needy children who deserve and want a loving family are deprived of one, instead they are left to languish in the foster care system, and moved from one home to another.\r\n\r\nPlease petition against matching adoptive families according to race. Inter-cultural and interracial adoption should be allowed and encouraged.\r\n\r\n",
