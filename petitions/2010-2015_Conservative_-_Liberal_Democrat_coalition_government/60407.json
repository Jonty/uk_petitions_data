        "additional_details": "The recent capture of the canine working for British forces or American forces in Afghanistan - given the fact that the canine was in essence forced into service, it is the canines basic right to be protected as a human member of the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nAnd thus given the danger the canine faces alone I believe I speak for everyone when I say that dog needs to be saved - it is the duty of the Armed Forces to protect its members and the canine is no exception.\r\n\r\nWhat I am ultimately trying to achieve is that the canine is returned to its rightful place amongst the Coalition forces. Whether this requires excessive force or can be achieved by diplomatic negotiations, it is essential that the canine is saved.",
