        "additional_details": "I am creating this petition for the government to make recommendations that all social housing landlords have an obligation for sanitary reasons to install  a shower into bathrooms for all tenants.\r\nI find it very hard to believe that in the year 2014 there is still social housing without a basic shower.\r\n\r\nNot every tenant is in reciept o housing benefit and most do actually pay a fair rent, I believe everybody should be entitled to have the choice of a shower.\r\n\r\nI rent privately and would not even take a tenancy on without a shower being in the premises. For those interested I am doing this for my sister who is a social housing tenant and has been told very clealy her housing association will not pay to have showers installed.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and keep forwarding link.",
