        "additional_details": "Their will be closures/job loses at many Sure Start Centres. Baffins is one set to close, which means that the nearest will be Milton, which for alot of people will just be impossible to get to, or the fact Milton is alot smaller and our big groups at Baffins would simply not all get in. One of the reasons for Baffins closure is that being a thriving area \" we do not need \"our Centre as much as the less affluent areas.\r\nWe have as much need as any other area, our postcode does not stop, domestic violence, vulnerable single mums, at risk children, depression, and the need for advice and support ! I want their to be a full investigation  into numbers at all Portsmouth Sure start centres which will show Baffins is needed as one of (if not) the busiest in Portsmouth, and for the closure to be stopped ! I have done spot checks and knowsome centres are in single figures",
