        "additional_details": "We believe that the government should offer a form of state subsidy to help listed religious buildings (Grade II and above) to carry out necessary repair and maintenance work or work that will enable them to be used by the community as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis could take the form of tax relief for such building work or of direct subsidies from central government or an independent body.\r\n\r\nIf a measure like this were passed it would help to preserve some of the country's most important historic buildings and to open them up for use by local groups and organisations. Without this support local communities will struggle to save this integral part of our heritage for the next generation and an irreplaceable resource will be lost forever.",
