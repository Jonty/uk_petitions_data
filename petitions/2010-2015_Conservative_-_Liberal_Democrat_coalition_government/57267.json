        "additional_details": "Elmbridge Council has proposed to turn Radnor House into a homless shelter. Being a safe, affluent community we feel that these plans will create an unsafe and volatile environment for all who live in the area. Not only that, but the new shelter will be directly opposite a well known, popular primary school. We are creating this petition to ensure that these plans do not go ahead in order to preserve the safety of our town. ",
