If an individual joins the scheme he or she agrees to donate his/her organs.  Only members of the scheme should be eligible to receive a transplant.  Children would automatically be eligible up to the age of 18.  Organs donated would not be available to anybody who is not a member of the scheme.  Non members would not be allowed to join the scheme following diagnosis of any condition likely to lead to the need for a transplant of any type unless this was diagnosed under the age of 18.  ",
