For IT staff this damage can easily be reduced by running software to remind users to take a break. Perhaps the government should encourage employers to offer their IT staff the option of running a \u201cDesktop Lifejacket\u201d application to encourage regular short breaks to combat the build-up of damaging factors within the body caused by having a sedentary job?",
