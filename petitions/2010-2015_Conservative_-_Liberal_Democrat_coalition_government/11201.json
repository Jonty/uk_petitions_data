        "additional_details": "In the wake of the recent riots throughout the UK, perpetrated in a large part by young people, we the undersigned propose the introduction of a curfew to the streets of the UK. Anyone under the age of, for instance, 14 should not be out on the streets past, say, 7pm without a responsible adult accompanying them. Any parents who fail to inform this curfew should be sent to a parenting class, and repeat offenders should be fined. In drastic cases, children should be removed from the care of the parents, either permanently, or until they have learned to enforced discipline with them",
