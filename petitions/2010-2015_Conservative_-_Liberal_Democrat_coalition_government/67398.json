        "additional_details": "If your child misses a day to go on holiday, you can be severely punished by the UK government. Teachers on the other hand can \"Book\" holidays just like any other persons. However, parents who would like to take their children out of school for a holiday may face fines or even PRISON. The UK government needs to rethink their policy about this, as the average holiday for a family of 4 in school terms can be as low as \u00a3600. However the day that the schools break up, the price increases by tenfold. Teachers should not be able to have holidays just like the rest of us.",
