        "additional_details": "This petition is an attempt to try and stop the cruel slaughter of Calderon Dolphins in Denmark. Every year thousands of these dolphins are killed by men as a 'Right Of Passage' to being/becoming a man.\r\nThe Dolphins only come toward land to try and contact man - in a way of pure friendship.\r\nThe UK should create a way to stop this - whether it be fees for the slaughterers, an organisation (similar to the RSPCA), or a reserve for the dolphins to be safe.",
