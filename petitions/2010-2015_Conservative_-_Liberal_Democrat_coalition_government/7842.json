These rioters need to be boxed in and closed down.\r\n\r\nThis is out of hand. One person has now died from gunshot wounds. An officer has been run over and had both legs broken. Enough is enough. Military intervention. Not live ammunition. But more authorities/military personell to police the streets of London & other English citys.\r\n\r\nThe police need help, and are at breaking point. They are human. They will get tired, start making mistakes. They need help. Our cities need help.\r\n\r\nOur military resources are there to protect our country. From external and internal threats. Lets use a resource that  we have.",
