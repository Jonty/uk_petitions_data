Our legal system would be freed up and our prison population dramatically reduced, saving billions.\r\nThere is no evidence to show that prohibition is succeeding. The question we must ask ourselves is, \"What are the benefits of criminalising any drug?\" If, after examining all the available evidence, we find that the costs outweigh the benefits, then we must seek an alternative policy.\r\n\r\nWE DEMAND REFORM",
