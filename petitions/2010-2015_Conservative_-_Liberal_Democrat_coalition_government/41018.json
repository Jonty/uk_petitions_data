Dog owners are quite rightly made to clean up after their pets and so should cat owners. This leaves us with only two sensible options:\r\n\r\nPut your cat on a lead and take it to the park, take some bags to clean up the poop - if in doubt watch the dog owners.\r\n\r\nAnd/As well as\r\n\r\nIf your cat is not receptive to being put on a lead or cannot do its business with an audience then it MUST wear a cat nappy when unaccompanied.\r\n\r\nAny cats owners that are caught not abiding by these rules will be held accountable to the same laws and fines that dog owners are subjected too.\r\n\r\nIn addition any cats that are found wandering about \"nappy less\" will be rounded up and sent to a local Chinese restaurant for food processing.\r\n",
