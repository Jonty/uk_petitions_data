        "additional_details": "Spain has targeted Gibraltar by sending armed paramilitary vessels into British Gibraltar Territorial Waters and imposing huge delays to cross from Gibraltar to Spain.\r\n\r\nIncursions into BGTW included the firing of weapons at a British citizen; the border delays are a massive health risk as people queue in 30+ degree heat.\r\n\r\nThe government has protested for this to stop which has fallen on deaf ears, and less than 24 hours after Mr Hague's intervention today, 30/07/13 the Spanish have again ignored this and started manufacturing queues by searching every car that crosses the border.\r\n\r\nA stronger message must sent to Madrid that we will not accept treatment like this from a NATO and EU ally. The removal of the Spanish ambassador from London until these hostile tactics cease and the stationing of a Navy warship within BGTW as a visible deterrent to the armed Civil Guard incursions.\r\n\r\nThe government has a duty and obligation to act on these matters in a much stronger form.",
