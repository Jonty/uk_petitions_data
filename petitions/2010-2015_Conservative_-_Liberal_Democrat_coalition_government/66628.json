        "additional_details": "Football is the national game of the UK which generates significant wealth and attracts public and private funding but has failed to achieve at the World Cup resulting in national embarrassment and potentially jeopardising the future of the football industry and broader development of the game\r\n\r\nIn light of the disappointing World Cup performance of all of the home nations I propose a debate into the state of football, youth development and publicly funded football infrastructure across the UK.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I propose that the prevalence of foreign players and uncapped salaries in the national leagues (predominately the EPL) is having a detrimental long term effect to the development and future of the game.\r\n\r\nIf we, as a nation wish to preserve football as part of the National Character, then a long-term and appropriately resourced strategy is required.",
