        "additional_details": "The Segensworth Estate is becoming extremely congested during the hours of 4pm and 6pm when commuters are trying to leave from work and head home.\r\n\r\nConcorde Way is currently an unfinished road; can this be completed and joined with Whiteley Lane to provide another exit off of the estate?  It would significantly reduce the congestion.\r\n\r\nThere are more and more companies setting up in Segensworth and the congestion has increased dramatically over the last few months.  Something needs to be done to improve this situation.\r\n",
