        "additional_details": "The European Court of Justice tore up the rule book for insurance companies by banning risk assessment based on a person\u2019s sex.\r\n\r\nSurely then the same principal should be applied to age discriminatiom. Age discrimination law states that it exists to ensure \u201cmeasures taken to improve the position of young people\u201d\r\n\r\nSurely the issue is around the safety of drivers, not their age or gender, and there are a number of tracking and monitoring gadgets used by some insurers to determine the safety of drivers and the risks each one poses. New drivers of any age can pose an increased risk.\r\n\r\nThe current method of calculating insurance Ageist just as it was Sexist not long ago? European legislation surely can\u2019t argue the case for one and not the other.\r\n\r\nACTION : ASSESS INDIVIDUALS NOT STEREOTYPES\r\n\r\nEnsure that if one discrimination law is applied to a service then ALL discrimination laws are applied - otherwise this would be discrimination!",
