        "action": "Reducing the Tax Burden for Domestic Employers",
        "additional_details": "At a time when the economy is struggling, the financial burden placed on ordinary families employing domestic staff (Nannies, Au Pairs, etc) acts as an unnecessary restraint to recovery.\r\n\r\nRising inflation, living costs and unemployment are placing a real and threatened squeeze on household incomes.  As a result many domestic employees are losing their jobs.\r\n\r\nThis reduces tax income to HM Treasury and increases costs through benefit payments.\r\n\r\nMy proposed suspension on Employer Tax for families employing domestic help will address this.\r\n\r\nMore domestic workers will stay employed, or find new jobs and HM Treasury will benefit from the income tax of these workers and the consumption their salary allows.\r\n\r\nMany domestic professionals dedicate years of study to gain the qualifications required to carry out their work.\r\n\r\nIt is unfair that HM Treasury is threatening their employment prospects.",
