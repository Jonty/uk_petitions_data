        "additional_details": "Wahabism espouses death to anyone who will not accept Allah as the one true God and MuHammed as his final prophet, this in Islamic terms is heretical since the Koran states that Jihad which is simply a personal struggle in life can only be used as an excuse to take the life of another human being if they pose a threat to the life of the individual or their family, so the wahabi dogma\r\nIn Islam is an affront to Allah.\r\nMost Sunni Muslims in the UK support the perverted Wahabi dogma albeit in a dormant way, but they do not actively prevent their children from becoming radicalised because by doing so they would be ostracised in Muslim society.\r\nI call on all UK MP,s to support this petition.",
