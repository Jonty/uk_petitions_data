Most importantly we could massively improve the infastructure of our country at a minimum of cost and the improvements would help boost the economy; but also it would give prisoners valuable skills for life after jail. The amount of effort put would in by the prisoner would determen how comfortable or unbearable their living standards would be whilst inside.\r\nPeople on benifits should be put to work in the local comunity.  Those who outright refuse should only be given vouchers for food and other essentials. Cash paid benifit well below the minimum wage only for those working for it.\r\nWe're paying for these people anyway; lets make them useful !\r\n",
