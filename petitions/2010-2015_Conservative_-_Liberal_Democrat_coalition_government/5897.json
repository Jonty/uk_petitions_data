Why should the public have to purchase a Sky subscription and then have to pay for the relevant Sports package on top to watch a sport that has been broadcast on BBC1, BBC2 and ITV for over 50 years. We already have to pay for a TV Licence and we don't want to have to continue to pay to watch F1.",
