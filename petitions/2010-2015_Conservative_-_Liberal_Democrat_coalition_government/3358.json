        "additional_details": "Ireland gets to celebrate St Patricks day in March with a public holiday.  Likewise, Scotland get to celebrate St Andrews day in November.  This petition is to ask for St Georges day to be recognised as a public holiday in England on the 23rd April.  English people often feel repressed to celebrate this day but it is part of the English heritage and should be celebrated as part of the English culture.  This is England afterall.",
