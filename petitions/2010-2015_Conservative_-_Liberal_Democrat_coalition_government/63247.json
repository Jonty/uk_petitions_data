        "action": "Stop F1 going to Bahrain",
        "additional_details": "There are many human rights abuses in Bahrain but certain event there put a sheen on the dictatorship which spends millions in PR and denies it's record of torture.\r\nIf F1 can be stopped from going, it will shine a light on the non sectarian struggle for Democracy and the impunity with which peaceful protesters and journalists are treated. Medical care is politicised so many doctors have resigned and no assistance is given to victims of torture or bullet wounds from being shot during protests. This petition is dedicated to Chrissie Morris Brady who spent many months raising the plight of Bahrainis.\r\nThe British government must stop condoning the oppression committed by the Al-Khalifa ruling family.",
