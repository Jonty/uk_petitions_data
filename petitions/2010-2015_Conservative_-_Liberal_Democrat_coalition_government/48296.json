At stake is the break up of the UK. As such it is only fit that the Prime Minister should put forward the case for the UK and the First Minister of Scotland should put forward the case for Indpendence.\r\n\r\nA debate of this nature would give the people of Scotland the chance to make an informed decision on the future of the UK and Scotland.",
