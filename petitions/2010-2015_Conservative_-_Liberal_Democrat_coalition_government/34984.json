THE NHS CHARGES \u00a37.65p ON EACH DRUG WHICH MANY SUFFERERS ARE RELUCTANT TO PAY WHEN IT COMES TO MULTIPLE PRESCRIPTIONS AND JUST ON 2 MONTHLY BASIS AS GP's PRESCRIBES.\r\n\r\nDUE TO THIS MANY HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS ARE NOT COMPLYING WITH MEDICATIONS OR ARE IN DENIAL, WHICH IN MOST CASES LEADS TO COMPLICATIONS THAT MAKES THE NHS SUFFERS MORE on COST OF ADMISSIONS FOR TREATMENT ON STROKE, HEART ATTACK TO NAME BUT FEW AND ALSO HAVING DEVASTATING EFFECT ON THE PATIENTS INVOLVED, EVEN DEATH.\r\n\r\nIF ALL HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS ARE GIVEN FREE MEDICATIONS or CHARGES OF 1 POUND PER ITEM, THIS WILL REDUCE THE NHS WAITING TIMES/LISTS, THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH STOKES, HEART FAILURE, HEART ATTACK and OVER ALL SAVES MONEY AND LIVES. THERE IS NO POINT IN WASTING MONEY ON AMBULATORY BLOOD PRESSURE MACHINE AS SUGGESTED IN THE NEWS RECENTLY. PLEASE SIGN TO SUPPORT THIS PETITION. THANKS\r\n\r\n",
