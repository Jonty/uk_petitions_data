        "additional_details": "The EU Cookie legislation that became law on the 26th May 2011 is a shambles and requires clarification.\r\n\r\nThe DCMS (Dept for Culture, Media and Sport) handed this half-baked legislation onto the Information Commissioner's office and the population at very short notice.  The resultant guidance is poorly defined and unclear. At the time of writing I was unable to find any government website that was compliant.\r\n\r\nAs this law stands most websites are in fact illegal.  The ICO now has the ability to fine up to \u00a3500000  making this poor legislation more scary.  The ICO has granted 1 year for site owners to be compliant; are we going to have to wait for prosecutions before the law is clarified?\r\n\r\nThe CO guidance is here: http://goo.gl/KxDUq\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned accept legislation may be necessary, we request the DCMS/ICO look again then issue accurate, clear, proper guidance to website owners. Alternatively that steps are taken to ensure prosecutions under this law are not forthcoming.",
