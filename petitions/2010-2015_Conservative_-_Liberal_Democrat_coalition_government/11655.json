This includes meat that has been slaughtered to abide by certain rituals; e.g yet not inclusive to Halal and Kosher meat. Whilst people of the appropriate religions have their right to consume such food, others have the right to not eat it if they don't want to, they have the freedom to choose.\r\n",
