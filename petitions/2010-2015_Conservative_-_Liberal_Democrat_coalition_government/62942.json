        "additional_details": "Half a million British song birds are slaughtered every year during migrating season.\r\nThe killing fields are centred on the British Sovereign Base Area (SBA) of Dhekelia, on Cyprus\u2019s southern coast, close to the tourist hot-spot of Ayia Napa. British soldiers train on firing ranges there before serving in Afghanistan.\r\nTrappers place their lures at night. Early the next morning, they return for their grisly harvest, ripping the terrified birds from the fine-mesh \u2018mist\u2019 nets or glue-covered branches, often leaving the entangled feet behind, then killing them with a cocktail stick or a penknife to the throat.\r\nThis sickening trade is worth \u00a312\u2009\u2009million a year to private companies.\r\nPrince Charles has written to the most senior Army commander in Cyprus condemning the 'industrial scale killing' of migrating songbirds on British Military bases.\r\nThe government must put a stop to this or we will have NO birds left in Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
