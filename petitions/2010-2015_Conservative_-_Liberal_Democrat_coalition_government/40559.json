We ask you to support freezing all preferential trade agreements with Israel until that state upholds the rights of Palestinian children and implements international law.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that every year around 700 Palestinian children, even as young as 8 years old, are arrested and detained without proper trial or access to law or their parents. They are kept in harsh conditions, sometimes in isolation and often far from home.\r\nUsually their offences are minor such as throwing stones at illegal settlers and often they are forced to sign false confessions in order to try to be released.\r\n\r\nWe believe all this to be inhumane and in contravention of international and human rights law and that this is something our government could and should act upon to bring about its end.",
