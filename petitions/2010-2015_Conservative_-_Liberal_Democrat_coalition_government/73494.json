This is 31,755 per year. 1 in 103 people in the UK have epilepsy. Source of information:- www.epilepsy.org\r\n\r\nPLEASE CONSIDER GIVING SOME GOVERNMENT FUNDING TO THIS ORGANISATION.\r\n\r\nDespite constant research and investigative work, there is still no cure for epilepsy.  To date this work is funded by charitable donations.  There is currently no government funding for this organisation.\r\n\r\nEpilepsy takes no prisoners on people affected by it.  Notable subjects who had epilepsy are:- Prince John (youngest son of King George V), Aristotle, Caligula, Caesar, F.D. Roosevelt to name but a few. I do not name persons still alive suffering from epilepsy for obvious reasons to the individuals.",
