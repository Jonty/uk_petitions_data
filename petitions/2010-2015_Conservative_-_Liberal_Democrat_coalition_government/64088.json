        "additional_details": "HM Revenue and Customs are currently planning proposals to sell off private data belonging to millions of tax payers.  The data sale is nothing short of a cash grab at the risk of identity theft.  Previous attempts have shown how risky such moves are and this one is no different and how this cannot violate the data protection act is simply beyond me.\r\n\r\nThe data of citizens of the UK is private and should not now or ever be used by any government as a commodity.  This is after all the digital age, data is power and it's abuse is rampant opening this door will be a body blow to data security and privacy  throughout the UK.\r\n\r\nThis petition has one simple goal to stop this and any future attempt of the governments to sell data belonging to citizens of the UK.",
