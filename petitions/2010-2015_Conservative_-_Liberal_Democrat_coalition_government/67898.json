        "additional_details": "All people drawing a pension \u201cstate or private\u201d pay 20% tax on everything over \u00a310,000. After paying tax all our life I think it\u2019s an insult that pensioners should pay the same tax at retirement as they did when they were working. I therefore propose that tax on pensions should be reduced from 20% to10% on earnings over \u00a310,000 or the threshold raised from \u00a310,000 to \u00a320,000 before any tax is paid at all. Please vote for my petition. ",
