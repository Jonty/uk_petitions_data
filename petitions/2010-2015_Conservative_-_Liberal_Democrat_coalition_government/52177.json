        "additional_details": "The UK Government has announced that it supports the introduction of 'three person IVF' infertility treatment, whereby three DNA of three people is used to create a foetus;\r\n'Three person IVF' raises huge moral issues, as well as questions as to the parentage of any child born of the method - children who would be 'monitored for life', due to the uncertainty of the method. Dr David King, the director of Human Genetics Alert, said: \"These techniques are unnecessary and unsafe. It is a disaster that the decision to cross the line that will eventually lead to a eugenic designer baby market should be taken on the basis of an utterly biased and inadequate consultation.\"\r\nWe demand that the UK Government does NOT legalise 'Three person IVF' - no 'designer babies'.
