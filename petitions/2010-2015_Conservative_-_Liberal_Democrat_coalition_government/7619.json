        "additional_details": "The insane rioting that has taken place in Tottenham and various London Boroughs (which has now spread to other cities in the UK), has left hundreds of businesses destroyed, and scores of families seeking alternative accommodation, as their homes and possessions have been burned to the ground.\r\n\r\nGiven that the police has proven itself to be entirely incapable at protecting the people, we demand the right to bear arms, on our own private property only.\r\n\r\nIn practice, firearms will likely have to be registered, and certain checks put in place (ie this right is removed if you have a violent criminal record), but ordinary law-abiding citizens should have the right to protect their property and their family by any and all means necessary. This is one of the most basic rights imaginable, which has only been removed recently.",
