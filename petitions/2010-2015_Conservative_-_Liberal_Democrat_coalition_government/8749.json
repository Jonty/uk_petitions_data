        "additional_details": "There should be incentives for people using their cars less. Currently people are travelling further than necessary by car causing congestion, resulting pollution and road building.\r\n\r\nIncentives could include:\r\n1. Low mileage e.g. less than 6000miles per year qualifies for free road tax (proof could MOT cert for older cars, newer cars could get a mileage inspection at a MOT station)\r\n2. Moving closer to work could be rewarded by free stamp duty. The employer would need to validate that the employee's claim is valid and refund could possibly be administered by the employer similar to cycle to work or childcare vouchers\r\nRewarding people for driving less is a good for the environment. There are currently incentives for low emission cars, so why not have incentives for reducing emissions with currently existing cars?",
