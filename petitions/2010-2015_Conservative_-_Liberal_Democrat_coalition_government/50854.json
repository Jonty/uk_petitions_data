        "additional_details": "The Law on Elimination of Violence Against Women is a bill that bans domestic violence, child marriage, forced marriage, rape within a marriage and the exchanging of girls and women to settle disputes in Afghanistan. It was passed into law by presidential decree in 2009. It is being brought before parliament to cement it with a parliamentary vote to prevent its potential reversal by any future president who might be tempted to repeal it to satisfy hard-line religious parties.\r\nPlease sign this petition to gather awareness surrounding the poor status of women's rights in Afghanistan and to petition our foreign secretary, William Hague, to support the bill publicly.",
