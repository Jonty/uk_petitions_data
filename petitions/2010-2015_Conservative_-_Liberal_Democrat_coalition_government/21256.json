        "additional_details": "I call on the government to uphold a ban on all types of pornography including TV, magazines, mobile apps, books, movies and the internet. I also call on the government to uphold a ban on all types of glamour modelling and watershed media which includes the same media list as above. I call on this because it is this sort of media that is degrading humanity all around and is bringing out sexual immorality in people with more crime being committed, therefore I call for at 100,000 to sign this petition so we can campaign to get this law passed in Parliament.",
