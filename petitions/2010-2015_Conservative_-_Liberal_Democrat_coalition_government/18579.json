        "additional_details": "Since the 1960s schoolchildren have been taught the metric system, not to conform with an EU diktat, but because it's simpler and internationally recognised. They then have to learn the imperial system because some people feel we should retain measurements such as Fahrenheit (invented by a German) on patriotic grounds. So we're left with an odd mixture of both systems. But we got used to decimal money, and Australia, Canada (not in Europe) and Ireland have all successfully completed metrication without losing their national identities, so why can't we? ",
