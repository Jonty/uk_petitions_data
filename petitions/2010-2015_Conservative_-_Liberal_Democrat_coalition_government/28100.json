This is true but would be eroded if Luton actually became a competing city against London.\r\nLuton is a wonderful, important, multi-cultural, growing town. If given City Status it would become a small and inadequate city with relatively poor public facilities and infrastructure.\r\nBecause we love Luton we are not backing the bid for City status and we call on the government to support us.\r\n",
