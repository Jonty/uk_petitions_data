Cyclists however are at the most risk and from any age they can use the road without any training, cyclists are often wearing ipods and flount the rules of the roads e.g not stopping at traffic lights and riding on the kerb. I propose that all cyclists must undertake training and be insured before riding on the road to protect themselves and others",
