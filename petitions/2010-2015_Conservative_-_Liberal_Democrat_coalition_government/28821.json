        "additional_details": "On 31st January 2012, the Government announced it was cutting equine vocational qualifications from the school league tables.\r\n\r\nThe horse industry is worth \u00a34 billion, and organisations such as the British Horse Society, Association of British Riding Schools and the British Horse Racing Authority know these qualifications are the foundation of our industry and use practical and theory knowledge which is needed in the work place.\r\n\r\nTraining yards such as Bigland Hall Equestrian in Cumbria, could lose students if the schools won't offer the courses anymore, as it doesn't directly benefit them.\r\n\r\nWe want the Government to keep equine vocational qualifications in the school league tables, to allow all potential instructors, potential livery yard owners and even potential Olympic riders the chance to form the foundations of a career for themselves.
