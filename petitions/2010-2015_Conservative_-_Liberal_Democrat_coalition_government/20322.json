However, getting all relevant IP protection can be expensive and complicated, particular for smaller charities who need to focus efforts and funds on doing charitable work,\r\n\r\nThere are many ways protection could be automatically achieved, but at a minimum charities registered in the UK should be able to use of the charity name and any existing derivatives and mascots, regardless of any Trademarks they own or are subsequently registered by others.
