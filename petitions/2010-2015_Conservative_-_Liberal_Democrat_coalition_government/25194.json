(negotiable) index-linked, plus expenses as at present.\r\n\r\nHonourable Members, if they want to claim anything at all by way of salary or pension from the taxpayer, would be required only to make a simple declaration (on their honour) that their income falls short of \u00a340k by \u00a3x and that would be paid without question.\r\n\r\nThere should be a random audit and if it were found that a false claim had been made, he/she should be referred to the Committee on Standards.\r\n\r\nGovernment should introduce a Bill immediately to this effect, demonstrating parliament's commitment to sharing the burden of the current crisis.\r\n",
