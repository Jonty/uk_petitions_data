We work part time to ensure that we can actually live as well as study for degree that contribute to society and the economy by gaining work. Why is it that when a mistake is made, for example, the wrong tax code, that we have to suffer from it and wait 6 or more weeks for the issue to be resolved? Shouldn't we have the right to say when we need our money! After all, didn't we earn it?\r\n\r\nI want change:\r\n\r\n- Rights over rebate timing/schedules\r\n- Choice over cheque or bank\r\n",
