        "additional_details": "The state pension increases by the rate of inflation every year. If you have paid your full national insurance contributions in the UK and move to the USA in retirement you would still receive the equivalent UK pension and any increases due. This is not the case in Canada, a commonwealth country. Once you emigrate to Canada the pension payment stays the same as when you first emigrated. When you return to the UK for a visit the pension amount is increased to the current payment amount for the duration of your stay. When you return to Canada the pension reverts back to the original amount from when you first emigrated.\r\nSurely this is not just. The payments for all ex pats should be the same if the full national insurance contributions have been paid.",
