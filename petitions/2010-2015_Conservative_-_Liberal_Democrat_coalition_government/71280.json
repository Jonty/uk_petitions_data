        "additional_details": "Working people pay to subsidise the NHS, though we feel penalised, as we work full-time, therefore many of us have no free time to be able to attend GP appointments within these hours. Because there seems to be no provision for evening or weekend appointments, and with surgeries already over subscribed, working people have to take time off to see them.  If they are not allowed that time off, which is common, then they have no access to NHS treatment. This is extremely frustrating. All NHS GP Surgeries should be required to provide a GP on at least two weekday evenings and at least one day each weekend. In the case of larger practices, each GP should make themselves available one evening a week.  The common occurrence of not being able to make an appointment to see a GP within a two week period and being told to call back another day when they can start making appointments again is just not acceptable.",
