        "additional_details": "I believe that a \"Naturalist Day\" would extremely benefit the people of the United Kingdom. After watching many reality programs and documentaries about health issues and also the large group of young teenagers, who you can see have extremely low self esteem due to the media industry and the whole idea of \"perfection\" With this day as a national holiday, this can then give young people the chance to be around other people their age which would then help them to be more comfortable in their own skin and to realise everyone is different. Another excellent factor of this day would be that health issues that are taking over the United Kingdom could also be observed, this could make people aware of health issues that could eventually destroy their life. This is a perfect chance for the United Kingdom to come together and for everyone to be comfortable with each other. ",
