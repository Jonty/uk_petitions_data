The teachers may have a degree in their subject but this does not mean that they are able to teach. Communication is a huge deal between a teacher and a student if one cannot understand there is no expectation to learn. control and dicipline is another factor, some teachers cannot control their class and therefore not giving other students a chance in education.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading, I appreciate the time you have taken to do so.\r\n\r\n ",
