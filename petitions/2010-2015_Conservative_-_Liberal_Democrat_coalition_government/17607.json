The other suggestion relates to physical activity.The recommended time for playing sport should be doubled to 4 hours per week.\r\n Hopefully these proposals will make obesity levels go down. Also with children playing more sport it may increase thecompetitive nature of participants which will help them throughout their life. Children may also find they might start to enjoy sport more. In the UK 24.2% of the population are overwight or have diabetes problems and this is icreasing. I believe that by doing these things we can bring that down considerably.\r\n  ",
