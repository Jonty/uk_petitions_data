        "additional_details": "With the high rise in fuel prices hitting Britain, more and more UK drivers/commuters are looking for ways of getting around the problem of how they will afford filling up the tank.  However there does not seem to be any changes happening in the near future to benefit the public.  More emphasis needs to be in developing and securing ways of producing and storing hydrogen fuel for public use.  Not only will this beggin to help solve the ever growing climate change problem, it puts Britian on the map for pushing forward a much more ecological view on transport.  For the public this would mean a cheaper means of travel too.  I urge support for change, not only for our wallets but also for our world.",
