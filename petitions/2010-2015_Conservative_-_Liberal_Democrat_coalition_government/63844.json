        "additional_details": "This Government is using our National Insurance contributions to pay benefits for the masses of immigrants that are swamping this country. They have also increased our retirement age to pay immigrants. Beneftis have also been cut due to the same thing. I believe this money belongs to the British people and should remain our property with the Government being trustee's only. We should have a say in the way our money is being used. I think this applies for money that we pay for the NHS also and feel that our NHS is also being stolen from us.",
