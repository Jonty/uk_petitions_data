        "additional_details": "The BAC/Aerospatiale Concorde was a supersonic commercial airliner serving with British Airways and Air France between 1976 and 2003. The main reason for retirement was politics; hence why i'm trying to get it to fly again via politics. There are many reasons as to why she should fly again, including:\r\n\r\n- It's supersonic, thus it can 'skip' time zones, making flights a lot quicker. Businessmen/women can benefit largely from this.\r\n-It is an extremely popular with celebrities and aviation enthusiasts. People will pay lots of money to fly on this, consequently making profit, eventually.\r\n-Efficient way of making income.\r\n And many more reasons.\r\n\r\nWe need to Government to provide funding and awareness of this project.\r\n\r\nWhat we as citizens can do -\r\n\r\nDonate money.\r\n\r\nWhat I can do-\r\n\r\nMake enquirys about possible extra funding and components (Rolls Royce- Engines, and Maintenance).\r\n\r\nThank you, from a 14 year old  year old with a dream. To make her fly again!",
