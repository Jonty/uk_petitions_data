Bradford has one the highest car insurance in the country, most people seem to be starting 'Cash for Cash' as an easy way of getting some money into their pocket. A total of 118,500 bogus or exaggerated claims were detected last year and this figure is drastically going up. This is entirely the fault of Tony Blair's 'No win no fee'.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition in order to make the government stop 'No win No fee' for cheaper & affordable car insurances.\r\n\r\n",
