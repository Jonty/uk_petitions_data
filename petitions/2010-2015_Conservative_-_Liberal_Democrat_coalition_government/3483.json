Example, first burglary two weeks in correctional institution, 2nd burglary 6 weeks and so on. It's a criminal waste of valuable police time and unnecessary suffering for hoards of law abiding people when offenders come before the courts for their 20th, 30th, 40th offence. Clearly something isn't working with present levels of punishment. The menu should list what offences are covered (e.g. not capital crimes). Punishments could always be increased by the courts but there should be an expectation of a minimum result. This may even release court time for the more serious issues.",
