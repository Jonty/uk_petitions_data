        "additional_details": "To adopt a baby you have to meet certain requirements, age, a safe, caring home etc. why not have these requirements to own a dog, or at least dangerous dogs like pitbulls and rottweilers. It's a massive problem in the UK, teenage youths having big dangerous dogs and training them to be vicious.. no wonder there's always stories in the news about children being attacked by vicious dogs. Dogs are made vicious by their owners. Increasing the requirements to own a dog in the UK is not only fair on the animals but also makes the streets a lot safer and also makes teenage youths look and feel a lot less intimidating. ",
