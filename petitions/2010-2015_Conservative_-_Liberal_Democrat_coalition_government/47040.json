        "additional_details": "This petition is to raise awareness of the terrible state that Temple Cowley Pools is in, and how badly we need the plans for the new leisure centre in Blackbird Leys to be put into action. The City of Oxford Swimming Club deserve a decent pool with good facilities for the dedicated members to train in, that will not break down, unlike Temple Cowley Pools. Temple Cowley is unclean, and simply breaks down too often to be sufficient for its users.\r\nPlease sign this petition to put the plans for the new leisure centre in Blackbird Leys into action.",
