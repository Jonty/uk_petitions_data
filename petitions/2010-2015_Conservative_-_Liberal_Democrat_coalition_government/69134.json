        "additional_details": "The continued decline in natural phenomena,the failure to ensure our food is free of pollutants through adopting clean husbandry,the decades of bovine TB mismanagement,the placing of a property developer financier to CEO of NE,the denial of science and expertise are all symptomatic of ineptitude, abuse of functionality and partiality.Interferon testing for BTB first recorded in 1992 but denied by DEFRA for 20 years.Interferon testing 'discovered' by Owen Paterson in 2005 but not progressed. Decades of declining insects/birds/mammals indicates an environmental management defeat but this is an industry that justifies its existence through failure--a healthy environment does not require QUANGO's especially QUANGO's dedicated to upholding agendas rather than best practice and science.",
