By doing so they pose a security risk to the people around them and segregate themselves from society as they can not interact properly with other members of the community.\r\n    This would not just include preventing people from wearing the burqa but also balaclavas, scarfs warn around the lower half of the face combined with a hoodie as we have seen during the August 2011 riots as well as other garments and masks used to conceal the face.",
