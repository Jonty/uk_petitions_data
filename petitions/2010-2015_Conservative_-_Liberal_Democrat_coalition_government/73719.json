        "additional_details": "Leaseholds are a Medieval heritage which is unjust and only serves to make the gap between the rich and the working class wider. It is not fair to have to pay rents to people born within already privileged environments and social groups thus making them even more powerful and rich. If a new government really wants to become popular, they must make sure that Britain gets rid of such enormously big social inequality. ",
