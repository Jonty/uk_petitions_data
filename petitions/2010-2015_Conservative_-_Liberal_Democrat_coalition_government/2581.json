        "additional_details": "David Cameron has lead the most atrocious battle in history against our Country. He is ripping apart the fabric of our society through the demise of our healthcare, education and justice system. By reinventing the class system, he has shown that Britain is as unfair as ever.\r\n\r\nThese cuts are not needed, they are simply unnecessary. You don't buy a mortgage on your home and wish to pay it all back within 4 years. Whilst our spending must be controlled, the Prime Minister must accept that these cuts are both ideological and reckless.\r\n\r\nAlong with this, the Prime Minister cannot deny that he had no knowledge of the phone hacking saga. Through his links with Andy Coulson, himself and his front bench remained unscathed from the saga, whilst every other party suffered heavily. 'Dodgy Dave' fails to be transparent in his dealings with News International.\r\n\r\nThe boot stops at the top, David Cameron must resign immediately. ",
