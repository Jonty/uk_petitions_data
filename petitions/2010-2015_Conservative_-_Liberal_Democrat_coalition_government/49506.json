        "additional_details": "One of the dangers facing animals each year is accidental poisoning by antifreeze. An estimated 10,000 dogs and cats are poisoned annually from just a few licks. Animals do not have to drink much antifreeze to suffer from the poison or antifreeze toxicity.  Wildlife suffers from antifreeze poisoning too. Ethylene glycol antifreeze that has been spilled, leaked, or carelessly disposed of is responsible for the needless suffering and death of all types of animals. We would like the Government to insist that a bitter agent be added to antifreeze to deter its ingestion by all animals.",
