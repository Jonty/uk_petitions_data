        "additional_details": "There is a real need for mandatory training about mental health for all HR staff, senior staff, managers and directors in every single workplace in the UK. A lack of understanding about mental health is unacceptable, especially when 1 in 4 of us will experience some form of mental health illness in our lives, and workplaces are still being so ignorant about it. It has to be mandatory; there are so many employees keeping silent about their mental health illnesses because they are afraid of being judged, stigmatised and/or losing their jobs as a result of disclosure; so there's bound to be thousands, if not millions of people silently suffering in workplaces up and down the country. The training has to be REAL. The training needs to show and educate workplaces what it's REALLY like for an employee, with a mental illness, to struggle in a work environment.",
