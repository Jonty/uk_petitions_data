This System is depreciating the value of A-Level grades. It should be a simple case of, If you don't get the grades, You don't go to uni! Allowing failing student to go to university is resulting in a generation of students who will leave university with unneccassary\r\ndebt, as well as increasing the national debt due to these guaranteed loans. Clearing should be scrapped in order to save our education budget and preserve the value of our educational awards.",
