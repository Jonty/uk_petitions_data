        "additional_details": "Mobile service providers should not pay unsolicited subscription fees on behalf of customers without informing customers of this new charge. Currently service providers are paying customer charges to companies who provide services the customer is unaware they are even subscribed to. The mobile service providers then charge the customer by increasing their monthly mobile bill. This means the charge is hidden from the customer who simply see their monthly mobile phone bill increase with no explanation.\r\n\r\nThere should be an investigation into whether the mobile service providers are profiting from this situation. Charges of typically \u00a34.50 a week add up rapidly over several weeks.\r\n\r\nIf a customer is found never to have used the service they should be entitled to a full or partial refund.\r\n\r\nThe government such examine legislation on this matter as it needs updating.\r\n",
