        "additional_details": "11.9 million people are still in areas which have speeds of less than 2 megabits per second even after BT's Fibre To The Cabinet (your local telephone exchange) Has been fully upgraded. If you were to take an approximate of 40% of the population where over 18 and had 100 megabits per second the average tax revenue would be \u00a3350 per person  though products and services then the annual tax revenue would be \u00a31.638 Billion; it would make common sense to upgrade everyone to superfast broadband no matter where they are with the use of wireless networks instead of mobile phone networks that are currently struggling and fixed line broadband. If it cost \u00a315 BN to build then the payoff time with a 100 megabit connection would be 9 years and 3 months, but this excludes savings to other Government Departments by having submit information websites & NHS Benifits.\r\nSign this petition to get faster broadband for all of us and help enable rural entrepreneurs.\r\n",
