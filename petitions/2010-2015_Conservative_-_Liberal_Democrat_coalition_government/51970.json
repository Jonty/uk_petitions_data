I have just returned from a holiday in Germany, driving from Berlin to Bavaria, and their autobahns are literally lined with trees and forests for the length of the country.\r\n\r\nIt needs no detailed scientific explanation of the clear benefits- stable soil, C02 absorption, noise reduction and a more pleasant drive. We need a program to replant trees on the motorways for the future benefit of drivers and biodiversity. There would be literally thousands of volunteers available for such a project nationwide.\r\n\r\nWho's with me! We can't let the Germans win!",
