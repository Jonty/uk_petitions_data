        "additional_details": "Background:\r\n\r\nIn October 2014 a petition closed with 124,495 signatures.  It was titled \u201cEnd the conflict in Palestine\u201d and \u201caimed to ensure that the government is doing all it can to help address the problems between Israel and Palestine\u201d.  The government duly considered this petition and there was a debate in Parliament.  A vote also took place that same month, where 274 MPs voted to recognise a Palestinian State, with 12 MPs voting against.\r\n\r\nDespite the vote, the overall Government\u2019s policy on recognising Palestine has not changed.  The Government states that it will recognise Palestine at the time when it is most beneficial to the peace process.  We believe that time is now, and call for the recognition of Palestine to begin in 2015.\r\n\r\nWe call for the British Government to begin the process of officially recognising Palestine, and make the necessary Act or Acts of Parliament to change official policy by the end of 2015.\r\n",
