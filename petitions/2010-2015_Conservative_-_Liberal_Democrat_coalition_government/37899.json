        "action": "Remove the elitist Michael Gove from office",
        "additional_details": "Since Michael Gove was appointed as education minister in the cabinet, he has pursued elitist policies that have only created greater inequality in our country. It is clear that he is only concerned with academia and sees any other path, such as vocational courses as inferior. This must be stopped, as it is installing in our children today that if you don't go to university that you are worthless, additionally, his concentration on the superiority of  traditional  subjects is completely narrow-minded and shows his true elitist nature, not everyone excels at modern foreign languages or the sciences, and to say that those who take the arts are not taking the 'hard' subjects is detrimental to all the hard work our students put into their A-levels and GCSE's. It seems  Gove who has experienced private school education and Oxbridge is completely out of touch, blinded by his own academic superiority and privileges that leave him unable to understand.",
