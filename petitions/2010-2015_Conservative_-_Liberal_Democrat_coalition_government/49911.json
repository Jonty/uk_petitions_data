This all violence is controlled by MQM's founder and leader Mr Iltaf Hussain who is a British Citizen from his headquarter in London. Through this petition, I would like UK Government to play its role to stop these inhuman activities by MQM especially stopping Mr Hussain addressing to people in the Pakistan over the video link.  If Mr Hussain wishes to involve in Pakistan Politics he should do so by going back to Pakistan and not from UK.\r\n\r\n",
