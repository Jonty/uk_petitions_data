Why?\r\n\r\nWe aim to become self-funding through sound business like most economies- we are not a charity\r\n\r\nThe Government at this time should be the ones to invest at least just once and that once is now by giving us our pound.. per head.. per child..\r\n\r\nwww.youthparliament.co.uk\r\nNew NAYPIC/Youth Parliament",
