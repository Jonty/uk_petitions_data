        "additional_details": "The suggestion by Michael Gove that the activities of Mary Seacole during the Crimean War should not be taught in British Schools denies all children the opportunity to celebrate her bravery. The daughter of a doctor, she was trained in medicine and practised for years in Jamaica, although she couldn't qualify as a doctor due to her race and sex. Despite discouragement from the British establishment, again because of  her gender and her race,  Mary Seacole paid her own way to travel from Jamaica to the Crimea; she worked in the battlefields to save the lives of British soldiers and set up 'clubs' to provide crucial support to our forces. She was revered by the troops at all levels and played a crucial role in the history  of the UK. She represents the best of humanity. An immense role model for women and for black people; the history of this amazing woman should be taught to all children. ",
