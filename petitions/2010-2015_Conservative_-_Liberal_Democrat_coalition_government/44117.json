With birth rates rising to ridiculous figures it is not only putting a huge strain on the NHS but, overcrowding the country resulting in more and more houses being built everywhere in the UK.\r\nGovernment should not be going along with this rise in population, BUT be thinking of ways to reduce it.\r\n",
