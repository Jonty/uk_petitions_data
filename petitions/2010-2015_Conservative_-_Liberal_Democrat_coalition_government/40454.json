Remember the glorious state of ruling so many lands? Where is the British Empire which used to be so great, so admirable, so marvelous and so prestigious?\r\n\r\nCan you see how the Uyghur, the Great Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Canton, etc. people are living now? They are living under the most brutal, illegal and horrible rule of the Chinese Communist Party. If the Great Britain lost its strong military strengths over China, how can it defend itself against China, and help to liberate Uyghur and Great Tibet, etc. from the devil\u2019s claws? The splitting of Scotland from England will have a \u201cde- synergy\u201d effect, causing the military powers much weakened in the British Empire.\r\n\r\nIt is urgent and necessary that you ban the so-called \u201creferendum\u201d on Scottish independence, which must be ceased at all costs!!!
