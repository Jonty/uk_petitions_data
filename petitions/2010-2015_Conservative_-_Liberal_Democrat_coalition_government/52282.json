        "additional_details": "David Cameron is to bring forward legislation in the autumn to recognise marriage in the tax system.\r\n\r\nWhy should a single, divorced or widowed person pay more tax than someone who is married? Would \u00a3150 a year persuade unhappy couples to stay together or encourage people to get married in the first place?\r\n\r\nWe want a Fairer Society. This is not fair! It is going back to a nanny state telling people how they should live their lives. It is a complete waste of taxpayers money. Why should unmarried people fund those who are married?\r\n\r\nWe must reject these proposals and not discriminate against people just because they are not married. ",
