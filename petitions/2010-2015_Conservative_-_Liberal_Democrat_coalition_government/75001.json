        "additional_details": "\r\nThe mini section of the VOG Football League brings together over 1,200 children every week to play the game, these kids are able to take part and have fun. Organisers, coaches and volunteers have grown the numbers playing mini football in the Vale. Without the facilities, this can't be sustained. To create a level playing field, we need level playing fields. The Vale of Glamorgan Council has over \u00a3500,000 to spend on new facilities at jenner park.A feasibility study has been carried out - and will soon be made public - which has looked into allocating all of that money to build a 3G pitch at Jenner Park.Time demands on Jenner Park from certain users of this facility would leave grass roots clubs no time on the surface .The money should be used to provide 3G pitches in a place where the footballing community in the Vale can take the most advantage. We believe mini football in the Vale should see the benefit of this money and a 3G pitch should be built in Colcot.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
