        "additional_details": "Please take a moment to sign this petition against Gumtree advertising ANY animals as \"free to a good home\". In this sad and disgusting time, you cannot guarantee poor defenceless animals are SOLD to a home where they will be cared for properly - let alone if they have been given away free. In a time where animals are being stolen for bait or these horrible people pick up pets for free, WHY is Gumtree enabling this practice?! Gumtree should at the very least ensure they are not passed on to a cruel fate. This needs to STOP NOW. ",
