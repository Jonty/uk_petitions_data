        "additional_details": "We are calling on our Government to request and defend the basic right to humane treatment for animals in Romania. There is a huge problem concerning stray and abandoned animals, mainly dogs, and they are abused, tortured, imprisoned and left to die of starvation rather than the Government dealing humanely with the problem. We as British citizens find this treatment of companion animals unacceptable from an EU country which should be adhering to EU standards.",
