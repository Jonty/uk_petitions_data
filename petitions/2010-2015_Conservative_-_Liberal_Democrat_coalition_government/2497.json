        "additional_details": "As a matter of urgent animal, pet and wildlife welfare, to ban the sale of fireworks to any except licenced event organisers. Fireworks are now on sale widely throughout the year and are more powerful and noisy than ever before. This causes demonstrable stress and even injury to domestic animals, pets and wildlife. Fireworks are also used to torture and torment both animals and humans alike. They can be enjoyed as much if not more when used in organised and regulated displays than when used individually, hence there is no justification for their sale to private individuals.",
