It was built in the 1980s to cater for 20K patients a year but currently being used by 73K patients.\r\n\r\nMilton Keynes has been rapidly expanding and there is a major Western expansion planned which includes 6.5K new homes. The health service as well as the infrastructure has to be adjusted to cope with the growing population. Failure to do so will mean health of the citizens might be at risks.\r\n",
