        "additional_details": "Travellers are often forced into living in illegal sites because there aren't any legal places for them to stay. We call for the government to change the law so that travellers can be evicted only if the council have made sufficient provision for them to move elsewhere legally. This would reduce the number of illegal sites and make life a lot easier for travellers and non-travellers alike.",
