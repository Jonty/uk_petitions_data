        "additional_details": "what i want is simple. Stop giving criminals new identities. In england it is felt by much of the public that to much time, effort and money is spent looking after the criminals. Criminals should have to live with what they have done just as the victims and their families have to. It is felt by many vicitms of crime that by giving criminals new identities that the state seeks to protect the criminals while having failed the vicitms. English justice should be there to protect the innocent and not the guilty. Then and only then will victims actually feel like justice has been done.",
