        "additional_details": "Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary wants to reduce his flight staff to one pilot per flight saying it will potentially reduce flight costs by \u00a310 per person, advertising this in September 2012, his tag line being \" Trains don\u2019t need 2 drivers, why do planes?\"\r\n\r\nO\u2019Leary, when a train has to STOP due to an absence of driver the train STOPS (it\u2019s called a dead man\u2019s switch), when a plane STOPS without a pilot it DROPS !!!!!\r\n\r\n \u00a310 is not an amount I would equate with significantly reducing my life expectancy whenever I step on a Ryanair flight.\r\n\r\nPlease sign up to this petition to stop O'Leary from further endangering our lives and those around us and strive to ensure our safety in the air is not ridiculed by an unnecessary cost cutting exercise.\r\n",
