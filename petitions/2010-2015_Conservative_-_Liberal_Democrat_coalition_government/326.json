        "additional_details": "I think it would be advisable for Prime minister David Cameron to step down from his position and let someone else take his stead.\r\nThe reasons are that for starters he only got in by default as the Liberal Democrats joined with the Conservatives, and if they hadn't it would have been a hung parliment.\r\nAlso he has introduced a number of policies that have damaged this country in the name of cutting the deficit when there are several alternatives that would be more beneficial to the welfare of this country.\r\nHe seems to be out to benefit the wealthy class and doesn't give the lower classes a second glance.",
