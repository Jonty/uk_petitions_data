        "additional_details": "I believe that a pet licence would cut down on acts of cruelty , dog attacks and wasted police time. If anyone who wanted to own a pet had to pay only \u00a35.00 it would provide a huge amount of revenue and enable the government to police this concern. How often do we hear about cruelty to animals or dogs attacking people , if pets were only sold to licenced people this could be cut drastically. The RSPCA are funded through donation and in these current times people are reluctant to part with there money , and even then they lack the authority to deal with these cases. With this petition you can create jobs and more importantly deal with the unexplained rise in acts of cruelty to animals. You can even help stop the increase in dog attacks as most of these stem from irresponsible owners who should never be allowed to own a dog or have owned dogs and not been caught.",
