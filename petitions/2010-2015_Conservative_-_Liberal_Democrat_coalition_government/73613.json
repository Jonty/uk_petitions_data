        "additional_details": "If you have worked in Britain and another country, providing you have paid contributions, you are entitled to a State Pension from both countries. If you remain in the Foreign Country on your retirement, you could be liable for Health Insurance Contributions on your Local pension and also your British Pension. If the same was to happen to a National of that country and he came to live and work in Britain and retired here, he would have to pay nothing from his Pension for Health Care. This is grossly unfair and should be stopped. If the \"Foreigner\" doesn\u00b4t have to pay in Britain, then the British shouldn\u00b4t have to pay abroad. This affects thousands, if not millions, of British Pensioners overseas.  ",
