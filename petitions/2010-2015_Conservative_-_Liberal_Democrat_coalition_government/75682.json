The investigation by the BBC is trying to uncover details of something that occurs everyday between average people who can shake hands and move on.  I would like the house to instruct the BBC to reinstate him, and satisfy the hundreds of thousands of people who are already calling for him to return to his previous position and bring a presenter who is not afraid to speak his mind back to our television screens.
