        "additional_details": "We are calling on the Secretary of State for Transport, to launch an independent review of the UK Blue Badge Scheme, with regards the failures DfT has made with the scheme.\r\nWith regards not having a central data base, of all Blue Badge issued & to whom, which would stop Badge Fraud too. Also allowing local councils to control the issuing of Badges, or deciding who is or who is not entitled to a Badge, instead of DfT being the issuing office.\r\nWhich is leading to disabled drivers & passengers, who are holder\u2019s of Blue Badges, to be subjected to disabled discrimination & financial abuse too. With regards London Congestion Charges or Congestion Fines, Registration Badge Fee\u2019s, Parking Charges, or charges for toll bridges, tunnel & roads too.\r\nBefore the 2012 Games/Para Games, because Blue Badge holders from around the world & not just the UK will be discriminated & financial abused by others, if DfT does not act on this issue now, as UK Badge holders are already being abused.\r\n",
