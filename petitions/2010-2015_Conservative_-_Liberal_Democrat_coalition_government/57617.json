        "additional_details": "The practice of dumping raw toilet waste from trains onto the tracks, particularly when it happens in stations, is disgusting and should be stopped. To achieve this, the train operating companies should be instructed by the Government to make the necessary changes to their rolling stock immediately.  This practice pollutes our environment, encourages pests, means someone (in some locations) has to clear it up, and it shames a modern society - in 2013 it is inexcusable.",
