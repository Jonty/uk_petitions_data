        "additional_details": "The transfer of power is a critical issue in Africa. Recently, several countries have imploded and descended into chaos and violence when their leaders refused to step down or accept electoral defeat. The recent elections in Ghana have generated such controversy with the largest opposition party taking the matter to the Supreme Court. We Ghanaians in UK petition the British Government to support the petition at the Ghanaian Supreme Court challenging the results of the December 2012 elections by the following actions:\r\n\u2022 present representatives to observe the court process and encourage law and order to continue to take hold in Ghana\r\n\u2022 support the outcome that produces justice and ultimately lasting peace and stability in Ghana and avoid any actions that will put Ghana's peace in jeopardy.\r\n\u2022 support the path taken by Petitioners in the court process, since  this ensures lasting peace for Ghana",
