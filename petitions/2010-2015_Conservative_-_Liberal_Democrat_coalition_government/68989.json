        "additional_details": "Holodomor was an orchestrated famine in the Ukrainian SSR from 1932-1933 which killed an estimated 2.5 million Ukrainians. This is despite there being sufficient food in the Soviet Union as well as the country being offered aid by outside sources. This amounts to a genocide against the Ukrainian people. This is even more relevant today as Russia is still violating Ukrainian sovereignty and killing the Ukrainian people.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government of the United Kingdom to recognize this barbaric act as genocide and to condemn the actions of the authorities of the time which allowed this to happen.",
