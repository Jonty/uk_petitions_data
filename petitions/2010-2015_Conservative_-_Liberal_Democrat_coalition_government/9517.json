        "additional_details": "This has three main benifits:\r\n\r\n1. Morally\r\nIt will make Colombia a safer and therefore happier place. This is a right that every human being should have.\r\n\r\n2. Finacially\r\nThis will help their emerging economy to grow, something we should associate our country with to create trade as they get richer. Since the guerrila movements make money through the production of drugs, by eliminating them we will reduce the drug problem within our country. This means we would spend less money on fighting the drugs trade and assisting with drug users from quitting.\r\n\r\n3. Politically\r\nThis will show the world we still have one of the most powerful armed forces on the planet. The USA have so far failed in \"Plan Colombia\" so it would make a big statement if we could succeed where they failed. It will also show the world, who tend to think of us as a colonial power, that we care about other people and are willing to fight for the freedom of others.",
