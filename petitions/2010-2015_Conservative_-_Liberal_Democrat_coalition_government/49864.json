        "additional_details": "Smoking cigarettes on television normalises the habit.  It makes it seem to adults and children that it is acceptable.  For example in soap operas characters smoke regularly but rarely are the health effects illustrated.  Showing actors smoking on television is not necessary.\r\n\r\nThere is no benefit to actors smoking on television.  So many illnesses can be caused or made worse by smoking.  If smoking is banned on television people will be less inclined to think smoking is ok or normal.\r\n\r\n",
