It happened a lot just after the Normandy landings. The difference in this case is that it was captured on video.\r\n\r\nIn the heat of battle, soldiers kill each other. The line between what is appropriate and what isn\u2019t is wide and blurred. This marine did something wrong, and had it happened in an English town, it would be murder. But this was NOT England. If this had happened to a civilian it would be murder, but this was NOT a civilian, it was an insurgent / terrorist.\r\n\r\nIt happened in Afghan in the middle of a military operation that involved shooting and killing the enemy Marine \u2018A\u2019 had it right, when he said he \u2018breached the Geneva Convention\u2019\u2026..and that is what he should be punished for, NOT murder..",
