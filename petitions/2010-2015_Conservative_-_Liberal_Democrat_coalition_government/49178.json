        "additional_details": "Scotland will decide in 2014 whether to remain a member of the United Kingdom or become an independant country.  It seems right and proper that only those living in Scotland make this choice.\r\n\r\nOne significant outstanding question is what currency an independant Scotland will use and at the current time the Scottish National Party wishes to retain the British Pound.\r\n\r\nHaving seen the impact of a poorly implemented currency union in Europe over the last few years, there are significant risks to the UK economy if proper controls are not implemented.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned request that the remaining UK population are consulted via a referendum prior to entering into any currency union with an independant Scotland.",
