        "additional_details": "This petition represents the majority of opinions held by students and teachers during the demonstrations. The act should be repealed in favour of a fairer act which will primarily have better rules concerning the universities maximum fee of \u00a39,000 per year, to ensure that the quality of the University and ranking is in accordance with the amount it is charging at the very least. At the moment a few of the lower ranked Universities are still charging the full price (eg London South Bank and Middlesex). Secondly this petition calls for better funding for students who cannot afford to attend university without the fees which are also being cut (eg the reduction in EMA). This makes it more difficult for students to afford the cost of living let alone considering university",
