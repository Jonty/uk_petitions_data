In no way is 15 months a reflection of his crimes that he has pleaded guilty to.  His victims have been brave enough to come forward and highlight that this man is a threat to children but our justice system has shown no respect to them.  To be given just over one month in prison for sexually abusing a child is sending out the wrong message and is as good as saying that this type of crime is acceptable.",

If you believe a sentence given in a Crown Court appears to be very low, or unduly lenient, anyone can contact the Attorney General's office asking for the sentence to be reviewed as long as it is within 28 days of sentencing.\r\n\r\nIt also only takes one person to make such a request. In the case of Stuart Hall, the Attorney General\u2019s Office has already requested the papers from the Crown Prosecution so one of the Law Officers can decide whether or not to refer the sentences to Court of Appeal as being unduly lenient."
