There are a large number of empty units both within the town centre and two exsiting out of town 'home based' retail parks. Worcester has no need for yet another development when the latest still remains half empty with many large units unoccupied.\r\n\r\nMany Worcester residents have raised concerns regarding -\r\n-increased traffic to the area surrounding the hospital and residential areas\r\n-There is already lack of parking for offices within the area of the proposed site\r\n-loss of green land\r\n-final nail in the coffin for the town centre\r\n-unnecessary considering the ammount of exsisiting unoccupied units that would be suitable for development\r\n\r\nPlease sign and share!\r\n",
