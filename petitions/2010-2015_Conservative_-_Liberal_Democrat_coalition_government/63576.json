        "additional_details": "In view of the continuing abuse of the expenses payable to MP's we demand that the government incorporates in the forthcoming Queen's Speech a Bill detailing the eligibility of MPs Expenses and makes it a criminal offence to falsely claim monies and that all expenses are subject to approval by the independent commissioner responsible for parliamentary standards with no appeal to a committee of MPs. This Bill must be enacted before the next general election and before MP's salaries are increased. MPs office cost must be standardised and a fixed payment be made for all MPs with a constituency that is more than 90 minutes travelling time from Parliament to cover travelling and second home rental costs. Capital gains on second homes supported by expenses must be subject to taxation equal to at least twice the support received plus interest.",
