        "additional_details": "Prince Harry is an unmarried young man, he was committing no crime, nor was he involved in any public duties. He was just a young man having fun, and doing what most young men would love to do.\r\n\r\nMost people have at times participated in wild but legal activities, and no body should have their lives so public paraded for the profits of a newspaper.\r\n\r\nThe Suns motivations were not in the public interest, they have humiliated a dedicated soldier and excellent public servant for their own gains.\r\n\r\nI would not portray myself a royalist, however I do appreciate the hard work of Prince Harry. The Sun should be forced to print a very public front page apology!",
