        "additional_details": "There are a vast amount of UK businesses who create nuisance, automated and silent calls which would be illegal if called from a UK telephone number.  They get around it by having the call routed from abroad where the number is also not shown to allow you to complain.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to pass legislation to mark such actions illegal.  At the very least the telephone number should be displayed and mechanisms created to permit householders to block such numbers.",
