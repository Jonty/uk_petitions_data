        "additional_details": "The consultation paper as it stands effects wholesale change to the taxi and private hire trades when only a tightening up of both trades is required. It is a sledgehammer to crack a nut.\r\n\r\nThe benefits it creates do not outweigh the damage and harm it causes socially, environmentally and financially.\r\n\r\nWhilst I believe the Law Commission means well, I do not believe they have the understanding or knowledge of the trades to make informed recommendations and decisions.\r\n\r\nI therefore respectfully ask the House to debate this issue forthwith.",
