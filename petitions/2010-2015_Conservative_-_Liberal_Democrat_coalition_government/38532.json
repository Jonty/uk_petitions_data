That is why the government does not interfere in what a newspaper or magazine chooses to publish. However, with this freedom comes great responsibility.\r\n\r\nNewspapers must, of course, abide by the law, but they also sign up to a Code of Practice, overseen by the independent Press Complaints Commission (PCC). The Editor's Code of Practice sets a benchmark for the standards the press is expected to maintain.\r\n\r\nIf you would like any more information on the PCC and the Editors\u2019 Code of Practice, it can be found on the PCC\u2019s website at: http://www.pcc.org.uk."
