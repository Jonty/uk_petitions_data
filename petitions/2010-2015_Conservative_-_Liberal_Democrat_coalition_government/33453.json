        "additional_details": "When tax relief is allowed on charitable donations it means that the subsequent tax shortfall must be made good by other taxpayers.  This means that taxpayers are subsidising these charitable donations.\r\n\r\nTax revenue should be used for funding public services and should be publicly accountable.  The decisions regarding the spending of tax revenue should be made by elected ministers.  The system of tax relief on charitable donations means that, in effect, donors choose how some of their tax is spent, and the richer the donor the more choice they have.\r\n\r\nIf tax relief on all charitable donations is ended it need not reduce the amount of money donated to charities - it will just mean that donors will give only their own money, not that of the public at large.\r\n\r\nLet's end tax relief on charitable donations.",
