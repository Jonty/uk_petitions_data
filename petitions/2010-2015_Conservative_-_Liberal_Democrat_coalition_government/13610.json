        "additional_details": "The government should create a National Guard (NG) as a defence against civil disturbance.   The NG's purpose will be to bridge the gap between the police and the army.   The NG will be composed of local volunteers - private business people, family men, anyone wishing to stand up for their community against rioters.   As volunteers they will receive no wages.    The NG will receive military-type training, will be uniformed (especially riot uniforms:  helmets, shields etc) and will be armed, eg with rifles firing baton rounds, truncheons, and water cannon.   The NG will be based in areas with a history of riots.   They will be capable of being put on stand-by at short notice, and also will be sufficiently flexible to be bussed to other areas where they are needed.   The specific purpose of the national government will be to bring the National Guard into being, to provide the military training, and to pay expenses, eg equipment, premises, professional advice and training.",
