There are sufficient free to view channels for there to be adequate completion and also not everyone can afford to pay subscriptions. This would enable the vast majority of citizens to watch sport played at the highest level and encourage players of those sports to aspire to that level. It would also help to restore pride in a wide range of national sports and in the sporting figures that have become lesser known national heroes because only a relatively small number of people get to see them..\r\n\r\n",
