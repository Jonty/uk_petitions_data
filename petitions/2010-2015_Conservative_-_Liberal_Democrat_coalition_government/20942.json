        "additional_details": "I propose a tax on unhealthy snack foods you may purchase in a supermarket (Pies, sausage rolls, burgers) which are normally relatively inexpensive. The revenue from this could be used to subsidise healthier alternatives (sushi, salads, fruit salads) which are normally more expensive thus making them a more atractive option especially to people on low income.",
