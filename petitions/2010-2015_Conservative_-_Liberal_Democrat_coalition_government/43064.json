        "additional_details": "Currently Doctors can earn additional money from the death of patients. They have the responsibility of signing documents confirming the death of a person on the back of which they earn money. It has become a practice that has reportedly seen Doctors earn approximately \u00a315m. The practice is known as \"Ash Cash\".\r\n\r\nNurses do not benefit or earn money from the death of another. As care givers it seems questionable, immoral and unethical to think Doctors can. Such practices clearly bring the profession into disripute.\r\n\r\nThe Government must ensure that such practices are not possible and any medical practitioner should be disciplined by the General Medical Council for which temporary suspension from practice should be the sanction.",
