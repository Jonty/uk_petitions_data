        "additional_details": "Sulky racing is a dangerous, cruel and unnecessary activity. It poses a great risk to car drivers on the roads, horses themselves and those driving the carts. Each year, both people and animals get seriously hurt. Horses are left to die on the side of roads, and innocent people are injured. This so called 'sport' is unregulated and dangerous and should be banned. ",
