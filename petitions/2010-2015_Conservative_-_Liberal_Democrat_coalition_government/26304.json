        "additional_details": "I would like to see the right of any illegal immigrant lose their right to confirm whether they are illegal as there are too many people coming to the UK committing murder so that they can be imprisoned for many years as they dont want to go home. Anyone who cannot produce visas to be here for any reason should automatically lose their right to stay. This would take pressure of the taxpayers, police and court time in arguments relating to their stay in the country. The victim's rights should come first, not the immigrants.",
