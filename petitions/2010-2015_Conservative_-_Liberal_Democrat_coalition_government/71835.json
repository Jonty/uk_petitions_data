        "additional_details": "The Royal British Legion (Scotland) has changed its trading name to Legion Scotland and removed the Royal Crest from the logo.  This is an idea conceived to react to, and fuel a perceived anti British sentiment in Scotland.  The Royal British Legion and the Royal British Legion (Scotland) are vital organisations in support of our Armed Forces.  This name change does not reflect the commitment made by servicemen and women who have been proud to serve the United Kingdom of Great Britain.  This name change is more fuel for Scots intent on breaking up the United Kingdom which makes a mockery of the commitment made to the United Kingdom by Scottish men and women.",
