Because of this and the imbalance of power that exists between them and their park operators they are in a very vulnerable position.\r\n\r\nMobile home owners, chalet owners and landlords\u2019 tenants all have specific legal protection. It is time for this to be recognised as an entitlement for static holiday caravan owners.",
