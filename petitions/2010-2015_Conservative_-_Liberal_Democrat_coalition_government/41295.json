        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call for the immediate disqualification of the elected representative for Mid Bedfordshire, Nadine Dorries, from her current and all future parliamentary positions, due to her participation in the television program \"I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here\". Nadine Dorries is the elected representative of the people of Mid Bedfordshire, as such she should be present in the UK and in the Commons, representing her Constituents, which is what she was elected to do and which is what she is paid to do. She should not be abandoning her Constituents and her duties to appear in a television program that requires her absence from the UK, and from her duties to her Constituents, for an extended period of time. Further, her lack of judgement in this matter, along with her lack of consideration for her Constituents, shows that she is totally unsuited to the high responsibility and moral standards required of public office.",
