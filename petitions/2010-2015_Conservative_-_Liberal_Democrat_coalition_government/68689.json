This is unfair and unjustified due to the fact that blazers have nothing to do with the way children are educated. Freedom to wear what they like will ensure that pupils are more focused on lessons and have a better attitude towards education.\r\nI want to stop schools from forcing pupils to wear uniforms.\r\n",
