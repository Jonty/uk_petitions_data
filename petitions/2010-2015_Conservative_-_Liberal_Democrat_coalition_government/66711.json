        "additional_details": "Coventry Haven NEEDS saving from being closed due to the local women's services funding being reallocated.\r\nCoventry Haven and provides more than 1000 children and 800 women with essential help, support, counselling, a place of safety, financial advice and a sympathetic ear to listen to through times of emergency always. Coventry NEEDS this vital life line and without it, hundreds of vulnerable women and children will be at risk and live in fear knowing they are trapped\r\nDomestic abuse affects 1 in 3 women in Coventry and with Coventry being the worst in the West Midlands. This all women's charity NEEDS to be saved.\r\nThe service offers support in 18 different languages and is independent from police and social care.\r\nThe money that Haven desperately needed has been reallocated to go to the ABUSERS and creating an Interactive website which is supposed to help women. It won't.\r\nWe want the government to force the local council to provide this vital charity with regular funding. ",
