This Bill must:-\r\n\r\n*Strip them of all assets, real, portable and monetary.\r\n*Deprive them of all pensions and benefits, including provisions for partners, spouses and children.\r\n*Remove any honours previously awarded.\r\n\r\nWe also demand that 100% of the money raised by this penal measure be used to help homeless people of good character into accommodation.",
