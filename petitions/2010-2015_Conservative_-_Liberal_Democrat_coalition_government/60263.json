        "additional_details": "In light of the dropping of Kevin Pietersen from the England cricket team, we ask for more public accountability from the selectors of national sports teams. Arguably the most exciting and naturally gifted batsman of his generation has been dropped, near his prime, by a quango of cricket selectors and administrators. But the decision was taken behind closed doors and no public justification has been given. Fans want the truth. We call for proper public accountability from such officials, to ensure that the most important decisions are transparent to the nation's sports fans.",
