        "additional_details": "Through out the whole of wales council tax is rising yet again. Not only is it rising but its going up higher than the rate of inflation. While Council tax increases, wages do not rise at the same rate, putting pressure on low income families. We who sign this petition are asking that council tax should only be able to be risen at the same rate of inflation. This would help all families in wales cope with the cost of rising bills and a devalued wage. ",
