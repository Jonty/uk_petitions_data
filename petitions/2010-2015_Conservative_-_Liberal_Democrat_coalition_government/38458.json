        "additional_details": "The present arrangements, by statute, allow senior citizens and certain other groups free travel on local buses during off-peak periods, Mondays to Fridays, and all day at weekends.\r\nMany local authorities only provide the minimum required by staute (i.e., only for buses, and not for other forms of public transport such as trains).\r\nThis Petition calls for all defined and deserving groups, including Senior Citizens, the Disabled, the Unemployed and Students, to have:\r\n(1) free local travel on buses, trams, trains and metros;\r\n(2) reduced rate national travel on trains, and long distance buses and coaches (e.g. half-fare travel);\r\n(3) travel to be permitted throughout and within all the nations of the United Kingdom (i.e. England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland) - this would also promote links between the nations of the United Kingdom ",
