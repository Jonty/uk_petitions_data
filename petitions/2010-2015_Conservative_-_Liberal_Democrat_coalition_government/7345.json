Opportunism has led to countless thousands of pounds worth of property being stolen or destroyed, and people are losing their homes and businesses. All for nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Martial law is the imposition of military rule by military authorities over designated regions on an emergency basis\u2014usually only temporary\u2014when the civilian government or civilian authorities fail to function effectively (e.g., maintain order and security, and provide essential services), when there are extensive riots and protests, or when the disobedience of the law becomes widespread\"\r\n\r\nDespite the bravery of the Met Police, order is yet to be restored. Our best is not enough, and it is high time the government realise they are powerless.",
