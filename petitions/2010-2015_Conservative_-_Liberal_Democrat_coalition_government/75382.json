        "additional_details": "UK Mobile network carriers are deliberately upgrading customers to 4G masts who already have working 3G masts, consequently they are failing to care adequately or fairly for existing customers who have lower grade, and much older  2G masts, that do not provide data communication.\r\n\r\nThis is effecting rural communities that are being neglected and left technical behind. The Carriers appear to be chasing profits rather than caring for their existing customers who pay the same as those in urban communities who are receiving data connections already through 3G masts.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to ensure the 2G masts are prioritized first before allowing any more 3G masts are upgraded.\r\n",
