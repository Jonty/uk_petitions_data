        "additional_details": "In July BAA began 'Freedom Trial's' enabling flights to take off and land simultaneously from Heathrow.  These trials have resulted in planes flying every 90 seconds over Fulham, Putney and Barnes (much of which are sandwiched between 2 runways meaning no respite from BAA's use of alternating runways). Flights go from 4.30am until after 11.00pm ensuring sleep deprivation and noise pollution. From Nov. the new freedoms will allow many more flights to land at 5.30am.  We urge the Government to end this trial as soon as possible.",
