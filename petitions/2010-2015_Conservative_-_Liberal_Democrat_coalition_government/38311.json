        "additional_details": "At present if a child lives 3 miles or more from school they are entitled to a free bus pass. If they happen to live 2.99 miles away they have to pay up to \u00a35 per day return.There are lots of \"split\" villages where one child gets a pass and a child who lives a few doors away has to pay. The 3 mile rule was brought in about 50 years ago. It was thought (and still is by the issueing department) that a child could walk to school if less than 3 miles away. My child would have to walk down muddy tracks within inches of an arterial road in total darkness for all but spitting distance of 3 miles. I would like a bit of flexibilty and common sense when issuing passes.",
