        "additional_details": "To call for the government to accept that if more than 6m (6,000,001 or over) people call for a vote of no confidence in the government, the vote should be held. If enough people sign this petition, the call will be for parliament to make this law. Once the law exists, any petition which reaches 6,000,001 signatories will spark a vote of no confidence in any government in power at that time. This does not just apply to the current government, but should be statute for as long as the UK is run as a parliamentary/representative government.",
