        "additional_details": "With only 2000 prison places spare in 2010, more prisons need to be built. With a rising population, if the crime rate stays the same we simply do not have enough places for criminals. It's alright talking tough on crime but crime cannot be properly punished if people are released early to make way for new criminals. Because of this, not all criminals now will be punished in the 2011 UK wide riots.\r\n\r\nBUILD MORE PRISONS to match the rising population and deter people from crime because criminals know they will not go to prison because of overpopulation.",
