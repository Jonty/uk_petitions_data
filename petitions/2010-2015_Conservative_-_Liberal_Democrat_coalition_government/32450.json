        "additional_details": "The signatories in this petition believe the plans to enact a new bill enabling the government to monitor all correspondence of normal everyday citizens of the UK to be a breach of our privacy and civil liberties. Citizens should be able to email, text, call and visit websites of their choice without fear of recrimination by the government. We agree that there are elements in society that need to be monitored, but the vast majority of the UK does not need to be under this type of Orwellian government structure. We would like the government to not impose this bill on the majority of the law-abiding citizens of the UK; we see this as a backward step in society. If the government wants to monitor a group or individual then they should stick the current format where permission has to be granted by a magistrate.",
