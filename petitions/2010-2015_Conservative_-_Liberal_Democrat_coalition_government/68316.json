        "additional_details": "The government intends to hand over the successful East Coast line to private hands despite the public run rail line handing over \u00a31 billion to the public purse over the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nBidders for the East Coast include the French state run SNCF meaning future profits from East Coast could be used to improve the French state run rail network at the expense of hard pressed passengers.\r\nDespite 2 previous private sector failures the government is intent on re-privatising this line.\r\n\r\nWe already have the most expensive train fares in Europe and this action will hand more money to shareholders and over paid executives rather than benefiting passengers with reduced train fares.\r\n\r\nPlease sign here to stop this happening and keep the East Coast in public hands for the benefit of all\r\n",
