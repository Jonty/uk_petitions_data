Bias political coverage before & during election campaigns should not be allowed. Reasonable unbiased reasons for & against particular political media standpoint should be given. There should be clear guidelines about when disclosure by a free media constitutes \u2018public interests\u2019. Leaked information from \u2018moles\u2019, information covertly obtained, etc should only be used if the public interest criteria mentioned below are fulfilled. Apart from publishing & recording actual events, public interest disclosure publication should be on grounds of exposing: (1) corruption (2) waste of public money (3) fraud (4) possible commission of criminal offences (5) deception (6) pollution (7) immigration scams (8) incompetence (9) celebrity (& others) actual action or inaction reports, etc.   The media watchdog (PCC) should be expected to be independent but pursue objectives mentioned above.
