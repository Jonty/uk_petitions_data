        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the Government to urgently review the under-occupancy rules on the following grounds:\r\n\r\n- a blanket rule is unfair. Many situations are unique & not effectively included in the exceptions, for example: specific disability/illness-related needs like a couple being unable to share a bedroom; separated parents who share childcare; a child who severely disrupts siblings sharing a room.\r\n\r\n- it can break up family life for those with an essential support network close to their current home. The 'Big Society' aims to support these networks.\r\n\r\n- there aren\u2019t enough smaller social homes for everyone affected to downsize.\r\n\r\n- the poorest & most vulnerable people are being hit hardest. This \"tax\" further cuts the income of those who are already in social housing & receiving benefits due to low income or disability.\r\n\r\nEvidence shows the current rules are causing hardship & hunger. We urge the Government to ensure state benefits provide a sufficient safety net.",
