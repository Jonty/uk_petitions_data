This is due to the fact that the vast majority of the population know and are willing to use their CPR skills.\r\n\r\nThe BHF and Ambulance NHS trusts around the UK have shown the benefits for early resusitation being provided by CPR.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised by every youth group in the UK and taught at the Youth groups so why is it not taught in schools?\r\n\r\nIt is a skill we hope they will never use, but vital skill to have just in case.\r\n\r\nThank you for you time",
