(Offering controversial \"help to buy\" style schemes after first stripping first-time-buyers off their vital savings is no help at all!)\r\n\r\nRestructure the stamp duty such as when applicable, it is applied exponentially with the cost of the property.\r\n\r\nReimburse part of the money already collected unfairly through stamp duty from first time buyers to help repay their mortgage sooner.\r\n\r\nIntroduce stamp-duty adjustments around London where \u00a3250k does not even buy a half-descent 2-bedroom home.\r\n\r\nWe are begging for help and JUSTICE.",
