        "additional_details": "I am calling this petition to get our government to get CCTV placed across many local streets in neighbourhoods around the UK. Being an example is Clarence Crescent, Clapham Park Estate. This is due to too many different crimes occuring on that one street which one I was a victim of. Today we had another and this could have resulted in death and yet again there is no CCTV to help with evidence! This should have been a situation sorted a long time ago and would of helped with crime numbers also. I believe everyone will benefit from it, we need to feel safe within our communities. Sadly we live in a world where individuals feel the need to harm others out of revenge or because they are owed something. We need to stop it. Please get all your loved ones and associates to sign this. God forbid anything happens, but with the use of CCTV we can put a stop to these people committing crimes!",
