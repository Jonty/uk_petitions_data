        "additional_details": "\r\nEight people including six children have been killed in recent years by dogs originally bred for fighting or the baiting of bears/bull/badgers/pigs in the distant past. In 2010, 6000 people needed to be admitted to hospital after being attacked by savage out of control dogs, at cost of \u00a33.5 million to the NHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last month we have had a ten year old Northamptonshire  girl lose her lower leg and foot  following an attack by the families own (Nannie Dog) Staffordshire Bull terrier and the death of a 14 year old school girl again attacked by two Staffordshire Bull terriers and a Bull Mastiff & American Bulldog.\r\n\r\nTo this end we demand the DEFRA make the wearing of muzzles at all times compulsory for such dog breeds and a criminal offence if they do not.\r\n\r\nThat all such dogs are neutered male and female at the owner\u2019s expense. That the breeding or cross breeding of any of these dogs will be a criminal offence, leading to prison and the payment of large fines.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
