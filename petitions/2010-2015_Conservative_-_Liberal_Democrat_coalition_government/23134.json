Were smokers an ethnic group their treatment would be illegal.\r\n\r\nWe are told that smoking costs the NHS approximately \u00a33 billion per year which may be true but the excise duty and VAT from tobacco sales contributes over \u00a311 billion per year to the exchequer.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer should explain how the \u00a38 billion shortfall would be made up if smokers responded to the Governments constant exhortations to stop smoking.",
