I fear that I too may have easily been in the shoes of the poor primary teacher in the case mentioned above.  If the child had been weighed regularly, medical records crossed referenced the parents of the child would not so easily have been able to pull the wool over teachers, social workers eyes.   We must bring back the health checks for children - have school nurses and give the necessary time to listen and talk to each other about the children in our care.... and provide a curriculum were children are given time to talk to adults in languages they understand and use. (see Reggio Emilia - The Hundred Languages of Children.)",
