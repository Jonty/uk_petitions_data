For example the payment of bonuses to ineffective bankers including Heston and others at RBS.\r\nUnder the powers,  the first Regulation should be that no enterprise operating in the UK shall pay any person a total sum exceeding two million pounds in any fiscal year unless both Approved and Pretaxed.\r\nApproval is to be determined in the High Court by a Jury selected as at present.  They must see evidence the sums are justified.\r\nThe charge will be retrospective to April 1st 2010 and those already in receipt of such amounts must submit their estimated gross income to HMRC.\r\nTaxation levels should start at 75% and increase by 5% per million.\r\nThe same Regulation must also apply to overseas payments for services.",
