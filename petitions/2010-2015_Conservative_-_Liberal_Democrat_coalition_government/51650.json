        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the government to commit to the current cap on interest rates for pre 2012 student loans on the following grounds:\r\n\r\n\u00b7 All students who took out pre 2012 student loans did so with the understanding that interest would be capped either at RPI or banks\u2019 base rate plus 1 per cent, whichever is lower.\r\n\r\n\u00b7 A recent report by Rothschild investment bank, commissioned by the government, included proposals to increase interest rates on student loans for 3.6 million borrowers in England who have the pre 2012 loans.\r\n\r\n\u00b7 It is completely unfair to betray the 3.6 million students who took out these loans by increasing the amount they expected to pay back, particularly when many of them are struggling to find employment.\r\n\r\nWe urge the government to commit to the current cap and to protect current and future students by establishing in law that conditions on student loans cannot be altered retrospectively.",
