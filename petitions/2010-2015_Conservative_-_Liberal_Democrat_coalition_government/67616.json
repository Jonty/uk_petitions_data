        "additional_details": "Section 17 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 created a single County Court in England and Wales and Schedule 9 of that Act provided for numerous consequential amendments.\r\n\r\nHowever, the title of the Act which confers jurisdiction and powers upon the single County Court is still the 'County Courts Act 1984' and not the 'County Court Act 1984'.\r\n\r\nThis is confusing.  Where is the Government hiding these other County Courts?\r\n\r\nRemoving the surplus 's' from the title of the Act would make typing and printing the name of the Act up to 4.54% more efficient.\r\n\r\nIn this age of austerity, can the Ministry of Justice really pass upon such a potential saving?\r\n\r\nThis is to say nothing of the unnecessary wear and tear currently caused to the 's' key on thousands of lawyers\u2019 keyboards, or the likely increase in the nation\u2019s GDP if the publishers of legal textbooks had to do work to reflect this common-sense amendment.\r\n\r\nEnd this wanton use of a redundant character now!",
