There is no other help for costs such as field trips, books or transport to school.\r\n The EMA is vital to our young people who are already disadvantaged by right of being born into a financially less well off family.\r\nBringing back the EMA would serve to allow them a little self esteem and a belief they are valued.\r\nPlease sign to appeal to the Government to reconsider the EMA",
