        "additional_details": "This is a petition to stop the endorsement of 'fake food products' that are being sold as 'healthier' to the UK.\r\n\r\nThis includes products designed as low fat which then contain unrecognisable ingredients. How is a processed item full of junk healthier? Plenty of studies show that saturated fat and cholesterol are in fact good for us yet these products would have us believe otherwise.\r\n\r\nWe want these products removed from the shelves. REAL food offered on promotion in favour of this but most of all we want the Government to stop trying to sell us junk as being good for our health. REAL: education on health, not lies dressed up to make money.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition, share, get the word out there. ",
