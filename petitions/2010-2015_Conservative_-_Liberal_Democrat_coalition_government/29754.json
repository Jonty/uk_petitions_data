        "additional_details": "The 30 year rule allows Government/Cabinet papers to be kept secret from the public for 30 years. This means the public cannot find out what the current Government or even the previous Government has done or is doing in our name. Example: the Conservatives blame the previous Labour Government for the national debt crisis which they say necessitates deep public spending cuts. Labour says it's not their fault. How can the public hold the politicians to account if the information on which to do so is kept from them for 30 years?",
