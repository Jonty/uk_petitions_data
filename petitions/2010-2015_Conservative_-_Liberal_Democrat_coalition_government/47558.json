        "additional_details": "I and myself are quite fed up of the way some people including the moderators of ladslads behave. People make disgusting comments to younger users (under 18) write digusting blogs about race, drugs, sexuality you name it, it can be blogged about. The moderators, even when you complain about such a blog do nothing about it. Even when there is out right bullying going on towards other members. The moderators often join in and bully the people they are supposed to be protecting. There are also a few \"trollers\" on the site who are often very disgusting in their manner and still the moderators do nothing. TIME FOR CHANGE!! OR CLOSE THE SITE DOWN!!",
