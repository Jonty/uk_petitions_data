Regardless of their race, colour, religion, disability or sexuality.\r\n\r\nNo-one has the right to verbally abuse these groups, especially on tv, radio, printed in the press or online.\r\n\r\nHowever Katie Hopkins seems to have made a career out of doing just that.\r\n\r\nCompanies that continue to employ people with similar views by definition themselves are 'guilty by association' and are equally guilty of being homophobic, racist bigots just like those they employ.\r\n\r\nIt is time the media stamp this out and remove anyone from their payroll who's only interest is to insult and upset the public.\r\n\r\nIf any private citizen were to say or print half the comments Ms Hopkins has said in the past, I would have no doubt they would be dismissed from their place of work. So why should people in the public eye be exempt.\r\n\r\nMs Hopkins Should be removed from all types of media including professional and social.\r\n\r\n",
