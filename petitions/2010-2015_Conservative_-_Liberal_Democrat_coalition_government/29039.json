        "additional_details": "Having seen no new nuclear weapons testing since 1991, we are concerned that Britain's credibility as a nuclear power is falling. As a result, we petition the government to commence nuclear weapons testing with immediate effect and nominate Wales as a suitable testing area, due to its sparse population and limited economic value. This initiative will have huge scientific benefits and will contravene the terms of no arms limitation treaty.\r\n\r\nWe petition the government to act with alacrity on this hugely important issue.",
