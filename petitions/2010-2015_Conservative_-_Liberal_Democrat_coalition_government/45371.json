        "additional_details": "The taxes of the UK are to be simplified. I think they should abolish all taxes and make a system similar to the one in France all taxes are on items purchased.This would simplify at a stroke no more tax loop holes, no more capital gains etc. ,etc.It would promote jobs and save everyone a lot of time ,money and stress. It would also free-up an army of civil servants to be used for tax investigations and other uses. It would save a fortune in paper forms and other costs and be of benefit to all in reduced stress, effort and time. many business people would save money on tax consultants and accountants etc. It would return choice and freedom to people in that they could have all of their pay to spend on what they want. Our tax laws are unfair and too complex, this leads to law breaking unnecessary prosecutions and wastes the courts time, the time of the machinery to investigate and prosecute these and everyone involved and does not turn a profit for anyone.\r\nPaul Wilders",
