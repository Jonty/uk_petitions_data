        "additional_details": "With increasing pressure to reduce budget deficit, I propose that child benefits should be paid in a staggered manner which should be full benefit for the first 2 children, half benefit for the next 2 and none for the children thereafter. This will discourage people from having more children just for the sake of the benefits. This will also result in significant savings for the treasury.",
