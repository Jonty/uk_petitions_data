MPs are voted for to represent the electorate so it is those MPs who, after consulting the people who voted for them who MUST HAVE THE POWER TO ORDER AN IN OUT EU REFERENDUM.  David Cameron does not have the honour, integrity, probity, nor just the basic downright honesty to be allowed to continue doing what he does.",
