        "additional_details": "As nits are one of the common things children bring home from school as well as homework its time that the nit nurse became a regular sight in schools. It is an unfortunate fact that some parents do not or can not treat their children for nits and inevitably we end up with an infestation. Children become uncomfortable and cannot concentrate due to the pain they are in. Lets bring health checks back to schools now.",
