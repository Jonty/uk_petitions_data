        "additional_details": "(1) We ask the Uk government to demand that the EU and G20 countries introduce a tobin/financial transaction tax at no higher than 0.1%. We also ask them to consider a very low rate of VAT on this tax. The purpose of this tax is to be a disincentive to irresponsible and greedy banking activity. Any profits made from this will be used by the nation state to reduce its deficit and reduce austerity measures on its people.\r\n(2)We also ask the UK government to legislate that all derivative forms of banking are seperated and barred from retail banking.\r\n(3) We demand the UK government takes a proactive and firm role to stop secret banking and close all tax havens, both those in the Commonwealth and the European Union and wherever it can extend its influence.\r\n(4) We ask the UK government to do more to help mutualised societies such as the Co-op,Nationwide Building Society, Credit Unions and to invest in them financially.",
