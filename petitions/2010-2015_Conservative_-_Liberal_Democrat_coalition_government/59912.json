This way will stop any new smokers taking up the habit but allowing existing smokers to continue their habit.\r\n\r\nOnce the year is up anyone not registered as a smoker will no longer be able to do so this should in theory then stop anyone taking up the habit and effectively eradicate this poison from our society once and for all.
