        "additional_details": "We recommend the Government introduce conscription for rioters. A majority of rioters are younger males with a complete lack of respect for others and their property.This approach will help instill much needed discipline and respect for authority, take offenders off the streets without filling jails, instil some missing social values, and (at least temporarily) remove their lust for high value goods such as designer clothes, HDTVs, and iPhones. In some cases these individuals will end up in warzones such as Afganistan where they will learn just how well-off they were before they rioted. This should help reduce a repeat of these riots in the long term. This will be partly paid for by reusing the benefits payments otherwise paid to many of the underpriveledged taking part in the recent riots.",
