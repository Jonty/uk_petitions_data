        "action": "Decrease the use of fossil fuels and nuclear energy and increase renewable energy.",
        "additional_details": "I would like the government to look into completely stopping the creation and use of nuclear power plants and vastly reduce the amount of fossil fuels used by the country.\r\nNuclear plants use fossil fuels to build and create radioactive nuclear waste which is poisonous.\r\nFossil fuels (when burnt) create carbon dioxide which adds to the 'greenhouse effect' - global warming. Fossil fuels will soon run out and we need to find an alternative.\r\nThere needs to be a large increase in renewable energy to be able to cope with the rising population and global warming.\r\nThe consequences of using fossil fuels and nuclear power could be catastrophic. Please act now, instead of leaving it until it is too late.",
