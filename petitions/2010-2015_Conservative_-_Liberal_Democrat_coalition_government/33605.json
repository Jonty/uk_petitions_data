        "additional_details": "Existing swimming pools in four areas of the Oldham borough are being removed and replaced by a central Olympic sized pool with limited facilities for other water sports. No considerations are being made to replace the deep pool. We need a deep pool for many activities, including High diving (we have had Olympians trained in Oldham) Scuba diving - 3 clubs use the facilities. Canoeing. Lifesaving training and many more activities. The current facilities are in use daily and are profitable to the borough. Consultation was held with limited notice and still no consideration has been given. Assurances were made to offer alternatives within the borough though this has proven to not be possible.\r\nAction needed is to include either a deep pool or deep pool section in the new plans with availability in line with current procedure. A minimum depth of 4m would be required to facilitate all the sports undertaken.\r\n",
