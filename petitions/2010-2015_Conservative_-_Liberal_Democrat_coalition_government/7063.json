        "additional_details": "As all educated people are aware, criminalizing cannabis is not just a waste of police efforts and prison space but also a huge loss on revenue for the UK. By legalising the use and sale of cannabis we can have a huge uplift on tax revenue, not just from smokers or dealers who would like to legitimize there hobbies and business but we can also look at the other industrial usage of Hemp, for example, plastic, oil, clothes and paper. We must always remember that there are no direct health issues or mental issues from cannabis use (Except smoking with tobacco and from pre-existing mental issues in the user) and not 1 recorded death that relates to cannabis use. So if we compare this to the use of Tobacco or Alcohol it makes no sense to have cannabis as an illegal product, except for far right social issues, which again have no benefit to this country. Use your mind and be sensible by signing this petition.",
