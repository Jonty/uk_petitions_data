        "additional_details": "Given the state of our economy and in the spirit of genuine reform of our wasteful benefits system, it is hereby proposed that we gradually phase in a negative taxation scheme to substitute certain benefits such as job seekers allowance for those who have been on the scheme for longer than three months. This negative taxation acts as a government top up to all wages that fall below a certain minimum standard. The purpose of this scheme is to ensure that actual work is carried out by those who seek to claim assistance. With this scheme I could get any job no matter how little it pays and claim the difference from the government. This scheme is not intended to supplant those schemes that are genuinely effective such as responsible disability benefits. Getting the unemployed back to work would be the ultimate aim of this scheme.",
