        "additional_details": "I feel it should be made a cautionary offence to miss use the term \"Racism\". So many people use it to get out of problem that they cause because it is the one title the people of Great Britian are afraid of.\r\n\r\nIs Racism a relative term in todays modern society? Absolutely, however, the most common usage of the word, in my experience is when Muslim citizens have said \"You're being racist because i'm Muslim.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough i understand it is unacceptable for racism to take place anywhere, it is impossible to be racist to a religion of MULTIPLE RACES. People use this derogative terminology to get out of problems they cause and get people to quiet down and especially in government due to political correctness. I feel that anyone who uses this term should be properly educated in its meaning and where it belongs in society. It is English Litriture not a weapon.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nRobert Greaves.",
