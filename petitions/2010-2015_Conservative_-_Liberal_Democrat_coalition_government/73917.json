        "additional_details": "The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issues directives which can lead to citizens incurring significant financial losses.\r\n\r\nDecisions made by FCA staff can be incompetent and although the FCA can be taken to court, if the complainant wins the case no UK Court has the authority to allocate damages. This is because any liabilities would fall to the Treasury which has Crown Indemnity.\r\n\r\nThe FCA must be made accountable for mistakes and errors in judgement which lead to financial losses for the citizen.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury is hereby asked to remove the Crown Indemnity cover from the FCA and oblige the FCA to take out professional indemnity insurance so they can be held to account in UK courts.",
