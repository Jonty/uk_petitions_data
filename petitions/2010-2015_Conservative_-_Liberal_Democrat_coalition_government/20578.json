        "additional_details": "Every single breeder should have to register as a breeder so all puppies can be traced back to the breeders and the breeders can be held to account for the health and wellbeing of the mother and the puppies.  Anybody found to be breeding without a licence should be prosecuted - There is no excuse nowadays with the vouchers and help associated with spaying/castration.  This should in turn either encourage and help more people to get their dogs spayed/castrated or they become a responsible breeder and have to obide by dog laws otherwise they will be prosecuted.  This will stop so many unwanted dogs being abandoned and pts as the rescue centres are so full already.",
