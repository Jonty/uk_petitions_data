        "additional_details": "Delays in introducing a vaccine that protects against a deadly form of meningitis are putting the lives of children at risk.\r\nMake it available to buy as an option through the NHS. This will allow immediate access to parents at \u00a375 price & give manufacturer the returns they need to cover development costs. The more the vaccine is sold the lower the cost to the NHS in current negotiations. This should be the model for introduction. Gives option of immediate cover, & reduces development cost to give NHS minimum cost for introduction on ASAP basis. Also gives additional trials before cross country adoption. We all win. Also allows immediate introduction prior to election giving new government possibility to review ASAP in new term",
