Introduce a law punishable by imprisonment of those found Guilty. MPs should not be above the law. More scandals should be referred to the Police for investigation. The Government needs to be more accountable to the Public it serves, (or more often steals from or lies to). MPs are seen as untouchable and immune to prosecution in cases of theft and alike. There should be no more - one rule for them and one rule for us.",
