It's despicable that we're not involved in the choices that affect our lives and our future.\r\n\r\n- I'm old enough to work and pay tax but yet I'm not allowed a say in what is done with it.\r\n\r\n- I'm old enough to make the choice to die for my country, but yet am not allowed the choice on who it is I'm fighting for.\r\n\r\n- By law:\r\nI'm old enough to to play the lottery, I'm old enough to have sex, I'm allowed to get married, I'm allowed to apply for legal aid, I'm allowed to leave my home, I'm allowed to rent accommodation.\r\n\r\nI can do all of this but yet I'm still not able to have my say in who makes these laws. This diabolical injustice needs a change and I believe that it needs to happen now, so I can shape my future. Rather than it being decided for me. ",
