        "additional_details": "I would like this government to state that under no circumstances will they intervene militarily in Syria without full UN agreement.\r\nThe rhetoric im hearing from our ministers makes me wonder if they have really thought it through what military intervention could lead to.\r\nThis isnt Libya again - Russia and China have already stated that Syria is a line in the sand for them.\r\nAnd considering the oppsition in Syria appears to include The very people our young soldiers have died fighting over the past decade in Iraq  and Afghanistan.\r\nThen to risk a world war to assist an opposition that includes groups like Al Qaeda and extremists in Syria would be the worst decision a UK govermnment made probably ever.\r\nI hope there are people out there who like myself see the huge risk our government seem to be suggesting we could take and point it out to a government who from where im standing seem oblivious.\r\nPlease signt this petition for some sanity to prevail",
