Currently, there is not even a peaceful action. This is a chance to balance the situation and to start a new system towards immunity and harmony. It is time for Palestine! This is an authentic, non-voilent, thoughtful plan that deserves Europe's full aid.\r\n\r\nWe must continue in our fight to oppose Israel\u2019s Occupation and help win justice for the Palestinian people, because It's not about religion, it's about humanity! PALESTINE HAS NO ARMY, NO AIR FORCE. It's not war it's genocide!\r\nAn apple fell and Newton discovered the law of gravity. Thousands martyrs fell in Syria,Palestine but no one discoverd the laws of humanity.\r\n\r\nI request you all to sign the e-petition to save thousands of lives in Palestine/Israel. If the petition fails, we may have decades more of barbarism and extremists will win more ground.\r\n",
