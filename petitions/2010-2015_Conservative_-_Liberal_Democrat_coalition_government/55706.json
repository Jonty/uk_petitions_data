        "additional_details": "Harnessing the power of the sea is expensive, but once in place, it is a resource that will never cease to generate energy and with the correct technology and robust engineering, will stand the test of time. 'Fracking', 'windfarms' and solar 'fields' are costly, damaging to the environment, and unsightly. With intelligent design, Great Britain could supply its own energy needs without the need to rely so heavily on fossil fuels and other less reliable renewable resources. I would like the government to invest more thought and money towards this idea.",
