They sell off national assetts to their friends at less than the going rate and legislate to make poverty a crime while doing their best to tread people further down into poverty.\r\n\r\nlistening to the many satirical shows you will find that many comedians are actually far savier abouit real life and have more taste for social justice that the goliaths of eton and other priviledge backgrounds.\r\n\r\nSo why don't we ask the current government to step aside and allow a bunch of more common people to run the country as a single party...... Really it can't get any worse than it already is, can it ?",
