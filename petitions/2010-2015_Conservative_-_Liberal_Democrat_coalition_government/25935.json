        "additional_details": "The UK spent over \u00a340 billion on the defence budget in 2010. In recent years the UK has participated in contentious wars and has supported military actions both economically and with direct involvement. UK involvement in Iraq alone has cost the UK approx \u00a310 billion.\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of the MoD should be defence of British sovereign territories. To this end the Government should consider a strategic switch of focus from foreign military intervention and military bases towards a Home Army, trained, based and living in the UK and its overseas territories, with the ability for rapid deployment as part of UN/NATO missions. The UK Government should pledge to never again act unilaterally in attacking another nation without a UN/NATO mandate.\r\n\r\nBritain needs to face the fact it is no longer a world military leader, and does not have the resources to act as if it is so.",
