        "additional_details": "The keeping of chickens in towns and cities is becoming increasingly popular and this is fine. But there is no excusable reason to keep a Cockerel as a pet. The noise-nuisance caused by these animals and their inconsiderate owners should not be allowed and should be considered as anti-social behaviour. Granted, there is a chance with any pet that they may make noise but never is this such a certainty as with a Cockerel. Please sign this petition to encourage it to be made unlawful to keep Cockerels in residential areas.",
