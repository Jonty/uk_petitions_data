        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the Government to make it very clear, through legislation, that Rail Enthusiasts are allowed to take photographs and videos of Trains on Stations, without fear of being branded a \"Terrorist\". They should also not be harassed to apply for permits, present themselves to Station Managers, or provide personal details to rail companies to do so. Despite the \"Security Situation\", Rail Enthusiasts continue to present no risk, and, as stated by Ministers, do provide a positive benefit to major rail stations. ",
