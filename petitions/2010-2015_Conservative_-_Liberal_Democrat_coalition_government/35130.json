        "additional_details": "At the moment, a large portion of cinemas are offering a very limited choice when it comes to watching a film in 2D. Not only is 2D still very popular with a sizable portion of the cinema going public in the UK, there are also a sizable amount of people who don't want to pay the price of a \"premium\" ticket, in order to see a film in a format they do not want to see. Also, there are a lot of people who hare visually imparied, who are physically unable to watch films in 3D.\r\nI would like the governemt to step in, and stop this monopoly of the local multiplexes forcing people to pay higher prices at the cinema, to see a film in a format that they do not want to see.",
