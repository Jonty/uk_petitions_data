        "additional_details": "I propose that all paedophiles should, upon conviction, be banned for life from driving.  My reasoning is that in many, many cases a car,van or other vehicle is used as a\"tool\" by paedophiles in committing their crimes. Take the example of Roy Whiting who abducted and murdered Sarah Payne. He had previously abducted another young girl (who lived) and was given a short prison sentence. If he bad been banned from driving, Sarah Payne would almost certainly be alive today. Please support this petition and help save other children's lives. Thankyou, Harry Arnold.",
