        "additional_details": "The UK population is around 60,000,000, the Governments income from all taxes is around \u00a3650 billion per year. This equates to an average tax of just under \u00a311 per person, per year.\r\n\r\nVery roughly rounded up, there are12 million people under the age of 16 (so we\u2019ll assume they don\u2019t earn much!), 2.7 million unemployed and another 10 million over the age of 65 (already paid their dues). If we waive all forms of tax payment for these three groups that leaves 35.3 million of us to foot the entire UK tax bill.\r\n\r\nThat works out at just about \u00a318.40 per person, per year.\r\n\r\nI would be quite happy to pay this (even double this!) at the start of the year and scrap the taxing tax system so we can all spend more time living our lives, instead of doing paperwork and being \u2018on hold\u2019 with HMRC. We can then put our hard earned time and dosh to better economical use.\r\n\r\nSo, the purpose of this petition is to provoke the government to debate this flat-fee tax restructuring proposal.\r\n",
