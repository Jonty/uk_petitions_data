        "additional_details": "The edited version of the Electoral Register, which contains personal details of all residents, can currently be sold to anyone for any purpose. This can lead to increased levels of junk mail and uninvited marketing calls for residents.\r\n\r\nCurrently, inclusion on the edited version is automatic unless the occupant ticks a box on the form to opt out. This petition calls for a reversal of that option so that residents are automatically excluded from the edited version unless they tick a box requesting inclusion.\r\n",
