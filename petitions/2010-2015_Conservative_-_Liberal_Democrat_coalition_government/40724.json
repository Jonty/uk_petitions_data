However, foreign aid has been given to corrupt governments, dictators and wasted uselessly, funding vicious organisations.\r\n\r\nWe must get a grip on our foreign aid and help it reach those who need it. By focusing our foreign aid to help people and focus on International Development helping countries to develop as opposed to International give away's, we can help the world properly and hopefully reduce our foreign aid budget.
