        "additional_details": "The internet has become an important resource for all in this day and age. Most certainly it is the best tool a student has to access research, data and information relating to their course.\r\nAberystwyth is a town that revolves around its bustling student life, with around half of the residents being students. Which is why it is so shocking that the quality of internet for all but those in university halls is so poor. Internet service providers promise speeds of between 5 and 7 Mb, but many students often experience speeds of less than 1Mb, shared between up to 10 or 12 people in a house.\r\nThis is just not the quality we come to expect in this day and age, and leaves students in other university towns/cities at an unfair advantage.\r\nAll we ask is that internet providers improve their standards; we pay the same as everyone else, we should receive the same quality of internet.",
