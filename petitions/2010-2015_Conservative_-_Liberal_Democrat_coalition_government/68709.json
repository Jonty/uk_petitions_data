        "additional_details": "Given that George Galloway is being investigated by the West Yorkshire Police for incitement to hatred as a result of his inflammatory and anti-Semitic remarks directed against Jewish people, he is unfit for purpose to hold the prestigious office of that as a Member of Parliament.\r\n\r\nHis website for the Respect party is nothing short of a pro-Hamas, anti-Semitic tirade, adding no value for the Bradford constituents he represents. There is nothing on his website representing or assisting the welfare of his constituents.\r\n\r\nAlso, his anti-Semitic views means that he is not fit for purpose to represent some of his constituents (which is what he is paid to do), namely those of Jewish faith.\r\n\r\nHe should therefore be removed as a MP immediately for bringing the Houses of Parliament into disrepute.",
