        "additional_details": "HGV speed limits in the UK are set at 40mph on a roads,50mph on dual carriageways,60mph on motorways (56mph/90kph under eu directive). These limits are archaic and brought in when there was no disc brakes,power steering or abs,trucks are more advanced and more fuel efficient. Drivers are now required to to DCPC meaning we are constantly training and are professional in our field. New limits in the uk should be introduced at 50mph an a roads,60 on dual carriageways, 70mph on motorways. Bring HGVS up to speeds that that other vehicles can use,for instance on a motorway a truck doing max speed at 56mph has a 14mph speed difference to a car traveling at 70mph,this is dangerous,some trucks are limited to a max speed of 50mph which makes the speed difference even worse at 20mph. Obviously UK hauliers leaving our country to drive on the continent must abide by the speed limits over there so a truck could be relimited to the eu 90kph via satellite tracking devices.",
