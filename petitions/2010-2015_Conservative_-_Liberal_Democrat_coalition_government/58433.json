It should not be paid unless a mandatory length of work time has been completed by the individual.\r\nIt is obscene in this day and age when  voters are governed by such low pay rises and low salaries that peers are seen to be collecting in one signing what  for many people is more than their weekly wage.\r\nAn adult employee working full time on the national minimum wage earns  less than a peer takes home in one signing - this is wrong and should be stopped.\r\n",
