So many local groups are missing this base for health and well being, encouraging people to use their cars to travel further to swim, and children are being rushed through swimming lessons at the nearest, oversubscribed pool. Local government need to work hard to support them to return this precious community hub to it's people. We know our community give us full support on this. It is obvious! Let's make it more obvious.
