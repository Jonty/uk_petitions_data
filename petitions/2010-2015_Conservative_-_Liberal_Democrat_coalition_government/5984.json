        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that whilst reform of our Higher Education system is vital, it must not be done at the expense of students who are capable of making a valid contribution to British society. We want the Government to ensure that Universities are legally bound to provide a service which matches the fees they charge, that Lecturers and University staff are tasked with a legal duty of care to the success and progression of students and that students have an equal say in the running of their institutions. Therefore the Government must ensure that Universities actually ensure that students get the quality of teaching and guidance which their increased contributions deserve.",
