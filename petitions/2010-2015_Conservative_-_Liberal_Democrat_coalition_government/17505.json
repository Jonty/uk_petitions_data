Facts like almost one third of refugees have contributed to society by doing voluntary work since arriving in the UK. Truth like most Asians and Indians are students who have come to study legally. Facts about the countries that those who are seeking asylum from persecution and why they have left, the tough choices they have made and what they left behind. Posters of this should be made and put up in public places.",
