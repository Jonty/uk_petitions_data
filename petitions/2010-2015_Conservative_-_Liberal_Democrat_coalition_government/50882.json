        "additional_details": "This petition is for people who are concerned about their dogs.  Any dog can be dangerous, not just the dogs on the dangerous dogs act. Dogs act on how they are raised, every animal is different, punish the owner NOT the breed. My Staffordshire bull terrier is a lovely family dog for children, and my children are worried that he may have to go if his breed is put on the DDA. Dogs are part of families, it is not fair to punish responsible dog owners Mine and my children's heart would break if we couldn't keep our Staffie, please find it in your heart to sign this petition.",
