        "additional_details": "Article 24 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states \u2018Everyone has the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitations of working hours and periodic holidays with pay\u2019. This article states that we should have limitations of working hours. A child of legal school age is only legally allowed to work no more than 5 hours a day in a job. We are in school for 6 and a half hours each day, in lessons for 5 hours, so giving us homework is breaching our human rights. Once a students homework has been completed, they often end up not having any leisure time, whether that is playing games, spending time resting, or spending time with families or a partner. Giving students homework is breaching our human rights.",
