As such, we must have Government action to restrict these organisations ability to raise SVR interest rates on our Mortgages because of their inability to raise money commercially at rates which they want. Once again we are forced to bail them out. At a time when many people are struggling to to make ends meet. I feel we have contributed more than enough to the Banks over the last few years and once again we witness the arrogance and greedy behaviour of these people. ",
