Depending on network traffic the webcam image on your browser should update at approximately 30 second intervals\".\r\n\r\nThis statement could NOT be further from the truth.\r\n\r\nIt is the request of the signed that an official investigation should be undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe reverse engineered software and source code is at the following location.\r\n\r\nhttp://tinyurl.com/arkbk4h",
