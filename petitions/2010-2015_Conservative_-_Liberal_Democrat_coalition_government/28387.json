        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the government to introduce more effective dog legislation. This would include:\r\n\r\n1) The scrapping of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. It is commonly accepted among experts that any breed specific legislation is bad legislation. It causes innocent dogs to be slaughtered purely because they look a certain way or are of a certain type, regardless of behaviour. Any breed of dog can become dangerous when treated incorrectly; it should be deed not breed.\r\n\r\n2) Introduction of minimum breeding standards in the UK and a requirement for all breeders to be licensed; making all unlicensed breeding illegal.\r\n\r\n3) If licences for owners are to be introduced then they should be similar to a driving licence where the licence is for the owner not each dog. To gain the license a one-off fee is charged and the owner is required to demonstrate a minimum amount of knowledge about dog behaviour and handling by sitting a simple test.",
