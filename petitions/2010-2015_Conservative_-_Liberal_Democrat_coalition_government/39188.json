        "additional_details": "23% of adults and 14% of children are clinically obese. That is to say,  they eat too much and exercise too little.\r\n\r\nThe Foresight report predicted that if no action was taken, 60% of adults and 25% of children would be obese by 2050.\r\n\r\nLast year obesity cost the NHS \u00a316 billion in total.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my mind it makes sense to do the following;\r\n\r\n1: Introduce fines to parents who allow their children to be clinically obese.\r\n\r\n2: Increase amount of physical exercise in the national curriculum.\r\n\r\n3: Take away all benefits from the obese after a given time period. That time period will be given by a doctor, and will be enough time to become healthy.\r\n\r\n4: Remove VAT on all fresh meat, fruit, vegetables etc. To compensate, increase VAT of all unhealthy foods, such as confectionery and pies.\r\n\r\n5: Offer incentives to local sports centres etc. to improve the health of the local community.\r\n\r\nThese steps will reduce NHS outgoings, decrease obesity and save the country from obesity.",
