        "additional_details": "Luis Suarez has bit someone for the third time in football. He should not be allowed to play the game any longer. He is a bad example to children who will look to him as one of the best footballers and see that it is ok to behave in this way when it is not.\r\n\r\nHe should be banned from football, he has had too many chances to reform and he is not showing any signs of doing so. He also seems to think that racism is acceptable and it is not.\r\n\r\nSave the reputation of football and ban him for life. ",
