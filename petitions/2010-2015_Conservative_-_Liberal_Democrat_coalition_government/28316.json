        "additional_details": "ACTA is an international trade agreement currently negociated by the European Union, the United States, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Australia as well as a few other countries, whose aim is to enforce copyright and tackle counterfeited goods (hence its acronym: Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement).\r\nThe main problem with this treaty is that all the negociations are done secretely. Leaked documents show that one of the major goal of the treaty is to force signatory countries into implementing anti file-sharing policies under the form of three-strikes schemes and net filtering practices.\r\n\r\nThis Proposal will seriously infringe our rights to Freedom of Speech and will put our internet use under constant surveillance. Any sharing of what is deemed to be copyrighted material will result in punishment.\r\n\r\n http://www.stopacta.info/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Xg_C2YmG0&list=HL1327500414&feature=mh_lolz\r\n\r\n",
