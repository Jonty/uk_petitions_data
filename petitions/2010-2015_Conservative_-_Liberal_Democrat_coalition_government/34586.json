        "additional_details": "As we all know times are hard and the age limit for working tax credits is 25, but why? Why cant a 21 year old get help in this struggling economy, we dont suddenly need more money or work any different just because of the age, if you have a child at 21 you are entitled to them, plus child benefit, housing benefit, council tax help, in some cases you get moved straight into a council house. I suggest that the age limit is reduced to 18 or 21 to help everyone out not just over 25's or parents, as we are all in this country together all working to earn a living.",
