        "additional_details": "For his behaviour around the Hillsborough disaster, Norman Bettison should be stripped of his title. His role during the last 23 years, conspiring against the victims of this terrible incident, lack of remorse and continued view that Liverpool fans were part of the cause, despite the latest findings are not those of someone who warrants to be called \"Sir\" and so I implore the government to intervene and act.\r\n\r\nI would also add that the title would be a lot more fitting for one other person involved in the tragedy - Kenny Dalglish, who has done so much for the families involved and is so much more deserving of it.",
