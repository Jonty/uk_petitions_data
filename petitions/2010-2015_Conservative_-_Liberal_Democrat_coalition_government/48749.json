        "additional_details": "Every dog owner in England will have to microchip their animal from 2016. The government should introduce compulsory microchipping for cats. In 2009, 131,070 stray and unwanted cats were taken in by UK animal welfare organisations and the number is growing. The Cats Protection League took in and rehomed 40% of these cats. There are many charities, and not-for-profit groups run by volunteers, who work very hard to fill the gap. More than 100,000 dogs are dumped or lost each year, at a cost of \u00a357 million to the taxpayer and welfare charities. The annual cost to the taxpayer for cats will be a similar figure. Compulsory microchipping for all cats is a step in the right direction and may help reduce the burden on animal charities, volunteer groups and local authorities.",
