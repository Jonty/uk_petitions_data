        "additional_details": "Public Sector procurement is often overly complex, very expensive, reduces competition, disadvantages SMEs and does not necessarily reach the correct end result nor provide value for money. In these financially difficult times money must be used effectively. Unfortunately though, procurement practices have become bloated, they have an undue focus on a tick box mentality and policies rather than the talent, skills and services offered by the bidders. For a relatively modest commission at the EU threshold (\u00a3130k) it can cost the Public Sector \u00a370k to assess bids and the Private Sector \u00a3250k in bid costs, that is not an effective use of money, energy and talent.\r\n\r\nMany current systems are therefore not fit for purpose and should be fundamentally reviewed and streamlined, in partnership with the private sector and representative organisations. We need to create a simple, effective system to build a better Britain.",
