        "additional_details": "Student have a hard enough time without being forced to do second-class OCR Nationals. Particularly in ICT they are qualifications that big up schools' results yet serve no purpose save teach you to: click; press buttons; print screen; then explain said clicking and button pressing before doing it all over again. While schools say that Distinction is equal to an A grade and a pass is equivalent to a C grade, close analysis of GCSE points for the Level 2 Short Course suggests that that A should really be a D/E and that C a G. With regards to the other ones, they are only worth half as many GCSEs as stated.\r\n   In the interests of all students, I implore that the DfE scrap these set of qualifications: they are of worth to no-one. I would ask that you place high emphasis on the benefits of high quality Computing via GCSEs and A Levels/CISCO\r\nprogrammes for higher ability students.",
