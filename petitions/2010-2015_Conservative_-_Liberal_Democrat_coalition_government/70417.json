        "additional_details": "I believe that children should be screened each year for scoliosis in schools. I have scoliosis and when I found out I was too late to have bracing and will now most likely have to have an operation, this is a hard decision for any person  to make at 16 and I feel as if mine was made for me because it wasn't discovered early enough. Scoliosis is so easy to spot in young people and it really can change someones life if it is noticed early. Please sign this petition so more young people don't have to have the operation and can catch their scoliosis early.",
