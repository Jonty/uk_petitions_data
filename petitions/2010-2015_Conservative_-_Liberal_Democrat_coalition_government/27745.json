There were those that thought it was because most ex-pats were Conservatives numbering around 8,000000.Conversely, the same government supported the unemployed voter.\r\nWith the exception of the disabled and elderly to be democratic only tax payers should have a vote.\r\nIt is hoped that there are proper facilities at the next election \u2013 the same parliament would have condemned any election in the third world without adequate facilities.\r\n",
