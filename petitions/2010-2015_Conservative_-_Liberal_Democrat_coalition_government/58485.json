Somebody MUST be able to stop our criminal politicians and order that they be taken into custody for trial when they are found to have used our taxpayer donations to pay for the killing of civilians, as our present Prime Minister is involved in funding the murderers of the ATPU in Kenya.  DAVID CAMERON MUST BE STOPPED AND POLITICIANS CANNOT BE TRUSTED TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST A MEMBER OF THEIR COHORT ESPECIALLY AGAINST ONE TO WHOM THEY ARE BEHOLDEN FOR THEIR FUTURE PERSONAL ENRICHMENT.  THE PEOPLE MUST BE ABLE TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST CRIMINAL ACTIVITY BY POLITICIANS.",
