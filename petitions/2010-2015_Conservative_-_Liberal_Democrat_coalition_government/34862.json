        "additional_details": "Invading a country to affect regime change may be justified in certain circumstances, as military intervention in Libya indicates. The criteria of when to effect regime change should be affected (with UN agreement) on indictment of the International Court for crimes against humanity (as for Syria). NATO & UN member states can then enforce such regime change indictment. Perhaps the criteria for effecting regime change should be (1) to depose a dictator with overwhelming evidence of committing crimes against humanity towards its citizens (2) a head of state who refuses to step down after being overwhelmingly defeated in a general election (as for Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Laurent Gbagbo of the Ivory Coast, General Thein Sein of Burma) (c) pariah state with refugees having to flee in hoards in fear of their lives to seek asylum in other countries (d) a pariah dictatorship/undemocratic brutal regime with suspected WMD (as in South Korea, Iran) but refusing to comply with UN resolutions.",
