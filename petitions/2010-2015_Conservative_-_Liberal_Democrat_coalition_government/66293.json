        "additional_details": "The A57 Hyde Road is a straight stretch of road with minimal traffic lights and can have free flowing traffic in the morning. The traffic build up is caused by Bus Lane that starts near Redgate Lane for approximately 500meters!\r\n\r\nI sit in this traffic every morning for more than 10 minutes only to watch and average of 2 bus and two taxis speed past. Closing off one lane for THREE hours is excessive and is only building up traffic. Surely having two lanes of flowing traffic would cause less build up?\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you feel the same anger and frustration towards the out dated bus lanes.\r\n",
