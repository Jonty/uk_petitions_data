        "additional_details": "Since the 1990's El-Salvado has actively persecuted women under a law that strictly prohibits abortion, the nation is one of only a handful which outlaws all abortion with no exceptions including life threatening complications during pregancy, pregancy through rape in child victims and severely deformed foetus'.\r\n\r\nIt has also come to light that the justice system actively jails women who have had a miscarriage and that they are moved from hospital to prison before recovery is completed. The penalty is 12 years minimum and the presumption is guilty until proven innocent where the vast majority of poverty stricken victims of the pregancy miscarriage cannot afford proper legal representation.\r\n\r\nAs a father to be I believe a total trade embargo will help change the injustice, which should also be persued by UK across all of the EU.",
