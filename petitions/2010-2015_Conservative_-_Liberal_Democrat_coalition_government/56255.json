        "additional_details": "August 16th 2019 is the 200th anniversary of the Peterloo Massacre. On this day in 1819, 60,000 peaceful men, women and children, from Manchester, Salford & surrounding towns rallied in support of the right to vote. Attacked by armed cavalry, 15 were killed & over 600 injured. Peterloo changed UK politics forever, it began our journey towards one person one vote, Within 13 years the great Reform Act was law, the start of universal suffrage. What better way to mark  this sacrifice than having Manchester's gateway railway station Piccadilly re-named 'Peterloo'? The name 'Peterloo' on millions of tickets, timetables & signs, will be a visible reminder to passengers & visitors of this crucial moment in our history. We want you to sign the petition to get Government support for the change, in doing so please reflect on the selfless actions and vigilance always needed to support democracy, where the many & not the few, decide how we are governed & remember the brave souls of Peterloo.",
