        "additional_details": "We would like the government to prohibit the promotion and practice of religion in any state schools. Schools should be completely separate from religion, and thus prayer, hymns or the teaching of and promotion of religious texts should no longer be allowed.\r\n\r\nChildren should not be exposed or forced into religious practices, and no school should be allowed to promote a certain religion. As we live in an increasingly multicultural and secular society, it is wrong that everybody at one school should have a certain religion imposed upon them.\r\n\r\nWe do not oppose the teaching of Religious Education in schools, but schools should not require pupils to have to pray or sing hymns, nor should they promote one religion above others.\r\n\r\nTo do so creates religious divisions in our society, and also causes many children to blindly follow a certain religion without thinking for themselves.
