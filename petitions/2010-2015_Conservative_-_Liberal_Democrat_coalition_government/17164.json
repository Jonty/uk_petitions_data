SAAS claim the new system will result in an extra \u00a310 million being paid out in travel expenses... yet many rural students will be left with up to 6x less than they should be allowed to claim for travel.\r\nSAAS have made changes to the way in which student travel expenses are paid.\r\n\r\nFor 2011-2012, students will no longer have their travel expenses reimbursed. Instead, travel costs are based on family income and are included in your loan.\r\n\r\nThis does not consider your location, is discrimination against islanders/ rural students and doesn't begin to cover our travel costs!",
