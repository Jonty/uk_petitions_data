But in the proases they have made most customers and bus drivers alike to fear for there safety. The bus drivers are scared to be late on certain routes that they have put customer safety to the back burner. A few ex drivers have spoke of buses being cleared for use when the shouldn't be. And there is a rising thought that the rising bus fare isn't being used for what it should be which is to update the buses and fix anything that might be considered un safe. If you feel the same please sign thank you",
