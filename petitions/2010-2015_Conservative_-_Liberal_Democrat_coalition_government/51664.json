That America continues on this trend, is no reason for us to blindly follow!!\r\n\r\nThere is stronger evidence that terrorist groups are supporting the 'rebels' than the use of chemical weapons by the established government in that country....is this country going to make the same mistake we did when we armed Saddam Hussein and then Osama Bin Laden...it is our money, not yours to spend, and we do not want to spend it on other peoples wars!!!
