Lobbying companies are adept at finding ingenious ways to disguise the role of their clients which is why disclosure is so important.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to introduce:\r\n\r\nA public mandatory register of lobbyists, with financial disclosure.\r\n\r\nAn enforceable set of ethical rules and guidelines for all lobbyists.\r\n\r\nEnhanced rules on the ethical conduct of politicians and public officials\r\n\r\nHalt all undisclosed privileged access to decision makers.\r\n\r\nElected officials should work in the interest of the electorate, and transparency of the lobbying system is essential for an open democratic system and to ensure that the citizens always remain paramount.\r\n",
