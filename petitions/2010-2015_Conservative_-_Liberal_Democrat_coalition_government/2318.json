        "action": "Support HS2: Bring forward construction to boost growth",
        "additional_details": "Britain is now in the slow lane. Debt has forced us to tighten belts but at the expense of growth; we face a toxic cycle of stagnation, low industrial output and poor confidence. Major infrastructural projects like HS2 can break the spiral. Bringing forward construction will bring jobs at a time we so desperately need them and will leave a legacy of efficient and clean transport that can help serve businesses now and far into the future. When railways first spread across the UK they opened up trade and allowed people and products to move further creating and distributing wealth across the land. If we are to develop our industries to take us out of debt we need to support them with world class transportation. I call upon HM Government to fast track HS2 so that business and industries of the UK can excel far into the future. If you agree with boosting employment at a time of hardship and creating a green, world-class platform for industry for years to come then please sign this petition.",
