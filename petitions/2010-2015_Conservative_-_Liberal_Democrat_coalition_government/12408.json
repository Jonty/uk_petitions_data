A work for your money discipline should be adopted by us all in Britain as too many are on all sorts of benefits for staying home and getting out of bed at lunchtime! Anyone (who is able) claiming benefits should have to do Community Service such as; gardening, shopping for the old, cleaning up rubbish, or similar. No more benefit hand outs to ANY nationality without working for the money. This will create a positive mindset of there is no free lunch or handout for staying up all night and in bed all day!",
