Then count the number of other people that were in the store with you; then think of how many people shop at that store in a day, then think of how many branches that store has. Then think of how many different store chains there are across the country. You can see how it easily adds up.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides, when we pay for something that costs \u00a39.99, we usually hand over a \u00a310 note, and the penny just sits in our wallets for eternity anyway.",
