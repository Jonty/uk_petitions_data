        "additional_details": "660,000 Registered Nurses and Midwives pay \u00a3100 annually to remain Registered with the NMC.  The NMC between 2010-12 have self-awarded themselves up to 6% pay raise and increased their own employer contributions to 27.4%.   As well as receiving \u00a320 million from the Government. These figures far exceed that what is received by the NHS Registered Nurse and Midwives.  We believe the NMC are unfairly using our Registration fees received.\r\n\r\nWe request that the Department of Health investigate why the NMC can self-award such pay rises and create a lucrative pension from our Registration fees, when NHS Registered Nurses and Midwives have not had a pay rise for several years and have seen their employer pension contributions fall.\r\n\r\nWe also request that the DoH put measures in place for Registered Nurse and Midwives to have a greater role and professional voice in the NMC, especially the fiscal management which we would like to be overseen by the DoH.",
