        "additional_details": "Violent, far-right groups such as the 'English Defence League' and the 'National Front' have been operating with tactics of intimidation and violence. They use force and fear to cause divisions in working class communities. This is the very definition of terrorism: to threaten and/or enact violence to push an ideology.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why these fascist groups (who are proven, over and over, to be violent) should not be considered terrorist organisations. The violence of far-right gangs has already gone too far, and now these people are calling Norweigan mass-murderer, Anders Breivik, a 'hero'. We must look at the evidence, and consider what the violence of far-right groups is leading toward.\r\n\r\nEDL, NF and fascists are terrorists, and need to be treated as such.",
