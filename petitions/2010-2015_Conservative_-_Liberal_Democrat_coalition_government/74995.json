        "additional_details": "We as Chelsea fans would like to see Stan Collymore removed from his position at Talksport radio and banned for life from entering Stamford Bridge for inflammatory and slanderous remarks on social media aimed towards fans and the club alike which are not true. His comments are unfair and have no basis and are extremely unprofessional. Accusing the fans of the club of being racist is just ridiculous and unwarranted and could potentially cause violence between some",
