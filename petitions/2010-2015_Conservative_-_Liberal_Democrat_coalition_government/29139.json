        "additional_details": "While Britain is a socially progressive nation, it is sadly true that the majority of M.P's, especially those making up the current government, come from privileged backgrounds. A clearer understanding of everyday British life would improve performance. As such, we the undersigned feel that ministers should, before taking up their posts, be offered special training, and be required by law to demonstrate competencies in at least one of the following areas.\r\nSurviving ONE YEAR on jobseeker's allowance or the minimum wage without having a nervous breakdown.\r\nWalking into any public house in any major urban centre, any Friday or Saturday night, and ordering a pint of lager without subsequently being headbutted by another patron.\r\nBuying some fish and chips from a chip shop on a run-down council estate in Yorkshire without the person behind the counter laughing openly.\r\nSmoking twenty cigarettes a day for forty years while never doing any exercise, yet somehow still being incredibly hard.\r\n",
