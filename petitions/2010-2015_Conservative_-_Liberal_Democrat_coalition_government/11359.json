        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe excessive political control of the professional bodies in this country has undermined their flexibility and effectiveness.  While political accountability is necessary politicians do not have the professional expertise to make professional decisions. By over governance we now have a one size fits all Education System which has failed many; a National Health Service costing millions to pay non medical administrators to oversee dirty demoralised hospitals and a Police Service subject to political interference at the whim of Prime Minister and/or City Mayor.  We need these and other services to be regulated by professional bodies with only a light touch of political oversight which trusts professional judgment.",
