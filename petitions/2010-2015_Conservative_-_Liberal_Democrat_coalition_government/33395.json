        "additional_details": "China does not have a floating exchange rate at a time when their economy is growing faster than ours. This means the Yuan is undervalued.\r\n\r\nThis makes our exports to them appear artificially expensive and their imports to us, artificially cheap. It is in effect a trade barrier, but by a different name.\r\nAs a result they earn lots of hard currency but do not spend all of it on our exports: they use it to purchase western assets (equity, property etc). This is;\r\n1) strategically dangerous\r\n2) damages UK jobs without the balance of export-lead replacement jobs\r\n3) works against an open global economy.\r\n\r\nUntil the Yuan is allowed to float freely, the UK government should react in the following way:\r\n1) Impose trade tariffs on Chinese imports and outsourced services\r\n2) Make it illegal to outsource UK jobs to China and provide incentives for companies to return outsourced jobs to the UK\r\n3) Make it illegal for Chinese investment funds to purchase UK assets",
