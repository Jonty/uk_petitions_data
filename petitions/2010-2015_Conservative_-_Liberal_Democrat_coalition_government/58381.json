        "additional_details": "The Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 and Amendment Act 1997, has proved to be wholly ineffective in reducing the number of dogs attacks in the UK and has resulted in many  breeds of dog being stigmatised. This has resulted in a huge number of dogs being unable to find loving homes as a large portion of the general population now deem these dogs as dangerous.\r\n\r\nThis however has sadly created the situation whereby those in society who want a \u201cstatus dog\u201d are easily able to attain one. Resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy further which has only compounded the situation.\r\n\r\nI am therefore looking for support to have the Dangerous Act 1991 and Amendment overturned in favour of introducing legislation to penalise owners of dangerous dogs and to introduce dog licensing to ensure those who abuse dogs can be found.\r\nAs only by addressing the problem of dangerous owners, do we ever hope to address the problem of dangerous dogs.\r\n",
