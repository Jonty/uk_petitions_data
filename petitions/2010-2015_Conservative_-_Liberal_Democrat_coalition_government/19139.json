        "additional_details": "After travelling all across the USA last year it became evident that the ability to turn right (left in Britain) through a red traffic light eased traffic congestion tremendously and did it with safety and caution to pedestrians. The scheme in the US works wonders for allowing traffic to flow when the carriageway ahead is clear, without the need to cross lanes to progress. The left turn through a red light if the way is clear should definitely be adopted in Britain to help with the continuous increased traffic problem.",
