        "additional_details": "The government's subsidy to biogas plants of \u00a360 to 80 per tonne of food burnt is resulting in supermarkets selling food to those plants for burning which could instead be going to people on low incomes for them and their children to eat. This is wasteful and surely an unintended consequence.\r\n\r\nIf this subsidy was removed from biogas plants and given to charities distributing supermarket food to people who need it, less people would go hungry.",
