For some it is not an option to live within the family unit and so, with limited earnings, there age against them and with a lack of social housing the only option is to privately rent a room with the help of housing benefit.\r\n\r\nThe government must consider the vulnerable and optionless people and not risk making thousands of young people homeless, and at the very least invest in those agencies and charities already struggling to deal with the amount of homeless young people.
