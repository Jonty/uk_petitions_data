        "additional_details": "We petition that all television programmes directed at children should carry a government health warning. There have been many studies on the effects of the television on children.  Most have come to the conclusion that it is better not to expose young children to the TV at all. Some national governments like the French have issued warnings about children and TV exposure. French government researchers have found that watching television undermined the development of children under three, encouraged passivity, delayed language acquisition, increased agitation, reduced concentration and increased the incidence of sleep disorders. The French broadcasting authority Conseil Superior Audiovisuel (CSA) actually banned TV channels from marketing shows aimed at toddlers. With the recent riots in London and other cities involving so many children there is strong evidence that television violence can cause violence in society.",
