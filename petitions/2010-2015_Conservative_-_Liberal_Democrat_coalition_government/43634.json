        "additional_details": "We call for this government to bring in minimum amount per week per child. Currently self employed Absent parents adjust their income to achieve a Nil Assessment. No parent should have a NIL liability for a child. Setting a minimum amount of say eg; \u00a320 per week per child will make sure people only have the children they can afford, will relieve pressure from the dysfunctional CSA and make sure that every child is provided for to some degree. If parents have to pay for their children they may take an interest in their upbringing, and stop absent parents from going on to make yet more children to reduce their child support liability further. Parents who are on benefits and cannot find work could fulfill community roles to cover their child support as many community roles have gone due to austerity measures. Parents who earn over a certain amount could have their child support increased on a % scale.",
