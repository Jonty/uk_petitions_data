        "additional_details": "We request that children may not be removed from family homes based on risk of emotional harm and that all cases in which these were grounds for removal of children are reopened for appeal.\r\n\r\n\"Risk of emotional harm\" has no legal definition making it ambiguous and open to abuse when no risk is proven.\r\n\r\nBy the wording \"risk of\" there is an acceptance that no harm has or will take place.\r\n\r\nThe only way to assess emotional harm is after a period of time in a controlled environment contrary to a families right to freedom of expression.\r\n\r\nIn many cases where children are removed from families they go on to suffer emotionally by being separated from parents, grandparents, siblings and other family and friends. This makes a mockery of the original reason the children were removed.",
