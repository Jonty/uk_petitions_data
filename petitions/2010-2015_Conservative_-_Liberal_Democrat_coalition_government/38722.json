        "additional_details": "The cost of car parks is becoming a total rip-off! Even to park in London, and other smaller cities, it can cost more than \u00a35 to park for ONE HOUR!\r\n\r\nNow that really is stupid, because what are you really achieving? Nothing - it is exactly the same as parking in a town centre car park and road lanes, where you pay no more than \u00a32.00 for up to 3 hours!\r\n\r\nPeople who travel by train, and park their car at the train station may as well pay to rent a private drive or garage, which can cost as little as \u00a37.50 a week (not in London). Train station car parks are also too expensive!\r\n\r\nThe website is: www.parkatmyhouse.com/uk .",
