        "additional_details": "A lot of individuals would like to see some sort of road crossing on Kingsway road in BILLINGHAM near the post office. There is no easy access to cross the road and some cars park around the area where most people cross making obstructions and therefore harder to cross. It is also a school route and a little girl was knocked down this morning (03.04.2014) and an older person was knocked down just a couple of weeks before. Most of the residents have to cross this road to gain access to the town centre.",
