The public needs to have access to those archives - we paid for them so they do belong to us anyway - so that we may find out who was doing what to whom, while they claimed to be acting on our behalf in the interests of national security.  It appears it was all a con and they were actually acting on behalf of the interests of criminal politicians all the time.",
