Proposed changes to these services must be prevented; closure of these facilities will mean that many people\u2019s lives will be put in unnecessary danger by having to travel to the next nearest hospital which could be anything from a 45 minute to a one hour journey away.\r\n\r\nFurther, encouraging commuting to hospitals further away, places further strains on the already stretched local infrastructure and also has a negative impact on the environment.\r\n\r\nAny proposed changes are completely unacceptable, are not in the interest of the local populations serviced by Eastbourne DGH or the other surrounding hospitals that will be impacted.\r\n",
