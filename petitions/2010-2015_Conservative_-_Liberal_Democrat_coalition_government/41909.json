Too many bad carers have their jobs because the companies need staff, this should not be the case! Care workers are supposed to look after people, not abuse them!\r\n\r\nImagine if you were unable to look after yourself. You would have to trust the care workers that come into your home to look after you. This is becoming impossible.\r\n\r\nThere are 7 types of abuse:\r\n1.Neglect\r\n2.Physical Abuse\r\n3.Financial Abuse\r\n4.Sexual Abuse\r\n5.Psychological Abuse\r\n6.Discriminating Abuse\r\n7.Institutional Abuse\r\n\r\nPeople should not have to get abused before action is taken to protect them. More should be done to make sure they are never abused!",
