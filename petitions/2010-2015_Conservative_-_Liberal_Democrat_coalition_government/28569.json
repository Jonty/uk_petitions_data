        "additional_details": "A simple amendment to the Animal Welfare Act 2006 could abolish the awful cruelty inflicted not only on mice and rats, but on other non target animals too, such as birds of prey, foxes, voles, squirrels and many domestic pets.\r\n\r\nThe solution to any wildlife problem is to educate communities and businesses on safe waste disposal and hygene practices. This would lead to a huge reduction in the amount of rodents in urban areas, and eventually drive any remaining animals back to rural areas.\r\n\r\nI would like the British Government to to take action on this matter, and help preserve native wildlife and protect domestic animals by making it illegal to lay any kind of rodent or wildlife poison anywhere in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe death induced by the use of poisons is a slow, lingering agony, as the animal dies from internal bleeding.\r\n\r\nI am calling on the government to urgently review all methods of pest control that require the use of killing traps and baits.\r\n\r\n",
