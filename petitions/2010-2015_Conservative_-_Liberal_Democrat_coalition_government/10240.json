        "additional_details": "The Ambulance Service should be an emergency service, only responding to emergencies. The Ambulance Service responds to most calls, and while ambulances are dealing with non-emergencies, they are not able to respond to the life threatening calls, and the consequences may be fatal. A lot of GPs will come out to see patients, but we need to work together with healthcare professionals from GP and out of hour services to produce a 24 hour service responding to non-emergencies while Paramedics and Technicians are available to react to emergencies. The Ambulance Service has a triage system in place that classes calls according to their urgency, we need the life threatening emergencies responded to by ambulances, and the non-emergencies should receive care at their door from a new Non-Emergency Medical Service. This way, more ambulances will be available to go to the emergency calls and save lives.",
