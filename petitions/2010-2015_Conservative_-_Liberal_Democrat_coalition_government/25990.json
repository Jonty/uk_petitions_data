This remake was ill-considered and not all true, and if we look at what faith settled here first, that of the Romans, we should be a country for Zeus.\r\nThis kind of leaning toward the pantomime that is American politics, to say nothing of the theocracies of the Middle East, is transparent and manipulative and requires his immediate retraction. The UK is a secular and non superstitious country.",
