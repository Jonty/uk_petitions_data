        "additional_details": "I feel weed/ cannabis if legalized in the UK would be better no black market, taxes paid for the licence to 'deal' ect would stop the shit we get sprayed ect even cafes/ shops we could go to legal places to smoke so we dont offend anyone, I personally wish I could get clean stuff I personally DO NOT SMOKE it right now cause 95% of it is sprayed but IF it was legalized even licensed then how much safer would it be and bonus our government does not see is it would help get us out of recession too, do you agree??? FREEDOM is all we ask for, freedom to chose freedom to purchase freedom to be as we wanna be IF we fry ou brains then thats our problem and not the gov's and they could deny us NHS treatment but thats our choice or should be right??? If you agree SIGN UP     ",
