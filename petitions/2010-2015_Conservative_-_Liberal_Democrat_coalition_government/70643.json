Some pay the ultimate price, but most leave the services, their sacrifice a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nWhile those who are deployed to combat zones are decorated with medals, there are many who have loyally served, prepared to go into combat, but not called upon to do so.\r\n\r\nThey should be honoured with a National Service Medal, awarded to all who have served at least 12 years, as proposed by UKIP.",
