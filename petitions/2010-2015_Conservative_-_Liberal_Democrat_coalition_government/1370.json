There is already pressure for people to save more for their old age which these people will not be able to afford.  When this becomes apparent, young people will opt out of higher education, but in the meantime, there will be a tranche of people who are priced out of life by choosing to  go to University. If the country needs graduates, the taxpayer should pay for them, just as they pay for roads, schools, security etc. etc.  ",
