        "additional_details": "Off road motorcycle riding is discriminated against in the UK.  We don't get any support from any goverment department, local authority, council or such like. We have a right as much as anyone to enjoy our hobbies and have access to dedicated area's for which we should recieve funding and support like any other recongnised sport. Considering some other activities are recognise as sport and are not in any way a physical activity, off road motorcycle sport is very demanding and is requires a high level of fitness and strength. Motorcycles are very popular and maybe a reason for the discrimination we recieve due to mis use by people who have no connection to serious riders.",
