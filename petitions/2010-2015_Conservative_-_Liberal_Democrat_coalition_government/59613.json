They slice these animals with a hook whilst the animal is alive. The sea is full with blood. These people have to pay, this should NOT BE ALLOWED! I want to see these people do time for this and as the government I think use should take a stand and stand up for what is right! These people should not be allowed to get away with this, this is an outrage! We are allowing innocent animals to be killed so people can show how \"manly\" they are. We don't care and neither do the animals. These people have to pay and do time for this!\r\nI would appreciate it if you looked this up and seen for yourself.\r\n",
