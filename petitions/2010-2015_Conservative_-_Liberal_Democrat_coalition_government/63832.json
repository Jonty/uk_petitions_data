        "additional_details": "Currently, if your child attends a schools nursery, there is no priority given when allocating school places.\r\nI believe that children whom attend a schools nursery should be given some priority when allocating school places. This is because those children will have already created bonds with other children and teachers. They will be accustomed to rules and routines within that school. To start full time school can be a stressful time for some children and forcing them to restart and re-establish at a different school could be damaging.",
