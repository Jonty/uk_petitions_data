        "additional_details": "The one off tax (weighted depending on size, e.g. larger companies pay more) will help ease the impact of current austerity measures, specifically funding for example the recently cut youth services, emergency services - including police and the military, community projects and social workers. A realistic amount could well be around \u00a3100million. The tax could even be stretched to include football clubs, footballers themselves, banks, businesses and other industries not included in the FTSE. ",
