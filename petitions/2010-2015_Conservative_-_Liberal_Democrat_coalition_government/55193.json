        "additional_details": "With the speed and volume of road traffic being at an all-time high, it is becoming increasingly important that vulnerable road users, in particularly equestrians have access to safe-off road routes.\r\n\r\nHelp us put a stop to Suffolk County Council's plans to tarmac the surface of BW1 in Mildenhall. This route is just one of three beautiful and rural bridleways in the area.\r\n\r\nThe Council are proposing to contribute to the ever increasing suburbanisation of the countryside by providing a multi-user track which will be surfaced using tarmac. Not only will this deny access to the many horse riders who use and enjoy this route, pushing them on to the nearby busy road, but it will also destroy the rural quality of the area.\r\n\r\nThe surfacing of the bridleway using tarmac is not only dangerous for horse riders, but is totally unnecessary as the track is flat, well drained, not muddy or rutted and can currently be used easily by all classes of user.\r\n",
