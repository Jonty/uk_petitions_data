        "additional_details": "I would like the government to investigate recruitment agents. Certainly during my time of unemployment I have noticed that I have applied for jobs that either have been taken already or are just a figment of the agents imagination to hook jobseekers in.\r\n\r\nTighter controls should be in place to make sure this wide spread abuse no longer takes place. Its hard enough has it is to find work without agents bending the rules if not breaking them.\r\n\r\nIn fact I would suggest that the government completely overhaul the jobcentre plus service so that it becomes the focal point for every job in the UK. The jobcentre plus should be a place where all jobseekers can go to get help to find work, this should include jobs for professional people as well and not just the minimum wage jobs.\r\n\r\nIf jobcentre plus was fit for purpose then there wouldn't be a need for all these agents that make bold promises and deliver very little.",
