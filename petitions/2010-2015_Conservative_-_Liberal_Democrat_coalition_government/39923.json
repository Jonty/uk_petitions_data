        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to instruct NICE change the Current Guidelines which recommend Immediate Cord Clamping to recommend delayed cord clamping for 3-5 minutes.\r\nNICE have formally me that they won't consider a review of their guidelines until November 2014. The current (non evidence based)guidelines are supporting irreversible damage to babies.\r\nResearch has shown that Immediate Cord Clamping deprives the baby of up to 40% of its intended blood supply. Reasearch by Farrar, Dooley et al shows that leaving the cord intact  leads to a weight gain of up to 210g in the five minutes following birth. The weight gain is blood intended for the baby which is rich in stem cells, Blood cells and other natural hormones etc intended to complete the birth process. Research studies by Van Rheenan, Andersson/Brabin and Mercer has proved that Immediate Cord Clamping leads to long anaemia which impedes learning and development. ",
