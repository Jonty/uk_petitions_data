        "additional_details": "We need to see the government bring back National Service for ALL 16-18 year olds.  This must be compulsory.  Granted we have a lot of troubled youngsters in this country and the recent riots confirm this. However, I believe that 18 months compulsory National Service will discipline our youngsters and help them learn respect not only for us but also for themselves.  The future benefits of National Service would see an increase in our armed forces and would also lower the crime rate in years to come.  It would bring people together and make us a stronger opposition in this ever increasingly violent world.",
