        "additional_details": "Schemes are widely available and advertised in the media whereby the well advised wealthy shelter their assets in a trust so that they avoid care home fees. At the same time ordinary hard working thrifty families lose their family assets when  care is needed. The threshold for state funding should be raised from just over \u00a323,000 to \u00a3100,000 and the trust avoidance route blocked to fund the change. The present system is unfair. ",
