India funds a space programme. I realise the disaster in the Philippines but we have our own problems at home with more and more people each day relying on food banks, and other essential services are under threat each day.\r\n\r\nThe money saved should be used for the benefit of the people in this country.\r\n\r\nBasically I want the government to decrease the amount of foreign as I can't understand how the found \u00a350 million pounds to send to the Philippines when we are massively in debt should that money not be used to benefit THIS country.",
