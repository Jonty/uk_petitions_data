        "additional_details": "The Buckinghamshire Learning Trust (an outsource of Buckinghamshire County Council) is proposing cuts to High Wycombe Music Centre, which would mean a loss of many specialist teachers which make HWMC such a success. HWMC provides young people with a place not just to make music, but also make friends, learn skills that are useful for later life (e.g. teamwork) and develop as members of the local community. Please sign this petition to stop the funding cuts, or at least to let them be implemented in a way which will not affect the music centre we know and love so drastically. ",
