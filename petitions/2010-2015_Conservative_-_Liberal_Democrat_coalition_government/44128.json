        "additional_details": "We are calling for the repealling of the Benefit Uprating Bill 2012.\r\n\r\nThe Benefit Uprating Bill has imposed a meagre one per cent increase on working age benefits for three years until 2016. It is believed 7 million families are affected and one million disabled people. Approx 2.5 million unemployed people are also affected.\r\n\r\nThe capped increase means benefits will not increase by rate of inflation but well below the rate of inflation, imposing even more poverty on millions.\r\n\r\nIt is fundamentally wrong to impose poverty on millions whilst giving even more tax cuts for millionaires.\r\n\r\nThe benefit cap, unless it is repealled, also means any Labour government would have to implement the governments cap at the start of any Labour government from 2015.
