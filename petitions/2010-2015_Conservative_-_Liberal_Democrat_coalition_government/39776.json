        "additional_details": "A call for the government to rethink the laws on the medical and recreational use of cannabis.\r\n\r\nTo invest in research into the plant and the benefits it could produce for people suffering with illnesses from multiple sclorosis to depression.\r\nTo consider regulating cannabis in the same way alcohol and tobacco are.\r\nTo consider the, health and economical benefit this could bring; for example,\r\nCannabis is known for its pain killing effects, but it is also fast and easy to grow meaning that a cheap medicine becomes available to those who need it.\r\nAs for the economics of cannabis legalisation; according to recent polls between 2 and 3 million british people use cannabis regularly a year, this presents an opportunity for a government license to grow. For example you charge \u00a3100 a year for a license to grow 5 plants for personal use, now if 2 million people pay this license fee that is \u00a3200,000,000 a year that can be put straight back into the economy.",
