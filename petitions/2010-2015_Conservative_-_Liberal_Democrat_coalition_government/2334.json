The current drug classification system has been shown to bear no relation to relative dangers or actual harm caused. The current laws which ensure huge levels of serious crime, massive illegal profits and no quality control, cause far more harm to society and individuals than a system whereby drugs could be controlled and regulated through government run health clinics.
