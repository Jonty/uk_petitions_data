        "additional_details": "I am fed up with getting hundreds of unsolicited phone calls from \"claims companies\" regarding so called \"accidents\" asking me to claim money that I am \"entitled\" to.\r\n\r\nMost of them say they are from my actual insurance company until you question them, then they come clean with who they really are.\r\n\r\nNo-one was injured and damage was minimal but they still say I can claim over \u00a31000 because \"I am entitled to it\"\r\n\r\nStop this madness now - It is crook companies like this that push up insurance premiums every year. If you genuinely are entitled to a claim for an actual injury then fine but these people are nothing more than \"ambulance chasers\" & once they have \"milked\" you they sell your contact details to the next company.\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition to shut down these frivolous companies",
