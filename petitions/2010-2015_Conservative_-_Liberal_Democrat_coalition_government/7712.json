        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the police to be given the confidence and support they need to stamp-out crime in our communities. It calls for full police powers to be extended to Special Constables, tax breaks for Special and Uniformed officers to increase their pay conditions and encourage enrollment, and for the police to have the authority and powers they need to use appropriate force, where and when necessary and appropriate, to protect persons, property, infrastructure and social order. This includes the provision to the police of the tools (water and 'sound cannon' for crowd dispersal) and to give them freedom to use methods of cessation and arrest without fear of being prosecuted for 'excessive force' by those committing crimes.",
