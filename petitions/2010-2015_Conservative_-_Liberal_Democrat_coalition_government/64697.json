        "additional_details": "Why can all politicians in local, central and European government vote in favour, against or abstain, yet a member of the public cannot abstain in an election to vote for 'none of the above'?\r\n\r\nThis petition asks for the right to abstain as a legitimate vote and that an abstention is counted in ALL elections.\r\n\r\nMany people have died to secure the right to vote, and not casting a vote should never be an option, but an abstention means that you have taken the trouble to vote but simply do not support any of the policies or people seeking to represent you.\r\n\r\nApathy or laziness are given as the reasons for a low turn out, yet I believe that an absence of credible candidates, unconvincing arguments or no interest in the issues at hand are more often the cause.\r\n\r\nSpoiling a ballot paper is not the same. If it were politicians would do it.\r\n\r\nPoliticians must represent the people that elect them. If abstaining is a legitimate vote for a politician, why should it not be for the rest of us?",
