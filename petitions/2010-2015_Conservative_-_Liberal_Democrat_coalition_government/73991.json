        "additional_details": "In the light of the abnormally increased Terror threat being experienced by may Western Democracies it is now time for the Governments of said Democracies to properly regulate the use of Social Media(SM). SM has been clearly identified as a most effective tool and weapon in the extremists army. It is used to communicate with thier followers, post anti western propaganda and also advertise thier barbaric practices including the heinous executions of Western hostages. All main global SM sites now need to be regulated and legally bound to change thier account creation software to force all users to identifiy themselves, ideally with a credit card for example. It should no longer be possible for a lone terrorist to sit in a cafe in a far flung land and open up 1000 anonymous Twitter accounts. ",
