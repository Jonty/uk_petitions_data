        "additional_details": "People in England with long-term medical conditions are struggling to afford their prescriptions. This reduces their ability to manage their condition and increases their risk of serious illness, unemployment and dependence on the state for support and care.\r\nThis is a ticking time bomb and could lead to much greater Government spending on health in the long term. In order to help people manage their conditions safely and ensure better health outcomes, the Government must address the ever increasing cost of prescriptions. We call on the Government to honour its commitment to make the prescription charges system in England fairer by: freezing prescription charges until the end of the current Parliament; increasing awareness and uptake of prescription prepayment certificates and continuing the freeze on the cost of these certificates until the end of the Parliament and; aiming to make prescriptions free for people with long-term medical conditions.\r\n",
