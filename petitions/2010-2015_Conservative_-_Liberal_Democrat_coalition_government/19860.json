        "additional_details": "Minutes after a popular concert has sold out, tickets emerge on online auction sites with massively inflated prices. People buy tickets for concerts they have no intention of attending just to exploit the wallets of true fans. It's bad enough having the touts outside the venues the night of the gig, but the internet makes it far too easy for them and has seen the emergence of the e-tout.  It's a disgrace that this is allowed to happen.",
