        "action": "Relax planning regulations for garden decking",
        "additional_details": "Decking is a permitted development and in the vast majority of cases no planning permission is required prior to installation.\r\n\r\nThere are currently two main exceptions to this rule within the UK\u2019s Building Regulations; raised decking that sits more than a specific height above the ground, and decks that cover a certain percentage of the garden area. A detailed explanation of how the rules effect decking installations can be found at www.timberdeckingwarehouse.co.uk\r\n\r\nIn the majority of cases, regulations set the maximum area that a deck installation can cover to be no more than 50 per cent of a property\u2019s garden area. This regulation is particularly restrictive for those living in smaller dwellings, where the garden area is often very modest in size.\r\n\r\nSign this petition for the 50 per cent maximum size rule to be relaxed for properties with gardens under 30 square meters in size, so that owners of smaller properties are allowed to make the most of the space they have available.",
