        "additional_details": "All departmental and qango budgets should be subject to annual scrutiny, including the power of veto, by the relevant select committee of parliament. This will help to make permanent secretaries and qango heads, neither of whom are elected, accountable to elected MPs. Those making decisions on behalf of the public should be held responsible for those decisions, and this includes how budgets are spent and whether officials and qangos are providing value for the taxpayer.",
