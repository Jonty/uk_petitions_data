        "action": "Guarantee Dental Foundation Training places for UK graduates",
        "additional_details": "In 2012 35 dentistry graduates from UK institutions were not allocated a Dental Foundation Training Place. Because completion of Dental Foundation Training is a prerequisite for newly-qualified dentists wishing to provide NHS care, these individuals will be disqualified from caring for NHS patients.\r\n\r\nTraining these individuals will have cost UK taxpayers approximately \u00a3150,000 per graduate. The graduates themselves will also have taken on significant amounts of debt in order to complete their degrees.\r\n\r\nThe signatories to this e-petition believe that what has happened this year is unacceptable because it has squandered taxpayers\u2019 money and betrayed those who have strived hard to pursue a career providing NHS dental care.\r\n\r\nThey therefore call upon the Department for Health to meet the challenge set out in the British Dental Association\u2019s recently-published YDC Asks document for every dentistry graduate from a UK institution to be guaranteed a Dental Foundation Training place.",
