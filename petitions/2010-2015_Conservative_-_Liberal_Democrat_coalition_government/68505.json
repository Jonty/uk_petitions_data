        "additional_details": "Change the law to create a mandatory cooling off period for new gym membership agreements.\r\n\r\nCurrently, too many people are getting caught with hidden clauses within gym memberships that tie members into long term deals or fail to highlight restrictions / mandatory terms of the contract.\r\n\r\nIn most areas of consumer law there are cooling off periods, within which a buyer would be able to cancel the contract without penalty, this is not the case with gym membership. Once signed you are tied in for the duration. This is an unfair practice and should be stopped.\r\n\r\nThe creation of a mandatory 14 day cooling off period would allow the new member to cancel their contract if for any reason they are not happy with the contract.",
