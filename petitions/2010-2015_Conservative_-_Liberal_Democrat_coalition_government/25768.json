        "additional_details": "\r\nSupport the campaign to allow Fellows and Members of The Engineering Council to use the pre-nominal title Engr.\r\n\r\nThis is one way of promoting the Institution and encouraging fellowship among members. In addition any person using the pre-nominal 'Engr.' denotes they are either a Fellow or a Member of the Institution and possess an engineering qualification accredited by The Engineering Council, thus overcoming a long standing issue of misuse of the 'Engineer' title.\r\n\r\nThe use of the pre-nominal title 'Engr.' in the UK would also give parity with Engineers throughout Europe:\r\n\r\nIng. in Spain, used as a pre-nominal.\r\nEng. in Portugal, used as a pre-nominal.\r\nIr. in Belgium & the Netherlands (pre-nominal letters)\r\nIng. in Italy & Czech Republic and Slovak republics (used as a pre-nominal)\r\n\r\nPlease support this campaign,\r\n\r\nDavid Cole\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
