        "additional_details": "Given the announcement that he is to face charges of perverting the course of justice, it is felt that Chris Huhne should step down as the MP for Eastleigh. The matter of his innocence or guilt in the matter is irrelevant; mud sticks. The events surrounding this case have brought shame to his constituents, not just in the town of Eastleigh but in the surrounding areas that he also represents. Step down, Mr Huhne, while whatever little dignity you have remains. ",
