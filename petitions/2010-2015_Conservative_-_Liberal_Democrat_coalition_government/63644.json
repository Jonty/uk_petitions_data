        "action": "Reverse the increase in county court fees",
        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the Government to reverse the large increase in court fees for county courts that take effect on 22 April 2014.\r\n\r\nA small business that is owed, for example, between \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,000 will see the fee to issue a court claim increase from \u00a3245  to \u00a3445.  A 81% increase!  Also, the fee to issue a non money claim such as a claim for repossession will now be \u00a3280. In the real world, when a customer decides not to pay a small business without a genuine reason, what it wants is to be able to recover the unpaid accounts so that it can survive. These outrageous increases will reduce access to justice and the frustration will undoubtedly lead to some using unlawful means to recover money that is lawfully due.  The Government wants us to believe that it is trying to remove bullying debt collectors and bailiffs, but the increase in court fees will have the reverse effect.",
