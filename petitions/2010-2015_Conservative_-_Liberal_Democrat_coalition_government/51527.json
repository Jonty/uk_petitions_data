A very heavy price was paid. We call on the Government to show due respect for these war heros and their families and mark 2014  as a PATRIOTIC event and not be given the low key suggested by some Ministers for worry of causing offence to Germany. It is an insult to their memory to try rewrite history. There should be a 1914 Patriotic Bank Holiday as a mark of the event so that every member of every family can be a part of the commemorations not just the selected few who will attend Westminster Abbey.
