        "additional_details": "This petition proposes that due to the current economic climate and the effect of 'cost of living' increases on the budgets of the general Public of this country, MPs should not receive the 11% pay rise Ipsa are 'forcing' on them.\r\n\r\nTheir current salary of \u00a366,396 is more than sufficient and should therefore remain unchanged in this current economic climate.\r\n\r\nThe proposed Ipsa increase should be re-directed into Government budgets instead, to help reduce the cuts to those budgets which George Osborne announced in the Government spending review in June 2013 and help fund the 1% increase for Nurses and Teachers, etc.\r\n\r\nIf an MP is paid this increase, they should even donate the increase to the Government budget pot if necessary, to ensure this happens.",
