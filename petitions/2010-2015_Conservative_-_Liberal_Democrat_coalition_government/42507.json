These extra profits will encourage them to find other ways of encouraging larger sales.\r\nA notice of 1 metre by 50 cm explaining why the levy is necessary , such as, cirrhosis of the liver, heart problems, unwanted  pregnancies, abortions , etc.  etc. Should be clearly displayed where ever alcohol is sold.\r\n",
