        "additional_details": "Formula One Management (FOM) has recently decided to sell its TV Broadcasting Rights for 2012 onwards to both the BBC and Sky TV.   Sky TV has rights for the entire season, whilst the BBC has the rights for 50% of the season.  FOM states this is not in breach of the clause stating that F1 must be broadcast 'free-to-air' in major European markets such as the UK - due to the BBC showing 50% of the season.\r\n\r\nWe want the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, to look at this issue - in the light of the fact that by agreeing to this deal, the BBC, funded by licence payers - has enabled Formula One to be broadcast exclusively by Sky, by providing necessary 'free-to-air' credentials.\r\n\r\nFormula One is a big industry in the UK with several teams based here and many people employed in related engineering and manufacturing jobs,  this deal threatens the very foundations of Formula One.
