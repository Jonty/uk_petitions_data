Teaching them the skills which are needed in life e.g cooking, healthy living and taking care of the home and family. maybe we would have a better society and a better group of young people rather than mother's or father's being forced into work when the best and most rewarding job is to bring up a respectful child who can become an adult who is capable of the bascis to be sucessful in life and i think we have lost the importance of brining up a family.
