        "additional_details": "David Cameron's statements regarding Norway & Switzerland are factually incorrect. A huge amount of technical legislation is formulated at global or regional level, in bodies such as UNECE (on which Norway is represented) and then handed down to the EU institutions as \u201cdiqules\u201d which cannot, in substance, be changed. Thus Norway, for example, has a considerable say in the nature of regulation, long before it gets anywhere near the EU. As members of EFTA both Norway and Switzerland are represented on over 200 EEA committees which assist in the framing of Single Market legislation; also members of EFTA have the ability to refuse to implement any Directive the European Commission produces; something that Norway did do in respect of the 3rd Postal Directive and appears about to do with the latest oil-drilling proposal.\r\n\r\nWe demand a public apology from David Cameron for misleading the British public:\r\n\r\n",
