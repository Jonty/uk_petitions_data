        "additional_details": "For parking in a parking bay, normal charge is \u00a33-\u00a37 for an hour. But when giving penalty it is \u00a365 to \u00a3130 which is  unproportionate to its original charge. Penalty Should not be more than its original value. But currently penalty is more than 1000% of its original value and  there is no legal ground of doing such unfairness.So it should be reduced to \u00a310 which is closer to its original value.",
