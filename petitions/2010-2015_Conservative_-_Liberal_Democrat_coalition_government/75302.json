Anytime now, I will be asked to leave my job due to not being hygienic. A diet so strict is not the answer for us sufferers. The antibiotics recommended by the health care profession only contributes to depression and vomiting. We need this disease to be recognised as a disability and we need proper funds for the research. No one deserves this kind of torture.\r\n\r\nI need 100,000 signatures to be heard.\r\n\r\nDoes one need to take their life before their voice gets heard? ",
