        "additional_details": "To:\r\nTheresa May, British Home Secretary\r\nEvery year, hundreds of women who come to this country to seek safety from persecution are being detained in Yarl\u2019s Wood detention centre in Bedfordshire.\r\nResearch by Women for Refugee Women shows that the majority of these women say they have experienced rape, sexual violence and torture in their home countries.\r\nThe impact of detention on women is devastating. Many become depressed and suicidal. These women have not committed any crime, and yet they are being locked up indefinitely.\r\nWe are asking you to ensure the government stops detaining women who have come to this country to seek asylum. Women\u2019s asylum cases can be considered while they live in the community.\r\n It\u2019s possible to create an asylum process which treats women who have survived rape and torture with dignity and humanity. They deserve a fair hearing and a chance to rebuild their lives.",
