        "additional_details": "Petition for the reintroduction of the Death sentence in light of the Daniel Pelka case. We as a Human community will not stand for such vile behaviour inflicted or supported by others deemed nothing more than criminals in the court of law. As tax paying citizens of the UK, we feel it unfit to use Our money to support the life of others who inflict pain and suffering upon the defenceless nature of a child. Enough is enough and we would like the government to discuss and use the evidence from the  judicial system to reinstate the use of the death sentence upon the stated above.",
