        "additional_details": "Give lorry drivers discounts at service stations during rush-hours to persuade them off the road. They have to take compulsory breaks and if they have them at the times when traffic is busy, the roads will be slightly clearer, especially motorways. If the lorry drivers have a discount on meals at service stations they will be persuaded to take breaks during rush-hours and the roads will be clearer because the large vehicles are off the road.",
