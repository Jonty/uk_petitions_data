        "action": "Cats should wear birdsafe collars to reduce bird predation and be limited to one cat per household.",
        "additional_details": "The most recent figures are from the Mammal Society, which estimates that the UK's cats catch up to 275 million prey items a year, of which 55 million are birds. This is the number of prey items that were known to have been caught; we don't know how many more the cats caught, but didn't bring home, or how many escaped but subsequently died. Despite the lack of scientific evidence that cat predation is effecting bird population, common sence would suggest it is. A simple remedy, limit the cat population to one cat per houshold, and make it wear a brightly coloured birdsafe type collar that can warn birds of stalking cats.",
