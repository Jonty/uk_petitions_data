        "additional_details": "Quite rightly the government is trying to tackle the yobbish behavior of those binging on cheap alcohol by introducing a minimum pricer per unit. We have seen the results of MP Eric Joyce, fueled on cheap super strength lager, viciously assaulting four of his fellow imbibers in the strangers bar at the House of Commons. I propose that the minimum price for alcohol in all bars at the House of Commons be set at a price equal to that of the nearest pub, The Red Lion.",
