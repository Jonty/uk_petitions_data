        "additional_details": "Hidden away in the last two Budget speeches was the Chancellors intention to bring in a two-tier State Pension in 2015/16. Existing pensioners (having paid their full 40 yrs of NIC's) will continue to receive the index-linked pension currently on offer, topped up by means-testing. New pensioners after that date will receive c\u00a3140 per week (having only 30 yrs of NIC contributions, with no means-testing). The Treasury is talking about fairness all the while - but where is the fairness in this particular policy? Surely it would be fairer to treat all pensioners the same - perhaps a standard pension for everyone eligible, with no means-testing whatsoever, after all the government are always telling us that means-testing is expensive to administer.",
