        "additional_details": "Reduce the university fees for thoSe who are resident in the UK and are undergraduates. Many politicians complain about young people not having work or furthering their education but the whole reason we can't is because of them. They claim that we should be studying and expanding our education but how can we if money is really tight? Not every family is very fortunate. The current \u00a39000 a yer per subject is a bit too much especially for those who want to complete multiple years of study. This then leaves people in tons of debt. There should be a significant discount for residents of the UK.",
