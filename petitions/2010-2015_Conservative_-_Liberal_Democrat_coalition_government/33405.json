DLA should be given to all children regardless of age.  Teenagers need as much help as young children if not more due to increase in hormones and vulnerability of their condition.  A 14 year old child still needs help with insulin doses, night time hypos, sickness, hospitilisation, carb counting, correcting insulin doses, the list is endless.Financial support is crucial to help families with the cost of raising a diabetic child and manage their extra responsibilities.  DLA is needed for ALL of our children.",
