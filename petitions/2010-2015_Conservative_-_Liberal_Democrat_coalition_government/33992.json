(Those not trained, will have their licences revoked).\r\n\r\nThousands of Training providers have seen this legislation as a profitable venture, receiving approx \u00a31800-00 per person for NVQ/CPC training from government funds JAUNT. Drivers may also be required to pay themselves ! This is Not Fair on Drivers, the Industry, or the Tax Payer.\r\n\r\nA drivers competence is assessed when a driver passes his/her driving test.\r\n\r\nDue to the variation of work involved particularly within HGV Road Haulage, further competence training should be left to the responsibility of the employer, for the role that the driver is undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe Police and VOSA already have sufficient powers to deal with drivers/operators.\r\n\r\nIt is requested that the CPC Legislation be Abolished/Scrapped, before September 2014.",
