        "additional_details": "Pellens Corner, a crossroad in Great Bromley, Essex, was redesigned in March 2012 following fatal accidents.\r\n\r\nBut since the work there have been more crashes and drivers say the layout is dangerous and confusing.\r\n\r\nWork costing \u00a3200,000 reduced a short stretch of dual carriageway between Horsley Cross and Little Bentley to a single carriageway. The central reservations were also widened.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this petition (April 19 2012) The Harwich and Manningtree Standard had reported three accidents on the road around this new layout, involving elderly drivers and young children.\r\n\r\nWe want the Highways Agency to make this road safer by implementing a roundabout or a reduced speed limit.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to support the Harwich and Manningtree Standard campaign - The A120: Spend the Cash Now, Save Lives.",
