        "additional_details": "PhD students in their final year (writing up) are asked to pay full council tax, however, they are still studying full time to meet deadlines. Moreover, the funding is only for first 3 years due to which they do not have any income. In these circumstances, how can they pay council tax and why should they pay it?\r\n\r\nThe current policy is unfair. Final year students in Oxford and Cambridge do not have to pay council tax during their writing up. Councils should acknowledge the critical circumstance of the writing up students and need to waiver the tax. ",
