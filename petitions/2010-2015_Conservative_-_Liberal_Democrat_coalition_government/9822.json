        "additional_details": "I believe that for many years a underclass of British people have developed to live on the dole/benefits...\r\n\r\nThey leave school,  get the dole, have children and so perpetuate the cycle.  If a person leaves school and has not had a job by 23-24 he will never work.\r\n\r\nHe or she will lack the skills, confidence and energy to ever provide for himself and his family.  In many cases these idle hands will turn to some degree of criminality as we have just seen in the recent riots.After all what else do they have to do, and where else can they get expensive clothes and gadgets from?\r\n\r\nThe government should give all school leavers 6 months to secure work or further education, and then all benefits should be cut unless the person continues in education, joins the services, or takes part in government schemes which should be created wherever there is community need, to sweep the roads if necessary to keep people in work from 9-5 offer training, give confidence and introduce a work ethic.",
