        "additional_details": "Age Discrimination in the UK is very serious and has unfair implications for millions. The Age Discrimination laws are bias to industry against the people of the UK.  For 2010, 5400 got to court and only 95 cases successful from a staggering 29.2 million work force. Today\u2019s Economic resourcing models for industry include no balance on social or long term vision. Registering as unemployed for 50+ is clearly flawed as 1. \u201cJoint means testing\u201d automatically excludes many millions of any support and 2. the Government\u2019s reduction to 30 years NI contributions also negates peoples need to \u201csign on\u201d as unemployed, and we must question the numbers of unemployed and the massive invisible workforce. The vision of all 50+ able to support Care in the private sector future, is totally incorrect, with younger also to this fate. The Government should action these issues immediately. I am promoting \u201cFAIRNESS for All AGE'S\u201d.",
