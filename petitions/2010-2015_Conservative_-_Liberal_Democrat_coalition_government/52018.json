        "additional_details": "We the under signed believe the law of the land with in the uk,requires to be changed and for it to clearly state that no puppy or kitten may be sold or given away or  numeration be accepted so that it may  leave its birth home before 8 weeks from its birth date. No current act of law states an age clearly defined of 8 weeks, we ask that this 8 week be defined in law. This will empower many organisations and assist in a more well rounded development of puppy and kittens in this country  and stop the hobby breeder selling an animal below the age of 8 weeks",
