        "additional_details": "In a recent survey, Cornwall was found to have the greatest amount of second homes in the UK. These push up local house prices and prevent the local population (whose average wages are below the UK average and well below average local house prices) from buying their own home.\r\nI propose a significant increase in the council tax payable on these second properties or an annual surtax based upon the property's value.",
