        "additional_details": "On the evening of 08/12/14, West Midlands police officers were ordered to return to base due to an urgent security situation. This is unprecedented in mordern times and undermines the publics trust in the police force. Perhaps the only saving grace is that the 'pure baltic' weather conditions prevented anyone from bothering to riot.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, believe that to prevent a similar situation occurring in the future, the police officers of the West Midlands should be armed. However, it is only right that officers are given superiority in any impending conflict with vagrants, criminals, uncouths, terrorists and escaped animals. Whilst a pistol may provide parity, only a 'personal safety bazooka' can guarantee superiority.\r\n\r\nTo arm the 7442 officers of the West Midlands (I looked on Wikipedia), with the FGM-148 Javelin bazooka, at a unit cost of \u00a3157K, it would only cost \u00a31.170Bn.\r\n\r\nWe urge the government to give our crime-fighters the ultimate personal safety tool.",
