My petition calls for the government to immediately deport all & any imigrants & asylum seekers who commit ANY criminal offence. This should include their family and dependants and may go some way to encouraging economic migrants and asylum seekers to respect the British way of life and appreciate the fact that they are here in the first place.\r\nImigration is out of control and asylum seekers are here as our guests and yet large numbers of them continue to \"Bite the hand that feeds\" without any respect for the British tax payer that has to pay for them to be here. If they cannot comply with our laws then send them home.",
