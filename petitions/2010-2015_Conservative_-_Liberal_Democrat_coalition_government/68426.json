The main aim is to create a place for children with ASD to learn skills without education being the main focus. The Centre aims to provide a new social place for Waltham Abbey.\r\nThe Centre wants to be able to create a family centre which will include many attractions that will be available for the children at the centre as well as the whole community to enjoy.  ASD needs to be understood by our community and embraced by all. With that in mind The Centre wants to put Waltham Abbey back on the map for a very positive reason. Creating jobs and increasing visitors to the town. Imagine a place where those with severe ASD can live and grow without feeling pressure to conform to a society that clearly lacks empathy and understanding for those with the condition? How can we expect them to join our world if we are not willing to explore and understand theirs\r\n",
