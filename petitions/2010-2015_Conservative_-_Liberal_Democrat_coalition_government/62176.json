        "additional_details": "I am fighting for justice for animals: there needs to be a change in the law so that people are held accountable for their negligence.\r\n\r\nI lost my 6 year old cat Alfie due to medical error and misdiagnosis. I have tried to sue the specialist vet for medical misconduct and negligence but have been advised that I have no legal recourse as I suffered no financial loss. This is because i had pet insurance. I was told that if this had happened to a human I would have legal redress. I then pleaded with the disciplinary body for veterinary surgeons (RCVS) to investigate and they refused. I am trying to change the law and polices to provide legal recourse or assistance from a regulatory body in such unfortunate circumstances. Alfie was a member of my family and I loved him with all my heart.",
