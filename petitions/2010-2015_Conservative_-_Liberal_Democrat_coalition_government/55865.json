        "additional_details": "We the undersigned want the SAME laws and punishment as JUMPING RED TRAFFIC LIGHTS for the ones who go around TRAIN CROSSING BARRIERS, JUMP OVER THEM and go UNDER them as at this time, this can and do cause issues with the train driver`s, as well as risking their own lives and is a stupid thing to do which costs the EMERGENCY SERVICES time and money when someone gets hit, the same laws and regulations should apply to TRAFFIC LIGHTS and TRAIN BARRIERS which makes sense due to the same dangers with both.\r\n\r\nThanks",
