        "additional_details": "Call for a change in the law to make it a criminal offence if the non resident parent refuses to provide financial support for their child/children. To make it a criminal offence not to give full financial disclosure. To give the CSA more powers to investigate and track down non payers. To force the non resident parent to provide evidence of how they financially support their lifestyle. We, mainly mothers, feel let down by the CSA. We are left with the full financial responsibility of raising and maintaining our children. The biggest issue is the self employed who lie about their earnings and work cash in hand. Some of us are told that there is nothing more the CSA can do because they can find no record of them and therefor make a judgment of a nil assessment. Parental responsibility clearly states that both parents are equally required to provide a roof over their child's head and to financially maintain them. How can they be allowed to continually breach this?",
