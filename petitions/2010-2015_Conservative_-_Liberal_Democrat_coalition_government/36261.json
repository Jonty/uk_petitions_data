Therefore it is not a criminal offence for someone that is HIV positive to put someone else at risk if they do not become infected. I am petitioning for the law to be changed to include 'reckless endangerment' whereby a person that is knowingly HIV positive would be committing a crime if they do not disclose their status to a sexual partner whether they become infected or not, as per the law in Scotland.
