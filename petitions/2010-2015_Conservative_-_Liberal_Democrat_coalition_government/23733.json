It is also highly relevant that the population understand and experience the basis for religious belief systems alongside evolutionist belief systems.\r\n\r\nFinding an English educated person who has made an informed choice, who has examined and validated the assumptions they have made to reach that choice is unfortunately rare.\r\n\r\nInstead the common option is choose to trust, and then hang vigorously onto opinions of people they look up to, rather than gain a solid and simple understanding of what they actually believe.\r\n",
