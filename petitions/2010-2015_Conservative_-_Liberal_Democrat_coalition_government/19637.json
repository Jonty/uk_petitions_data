        "additional_details": "Human trafficking is serious, international, organised crime. The money generated from it (an estimated $32 billion per annum worldwide) is only marginally less than from arms dealing and drug smuggling. Tackling it is a priority for all political parties and the current Government.\r\nMuch effort is expended by NGOs, Police, Social Services and other key Government agencies, to tackle human trafficking in the UK and protect its victims. However currently there is no independent monitoring system to ensure that work is effective and coordinated.\r\nWe call on the Government to establish an independent watchdog, in line with the recommendations of the CoE Convention on trafficking in human beings (#29.4), to which the UK is a party, to monitor the performance of key agencies ensuring that victims\u2019 needs and experience are central. The watchdog should report to Parliament on a regular basis to ensure transparency and accountability.\r\n",
