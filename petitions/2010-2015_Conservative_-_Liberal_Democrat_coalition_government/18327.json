If successful, this will mean that Britain will have to pay means-tested, residence-based benefits \u2013 employment support allowance, pension credit and, income support \u2013 to people when they arrive, even if they have never worked here or paid any contributions and regardless of whether they have any previous link with the UK.  This is likely to cost the UK tax payer in excess of \u00a32bn and can surely not be right|?",
