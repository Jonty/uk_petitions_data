        "action": "Dismiss Lord Patten from the BBC Trust",
        "additional_details": "We the undersigned urge HM's Government to dismiss Lord Patten as Chairman of the BBC Trust.\r\n\r\nHis defence of the BBC in the past few weeks - in the face of indisputable evidence of wrongdoing and incompetence - has demonstrated an unacceptable level of arrogance.  For example, he told the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport - who is responsible for the media sector - not to interfere with the regulation of the BBC, claiming he had everything under control.  Clearly he didn't.  Clearly the Secretary of State was right - as proven by the subsequent defamation of an honourable former Cabinet member.\r\n\r\nLord Patten has clearly failed to hold the BBC to account.    Rather than doing the honourable thing and resigning, he is trying to cling to power.  He is totally out of touch with public sentiment.\r\n\r\nLord Patten is clearly not the right person to clean up the BBC and restore its reputation.",
