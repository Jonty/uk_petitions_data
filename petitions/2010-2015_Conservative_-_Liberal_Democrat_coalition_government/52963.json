At the moment, a standard dairy farmer makes less than 20p per litre after labour and machinery cost but still have other costs and tax to go. If theese low prices continue, dairy farmers will either go on strike or will be forced to quit dairy farming all together.If enough people do this, there will be a shortage of milk. Sign this petition for a fair price for milk.                       ",
