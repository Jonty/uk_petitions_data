If this were to occur in the civil service sector, the worker in question would be removed from his/her post immediately. Of course, this is unjust, as Members of Parliament are no different to hard working civilians, and so we believe that they should be treated in the same way.\r\nThis petition is to encourage the prohibition of running for re-election for those MPs who have been found to be guilty of meddling in expenses.",
