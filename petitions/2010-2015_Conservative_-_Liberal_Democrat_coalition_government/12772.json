        "additional_details": "please sign this petition if you agree that all illegal drugs should be made legal. making drug addiction a medical issue rather than a criminal issue. this would free up our prisons costing the british public less tax and also give the chance to serial drug users to get real help with out the fear of stigmatization in the local community. also i believe it would take the power away from drug dealers and would lead to a regulated market in the UK. i also believe if all drugs where made legal that there would be a massive impact in the reduction of crime in this country.",
