        "additional_details": "There are many towns and cities with a girls' comprehensive high schools, but, even though it is a rapidly expanding town, Ipswich doesn't seem to be one of them. To get into a girls' school in Ipswich, or even Suffolk, you'd need to pay unimaginable fees. What the people of Ipswich are looking for is free girls' high school education. If the government decides to go ahead with decisions like this, it will benefit the towns and be a great service. If schools are not mixed then it may promote enthusiasm within the classroom, as the opposite gender is usually a distraction for most students. Also, the end-of-school results may improve, as it is a known trend that most, if not all, seperate gender schools get much better GCSE results. The only support this petition needs, is your contribution, which is just a click of a button away. Sign this petition. With thanks.",
