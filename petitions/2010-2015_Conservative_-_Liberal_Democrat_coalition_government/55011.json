Why don't schools and NHS work together in preventing measures of future incidents of abuse and killing. Every year from the time child enters schools there should be one day made for child's health check up; weight, height, eyesight, hygiene and mental development. That can be done either in schools or local GP surgery. It will give chance for early detection of abuse and negligence at home and also it will help in quick or early diagnosis in serious health issues. There are more children out there just like Baby P, Khyra Ishaq, Daniel Pelka ..... Lets stop this NOW!  Our children are our hopes, our seeds for better tomorrow. Our duty is to help them grow and develop safely and that's all it takes. ",
