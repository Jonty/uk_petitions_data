        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, think that all level crossings (where road traffic crosses train tracks) should be abolished, and bridges put in place. Level crossings are a cheap way out of building a bridge, but they cost lives. Not only can signal failures prove fatal as a result of these crossings, but they are also incredibly dangerous for young children, as the barriers between the pavement and tracks are often rather minimal, and to a child, it can look safe, and the child runs out in front of the train and is killed. This has happened in the past. Furthermore, they give people an opportunity to commit suicide, but also kill some others in the process. This has also happened before.\r\n\r\nWithout level crossings, Britain's roads will be a safer place- for pedestrians, drivers, train passengers, and children. ",
