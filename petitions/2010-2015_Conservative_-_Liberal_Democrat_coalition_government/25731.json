Many hospices won\u2019t do this. St. Christopher\u2019s open a wide range of services so that patients can enjoy their time there, from a gym to a hairdressing salon.\r\nIf Patients want to be looked after in the hospice that is fine but many people would rather be treated at home which is also fine.\r\nExtra funding could go to opening more services or drip machines for home use.\r\n",
