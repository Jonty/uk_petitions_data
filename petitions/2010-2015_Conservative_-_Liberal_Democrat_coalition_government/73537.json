        "additional_details": "We would like to have Sir Tom Windsor removed from his position as HMIC due to the shambolic way in which the British Police Service has been treated. Once a world renowned Institution now only a shadow of it's former. A reduction of police officers on the streets will only result in higher crime figures and less reassurance for the tax paying public . We would like a judicial review on the role of the current HMIC and to his scathing report on the police service ",
