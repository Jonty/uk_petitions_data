        "additional_details": "Why should police committing crimes be investigated by a different organization? Criminals should be dealt with by the courts not the IPCC. Its unequal for these uniformed criminals to be treated differently. Put the evidence before the CPS and the court. Not a pro police organization. That way the good police officers will earn respect and retain respect. Police are no longer trusted by the general public. Police getting a criminal record after joining should be dismissed and barred from rejoining.",
