        "additional_details": "After the tragic news of a young girl collapsing during a game at Cadley FC on Sunday 19th October 2014, I call for an act to be passed whereby the Government helps fund for all sporting venues to have an automatic defibrillator. They are simple to use and could help prevent such tragedies from happening. Despite efforts to resuscitate the young female she unfortunately passed away. If an AED had been available this could have been prevented. Please sign so this matter can be brought to the Government's attention. Thank you.",
