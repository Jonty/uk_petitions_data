        "additional_details": "With the horrific terror offences in France in mind I believe there should be a comprehensive public education undertaking to explain that freedom of expression and speech is there to protect ideas and opposing views that some may find \"offensive\".\r\n\r\nCertain members of the public think they should be able to go through life un-offended, whilst simultaneously causing offence to others, and as far as I can see there is no guarantee of this anywhere in our legislation. Freedom of speech is the freedom to offend.\r\n\r\nMake EVERYONE aware saying something is offensive is not an excuse to stop the discussion and crack down hard on the people who want to suppress the freedom of expression within our society, especially when is comes to religious hardliners who perpetrate the most horrific crimes in the name of \"peace\".",
