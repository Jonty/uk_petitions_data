        "additional_details": "This petition is set up to try to stop Tesco from building a supermarket in The town of Bude in North Cornwall. Bude already has a range of wonderful, independent shops and 3 other major supermarkets. We feel that if yet another supermarket, TESCO, muscles in it will be more than the beginning of the end for the independents and the town as a whole, which is a lovely holiday destination. We would like government to look at stopping the march of supermarkets and so encourage smaller traders to thrive. ",
