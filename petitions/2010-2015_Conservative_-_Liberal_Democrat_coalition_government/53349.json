MANY THANKS TO OUR DISHONOURABLE ELECTEDS WHO SOLD IT ALL OFF)) on electricity supplied during the rest of the week when people, naturally, use more of it running the household for workers and schoolchildren.  THIS SCAM NEEDS TO BE STOPPED BUT OUR DISHONOURABLES HAVE NO POWER SO WE MUST RELY ON OUR LEGAL SYSTEM.",
