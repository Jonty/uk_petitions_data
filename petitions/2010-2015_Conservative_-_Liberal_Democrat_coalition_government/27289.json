        "additional_details": "I have always felt that ,as motorist we are all at some greater risk whilst driving under road bridges. It really frightens me, whenever I am on the roads, and I can see people loitering on road bridges.\r\n\r\nBridges are necessary but dangerous places, and it should not be so easy for someone to hurl themself off a bridge, into the path of moving vehicles. It should not be as easy to hurl things over the edge of a bridge.\r\n\r\nIn my estimation,for this to happen once,would be once too often,however this happens time and again,\r\nand I think its time the matter was looked into, with a view to doing something about the existing situation.\r\n\r\nMy campaign seeks to bring this matter to the attention  of:-\r\n\r\n1. The Government Department,with the responsibility\r\nfor Bridges.\r\n\r\n2. To see how many people feel as strongly as I do about this matter.\r\n\r\n3. To propose some form of Safety Netting along the edge of Bridges and Flyovers.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
