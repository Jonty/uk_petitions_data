        "additional_details": "This epetition would like to propose the following:\r\n\r\nMerge current road tax with fuel duty.\r\n\r\nReplace the current road tax disc with MOT  and insurance discs.\r\n\r\nThese proposals are aimed at creating an environmental tax, where all vehichles are taxed and therefore do not require sorn etc.\r\nThis will allow the Government to reduse the staff at the DVLA, so delivering better value for money to the tax payer.\r\n\r\nAlso by having Insurance and MOT discs, this will assist in the easy identification of current documentation.",
