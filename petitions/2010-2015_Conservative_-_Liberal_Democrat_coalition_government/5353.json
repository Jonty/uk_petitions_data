        "additional_details": "Many caravans and trailers (horse boxes for example) can weigh as much, if not more than a small family car. Their use creates wear and tear on the road system. Caravan and trailer owners should be brought into the same tax system as car owners in that they should pay a duty to use the road or complete a SORN. There are 498,000 caravan users alone out there, together with an unknown trailer users and asking for a contribution to the repair and upkeep of the roads seems quite reasonable to me. Any income raised can be put directly to repairing pot-holes initially and other improvements thereafter.",
