        "additional_details": "Thousands of people throughout the UK are dying from Air Pollution confirmed by a recent World Health Organisation report.The Government and Local Authorities have failed to implement effective Air Quality Strategies and the EU are taking action to fine the UK.In London improper and unlawful transport policies have failed to reduce harmful emissions and these ineffective policies are replicated nationwide\r\nThroughout the country many applications for Incinerators are not complying with proper process resulting in improper approval being given.\r\nIn Trafford an Incinerator application was refused by the Local Authority on the grounds that it was in an Air Quality Management Area.The Secretary of State then overturned this decision, which in itself is improper process.It seems that decisions and processes are being improperly influenced by financial considerations.A Public Inquiry is urgently needed to investigate and expose the failures which are causing thousands of deaths each year.",
