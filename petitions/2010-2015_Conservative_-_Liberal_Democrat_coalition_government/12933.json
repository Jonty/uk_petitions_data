        "action": "More Funding for Nuclear Energy",
        "additional_details": "Nuclear energy is arguably the only method of energy production that is environmentally friendly whilst also being reliable. The concerns about safety are much over-exaggerated and almost unfailingly the result of ignorance, with many people automatically assuming anything with the words \"nuclear\" or \"radiation\" involved to be sinister. The problems at the Fukushima plant quite simply do not apply to any Western European nation, least of all the United Kingdom as we inhabit one of the geologically safest positions on the planet. As such, we the undersigned petition the government to show a real commitment to tackling climate change and increase the funding for nuclear energy in this country in favour of coal-burning power, which contributes to climate change and is highly inefficient.",
