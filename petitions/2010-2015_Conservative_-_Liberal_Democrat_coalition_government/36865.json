        "additional_details": "The number of children living in Kings Hill that did not get a place in one of the Kings Hill Schools has risen from 6 in 2011 to 17 in 2012 (these figures are from KCC) and with the expanding developments this will become more serious and the surrounding schools will also become even more over-subscribed.  KCC and Liberty Property Trust UK need to stop building until they can provide the required facilities for the local residents.\r\nWith around 400 new home expected in the next phase of building in Kings Hill and another 700 homes being built in the local vicinity we are petitioning for a new school to be built in Kings Hill and not to keep expanding the already oversubscribed classrooms of the two existing primary schools.\r\nWe would like some answers to what will Liberty Property Trust UK and KCC do to overcome this growing problem as they are in partnership.\r\nWe are collecting signatures from those who support our campaign for new schools to be built in Kings Hill.\r\n",
