Where protestors are seen to be breaking the law or inciting others to break the law allow the police to use adequate and effective measures to immediately detain and arrest and ensure that offenders are then charged and punished, not simply cautioned and released. In particular, make it an arrestable and punishable offence for protestors to disguise their identity in order that they can freely break the law without fear of identification and future arrest. ",
