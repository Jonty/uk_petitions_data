This judgement is unfair as the government already has the tax and national insurance from the paying parent and csa no longer can take this into consideration. This may resolved in absent father's and parents who have regular contact with there child to give up there jobs and resort to go onto benefits!  It should be based on what there net pay is as obviously nobody gets there full pay.",
