        "additional_details": "We don't rent the pipes that supply our Water, we do not rent the cable that supplies our Electricity, we do not rent the pipes that supply our Gas! So why do we get ripped off with BT line rental, they started this after they lost the monopoly back in the 80's when people could buy their own phone instead of renting from BT, so BT changed from phone rental to line rental.  Now antone can rent from BT, and pass the rental on to the public. Surely renting from someone and renting out to a third party is illegall, as is the line rental from BT.",
