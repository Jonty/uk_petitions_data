        "additional_details": "Castle Point plan to build 5000 new homes on Green Belt land throughout the borough. We believe this will have a detrimental effect on the existing community, infrastructure and quality of life of residents today and for generations to come. We want the government to stop this outrageous plan, starting with the cancellation of the proposal for the Jotman's Hall Farm development. Please sign this petition, show your support and let as many people know what is happening as possible.",
