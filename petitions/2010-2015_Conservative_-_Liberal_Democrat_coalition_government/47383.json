When a baby is diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrom, the mother should be arrested and prosecuted for child abuse.\r\n\r\nFetal Alcohol Syndrom (FAS) is the leading cause of mental retardation in Western society. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a serious health problem caused by the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy and is completely preventable. Causing a child to suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome is really nothing short of child abuse and it lasts for life. Babies born with FAS tend to weigh less and be shorter than normal. They usually suffer from smaller heads, deformed facial features, abnormal joints and limbs, poor coordination, problems with learning, short memories\r\n\r\n\r\n",
