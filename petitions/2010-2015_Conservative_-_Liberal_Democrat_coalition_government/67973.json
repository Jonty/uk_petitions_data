        "additional_details": "I'm starting this e-petition the Lido is run by volunteers and from money raised from charity events. I believe with the help of PCC the lido would be able to open longer hours and run smoothly with more money, security, lifeguards, staff and volunteers. After visiting on 24/07/2014 and seeing for my own eyes how busy the splash pool is and at times unsafe for under 8 as so many older children are visiting. I believe this wouldn't happen if the lido (the big pool) was open and run better. The only way this will happen is with the support of the council and the citizens of Portsmouth. So I'm asking you to show your support and sign this e-petition then maybe together we can make the council listen and take notice. The lido should be a nice, safe place for parents, children and teenagers to spend their summers. So please join me in signing and sharing with friends and family. Thank you all and here to more fun times at the lido and splash pool! :)",
