        "additional_details": "The long standing exemption on payments made to MPs when they have been removed (even as a result of a criminal act or party political disciplinary matter OR (God forbid) been recalled by their electorate) from office by their electorate has recently been extended to the first GBP30,000.00p of MPs expenses.  This at a time when the government chose to hand a tax decrease to millionaires while increasing the income tax liability of pensioners by removing any increases to their threshhold allowances.  IF THIS IS A DEMONSTRATION OF HOW 'WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER' WE TAXPAYERS (PARTICULARLY PENSIONERS) DEMAND THE OPPORTUNITY, THROUGH A LEGALLY BINDING REFERENDUM, TO LET YOU KNOW WE WANT NOTHING OF IT.",
