        "additional_details": "Owners of Listed Buildings as \u2018gate keepers\u2019 of our heritage want VAT on maintenance works removed.\r\n\r\na)      To reduce the numbers of properties which are not maintained due to cost pressures\r\nb)      So that owners can afford VAT registered craftsmen to work on the listed properties.\r\n\r\nConservation Departments have rules on listed property maintenance which affect the materials e.g. type of thatch or windows and how the works are completed \u2013 there are no shortcuts.  Maintaining listed properties correctly, for future generations, is therefore expensive and VAT is a further financial burden.\r\n",
