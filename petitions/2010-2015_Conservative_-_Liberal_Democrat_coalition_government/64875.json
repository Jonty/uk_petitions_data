Everyone deserves an opinion but such negative views that are associated to life threatening mental issues such as annorexia are unexceptible. Promotion of mental illnesses and eating disorders is NEVER acceptiable! And people who want to reduce the life destroying mental illness that is annorexia have to actively stop pro-ana sites.",
