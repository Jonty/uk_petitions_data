        "additional_details": "At present public (that is private) schools in the UK enjoy charitable status meaning that taxpayer's give a sum of approximately \u00a3200 a year to those parents who have decided to send their children to private schools that charge large fees for this priviledge. This is instinctively wrong and immoral. Given that the fee's are in their thousand's of pounds a year it is also an irrelevant sum of money. But the subsidy costs the taxpayer approximately \u00a3100 million a year. This money could be much better spent invested in state schools. Moreover as these schools are businesses they should pay taxes just like any other business.",
