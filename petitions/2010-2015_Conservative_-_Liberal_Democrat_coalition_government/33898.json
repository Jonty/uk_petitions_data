        "additional_details": "Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) takes the lives of newborn babies all too often. CDH is a birth defect that can affect any unborn child and requires additional ante-natal care plus intensive care and treatment of the affected newborn. There is no known cause or prevention and treatment remains medically challenging and costly. The babies that survive may endure ongoing medical problems ranging from asthma and feeding problems to chronic lung and digestive problems, developmental delays/issues and oxygen dependancy. We want the Government to provide funding to enable well designed research into the cause of CDH with a view to finding the prevention and better treatment of the condition, resulting in saving lives and potentially saving costs to the NHS long term.",
