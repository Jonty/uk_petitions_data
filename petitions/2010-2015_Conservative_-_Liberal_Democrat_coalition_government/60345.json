We would like to make people aware that many Armed Forces personnel that have died since World War II are not included on the National Memorial Arboretum due to the cause and place of death not fitting specific criteria. Our service personnel are prepared and willing to serve their country anywhere and under any circumstance, they do not choose where they serve, they suffer the same traumas, they display the same courage, and we believe that all our armed forces should be recognised for what they were prepared to do for Queen and country. We ask for the support of our country and government in helping us to gain the same honour for our loved ones by supporting our campaign for a Bereaved Military Families National Memorial for those who died since WW2 and do not have their names inscribed on the National Memorial Arboretum.",
