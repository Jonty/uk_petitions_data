        "additional_details": "This is a request to the government to bring in some regulation of texts used in schools for Drama and English to prevent the damaging use of offensive and explicit material.  Currently schools have the freedom to use whatever they wish and are using texts in Drama and English which are extremely offensive and explicit.  Parents are unaware of the nature of the material which their children are being exposed to.  At the moment one such play in use all over the country has approximately 400 offensive words and explicit material. Such material would be rated for adults only in the film industry and would not be allowed on family TV.  It is a great inconsistency that schools are allowed to expose young minds with this material in concentrated form by getting them to act, read, watch and study it..  There need to be guidelines as to what is acceptable and what is not in order to hold schools more accountable for the material which they bring into the minds of impressionable adolescents.",
