        "additional_details": "Why do we still tolerate Electric and Gas companies confusing pricing structures? when you can go to a garage forecourt and clearly see the price you will pay for a litre of fuel including Processing, Delivery, VAT and Profit/Loss. ONE PRICE\r\n\r\nThere is no excuse for Electricity and Gas retailers to hide behind multiple pricing schemes, unless they have something to hide, that are designed to confuse the customer and make it very difficult to buy the cheapest. The latest pricing by SSE is a case in point. They have removed the KW unit cost inclusive of Standing Charge. Now you must pay a standing charge of \u00a350+ and a higher KW charge. They also have various pricing combinations.\r\n\r\nThe Government should legislate for a clear ONE PRICE fully inclusive of all charges.\r\n\r\nResult - Suppliers will be forced to cut prices, become more efficient to stay in business.\r\n\r\nEnd Rip Off Britain!\r\n\r\n",
