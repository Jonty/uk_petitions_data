        "additional_details": "It has been reported that the UK population will soon reach 70 million, then continue to grow inexorably. This is at least in part due to a rising birthrate in this country, in contrast to our European neighbours where it is predicted to fall, making us eventually the EU's most populous nation. The difference must surely be because of the availability of universal child benefit here. Introduced after World War 2 when the population was depleted, is it really still appropriate at a time of overcrowding, lack of housing, and high unemployment? If cutting child benefit helps end the baby boom, then surely it's a good idea.",
