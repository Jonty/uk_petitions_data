Heterosexual people who are promiscuous have a higher chance of being HIV positive than monogamous gay couple, for example.\r\n\r\nOnly 4% of adults currently donate blood, but most of us would happily take the blood of we needed if.\r\n\r\nWhy cut out a whole demographic of potential donors...\r\n\r\nMore lives could be saved. There is no evedence to support that a 12 month deferral makes much difference.\r\n\r\nIf blood is tested before it is given to a patient, does it matter who donated it? Only safe blood would be give to a patient in need.\r\n\r\nThe 12 month deferral needs to be scrapped. ",
