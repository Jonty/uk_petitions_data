        "additional_details": "Some 30 years ago, Lord Barnett, then the Treasury Chief Secretary, drew up a formula for the distribution, by Whitehall, of the Annual Public Money to England, Scotland, Wales & N. Ireland. This was supposed to be a temporary solution to a growing demand for self-government & facilities, all since resolved. The 2010 Annual Public Expenditure Statistical Analysis shows that Scotland received \u00a310,212 per head of population, England received \u00a38,588 - in other words, Scotland received 10% of Whitehall money for just over 8% of U K population. Wales received \u00a39,829. It means that the free services enjoyed now in Scotland (university fees, long-term care, prescriptions) are being subsidised by England, as are those in Wales. Financially, the Members of Parliament for England are not ensuring that England has it`s fair share of the money available & has been for some time. I propose the Barnett formula be scrapped & there are equal shares for 2012 onwards.",
