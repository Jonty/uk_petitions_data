        "additional_details": "We would like to see all newborn babies tested to see if they have Spinal Muscular Atrophy ( SMA ) or if they are carriers of the SMA faulty gene. Carriers come from all walks of life and affects 1 in 40 people if two carriers have a baby together there is a 1 in 4 chance of their baby having SMA, 80% of type 1 babies will die before their 1st birthday and all need 24hr care type 2 SMA children will be in a wheelchair all their lifes. It makes more sense to test at birth so that familys know before their child is born dying my grandson lived for 6 weeks and 4 days, 4 weeks of his life spent in ICU we did not know we were carriers and any future pregnancys will now have be tested. Surely it would cost less financially in the long run when you weigh up the cost of looking after a SMA child. Please sign and help put a stop to SMA thank you",
