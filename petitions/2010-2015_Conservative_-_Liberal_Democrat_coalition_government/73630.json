        "additional_details": "People should care about the issue because people feel that try can just have unprotected sex and the NHS will just pay for them to have an abortion. Last year 98% of abortions were paid for by the NHS, this was around 185,000 abortions. This is just in the UK. In the world there was 40-50 million abortions which equates to 125,000 per day. This is too many abortions happening for the wrong reasons, sign the petition to help make anortions harder to get",
