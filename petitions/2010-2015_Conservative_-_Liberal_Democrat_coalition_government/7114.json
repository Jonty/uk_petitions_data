This is as a result of the softening policies instigated by a number of governments in recent times. As a result, there are no longer any effective deterents in this country to deter offenders from committing crime against a largely law abiding public.\r\n\r\nThe government need to make an urgent review of deterrents and make them count in the fight for law and order.\r\nIn particular, to protect the public to lock away repeat offenders regardless of arguments of the effectiveness of prison. Prison does protect the public which is the top priority. ",
