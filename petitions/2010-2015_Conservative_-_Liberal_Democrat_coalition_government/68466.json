This is in accord with the norm for other countries that drive/walk on the left.\r\n\r\nOnly countries that drive/walk on the right should have revolving doors that turn anti-clockwise.\r\n\r\nThis measure would avoid confusion, make entry/egress from public buildings simpler and easier.  It would support the British walk on the left tradition.      ",
