        "additional_details": " There is no law against animal crush videos in the UK. We do realize that the UK has, previously, prosecuted individuals under the laws against basic obscenity for creating such videos, however, the law does not include the matter of their distribution, sale and purchase, which are degrading to society and dangerous to children. Undercover investigation by Stopcrush.org.UK showed us that these videos can be purchased \"under-counter\" at many UK  video shops. These videos are produced all over the world. In 2010 the USA passed the Animal Crush Prohibition  Act. The UK already has the protection of Children Act 1978. Under the section of a level 5 offence  where bestiality and sadism are listed, animal crush video would fit. We demand an end to this. The team at Stopcrush.org.",
