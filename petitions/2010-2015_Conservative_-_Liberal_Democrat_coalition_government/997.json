When there is 100% DNA evidence for someone who commits murder against a child or is a serial killer and there is no mitigation for their crime other than their own gratification then a civilisted society must stand up against such evil and the only appropriate response is to put that person to death, life imprisonment is simply not good enoughm, we should not be forced to keep that person alive and I sincerly believe if it was put to a referendum in this country the support for the death penalty would be immense.",
