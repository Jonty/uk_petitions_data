It is then not readily expected for the charity to give a significant portion of the donation to the government in the form of Employers National Insurance (tax).\r\n\r\nThe government receives considerable tax from Charities in the form of employees taxes and national insurance and on VAT purchases.\r\n\r\nThe relief of Employers National Insurance will make a significant difference to the Not for Profit sector and enable Charities to provide better and more services.\r\n\r\nBy the UK making a stand on this and leading the way internationally, foreign governments will have to follow so that they reduce their employer taxes on Not for Profit organisations.",
