        "additional_details": "The annuity providers make a profit and charge commission. This reduces the amount available to the pensioner. There is very little choice and all of the offered interest rates are derisory. When the pensioner dies the provider keeps the money.\r\n\r\nThe government should provide a competitive annuity product through National Savings, possibly index-linked. When the pensioner dies their money would go to the treasury rather than into a director's bonus scheme.",
