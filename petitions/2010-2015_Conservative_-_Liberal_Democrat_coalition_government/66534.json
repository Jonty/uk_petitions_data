This is an unacceptable display of hypocrisy and profit seeking from a country that prides itself on its alleged democracy.\r\nNo citizen of this country who utilises these freedoms should be satisfied with the current arms trade situation in the UK. The government\u2019s behaviour in regards to arms trading is a direct contradiction of everything that the ruling party is rightly expected to protect. We are literally handing oppressive governments the tools with which to further abuse their citizens.\r\nWe urge you to consider the report by the Committee on Arms Export Control, July 2013. And take responsibility for the failings of this government in regards to protecting the rights of foreign citizens.\r\nFlora Higgins, Iona Brandt and Lucas Leao\r\n",
