If you believe a sentence given in a Crown Court appears to be very low, or unduly lenient, anyone can contact the Attorney General's office asking for the sentence to be reviewed as long as it is within 28 days of sentencing.\r\n\r\nIt also only takes one person to make such a request. In the case of Lewis Gill, the Attorney General\u2019s Office has already requested the papers from the Crown Prosecution so one of the Law Officers can decide whether or not to refer the sentences to Court of Appeal as being unduly lenient."
