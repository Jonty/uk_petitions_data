Even if you are not local and believe in keeping vital services, please sign and help us to achieve our goal.\r\n\r\nYsgol Dewi Sant is a small secondary school which prides itself as being part of the vital core of the community.\r\n\r\nWith our diminishing health care services also causing concern in the county, we don't need to also worry about loosing our schools! We need to be able to encourage new families to live in our area to support the local livelihood, otherwise we will be relying too heavily on the tourist industry.\r\n\r\nYounger generations will be less likely to come back in years to come if important and integral parts of our community are lost.\r\n\r\nHelp save our school by signing this petition, thank you!",
