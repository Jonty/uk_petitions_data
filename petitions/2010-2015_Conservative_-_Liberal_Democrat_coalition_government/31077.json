        "additional_details": "There is a lot of confusion as to who is responsible for sunscreen re-application on children in schools in England. Nurseries, primary schools and secondary schools in England currently have no standardised policies on this issue, with each school or local education authority deciding for themselves on an ad-hoc basis what policy to follow - if any. It is the governments\u2019 responsibility to clarify to each local education authority what they are responsible for on this issue.\r\n\r\nUntil this is done, children are at risk of being sunburnt unnecessarily during school hours as no-one is sure if this responsibility lies with parents, staff or the pupils themselves.\r\n\r\nThe charity the British Skin Foundation (BSF) would like the issue of sunscreen re-application in schools in England debated and clarified in the House of Commons, so schools and education authorities are clear what they need to action.",
