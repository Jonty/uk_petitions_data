The problem is that many of them have little to no understanding of the issues and more importantly little to no desire to understand the issues.\r\n\r\nAs a result, they may vote for a candidate because they've always voted for that party (although they don't actually know what their policies are). Or they like the candidate's hair cut. Or they misunderstood a sound bite they heard. Or their hairdresser told them too. And so on...\r\n\r\nAs a result we get governments who are more interested in populist sound bites than actually coming up with long term solutions.\r\n\r\nI propose that every voter should have a short test as they go to vote - the pass mark could be tolerably low - and if they fail, they're not allowed to vote. A simple way to ensure that the people who are choosing the MP's actually have a basic understanding about what's going on.",
