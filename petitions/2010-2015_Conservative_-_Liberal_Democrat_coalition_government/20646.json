        "additional_details": "There is currently no legally prescribed age limit for ear, nose, lip or tongue piercings in the UK. Local councils can use their licensing powers to impose their own age restrictions for piercings carried out in their area. However we need a UK-wide legal age limit in order to protect all babies and children from unnecessary body modification. A legal age limit of at least 12 years is proposed.",
