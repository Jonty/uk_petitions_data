        "additional_details": "Newmarket is a unique Market Town & should be treated as such by Government within the National Planning Policy Framework. Urbanisation together with traffic & commuter needs taking precedent over the thoroughbred horse will see the decline of Newmarket\u2019s HRI as the largest centre for the training of thoroughbreds in the world & centre of excellence for breeding, equine medicine/welfare. The HRI is the largest employer in Newmarket,8500 jobs contributing \u00a3208 million. Newmarket should not be viewed by Government, Council planner\u2019s, speculators & developers as an area for housing allocation to benefit other neighbouring Towns & Cities. We call upon the Government to acknowledge that Newmarket should have exemption from the NPPF & allow it to be protected if it is to survive as the unique jewel in the crown of Suffolk which is essential to the thoroughbred horse racing & breeding industry. We wish the threat to Newmarket to be discussed in Parliament to protect it for the future SHNAG",
