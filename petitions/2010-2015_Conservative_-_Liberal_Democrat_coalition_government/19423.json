        "additional_details": "Child benefit should be paid to the first three children in any family. The UK is massively over populated, resources in this country are stretched and people need to have some social responsibility in the number of children they have. People should only be having children if they can afford them.  By limiting the number to three children, people who are not classed as 'wealthy' can still be entitled to benefits for a certain number of children, therefore not restricting their right to have a family. However contraception is free on the NHS and individuals can take control over the number of children they have. Individuals who already have more than 3 children should not have their current benefit levels cut, however if people are aware they will not receive benefits for all the children they have in the future they should not be penalised by this measure.",
