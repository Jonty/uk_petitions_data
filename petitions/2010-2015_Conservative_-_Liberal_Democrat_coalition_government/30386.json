        "additional_details": "The Mormon church is actively involved in a highly secretive process of using ritualistic activity to convert the souls of the departed, against their will, and the will of the family. Most notably Simon Weisenthal, and Anne Frank. This process is disrespectful to the memories of the departed. I want the Government to ban this practice on the grounds that is it causing unnecessary distress to the surviving families, and is in breach of the Religious freedom act. If a family is Jewish or Islamic for many generations, imagine the distress caused to learn that a family member has been \"seconded\" to another faith, against the wishes of the family.",
