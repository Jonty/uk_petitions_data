        "additional_details": "The Goverment should look at the possibility of teaching basic life support skills a compulsory part of the National Curriculum in Britains schools. Teaching children simple steps such as CPR, dressing bleeds etc and how to call for the emergency services could help them save lives. Quite often in the press you see stories of how a young person has saved a fellow students life because of a first aid course. The goverment should introduce funding for an annual one day first aid course for every student in Britain or look into an alternative solution.",
