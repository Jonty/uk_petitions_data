        "additional_details": "We ask the HM Government to grant a pardon to Oscar Wilde for the conviction of 'gross indecency'. In 1885, he was convicted of 'gross indecency' with another man and sentenced to two years of hard labour. Three years after his release, most of which was spent in exile on the continent, Wilde died of cerebral meningitis. This remains a shame on the UK government and UK history. The literary genius to be treated in such a way finally needs to be seen as wrong and accounted for. A pardon can go to some way to healing this damage. It may act as an apology to many of the other gay men, not as well-known as Oscar Wilde, who were subjected to these laws furthermore his family which still remain.",
