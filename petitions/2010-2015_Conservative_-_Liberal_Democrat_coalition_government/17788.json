        "additional_details": "We the undersigned want regulations to force TV documentary makers and TV programmes to use conventional imperial measurements for distance and speed: Miles and Miles per hour (MPH).\r\n\r\nMost people in the UK think in Miles when describing distance and MPH when describing speed. This fact has been backed up by multiple surveys over the years, based on all age groups.\r\n\r\nYet most TV programmes, especially documentaries ignore this fact, and use Km and km/h exclusively. Even though I am 24 and learnt the metric system in school, I still prefer to use Mile and MPH. I believe surveys and market research should have been conducted on this matter, to use a system that is still in everyday common use. Sign this partition, to show the TV production companies the need for change and for further regulation regarding this issue. ",
