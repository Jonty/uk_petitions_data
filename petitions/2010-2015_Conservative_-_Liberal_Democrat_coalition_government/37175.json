        "additional_details": "Zero-hour contracts are on the rise in Britain and we risk becoming an exploited people if we do not take on this growing trend now. Working people need to know how many hours they are to be expected to work otherwise the jobs system become redundant. It is unfair and unreasonable to expect people to not know how, when and in what condition they are to be working every day. Modern business is doing this so as they can exploit ordinary people by using them only when they need them and not when mums, dads and families need the money. This practice must stop. Sign this petition and we will lobby to legally enforce minimum hours contracts that stipulate your expected working hours.\r\nOvertime is a privilege for the company, not for workers...",
