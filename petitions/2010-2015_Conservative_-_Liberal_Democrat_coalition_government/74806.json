        "additional_details": "Supermarkets are driving petrol stations across the country out of business by selling petrol at a loss to encourage people to shop at their stores. This is an anti-competitive practice and allows them to increase prices again once any local competition has been driven out of business. Bring in a competition law to ban selling petrol at a loss and a public inquiry into practices by individual supermarkets and whether they are breaking the new law.",
