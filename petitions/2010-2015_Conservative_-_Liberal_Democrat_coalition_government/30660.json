And yet more and more of these important pubs are closed with no regard for the part they've played in our country's past.\r\n\r\nThe Montague Arms in New Cross, south-east London, is the perfect example. The owners of the pub, which was once frequented by the Kray twins, sadly died and the establishment was closed, stripped out and it's unique interior auctioned off.\r\n\r\nOur historic pubs need more protection so they can't simply be closed and dismantled without regard for heritage\r\n ",
