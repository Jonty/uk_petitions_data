        "additional_details": "In the years preceeding the crucifiction of Jesus Christ Israel was under roman occupation.  It is unclear whether Jesus was crucified on the request of the Hebrew Preists or whether it was the action of the Roman occupiers.  What is clear is that if the Israelies or the Romans were not completely at fault individually, they were culpable.  Therefore The Gov't should bring pressure to bear on both the Israelie and Italian governments to apologise for their involvement in the killing of Jesus Christ. ",
