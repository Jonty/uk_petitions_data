        "additional_details": "We the users of Coventry Stadium have decided to put up this petition in order to stop the planned housing development on the current site of the Coventry Stadium, Brandon. Home of the Coventry Bees Speedway Team and to many Motor Sports including: Formula One Stock Cars and virtually all other oval racing forms! We believe that the Stadiums loss would be devastating to many thousands of people who currently use the facility and also create a large hole in the leisure community in and around the Coventry area! The Stadium is also the oldest surviving Stock Car Circuit and as such should be preserved as a National Heritage site and not lost forever to another Housing estate!",
