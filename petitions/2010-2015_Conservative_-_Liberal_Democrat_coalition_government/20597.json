        "additional_details": "There are hundreds of decaying and abandoned buildings around the UK that are going to waste. This, coupled with the recent influx of new housing- that costs millions in the making- leads me to believe that each can be solved more economically and simply. For far less money and without the loss of our historic, or even not-so historic, buildings we should be redeveloping the old to embrace the new. Using the bones of old structures to combat the need for housing instead of insulting our history, letting the past rot and building on beautiful areas. We have the buildings- revamp them, don't rip them down!",
