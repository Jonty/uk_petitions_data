Why should we have to pay for tampons or pads?! Contraception is free, medication to stop bleeding is free, so why not sanitary items?! Did you know they TAX sanitary items?! Why pay tax on something we use as a regular monthly thing that we have to attach to our underwear or stick up our vaginas. Its NOT FAIR. I'm calling a stand today, we should get these free. Its a natural process of a women's life, lets get these provided for us.",
