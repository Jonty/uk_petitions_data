        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition HM Government to immediately withdraw, with permanant effect, the subsidised food available to members of parliament.\r\nIt is absurd that the average taxpayer (average earnings ~\u00a325k) should subsidise food for the average MP (minimum earnings \u00a360k plus allowances, expenses etc).\r\nThe poor should never subsidise food for the rich. It is a mockery to spend \u00a35.8 million per annum subisdising food for just 650 MPs. As they sit 150 days per year this is \u00a360 per day per MP, more than the average person will spend on food in a week.",
