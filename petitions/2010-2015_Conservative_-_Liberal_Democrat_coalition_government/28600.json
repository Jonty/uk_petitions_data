        "additional_details": "Is it right that requiring a TV license is compulsory, regardless of usage? The TV license fee pays for the upkeep of the BBC and it's programming, but what if an individual does not watch the BBC? Other tv channels do not benefit from this fee and are forced to find other revenues through advertising etc, meanwhile the non-BBC-viewing individual still foots the BBC's bill. The BBC does not have to be competitive because it has, in effect, been sanctioned by the government. Not only is this uncompetitive, it is unnecessary; the BBC will still be capable of running their channels and creating new content using other methods of revenue (such as advertising).\r\n\r\nTherefore this petition proposes that the TV License fee be scrapped.",
