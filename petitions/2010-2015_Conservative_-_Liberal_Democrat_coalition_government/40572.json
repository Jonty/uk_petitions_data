        "additional_details": "Currently fixed penalty notices for public order offences are \u00a380 which is often far less than the persons receiving them spend on a night out. I am suggesting that it is increased to \u00a3200 to make it more realistic and a deterrent. Also it would help to cover the costs of detaining offenders in cells over night because they are too drunk to receive the notice on the street. ",
