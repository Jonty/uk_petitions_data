        "additional_details": "Fixed speed bumps and speed cushions should not be used to enforce a speed limit of over 10mph and should not be used in places where it is deemed safe to have a 30mph speed limit.  Where it is deemed necessary to have a speed limit, such as 30mph, this should be enforced by means of cameras or by recessed speed bumps, that only rise (In conjunction with a warning sign) where a vehicle is approaching at more than the speed limit (Emergency vehicles could be fitted with an override mechanism).  This way only those who are breaking the law will be inconvenienced.  It would also save wear and tear on vehicles and reduce fuel consumption/emissions.",
