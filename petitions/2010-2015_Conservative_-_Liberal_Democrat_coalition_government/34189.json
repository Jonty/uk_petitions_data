        "additional_details": "The very concept of charging income tax on income earned and taxed overseas is morally bankrupt.  It should be declared illegal in all countries.  For one country to claim to have power (of taxation) over activities in another country is absurd and should be challenged in international courts.  The UK can make a start by scrapping all worldwide taxation legislation.",
