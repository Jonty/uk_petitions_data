Plus; Stiffer regulations regarding owning and breeding dogs should be implemented, and money raised through an ownership/kennel licence could help fund regulation. A policy to ensure all breeders are licensed, all pets that are not the property of registered kennels in the case of dogs, are to be by law speyed or neutered. All dogs and cats should be microchipped. Anyone owning a cat or dog should have the relevant proof of ownership. Tougher regulations regarding ownership of breeds such as pitbull, bull terriers, etc\r\n\r\nStiffer sentences for those arrested for organising dog fighting or cat coursing, including those supplying bait animals and coursing/fighting dogs.",
