Individual politicians are congenitally unable to do anything with first of all considering how it will better the position of 'the party'.  If party politics is allowed to predominate in any new upper house of parliament then any reforms will be a total and complete waste of time and money.  Party politics MUST be taken out of the considerations of the actions of members of the upper house.  Complete impartiality by those newly elected members of any upper house is the ONLY way to bring this country back to the great place it once was.",
