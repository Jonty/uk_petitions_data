        "additional_details": "Stop wasting money on wind farms at taxpayers expense. It is a fallacy that wind turbines reduce co2. Power stations do not shut down boilers when wind turbines are working as boilers need to be on line when the wind drops, also the power station turbines must be kept hot to prevent damage. This is because superheated steam cannot be applied to a cold turbine. The power station has to dump the cheap unused power through the cooling towers and we have to buy expensive wind for no reason. The co2 output from the generators is therefore the same whether the wind is blowing or not negating the whole reason for windfarms in the first place. The policy is based on a lie.",
