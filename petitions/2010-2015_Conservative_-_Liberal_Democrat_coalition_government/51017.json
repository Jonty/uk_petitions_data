It is costing the taxpayer vast sums of money to keep these non human beings alive in prison, only to re-offend again when they return to normal society.  It also costs the taxpayer vast sums of money protecting these individuals identity and also by trying to house them again and have them under monitoring.   We do not want these people in the places that we live, places we call our homes and raise our children!",
