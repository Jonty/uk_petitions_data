A condition of receiving any Welfare Benefit for a period in excess of 12 months should be relocation to a workhouse type secure premises where paid work at a minimum wage must be undertaken. The \"Any Work Test\" which is already established should be applied to determine the capability of inmates but regardless of ability or disability all should carry out some work in order to pay for their upkeep. Tower blocks and unused government buildings including military camps with appropriate security could be used to house those claiming benefits freeing up housing for the working population contributing to the national economy. Those few claimants receiving Out Relief because they cannot be housed due to lack of accomodation should only receive Food Vouchers and not be paid in cash.",
