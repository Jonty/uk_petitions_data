        "additional_details": "I would like to see mandatory sentences put through by the government. The UK is suffering ongoing growth of knife related crimes and it needs to be more aggressively approached.\r\nPlease join with me by supporting a proposition to introduce a mandatory sentence for committal of crime using a knife and another mandatory sentence for carrying a weapon/knife. I believe if we adopt a similar strategy to that of possession of a fire arm we should deter potential criminal activity.",
