        "additional_details": "The European Convention on Human Rights is well intentioned but not suitable for the UK. It restricts how the Police can behave when defending people\u2019s rights, it enables convicted criminals to be set free, it gives prisoners the right to vote, it prevents Judges from acting in the interest of UK Citizens, it allows illegal immigrants to remain in the UK when guilty of serious crimes, it enforces housing and benefits for social misfit criminals and illegal immigrants and allows religious war mongers to live for free while reproducing at the Tax Payers expense etc., the list is endless.\r\n\r\nThe UK needs a UK Convention on Human Rights tailored for the UK which replaces the EU version, but encompassing its foundation ethos of fairness where appropriate.",
