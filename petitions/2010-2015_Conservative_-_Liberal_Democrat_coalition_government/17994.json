        "additional_details": "Many people are required to take drug tests in order to do their job, including soldiers for example. They get paid, and part of their taxes goes to funding people on benefits.\r\n\r\nWe have a problem that the people in receipt of these benefits do not have to do drug tests. Frequently, benefit claimants are drug users.\r\n\r\nWe believe that all people claiming unemployment benefits should take frequent and random drug tests and be denied their benefits immediately if they fail the test.\r\n\r\nThis will save a lot of money and clean up a lot of drug problems.",
