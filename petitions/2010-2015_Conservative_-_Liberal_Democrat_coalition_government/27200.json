Instead ask whether the UK wants any part of Scotland!\r\n\r\nDissolution of the Union between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom will have implications for everyone in the UK, and as such all citizens should have the right to vote in a referendum on this issue. Under the current plans for a Scottish independence referendum this will not be the case. Therefore we demand that an additional referendum be held in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland to decide whether or not Scotland should be expelled from the United Kingdom.",
