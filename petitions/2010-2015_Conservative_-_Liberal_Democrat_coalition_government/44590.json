        "additional_details": "The national lottery organiser Camelot PLC are proposing changes to the national lottery game also known as Lotto which will result in a doubling of the ticket price as well as a change to the structure of some of the prize tiers.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these changes there is a \u00a34,000,000 shortfall in what the prize fund should be if the ticket price was doubled and what it actually will be on a typical non rollover Saturday draw with Camelot proving to be unwilling or unable when questioned on this issue to say where this shortfall will be going.\r\n\r\nWe petition the prime minister to block these changes to the National Lottery which has been operating perfectly well for 18 years at the original ticket price and prize tiers",
