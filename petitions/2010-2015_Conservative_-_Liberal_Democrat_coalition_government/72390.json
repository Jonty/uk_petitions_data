Improvements, both to alleviate congestion and increase safety in our villages, must be included in all on-going transport strategies for the region.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to seek immediate funding and action to make the A64 from York to Scarborough dual carriageway for the entire length of this A road.\r\n\r\nThis is the primary route between York and the East coast and surrounding areas.  It is of paramount importance for the North Yorkshire region, for all business and economic growth, tourism, safety and the local population - please support this campaign.",
