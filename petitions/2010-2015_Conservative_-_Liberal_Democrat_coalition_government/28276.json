        "additional_details": "Croydon Council is looking to amend its policy on how children with special educational needs (SEN) are assisted in getting to school. Many other Councils are following suit.\r\nCutting back further services to the most vulnerable people of society, such as children with severe learning difficulties or profound physical disabilities, is extremely worrying for both them and their Carers. It is an essential part of their education to be provided with a safe and consistent journey to their school and changing this would be very disruptive and distressing. Please take the time to sign this petition and protect the most vulnerable who cannot fight for their own rights.",
