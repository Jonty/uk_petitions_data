        "additional_details": "The requirement for each household in England to receive a minimum actual download speed of 2Mbps.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the UK is starting the rollout of Fibre Optic broadband, many homes in England have been left with an actual download speed of not even 250Kbps - An example of this is a village called Brocton, in Stafford which relies on the Milford exchange around 1500 metres away.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis could be achieved by the government simply increasing the amount of exchanges in England in which surrounds a radius that would be capable at downloading at 2Mbps. Another way would to improve the telephone lines to handle a higher speed to be delivered to the home.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment, ISP's are only upgrading areas in which would be profitable to them. If small villages and not so largely occupied areas do not receive a reasonable broadband speed, then the Government will not achieve its aim to create the best broadband network in Europe by 2015.\r\n",
