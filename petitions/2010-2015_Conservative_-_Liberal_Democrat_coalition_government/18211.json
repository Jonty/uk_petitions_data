        "additional_details": "Many Police Officers spend a great amount of time compiling full prosecution files unnecessarily for the benefit of the Crown Prosecution Service in order that the can make a decision as to whether or not to charge a prisoner with an offence. Surely all that is required are brief details of the facts of the case to decide if a crime has been committed. Many offenders plead guilty at court which makes the majority of the paperwork unnecessary. This would free up Police Officers time to use patrolling the streets and would also cut down on overtime payments as it is a known fact that some police officers engineer arrests to co-inside with the end of their tour of duty thus extending their hours of work.",
