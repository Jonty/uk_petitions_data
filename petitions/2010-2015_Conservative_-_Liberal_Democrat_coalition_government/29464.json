        "additional_details": "The government has broken a key coalition promise and women currently aged 56 and 57 are paying for it. They will receive a state pension at 66 - up to two years later than they expected. Three years ago women received a pension on their 60th birthday - now they have to wait until they are 66. There is not enough time for women aged 56 and 57 to make alternative financial arrangements to tide them over the significant shortfall in their expected income.\r\n\r\nI want the government to honour its promise to implement the pension rise for women by 2020 at the earliest. 2018 - two years earlier - is a broken promise that women are paying dearly for.
