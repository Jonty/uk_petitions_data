        "additional_details": "This petition is to urge Ed Miliband to challenge West Midlands Police over their barbaric use of force at a peaceful protest in Warwick University on Wednesday 4th December 2014. Students were holding a peaceful sit in protest at the University's Senate House over the rights to have free tuition, when they were set up on by police wielding tasers and brandishing pepper-spray. Students were then subject to being assaulted by police in this unprovoked, cowardly act of violence.  This is unacceptable behaviour by West Midlands Police and Labour Leader Ed Miliband NEEDS to challenge these actions. I urge you to sign this petition so this cannot happen again and so that people can use their right to conduct peaceful protests and speak out without fear of being assaulted by those people put in a position to protect and serve them.",
