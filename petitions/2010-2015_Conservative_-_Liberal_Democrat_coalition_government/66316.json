        "additional_details": "To Theresa May (MP) for Windsor & Maidenhead and Highway Agency (executive agency, part of the Department for Transport) there was a plan to remove the roundabout to convert to a crossroad in September 2014.\r\n\r\nAround a month ago, the Highway Agency completely changed the plan which is just to a a third lane northbound A404. Myself, motorists , Bisham Parish Council, Marlow Society and Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead strongly condemn these plan.\r\n\r\nAll we want is just a flyover which is more likely to reduce congestion on the A404 and other major roads such as A308, Handy Cross roundabout and A4130. This is also benefit for the long term please reconsider this plan as this problem has been going on for a very long time.",
