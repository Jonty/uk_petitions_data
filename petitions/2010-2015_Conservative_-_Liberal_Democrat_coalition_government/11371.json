        "additional_details": "We the undersigned recognize the need for legislated protection of human rights. We the undersigned believe in the paramouncty of British legal practice and tradition and that the ultimate arbiter of British legislation should be the British people and their elected representatives, not an external or international body. That being the case, we the undersigned petition the government to hold a debate and legislate to form a British Bill of Rights that protects universally recognised rights but also takes into account British national interest and unique societal circumstances and traditions. Once this is completed, we the undersigned would like to see the government repeal the Human Rights Act, withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights upon which it is based, and implement a fully formed, fully debated British Bill of Rights.",
