        "additional_details": "This petition is to stop people from selling puppies and kittens under the age of 8 weeks as they should be with their parents. it is much better to wait until at least 8 weeks (some breeders say 12 weeks) before sending them off to their new homes. The last few weeks of mother's milk will help puppy immune systems, which is always a good thing, as they aren't due for major shots until 14 weeks.\r\n\r\nIn addition, puppies that leave their mother too soon are at greater risk of separation anxiety",
