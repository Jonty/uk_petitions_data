This is ludicrous and MUST be addressed.\r\n\r\nSign this petition if you too belive organ donation should be something you have to opt out of, rather than having to sign in. This will mean that hundreds of thousand of people will be donors, more organs will be available, thus saving millions more lives.\r\n\r\nIt is common sense to sign this petition!\r\n\r\nThank you ",
