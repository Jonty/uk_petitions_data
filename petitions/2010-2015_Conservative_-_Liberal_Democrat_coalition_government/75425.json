        "additional_details": "We the undersigned would like to see the phrase \"Entry Level\" made a protected term when used in job descriptions and job adverts to specifically mean that the position must not require any prior experience in the field.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, companies that advertise jobs as \"Entry Level\" should be periodically vetted to ensure they actually hire inexperienced workers rather than only hiring those with prior experience.\r\n\r\nYoung people in this country face a Catch 22 situation, where businesses refuse to hire and train new workers, preferring instead to hire older and experience workers at the cost of pushing young workers out of the job market.\r\n\r\nThis change would give those entering the job market for the first time a way to focus their efforts and make it easier for them to get onto the job ladder in the first place. It also would provide job listing sites with an easier way of matching up those entering the job market for the first time to appropriate positions.",
