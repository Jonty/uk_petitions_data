        "additional_details": "1. Freight trains will transport the containers on the main part of the journey they go on. This will encourage thousands of lorries each year, off the roads and onto the railways to and from ports. This will alleviate the gridlocked and over congested motorways that are frequently reported on the news for being gridlocked.\r\n2. A former GWR man once said on a railway documentary; 1 mile of railway track uses up 1 acre of land, but 1 mile of motorway uses up 40 acres of land.\r\n3. Pat Stack, the Mayor in St Albans says a football stadium should be built instead of the freight terminal. We have enough football stadiums in this country. We don\u2019t have enough rail freight terminals.\r\n4. National stats from Rail Magazine this year states that trains create less CO2 emissions then road transport each year.\r\n5. Rail is a faster mode of transport then the road.\r\nWe, the undersigned, hereby petition the Radlett Rail Freight Terminal, in the Hertsmere District, to go ahead and be built.\r\n",
