        "additional_details": "It is a shame that some parts of our country have been rapidly bought up by the rich. This highlights a social problem that needs addressing. The displacement of our youth.\r\nPeople who own second homes and or holiday homes cause strain on services and infrastructure, Paid for in taxes and rates of the people who live their full time. Most of these people are poorly paid and have a low standard of living.\r\nPeople have little sympathy for local people and consider them as lucky to live where they do.\r\nThe reality is a lot less wonderful than these people know. Some family's are permanently displaced after generation upon generation of hard living that earned them the right to live there. Communities and traditions suffer greatly due to this.\r\nI propose that the owners of these holiday homes and second homes pay their way properly to help create new homes for the people they displace in their greed and equally have no right to local planning issues.\r\n",
