        "additional_details": "Mass releases of helium-filled latex balloons are popular for celebrations and fundraising but these latex balloons present a hazard to marine animals (as well as their strings and tags). Any deliberate release  should be licensed by an appropriate body after completing a thorough environmental impact assessment. Although latex is biodegradable, (a process which can take years in cold UK waters) it is not harmless and the incidence of  birds and other marine life being killed by balloons is increasing. Licensing might achieve a balance between the usefulness of balloon releases (such as for charity fundraising) against their environmental impact.",
