        "additional_details": "The purpose of this new national bank is to enhance our economic stability - not to make money in itself.  This is to be risk free, as such:\r\nNo loans, mortgages, overdrafts or debts of any kind.\r\nProvide UK citizens with basic bank account facilities: debit card, online banking, ATM access.\r\nSince the services are so limited, no branches will be needed, keeping costs to a minimum.  Offer no interest on the accounts so anything accrued will be put in to pay for the service.  Costs should be at a minimum.  No traders or stock market involvement whatsoever.\r\nMuch of the financially stable British public would prefer to put their main bank account here, where there is NO risk of bankruptcy, also as an alternative to the overtly corrupt banking industry.\r\nI believe this would grant us greater stability, whilst still allowing other banks to compete with decent interest rate accounts and business services.  I want to see this idea debated and explored thoroughly, please sign if you do too.",
