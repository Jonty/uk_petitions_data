In order to receive the maximum allowance individuals will need to complete a certain number of voluntary hours a week in their community. Examples of this could be working in schools helping to develop the literacy and numercy skills of children working below the national average, helping out at recycling centres and charity shops, litter patrols, sports /afterschool clubs or unpaid work experience at public and private companies.\r\n\r\nThis will help give people the work experience they need in order to get a job, develop community cohesion and a sense of responsibility. If individuals chose not to get involved then they only have themselves to blame.\r\n\r\n",
