Accidents cost money!\r\nNo authorities want to police properly fireworks and it is too difficult to know who has a big display in a very small space, same for children, by the time the police is called the group of children throwing the fireworks in front gardens have gone.\r\nIf you keep pets you know how bad it is.  Not everybody like fireworks, and it is not democratic to impose fireworks on people who are frighten of them.\r\nThe police does not want to intervene neither does the Rspca.\r\nHelp us, help our pets, children and elderly people to live peacefully.\r\n",
