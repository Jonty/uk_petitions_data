        "additional_details": "Since 2010, the UK has had to go through the pain of too many cut-backs, social problems and target failures on the economy. David Cameron is not taking responsibility for these issues and as such, we the people demand David Cameron to resign and to be replaced by David Davis MP for Haltemprice & Howden as Prime Minister. The reason for the replacement is because David Davis started off from humble beginnings to work his way up in business and we believe he has the experience we need to challenge our economic problems and also to challenge our social problems and make the UK a better place.",
