As a nation we are coming together to honour those many millions who have fallen and those who still risk their lives to protect us from unconscionable acts of terrorism and war, near and far. Each person should have the opportunity to attend a Remembrance Day Ceremony on the actual day. Therefore as part of the many events that the Government of the United Kingdom will carry out over the next four years, it should make a lasting gesture of making each Remembrance Day a Bank Holiday,a day of 'observance' regardless of where it falls during the week. Lest We Forget. ",
