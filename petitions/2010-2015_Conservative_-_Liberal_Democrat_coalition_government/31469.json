        "action": "Abolish European reptile and amphibian  ban.",
        "additional_details": "Changes are soon coming to reptile keeping in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe EU are passing new laws to ban reptiles and amphibians. This must be stopped. If this new law is passed all 8 of my pet snakes I currently keep (including corn snakes, boas and pythons) will have to be destroyed. This is all due to invasive species being released into the wild. There is no record of invasive reptiles surviving and breeding in the wild in the UK.\r\n\r\nTaking away the freedom of keeping your reptiles and making it illegal to keep reptiles and amphibians will upset a lot of people. It is unacceptable that the EU can decide we do not deserve to to keep our loved pets.\r\n\r\nThe reptile trade is the fastest growing trade in he UK, I believe taking this away will do more damage to our already dull economy.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and pass it on to everyone you know that keeps reptiles and other pets, its only a matter of time before the next pet trade is targeted.",
