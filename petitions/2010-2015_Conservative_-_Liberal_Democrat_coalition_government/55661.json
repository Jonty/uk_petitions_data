On this basis, I want to petition the entire Cabinet, including the Prime Minister and his deputy, to become unemployed and live on nothing but 'handouts'. By the way, MP's expenses do not count for this exercise, the Cabinet must learn to survive on the pittance they've condemned others to live on, no more and no less.",
