However, quite recently they have been consigned to the rubbish tip, discarded when no longer needed. THIS HAS TO CHANGED.\r\nWe believe in equality, we are not so different from the Bakewell ourselves yet we are allowed freedom when they are not. They are to be enjoyed, they are the platonic orgasm of the mouth and they too, to quote Mel Gibson, deserve FREEDOM.\r\n",
