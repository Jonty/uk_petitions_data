Depending on the number of signatures the e-petition receives this way, it should then be sent to a proportional number of additional random users. This process can continue so that e-petitions which are good and initially popular get seen by an increasing number of individuals, while those that are not don't.\r\n\r\nSimples :)\r\n\r\nThank you for reading... :s",
