I've just calculated using relative figures, how much revenue it has  given the companies since the house was built in 1962 it  equals \u00a312,147  for doing absolutely nothing.  It is a ridiculous state of affairs. Why can't it just be a price per unit at a higher cost if neccessary then at least one has the choice to use it or not if the bills are too high. As it is one is paying for nothing. ",
