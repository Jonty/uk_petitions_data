We regard not only those who are currently students within the higher and further education systems as exclusively members of the student movement, but also anyone who sympathizes with our aims and all those who have been hampered by student debte which frequently run into the tens of thousands of pounds. Their fight is our fight. End fees and end the disaster of student debt now.\r\n\r\n",
