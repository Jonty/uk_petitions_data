Now, most of us do this on the internet so only the Estate Agents gain anything from this practice. These signs are ugly, unsafe and a waste of trees. Blocks of flats often have signs permanently outside. They ruin the landscape. And now, Estate Agents put them up wherever they feel like, advertising local events. It's time to stop this outdated advertising method. ",
