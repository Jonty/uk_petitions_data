It was a fantastic opportunity, I got a lot out of it and so did the charity. I also happen to have a degree in English, but 3 months since my FJF placement ended, I am struggling to find work and the government expect me to do unpaid work experience for up to 8 weeks. My skills are wasted and I don't need more experience, I need a job!",
