        "additional_details": "We call upon the government to consider greater protection for those with Parental Responsibility (PR).\r\n\r\nIt is possible for a child to be taken from one parent by the other even if they share equal PR. In the time frame of legal proceedings this can potentially lead to psychological damage and even point worryingly at the person whom has taken the child.\r\n\r\nTherefore we ask the government to ensure that while parents undergo custody battles an amendment be made to law that protects their time with their child/ren until a judgment be given (With the exception of great concern for the child\u2019s/ren\u2019s welfare).\r\n\r\nWithin this amendment we ask that the government consider the standing of all associated professionals working with children. But most importantly to consider the implementation of a legal constraint towards solicitors whom falsely advise their clients that they are within their rights to make such actions, which in turn costs the tax payer in court fees.",
