        "additional_details": "This petition is to get the government to ammend the Animal Welfare Act  - Section 6, subsection 9.\r\n\r\nSo therefore legally docked working dogs as outlined in section 3 can compete in shows even if the public pay an entrance fee.\r\n\r\nThis should encourage more dual purpose dogs to work as they were bred to do and also show their conformation alongside their breed cousins and make more dogs fit for purpose and eliminate some health faults with certain breeds.",
