The ultimate crime should carry the maximum life sentence. The UK Justice System is deceiving the public by misusing the term Life Sentence. To restore the sanctity of life all cases of murder should carry a true life sentence. Life should mean Life in Prison. The victims of heinous crimes should see justice being served in UK courts. I call on Parliament to stop deceiving the electorate. ",
