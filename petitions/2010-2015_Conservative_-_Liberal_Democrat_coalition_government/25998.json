They already receive pay of around \u00a350,000 per year, plus a very generous annual leave package.\r\n\r\nDespite this they continue to strike taking advantage of laws designed to protect workers, and ask for ridiculous compensation to work on bank holidays, which quite frankly is part of the job they signed up for.\r\n\r\nMay I suggest a topic of discussion could be to dismiss any ungrateful London underground drivers, and offer the training and the job to a recently made redundant member of the armed forces?",
