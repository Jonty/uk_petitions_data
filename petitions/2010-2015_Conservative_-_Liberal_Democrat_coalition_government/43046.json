        "additional_details": "To put an end to tax payments on account based on previous years trading for people who are self employed. Many work longer working weeks to make ends meet and work hard to make a living. We keep our own books and records, pay accounting fees, our own NI and some, if they earn enough, private pensions. PAYE and CIS pay tax as they go, but the hard working self employed are penalised and have to pay up front. Would you like to pay half a years tax before you even earned the money. Please sign and petition for a fair change in policy.",
