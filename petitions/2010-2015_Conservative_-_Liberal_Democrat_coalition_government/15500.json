        "additional_details": "People take no notice of the highly unecessary waste by using plastic bags in abundance. If the government were to introduce a tax on plastic bags or ensure a small extra charge such as 5p on every bag used, the use of bags would be reduced and a small amount of revenue would be created for the government. The reasoning behind this is that plastic bags are reusable and this small deterrent may bring the issue into peoples minds making them re-use bags that they have already aquired and not throw them away or leave them at home.",
