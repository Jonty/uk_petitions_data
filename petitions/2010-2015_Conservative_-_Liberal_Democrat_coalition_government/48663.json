        "additional_details": "Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome (CVS) is thought to affect 2% of the population.\r\n\r\nIt comes in series of 'attacks', which may occur several times a month, each attack lasting up to 5 days.\r\n\r\nSymptoms include:\r\n1. Severe, constant nausea\r\n2. Vomiting (5-6 times per hour)\r\n3. Retching\r\n4. Extremely SEVERE abdominal pain and headaches\r\n6. Diarrhoea\r\n7. Unresponsiveness\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, causes and cures are unknown. Many sufferers (usually young children, but adults as well) spend days in hospital each month. CVS isn\u2019t recognised by the NHS as a disability, making it difficult for sufferers to be treated (http://www.cvsa.org.uk/Guilt.html). Many other countries recognise CVS as a disability (e.g. Italy).\r\n\r\nThis petition asks that CVS gains the status of a disability. This would greatly benefit research, treatment and all else associated with the condition.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please see the website of the UK Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome Association (CVSA): www.cvsa.org.uk/",
