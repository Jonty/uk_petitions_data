This can be contributing to the UKs high stillbirth rate as women are not receiving the correct information, as approved by the Department of Health,  that may help save their babies\r\n\r\nI would like the government to regulate pregnancy websites so those giving out information relating to the health of the mother or baby must ensure the information complies with national guidelines.
