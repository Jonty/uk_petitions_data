        "additional_details": "It is a fact that teenage drivers are dangerous on the road. It is also a fact that 20% of new drivers will be involved in a crash within their first year behind the wheel. However, this means 80% of teenagers are responsible drivers. These 80% are being punished by high insurance prices because of the reckless behaviour of the minority. Teeagers should not be punished with the extremely high insurance prices (\u00a33000), until they prove that they are a liability on the road. Teenagers with low insurane costs will also drive safer in order to keep the low cost. Let teenagers prove that they are not all reckless, irresponsible drivers, but actually people with a mind for saftey and responsibility.",
