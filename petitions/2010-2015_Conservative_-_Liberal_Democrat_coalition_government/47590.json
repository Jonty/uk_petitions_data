        "additional_details": "In these times of austerity it is not an efficient use of tax payers money to subsidise the life style of a man worth \u00a330,000,000+ with free security to the tune of \u00a3250K+ a year, in addition to a \u00a370k pension, and \u00a3115k allowance. This petition asks that Blair be charged the market rate for any security provided to him, while he is able to pay for it, and that the resultant saving be spent on food for homeless ex-soldiers.",
