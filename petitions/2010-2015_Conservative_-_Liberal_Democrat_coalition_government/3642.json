        "additional_details": "Millions of game birds, such as pheasants and partridge, are released in to the wild each year. The release of millions of birds in an unconrtolled manner undoubtedly increases competition for scarce food resources between our native bird and animal life. EIAs must be completed for habitat restoration work as well as the reintroduction of locally extinct native species in to this Country. DEFRA should require EIAs to be completed each 3 years, with interim monitoring to assess what effects the release has on local ecosystems. Game bird releases should be licenced and have a maximum release number per holding.",
