And if one chooses to take this side of the law into their own hands, if the court doesn't deem it justifiable enough (even if you were in severe danger), you are then apparently in the wrong. No arguments.\r\n\r\n'Yobs' are of increasing numbers and with each person adds more danger. Considering (almost guaranteed) 1 in 3 will carry a knife or weapon of some kind, self defence should be a right held wholly to ourselves and not whether the 'law' sees it fit.'\r\n\r\nConsider your own and others safety when thinking of signing this petition, 'yobs/chavs' will think twice when they know people can fight back to their full extent if self defence was legal to the extent where one could actually 'defend' themselves.
