        "additional_details": "The UK should leave the EU in the near future.  Membership in the European Union has become a one sided deal, favoring the developing countries such as Poland, Greece etc.  The UK taxpayer is funding our competitors, which are taking our jobs and industries from us.  Is like owning a newsagents and giving money to help someone else build another newsagents across the street which will take our business off us in the future. Immigrant workers come here to work and send money back to their home countries, money which will not filter back into our services and our own development.  Indigenous British are highly unlikely to go and work in the new European countries.  Perhaps in the future, countries like Germany and France could also leave the EU and we could form a new Union between us without all of the less developed countries that we are having to carry and are slowly wearing us down.",
