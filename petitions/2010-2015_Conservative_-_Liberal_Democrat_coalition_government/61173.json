        "additional_details": "Free train travel for disabled pass holders is due to cease in April 2014.  The government should prevent this from happening to ensure disabled people can continue to travel free on trains and buses.\r\n\r\nMany disabled people either can't work or can only work part time, thus their income is very low and as we all know the income support for disabled people is constantly under threat and harder to obtain, yet here they are expecting people to spend more of what little they do get on travelling.  Free public transport for many is what actually keeps many able to work in the first place, which is a right recognised by the International Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nThe government has recently stated that we are a rich country.  With wealth comes the responsibility to support those who need it.",
