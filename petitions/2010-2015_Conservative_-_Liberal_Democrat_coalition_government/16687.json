It would greatly enhance our democracy if members of th epublic are to attend and  stand at the dispatch box and address parliament on an issue of concern be it local regional, national or international. in the same way that members are called upon by the speaker to  talk the office of the speaker should  choose who should and when this may be someone  nominated by a village to talk about preservation. It is not unheard of  or unreasonable to assume that parliamentarians will always speak on an issue. ",
