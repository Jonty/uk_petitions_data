        "additional_details": "The Royal Bank of Scotland is owned by the taxpayer. Bankers would have us believe that this is an asset and that one day we will get our money back in full. Meanwhile drastic cuts are being made to public services and the very fabric of our country is being torn apart. This petition calls for a full and open public audit of the above mentioned institution by an independent panel to include representatives from Unions, NGOs and experts in forensic accounting and auditing. The results of this audit should be published so that the public can know if this purchase is an asset or a liability.
