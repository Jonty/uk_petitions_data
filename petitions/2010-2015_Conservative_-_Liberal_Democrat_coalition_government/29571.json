France recommend 10 portions and Danish are currently recommending 6.\r\n\r\nThe current nutritional guidelines of 5 a day were set based on research from the World Health Organisation on basic human needs. The Department of Health decided that 5 portions a day was just enough to not become malnourished and be realistic for people of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThese low standards have set up the UK for obesity, diabetes and many forms of cancer.
