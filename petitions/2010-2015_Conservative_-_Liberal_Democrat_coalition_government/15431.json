Often there are plenty of people who oppose the petition but to make their views known the only option they have is to start another e-petition to oppose the first one.\r\n\r\nE-petitions should allow somebody to sign it stating that they either oppose it or support it. That way a more representative level of support and opposition can be seen.",
