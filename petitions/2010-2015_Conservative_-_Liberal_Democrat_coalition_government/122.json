        "additional_details": "Stop all foreign aid apart from when it is needed for natural disasters in countries around the world and instead spend the \u00a313 billon plus a year that goes on foreign aid by putting it back into the public sector including the emergency services, care for the elderly, armed forces and the health service which will reduce the strength of the cuts. I also believe that the government should use the money to match the donations pound for pound that Help for Heroes receive as this government has let down its injured service men and it shouldn't just leave it to a charity to pick up the pieces of the governments wars.",
