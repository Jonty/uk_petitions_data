A new maximum limit of only 12 breeding bitches per establishment should be introduced  and these should be regularly inspected and policed by local councils.Only those dogs that have passed health tests relevant to the breed should be bred from and the kennel club should refuse to register those puppies from untested dogs. In addition,the general public should be made aware of the dreadful conditions in which these dogs and puppies are kept and raised. The current system permits this awful trade to continue unhindered and it is full time that this ended.Let's get together and do something now for the sake of these puppies who are born into filth and neglect and often suffer a lifetime of health problems .They cannot speak for themselves  -let's do it for them",
