        "additional_details": "People have no where to live and yet there are empty fields. People have to live in slumy rented flats or with their parents yet there is plenty of land to build family houses. House prices are kept artificially high and unaffordable because the green belt laws restrict the supply of new land. Businesses have to pay high prices for their premises because the supply of land is restricted by green belt laws. Green belt laws restrict business growth and development. If the green belt laws had been introduced in 1647 instead of 1947 we'd have no big cities in this country and we'd be living in a 17th century economy. The 1947 green belt laws condem all future generations to live forever in the mid-20th century. The government must abolish green belts.",
