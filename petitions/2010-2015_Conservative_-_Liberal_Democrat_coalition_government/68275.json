        "additional_details": "Animal abuse is on the increase, a lot of these abusers are young children and youths. Most parents/guardians do educate their children to have respect for all animals.\r\n What i would like to see is animal care brought into the school curriculum. With regular interaction of animals, visits to animal sanctuaries,rescue shelters , zoos and safari parks.\r\nGet animal welfare officers in to do talks and interact with the children, bringing in a small animal when they visit.\r\nWe need to start at the beginning and teach our children from a very young age to respect all animals and so reduce animal abuse. We need to make sure every child is educated and understands the implications of mistreating any animal. Learning them to respect them will have a huge impact in the reduction of animal abuse cases.",
