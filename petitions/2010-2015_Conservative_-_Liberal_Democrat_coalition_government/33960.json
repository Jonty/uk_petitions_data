        "additional_details": "Whilst it is understandably a legal requirement to hold car insurance whilst operating a vehicle on the public road system, the prices for newly qualified drivers to drive legally is utterly unreasonable.\r\nOnly the most privileged young men and women are able to afford the premium, whilst others who don't have thousands of pounds worth of disposable income (and often have more pressing reasons for their need for easy transport) are unable to afford even the cheapest policy.\r\nThese prices are not only a nuisance, but a distress, with young men and women unable to get back into a car after passing, often until they enter into formal employment or take out a student loan.\r\nI propose that the government introduces legislation to impose a cap on insurance premiums of newly qualified drivers until they begin further education or employment. The cap would be discontinued for the policy of a driver who has been involved in an incident.\r\n\r\n  ",
