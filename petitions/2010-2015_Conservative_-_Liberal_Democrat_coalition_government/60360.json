We have seen two examples, the first effectively died of dehydration after the hospital stopped administering fluids, apparently a common practice, the second took 40 minutes to die after having an oxygen helmet removed without sedation and whilst fully conscious and in great distress.\r\nWe took this to medical lawyers who say that 70% of calls to them have similar stories but that they could do nothing. Can we do something here?  This is NOT a petition for euthanasia but when the end is near, why not sedate patients and let them pass peacefully in a dignified manner?",
