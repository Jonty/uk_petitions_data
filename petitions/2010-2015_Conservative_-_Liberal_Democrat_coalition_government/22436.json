        "additional_details": "We the International Animal Rescue Foundation want the English Government to consider a ban on medicine and chemical testing on all animals at H.L.S labs and for the use for more effective treatments other than animals to be used. Animals suffer each year in labs all over the world, we want this to stop and all methods that are now available to scientists (ie) cell research, and much more to be used. Testing on animals is inhumane, and much more dearer than non humane methods, we would like to see these methods placed in to action that will then end animals dying in labs everyday. Alternative methods are have been proven to be cost cutting and more effective cutting out animals dying. Please support us we would like our voices heard. Thank You",
