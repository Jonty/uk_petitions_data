        "additional_details": "I am petitioning for the amount of fuel duty to be significantly reduced. The cost of petrol is now got to the point where millions of motorists are thinking twice before using their cars. It is now a luxury to use your car for simple day to day needs. This is particularly the case in rural areas where a car is often a necessity.\r\nThe cost to businesses is at a critical point and will cause many to fold. The knock on effect is all too clear; a rise in prices in the shops and the possibility of job losses as people's spending power is severely affected.\r\nI urge the government to take a serious look at this issue and help out hard pressed families and busineses up and down the country who have to account for every penny spent simply to make ends meet.",
