        "additional_details": "16-18 year olds have been termed \"the biggest losers\" in the government's cuts to the education budget. The replacement of the EMA with the bursary means that many cannot afford to go to college or training and rising public transport prices are not helping. Recruitment freezes in training facilities mean that less help is being given to vulnerable young people and sixth forms and colleges are being forced to cut less popular but very important subjects such as languages. The government should consider seriously targeting at least one of these areas to drastic effect.",
