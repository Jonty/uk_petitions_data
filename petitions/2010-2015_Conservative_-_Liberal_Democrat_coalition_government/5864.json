        "additional_details": "How can it be right for an innocent baby to forcibly have their foreskin removed simply because their parents choose to do so? It is often done for religous reasons or simply parental preference. We believe that religion is a personal choice, while our parents may enitially instigate the choice, as an adult we reserve the right to change our religious views if we choose to. Unfortunately individuals are unable to choose to grow back their foreskin. Circumcision should be part of a religious right of passage to manhood as it is in many parts of Africa. We petition to call for a UK-wide ban on non-medical circumcision before the age of 16 to protect the right to choose.",
