        "additional_details": "I am starting this petition to try and get the government to ban the use of premium rate numbers. Hospitals, schools, banks and most government departments use them.  They are expensive to call and most organisations using these numbers and you have you listen to long menus before you can speak to a human or get to the option you need.  If like me you think it's time companies stop using 0871, 0870, 0844, 0845, please sign this petition. ",
