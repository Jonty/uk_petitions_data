        "additional_details": "David Beckham has done nothing for Britain - for the British People - for the British Sporting Interest/s - for the betterment of British Sport.  Beckham has only supported one thing; - All Things Beckham - and continues to be an advocate of Self Promotion in all aspects of his involvements either British or, more fundamentaly, all his years outside of Britain.  Beckham has spent more time over the years 'Self Promoting' than genuinely promoting anything British. If for this reason alone - and there are many more - Beckham should be denied the 'ultimate accolade' that of receiving a Knighthood which is totally undeserved, given his antecedence.",
