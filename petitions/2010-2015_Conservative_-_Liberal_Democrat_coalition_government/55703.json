        "additional_details": "We ask the Government to introduce a national photo ID card for disabled people. Many people suffer from 'hidden' disabilities - conditions such as autistic spectrum disorders, sensory disorders etc - which are not immediately apparent to the outside observer, but which impact greatly on their ability to participate in normal everyday activities.\r\nThere is currently no accepted form of proof that a person is in receipt of disability benefits. Recipients are required to provide copies of DWP correspondence (often showing personal information), doctors' letters (for which they are charged) and many other meaningless forms of so-called ID in order to access services and concessions such as reduced prices, toilet facilities, rapid queue systems, and much more. A formal photocard similar to those used for driving licences needs to be introduced for all persons in receipt of disability benefits, which can be renewed and updated periodically as necessary.",
