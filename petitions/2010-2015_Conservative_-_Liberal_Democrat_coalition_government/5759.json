The Cabinet Secretary should draw up guidance stating that the PM hoilday entitlement is 25 days per annum, plus public holidays. This would ensure that the needs of the UK take precedence over the leisure needs of the post holder. It would also bear down on costs and would be an act of solidarity with those who cannot afford even one break a year.  ",
