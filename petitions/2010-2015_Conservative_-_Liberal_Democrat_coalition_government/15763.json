Why are we afraid to speak our minds on issues which affect us all in our everyday lives, such as housing, schools, health care and benefits! Immigration has to be the priority after financial stabilty.  I would like the Government to adhere to the promises made in seriuosly capping immigration and start putting the people of this country first, if that means pulling out of the E.U so be it.",
