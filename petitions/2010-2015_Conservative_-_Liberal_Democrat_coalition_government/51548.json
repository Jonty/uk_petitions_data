In 2009 there were at least 50 sex offenders posing a risk to children were cleared to work in schools. The Government refused to declare how many were child sex offenders. On the 6th of June 2013 teacher Geoffrey Bettley found to have 200 child abuse images on his computer. He accepted a police caution but a panel ruled he should be allowed to return to work in the classroom. The above proposal would stop children being placed at risk.",
