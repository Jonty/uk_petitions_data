        "additional_details": "A BBC investigation, by Tim Whewell, BBC News, Uganda   into human sacrifice in Uganda has heard first-hand accounts which suggest ritual killings of children may be more common than authorities have acknowledged.\r\n    Child protection activists in organisations such as FAPAD (Facilitation for Peace and Development) and ANPPCAN (African Network for the Prevention and Protection against Child Abuse and Neglect) have highlighted recent cases of ritual killing and called for new legislation to regulate so-called \"traditional healers\".\r\n\r\nI request that our British Government, through the Foreign Office and the United Nations make clear our absolute abhorrence to this practice and call for legislation to stop this growing, evil practice.\r\nThe British Government should work with UNICEF  to  make sure that  Convention on the Rights of the Child  are adhered to, specifically that which refers to special protection for particularly vulnerable groups.\r\n\r\n",
