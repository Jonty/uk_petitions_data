Sadly there still exists a small but vocal group of 'sheffield deniers', a loose knit set of individuals with the entirely incorrect understanding that Sheffield is in 'the Midlands'.  The government needs to clarify the border of 'the north' (making it clear that Sheffield is incorporated), to ensure that others are not mislead.  ",
