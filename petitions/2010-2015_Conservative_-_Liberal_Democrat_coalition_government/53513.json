        "additional_details": "It is a sorry state of affairs when the government of a supposedly progressive, democratic society endorses contracts in which workers do not know when and where they will next work and in what conditions. There are two linked reasons for this petition:\r\n\r\n1. To put forward the claim that zero-hours contracts are an example of mass exploitation and appear to be in breach of The Human Rights Act 1998 as they represent degrading treatment (based on the principle of dignity), which the government has a duty to prevent.\r\n2. To argue that zero-hours contracts should be made illegal on the ethical grounds represented in (1). ",
