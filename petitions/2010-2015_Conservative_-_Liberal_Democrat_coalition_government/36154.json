So when you get a legit email many links in it take you to odd addresses rather than the company website the email is purporting to come from. This is the tactic   scammers use in phishing emails. What we need is for companies to allow outsourced organisations to use an area on their own website for routing emails through, therefore making links going to odd addresses appear out of the ordinary rather than is the norm at present.",
