This is typically exactly what they desire, and only serves to give more motivation to the next person considering such an act.\r\n\r\nI am realistic and understand that we enjoy freedom of the press in this country - but can we consider the options for a voluntary restriction of the publication of photographs and real names by the UK media, and perhaps in time other countries will follow suit.",
