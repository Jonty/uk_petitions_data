We want the government to take notice of this issue and move towards helping to solve the problem. As the UK government is part of the G8 it is vital that they work towards a peace treaty in the Middle East in order to help save lives and build a sustainable community.\r\n\r\nAs a human being it is your responsibility to take part in looking after world relations and this petition aims to ensure that the government is doing all it can to help address the problems between Israel and Palestine.\r\n\r\nThe conflict has now taken another life of a child who was burnt alive how can this be allowed to continue? How many more children have to die before something is done?\r\n\r\nForget culture, nationality of religion & please act in the name of humanity",
