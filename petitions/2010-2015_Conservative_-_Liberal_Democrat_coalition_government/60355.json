Current pensioners have worked hard all their lives, without the bus pass, a lot of us would not be able to get out and see people. It is an absolute lifeline to most pensioners. And to all the younger people who are hard working, you want to benefit from it also.\r\n\r\n If they take this away, it will kill a lot of small businesses as well.\r\n\r\nRemember, the vast majority of voters are pensioners, we hold a lot of power, lets use it wisely\r\n\r\nPlease sign up\r\n.",
