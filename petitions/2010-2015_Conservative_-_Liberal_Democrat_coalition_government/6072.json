        "additional_details": "This petition believes that an English Parliament would be impractical. 80% of the population of the United Kingdom live in England. Therefore the majority of the MPs in the UK parliament represent the people in England. This petition feels that the creation of an English Parliament would be a waste of money and unbeneficial to the people who live in England. \u2018England is the mother of parliaments\u2019 \u2013 this petition states that it would be more economically sensible to simply ban all non-English MPs from voting on laws that affect ONLY England.",
