        "additional_details": "Fireworks need to be banned from public sale and only need to be used by professionals at major public displays. Fireworks cause animals, especially dogs to suffer unnecessarily due to intense fear of the noise. Dogs are not the only ones to fear fireworks. If fireworks were only to be used at displays then they would only be on very few days and at certain times instead of them being let off by different people all night every night for weeks on end. Animals have a right to live without fear and suffering, so why shouldnt they?",
