That's 40p per ticket sold.\r\n\r\nI propose the government should not take tax on all Lottery tickets sold for a minimum of 3 months, in order to use both that money and good causes cash to fund repairs for homes and small businesses affected by the recent riots.\r\n\r\nThis could help people to get back on their feet and begin their lives again.
