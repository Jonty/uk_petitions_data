        "additional_details": "The majority of people using legal aid are repeat  offenders and lawyers earn a lucrative living from representing these people. I petition the Government to limit the number of  times one can access legal aid to just 3 applications. Also,  to limit the maximum amount to 100,000 pounds per claim.  This restriction to legal aid may go someway to reducing repeat offences since serial criminals will know in advance that they may not receive free legal representation in the future.",
