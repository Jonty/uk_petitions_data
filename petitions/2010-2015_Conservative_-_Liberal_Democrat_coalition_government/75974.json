        "additional_details": "The minimum wage is going up this year to \u00a36.70 an hour. But is that enough? No. Alot of people are working so hard in the UK just for a small return of 6.70 an hour or as a 16 year old less than \u00a34 an hour. And even for \u00a36.70 were still struggling. Businesses in the UK are earning more profit than ever so why not help the workers who are working on the front line making them the profits. An average minimum wage that most people want is \u00a38 an hour. It will help millions and also help thousands get a job and get of benefits knowing its worth going work. If you agree with me please sign. ",
