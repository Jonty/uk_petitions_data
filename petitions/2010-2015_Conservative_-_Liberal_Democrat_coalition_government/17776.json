        "additional_details": "This Petition is to get attention from Government to look and do something about prices and availabilities of nurseries. Great Britain is charging the most for nursery schools, day care and any other early education up until child is five years old in Europe. I believe that it is not fair and I think that most parents would agree to it. By creating this petition I want the government to discuss this issue, create some kind of public nurseries not only private which could be cheaper but still high standard for child development and care. How does other countries do it without charging people fortune of their monthly income. I believe this country can do it too. So please sign my petition so we can get it further and seek that something could be done to make parents happier and help those children get early education cheaper because at the moment minority can only afford it.
