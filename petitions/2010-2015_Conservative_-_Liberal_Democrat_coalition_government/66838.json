        "additional_details": "I petition that the department dealing with child/working tax credits becomes regulated and be subjected to fines when cases are incorrectly handled, calculated or take too long to speak with an adviser. Currently data submitted on renewal forms are ignored leading to incorrect calculations, leading to payments being stopped and money being demanded back - if data submitted on the forms at the time was used,this would be avoided and families not put into poverty until recalculated. They also demand monies back years after being paid out, if not calculated correctly at the time the department are at fault and they should be fined for the value that is being demanded, not the families that received this at the time. I also petition that the helpline becomes a freephone number from mobiles with more staff, after paying credit and waiting 50mins for it to say goodbye and hangup, this is far from a helpline being helpful.\r\n",
