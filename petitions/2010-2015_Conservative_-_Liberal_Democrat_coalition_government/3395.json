        "action": "Abandon the forced migration from FM to DAB radio",
        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, petition the government to abandon the switch-off of national FM radio stations.\r\n\r\nThe BBC estimates that the average household has 6 radio sets and so the cost of replacing them with like-for-like DAB radios is unaffordable for many households. DAB offers little benefit over the current FM system and so it is not worth every household spending hundreds of pounds to replace perfectly functioning FM radios.\r\n\r\nWhile the government looks set to gain \u00a3billions of VAT from the sale of DAB replacement radios, the radio listeners cannot afford it.\r\nOf course, our planet cannot afford this wastage either.",
