        "additional_details": "The safety of British citizens and their ability to seek justice is under threat. The UK government intends to abandon dozens of EU cross-border policing and crime measures. More than 100 Conservative MPs have demanded the government pull out of all such measures.\r\nJustice Across Borders believes this would be against the interests of British justice, leave British citizens more vulnerable to crime, and both victims and those accused of crime at risk of human rights abuses. In recent years, the European arrest warrant, Europol and Eurojust have broken up paedophile rings, prevented human trafficking, caught terrorists and other criminals attempting to flee justice overseas, and allowed us to deport criminals swiftly to other EU states.\r\nBritain must work with its EU partners to keep us safe. In the modern world, crime crosses borders, justice should too. We, the undersigned, urge the UK government not to opt out of over 130 vital EU police and judicial cooperation laws.",
