        "additional_details": "We need to start creating more wealth for the country by selling more produce and goods across the world. There are 3 ways to create wealth\r\n\r\n1 - You either dig up (mining and oil) and sell\r\n\r\n2. - You grow it ( farming )\r\n\r\n3. You Manufacture it.\r\n\r\nFor farming most of our lush fields are empty - we need to sell more outside the EU which is bound by the Common Agricultural policy.\r\n\r\nFor manufacturing likewise we could be selling more products within Europe but more importantly to massive markets in Asia and South America -\r\n\r\nThe only effective means to increase export growth which can be easily managed within any business accounts is to offer reduced corporation tax of 5% on all profits made on new export customers for a period of 12 months. Loop holes can be easily tightened in a similar way to how VAT is managed across Europe.\r\n\r\nTherefore my main policy to help promote export growth is : TO REDUCE CORPORTAION TAX TO 5% ON ANY NEW EXPORT BUSINESS FOR A PERIOD OF 12 MONTHS.\r\n\r\n",
