        "additional_details": "I was horrified to see on the news that there are , on average, 10 attacks on guide dogs per month from other dogs who are not on leads. This results in the vulnerable owner of the guide dog, not having their lifeline, and the dog cannot work again after an attack. It also unnecessarily costs the charity  \u00a3180000 per annum, which is money that could be better spent supporting more people, and training more dogs. I would like the government to pass a law that ensures that all dogs are kept on leads in public places to ensure the safety of children, vulnerable adults and other dogs including guide dogs who provide an invaluable service.",
