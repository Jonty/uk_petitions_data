To fund the demolition and rebuild, they will be building extra new flats and homes on the estate that will be sold to raise cash for the council.  This will destroy the existing vibrant community and affect every user of the beautiful Brockwell Park.\r\n\r\nThis will also set a further precedence of leasseholders and freeholders being essentially evicted from their homes via Compulsory Purchase Orders and pushed off the property ladder.  All homes that sit on land owned or controlled by a council can be subject to a CPO, now leading to a two tier system of private ownership where such properties are not safe from enforced private development.\r\n\r\n",
