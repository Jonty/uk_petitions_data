Why is it that the Home Secretary has never been charged, as the person in charge?  The judge today, in sentencing Andy Coulson only because he was in charge has set the precedent.  Will we now see CEOs of NHS hospitals being charged because their negligent nurses and doctors cause the death of NHS patients?",
