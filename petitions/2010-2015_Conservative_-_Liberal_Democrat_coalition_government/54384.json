        "additional_details": "In order to promote health concious future generations and to allow those on lower incomes to eat healthy and lead healthier lives, I propose that instead of having higher taxes on unhealthy food and to encourage healthier lifestyles in Britain - tax should be completely non existant on healthy foods such as fruit, veg, lean meats and other  healthy food groups. I also propose that nutritional experts be given the lead on deciding what is deemed to be healthy. The Government have a duty and a responsibility to the wellbeing of it's citizens. Profit should not be prioritised over health. tax free products would also be a key indicator when purchasing food as to what exactly is healthy to eat.",
