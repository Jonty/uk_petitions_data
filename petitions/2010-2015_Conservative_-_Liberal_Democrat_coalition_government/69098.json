        "additional_details": "Far to often social workers make false , unfounded and defamatory statements with severe consequences.And there is no recourse for parents or carers to challenge and hold these people to account. If the family court judges show no interest in holding them to account for misleading the court. Then the parents should be able to report the offence to the police for them to investigate.\r\nBecause often the service department complaints procedure results in the offending workers simply being asked if they have done wrong  and when the social worker says that they have done no wrong the complaint is not upheld and you get a brick wall response.\r\n\r\nThe social services and courts need to be more transparent. This will no doubt save peoples lives and stop the abuse of power by the S/S that has covered up children being abused and forced  children to suffer at there hands ether by there actions or failure to act.",
