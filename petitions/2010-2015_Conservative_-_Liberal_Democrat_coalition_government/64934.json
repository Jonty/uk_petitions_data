        "additional_details": "Fraudulent Marriages, where foreigners con UK Citizens to believe they have genuine feelings need to be taken more seriously by Government and the UKBA.  Foreign nationals who enter into a sham or fake marriage are doing so with the sole intention of deceiving not only the vulnerable person they have conned into marrying them, but also public officials and society at large.  These scams are destroying families, as once the fraudster gets hold of the marriage certificate, the door is wide open to them to carry out further mental, physical and financial abuse.  Many of these fraudsters target elderly vulnerable people with the sole intention of duping them into signing over their properties and life savings and as next of kin they are often the sole beneficiary to the estate, which can be viewed as stealing the inheritance from an elderly person\u2019s close relatives.  Fraudulent Marriage for immigration purposes needs to be treated as a crime and the law needs to be tightened up.",
