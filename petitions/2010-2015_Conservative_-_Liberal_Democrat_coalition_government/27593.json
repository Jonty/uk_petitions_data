Central to this concept lies the heart of the education system. However, one may question how an evil, manipulative and depraved sexual predator, also a trusted teacher, was able to abuse his position for years by continuing to molester children at the primary school in which he worked.\r\n\r\nI propose that the UK Government enact laws at once to protect all young children in education from any future harm by;\r\n\r\n(1) including \"general child-protection awareness\" classes in the national curriculum for nursery and primary school students throughout the UK; and\r\n\r\n(2) putting further screening mechanisms and spot-checks in place for all existing and prospective staff members working with young children.\r\n",
