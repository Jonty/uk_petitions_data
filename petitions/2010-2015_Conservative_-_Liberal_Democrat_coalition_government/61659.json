        "additional_details": "Jaguar Land Rover is now owned by a foreign company (Tata) and although they have invested  money to help create many new jobs there is currently no mainstream British owned car producer. Foreign companies have invested heavily in Britain and those factories are now some of the most efficient and productive in Europe. Britain should capitalise on its skills and invest in its own work force. There is no reason why Britain should not again be able to compete on an international market at the very highest level. This is not a campaign against Tata, they are a successful multinational company. But that is no reason to let great British brands go cheaply.",
