        "additional_details": "T-Mobile has followed other mobile companies in forcing price increases on customers with Fixed Monthly Contracts. So after signing a 2 year deal, they can increase the monthly fees without giving you the option to void the contract - (against the terms of Communications Act 2003 clause 9.3 )\r\n\r\nPetition to:\r\n\r\n1) Force mobile companies to tell customers that fixed monthly contract prices can change at point of sale upfront and clearly (not buried in 16,000+ word terms and conditions).\r\n\r\n2) Allow customers to cancel contracts when/if prices are increased.\r\n\r\n3) Force mobile companies to honour the contracts.\r\n\r\n4) To know why OFCOM thinks this is ok as apparently they have signed off on these price hikes.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven if you have not been affected by this please sign the petition, imagine ordering a new phone under a 24month contract, only for the price to go up the very next month with nothing you can do about it!\r\n",
