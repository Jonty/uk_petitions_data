Road repairs should reduce, traffic accidents should reduce, motoring offences should reduce, road rage should reduce, pollution should reduce.  Also people might be less stressed, community spirit might return and we might all end up talking to each other rather than locking ourselves in our own little boxes.... and on a really plus side, we might just save the world from the worst that global warming will do to us. Perhaps we'd need to be taxed a little more, but the money we'd save from paying fuel - and fuel tax would probably more than compensate us for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
