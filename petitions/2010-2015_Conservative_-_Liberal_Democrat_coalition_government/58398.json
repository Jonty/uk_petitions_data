Evidence presented to the United Nations Convention of Child Rights by Nancy Faulkner Ph.D simply states that \u201cParental Child Abduction is Child Abuse\u201d, \"Parental Alienation\" is viewed in the same strong terms by the UN as a form of Child Abuse - UK Law must recognise Parental Child Abduction and Alienation does not necessarily require a Child to be removed from the UK, or even a specific legal jurisdiction within the UK.\r\n\r\nUK Justice and Courts do not presently support the \"Rights of the Child\" to sustain a relationship with both Parents, and it is proposed the UK follow Denmark's presumption for Shared Residence when Parents separate in the interests of Child rights.",
