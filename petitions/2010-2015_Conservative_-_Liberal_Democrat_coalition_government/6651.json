        "additional_details": "With fuel poverty at a record high, it is unsustainable to allow gas and electricity companies to keep increasing their prices. By re-nationalising, everybody could pay the same amount as set by the government and the government could control prices.This in turn raises extra revenue for the country instead of unscrupulous companies who are only out for making a profit. With the current system of competing tariffs from varying companies,it not only confuses the consumer but it also makes it very difficult for those in fuel poverty to change supplier to a cheaper tariff.
