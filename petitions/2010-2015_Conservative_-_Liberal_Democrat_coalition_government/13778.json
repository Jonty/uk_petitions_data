This is nothing more than \u201cmedical apartheid\u201d, where the devolved nations enjoy better health services despite paying far less tax per head.\r\n\r\nEnglish patients are currently paying \u00a37.40p per item \u2013 while effectively subsidising free drugs for those elsewhere in the UK.\r\n\r\nIf English patients cannot get the same benefits, then we should end this medical inequity and all pay the same so that the health service benefits everyone equally in the UK.\r\n",
