I have a voice and i want my voice heard.\r\n\r\nI submitted a fair and frank epetition concerning the conduct of politicians and the epetition was rejected and i can't see why. My epetition stated that if a member of parliament was found to have lied or been untruthful in anyway then they should be removed from public office.\r\n\r\nThis epetition is for the right to have an appeal procedure in the event of an epetition being rejected.\r\n",
