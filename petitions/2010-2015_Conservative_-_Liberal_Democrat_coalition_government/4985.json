From one petition complaining that Sharia law was coming to get us all (Written unbiasedly by a member of the EDL) to complaints that India have a space program and we dont. Really?\r\n\r\nNo one wants a government that pretends to listen, we just want a government that looks like its doing something. As long as the goverment is seen to be doing something \"wrong\" by someone it will all be okay.\r\n\r\n",
