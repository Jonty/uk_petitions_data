        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to declare Britain a secular country & apologise for his remarks claiming moral decline is a by-product of a decline in Christian values.\r\nThe remarks imply atheists are responsible as a religion for criminality, that non-Christian Britons are culturally Christian if they embrace ideals such as community spirit & to be British is to be Christian; which is insulting to non-Christian Britons. Advocating 1 religion as a national religion implies that nation considers others morally & spiritually inferior, & the concepts of freedom of thought, opinion, religion & expression are no more than tolerance of \u2018wrong\u2019 religions & beliefs; As the remarks were made in a political capacity not as a private citizen we consider them an affront to Articles 1, 2, 15, 18, 19 & 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on the aforementioned basis; and politics & religion should be kept as distinct, separate institutions.",
