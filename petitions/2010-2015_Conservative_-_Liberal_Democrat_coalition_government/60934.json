        "additional_details": "This petition is a petition to ban the disclosure of a criminal's faith or religion by the media, as it is felt that it in no way adds any insight or real information to a story. It has led to a strain in interfaith relations, and has led to extremist groups being formed, targeting the faith as a whole because of the actions of a small percent. We must push the government to ban this for the good of the people and the state. ",
