The only mode of communicating with the UKBA for making a ILR application is via post now which could take upto 6 months processing time. During this period, passports are not available resulting in constraints for some people who are in jobs that involve frequent travel. Over the last 6 weeks, attempts have been made by several of my friends, colleagues, relatives to book a premium appointment but the UKBA website just turns up zero appointment dates for the next 45 days in any of the listed 7 locations across the UK. It does not allow applicants to register their details once and they be put on a queue and assigned the first available date on a First-Come-First-Served basis.\r\nThe service needs drastic improvements to allow people convenient access to UKBA service and enable them to make Premium appointments.
