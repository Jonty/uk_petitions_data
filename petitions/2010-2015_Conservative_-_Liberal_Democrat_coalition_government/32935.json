I want my children to gain the best education they can within their short years at school.\r\n\r\nWhy name school advancement in years when it is clear to all that children spend a large portion of the year outside of school.\r\n\r\nLets decrease the holidays and increase the educational developent of our children to an acceptable standard that we can all be proud of.",
