        "additional_details": "The previous Labour Government started a process of granting Foreign Workers, working Visas for the UK in 1997, allowing them to work for so many months and years. These workers are still here, especially in the NHS and some have been granted British Citizenship essenatially blocking vacancies for UK Citizens (pre-1997) who have been trained to a high standard and unable to find work in the NHS. This problem is rife in the UK regardless of which sector therefore, I urge the Governement to revoke any Foreign Workers Visas, Revoke any British Citizenship given, dating back to 1997, re-patriate these foreign workers and, in turn, creating the much necessary career paths for genuine UK citizens.",
