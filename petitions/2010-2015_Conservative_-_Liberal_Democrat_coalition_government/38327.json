        "action": "disability hate crime is a crminal matter",
        "additional_details": "The success of the Paralympics demonstrates what disabled people can do and bring pride to Great Britain as a society we must be progressive in our social attitudes and in turn this must be reflected in modern legislation. Unfortunately disability hate crime is not on the statute book and in the wake of the Paralympics change must now follow. This e-petition asks Parliament to debate the subject and amend the Equality Act 2012 to make hate crime a criminal offence and put punishable by fine an imprisonment or a combination of both. For example I observed a former serviceman who is paraplegic being verbally abused by local youths who had been drinking all day it was the Chief ex executive of our Housing association who did something. It seems the police had other things to do rather that enforce public order. Please support this and not the Frankie Boyles of this world\r\n\r\n\r\n",
