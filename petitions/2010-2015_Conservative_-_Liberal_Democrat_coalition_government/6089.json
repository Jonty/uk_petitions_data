        "additional_details": "Both types of aircraft, are similar in logistics. Both are used, for different types of missions. Perhaps on the QE carriers, a mix of both F35C and F35B could be desirable. F35C could be used for strike missions, to soften up targets for the carrier group in a future scenario.\r\n\r\nF35B could be used for air defense, air support and interceptions. Many people argue that the F35B is better than the C, or even the other way around. I think they both have their advantages and disadvantages. We obviously lose a range of capabilities by buying one over the other, so why not buy both. Have dedicated squadrons for the C version and squadrons for the B version.\r\n\r\nAgain they have similar training, parts are common among them and we can have joint operations with nations which have smaller carriers which have VTOL aircraft only, one example would be spain or even italy, with their 'Harrier carriers'\r\n",
