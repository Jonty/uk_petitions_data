        "additional_details": "Elephants are on there way out. Unique and amongst the most intelligent animals on the planet but we are killing them due to the high price of ivory fed by demand in China and the money is feeding arms purchases in african wars, and the soldiers in those wars are killing the Elephants. This now includes mass killings from military helicopters. I want the FCO to put pressure on China to prosecute those who buy and sell and smuggle ivory and up the TV campaign in China against ivory. I want the MoD to train and arm park rangers to fight the poachers. I want DfID to provide aid to these parks which are an essential part of the local economy in terms of tourism. I want a co-ordinated approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
