        "additional_details": "It is time for the United Kingdom to reintroduce the death penalty as a punishment and sentence for those criminals who commit the most evil, vile and heinous of crimes. This petition calls upon the Government to bring forward proposals to let Parliament and the public have the opportunity to debate and then decide through a referendum whether offenders convicted of the most serious crimes, for example murder and paedophilia, should face the prospect of the death penalty after full legal and judicial process has taken place. The petition also calls upon the Government to develop proposals to remove any human rights laws that prevent the reintroduction of capital punishment.",
