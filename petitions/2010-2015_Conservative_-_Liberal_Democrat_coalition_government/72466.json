        "additional_details": "Jeremy Hunt's position as Health Secretary is untenable following his comments this week regarding his A&E attendance with his children. His statement that he took his children to A&E because \"I did not want to wait until later on to take them to see a GP\" demonstrates not only ignorance but a complete lack of support for the system. These comments have destroyed any semblance of confidence health care workers may have retained in him. ",
