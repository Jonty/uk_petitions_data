With the current economic situation undertaking this would improve infrastructure, provide considerable employment and provide considerable benefits to food production and help aleviate local flooding situations.\r\nIf as we are told that climate change and droughts are a reality then starting a National Water Grid should be an important upgrade to Britains infrastructure for the future benefits of farming, Industry and the general public at large. Continual draining of acquafiers may be cheap but not in the long term interest of the country.",
