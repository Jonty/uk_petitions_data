        "additional_details": "Under new rules to be introduced next year, any housing benefit allowance will be paid direct to  tenants, even if they are in arrears & not the landlord. This will not only subject the landlord to financial pressure and possible repossession, but also increase the likelihood of landlords refusing to take housing benefit tenants, which will increase pressure on local councils and housing associations who will also not be able to request direct payments to them. The government needs to take on board our views, that tenants who receive housing benefit directly and NOT pay their rents  are not financially responsible and therefore should it should be allowed that rents can be paid direct to their respective landlord when they are in arrears as per the current rules, failure to take on this common sense approach will cause more issues for the government \u2013 this is common sense and a logical solution to all concerned, both tenant and landlords - pay rent direct to landlords",
