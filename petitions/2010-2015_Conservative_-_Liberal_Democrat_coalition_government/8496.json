        "additional_details": "The Government removed all bursaries for 2011 trainee teachers saying that it encouraged people to train but never enter the classroom and that there's no longer a glut in applications so they're not necessary. But then they're back for 2012 and going up to a maximum of \u00a320k! It's unfair to penalise one cohort of trainees who are doing a course that makes it extremely difficult to do well AND work part time. So 2011 trainees will find it extremely difficult financially. Bring back the bursaries for 2011 trainees too, some of which took a year out to gain additional experience and have now missed out on the additional financial help because of it.",
