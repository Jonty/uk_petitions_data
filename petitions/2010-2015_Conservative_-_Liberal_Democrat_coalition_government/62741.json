I want there to be a responsible dog owner law. a law that states all dog owners are to have their pet neutered and microchipped by law. I'm hoping that with the help of the public we can raise the issue  and get it passed by 2016. Obviously we cant neuter all dogs, I feel pedigree owners should have to apply (and pay) for a license that entitles them to breed with another licensed dog.\r\nThe rspca are over run with abandoned and unwanted dogs. These dogs can't help themselves. so LET'S HELP THEM!\r\n",
