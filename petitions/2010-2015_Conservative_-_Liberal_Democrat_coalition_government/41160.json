        "additional_details": "CSA law says that a Non Resident Parent receives a 1/7th reduction per night a child spends with them.\r\n\r\nI petition to increase the nightly rate from 1/7th to 2/7ths.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if a NRP has a child overnight for 3 nights a week (almost half) they still have to pay 4/7ths of the assessment to the PWC. Why? The PWC has no legal duty to provide footwear, clothing, anything, for overnight stays. The NRP still has to provide bedding, clothing etc. Equal shared care should mean no payment either way. Changing the 1/7th per night reduction to 2/7ths, almost addresses this.\r\n\r\nThe Government want to charge for using the CSA. Why deal with the symptoms of having an unfair system - address the causes.  They should encourage NRP's (95.2% dads), to be involved in their childrens lives. Currently, It is cheaper for a NRP to send a check in the post than be involved in the childs life.\r\n\r\nThis is morally wrong. End absent parenting and increased child support evasion due to an unfair system.",
