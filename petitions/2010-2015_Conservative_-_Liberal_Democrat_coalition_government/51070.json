To introduce a national currency that is designed, printed and distributed within England along the same lines as the previous Bradbury Pound.\r\n2. Our currency design, printing and distribution should not in any way involve any private banking institutions and our currency should be free from any terms or conditions which empower private bankers to entice people into debts.\r\n3. The amount of currency distributed for use within England should match the countries current real wealth.\r\n4. Our currency should be free from the influence, control or debt creating systems used by private bankers and any other parties ( regardless of the social status of those other parties ) working with, or directing on behalf of  those private bankers.\r\n",
