        "additional_details": "Whilst I accept that tuition fees are going to be in place when I got to university I would like to see certain courses, ones that are in high demand such as maths, physics,chemistry,biology ect. to be free or at a heavily discounted rate. I know that this means that certain courses won't get this treatment, however I suggest we determine which courses get it and which don't by looking at the demand for people with that degree and the difficulty of getting the degree among other criteria. By applying this, the government can get what they want by having more people with degrees in need, making more engineers, physicists etc. and people get what they want by having a more free education then the one currently in place.",
