Whilst recognising the right of citizens to advocate and lobby for constitutional change in a peaceful and lawful manner as part of a democratic and constitutional process, we find that inciting or otherwise encouraging people to unlawfully subvert or destroy lawfully constituted government, should be a criminal offence in order to deter or otherwise prevent demagogues and fanatics from threatening the peace and security of the realm and its citizens.
