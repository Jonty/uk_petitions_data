        "additional_details": "When the expenses scandal broke in 2009 a number of MP's were claiming allowances in order to pay the interest payments on their mortgages, at thousands of pounds a month.  Some claimed tens of thousands of pounds in total.  The rules then changed so that they could not do this due to the fact that they should not get a free property paid for by the taxpayer.  A number of MP's have since moved out of their properties and are now renting them out at a great profit.  These properties have changed from being supposed requirements to help them do their jobs, to profiteering ventures of which they are making thousands of pounds a month.  It should be debated so that the taxpayer shares in the profits that they have invested in or the properties are sold and the money is given back. ",
