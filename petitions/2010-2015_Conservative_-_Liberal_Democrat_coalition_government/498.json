Britain should support its own High Tec industries. It is shooting one\u2019s foot if Britain cannot support its own High Tec industries (like ship building, train manufacturers like bombardier) but short sightedly support those based in another country to the determent of British jobs, know-how, research and manufacture.\r\n\r\nThere should an investment bank set up with funds (worth billions of pounds) to support British industries and research.  Britain will reap rewards in terms of jobs, exports, knowhow several times over.",
