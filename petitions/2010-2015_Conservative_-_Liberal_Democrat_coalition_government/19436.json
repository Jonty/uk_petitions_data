        "additional_details": "In order to help reduce the cost of domestic fuel charges and to reduce the number of people in fuel poverty the 5% VAT rate currently charged could be removed and that will immediately help every household in the country.\r\n\r\nThe Government have promised to help reduce costs and have informed customers to change providers, this does not always produce the savings many are led to believe they will get.\r\n\r\nSo I propose that VAT be removed from domestic fuel bills as soon as possible to help save hundreds of pounds which could be spent on heating and lighting instead of going to the Government coffers.",
