        "additional_details": "Planning proposals have been put forward for an incinerator to deal with general and an anaerobic digester to deal with raw food waste at New Lodge Farm, Cwmgwili, Carmarthenshire.  We believe that this development is unsuitable for this area, as it is far to big,  ( they plan on having 100 lorries a day) and will contaminate the local food chain. We are also worried about the permanent, accumulative, toxic emissions that can cause serious health problems. JUST SAY NO TO AN INCINERATOR IN CARMARTHENSHIRE! ",
