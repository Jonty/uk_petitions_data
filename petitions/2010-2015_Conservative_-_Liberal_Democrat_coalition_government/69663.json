        "additional_details": "Hi\r\n\r\nHave you noticed that more and more \"News\" papers resort to inaccurate reporting and speculation about what \"could\" happen rather than simply reporting the news.\r\n\r\nThey do this just to sell papers rather than being responsible and affect the nation's livelihoods and industries by doing this and it really needs to stop.\r\n\r\nI am asking that sensationalistic headlines should become an offence. It's not freedom of speech.  A fine of \u00a310,000 to be imposed for each newspaper per article with the money to be divided up and returned to each taxpayer equally, at Christmas.\r\n\r\nThere are so many examples out, but last year it was about the worst winter ever, recently, it was about how killer asteroids will start raining down, 12th Sept was the worst ever solar storm that could knock out GPS.  It needs to stop and news just needs to be simply reported.",
