        "action": "Introduce a proper Recall mechanism for MPs",
        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to introduce a genuine Recall Bill. Under such a Bill, if an agreed percentage of eligible voters (minimum 20%) sign a petition calling for their MP to be \u2018recalled\u2019, a referendum must be held. If more than half of those taking part vote for their MP to be recalled, a by-election must follow.\r\n\r\nIn the wake of the expenses scandal, the UK\u2019s main Political parties all promised to introduce a Recall mechanism, and in 2011 the Government produced a draft Recall Bill. However, its proposals fall far short of genuine Recall.\r\n\r\nIn the Government\u2019s proposals, a Parliamentary committee (not voters) would decide if an MP qualifies for recall. The proposed criteria is so narrow that just as today, an MP could break all pre-election promises, switch Party, refuse to see constituents, all without qualifying for Recall.\r\n\r\nGenuine Recall would empower voters, increase accountability and improve the relationship between people and power.",
