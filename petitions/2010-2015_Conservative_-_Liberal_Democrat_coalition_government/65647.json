        "additional_details": "On a recent trip to London with my two young granddaughters they needed to use the toilet. Being unable to find the correct change and thereby being refused entry to the toilets by the attendant, I feel that charging for this basic human right is totally unacceptable in the 21st century. My petition is to  make all public toilets in the UK free of charge for everyone",
