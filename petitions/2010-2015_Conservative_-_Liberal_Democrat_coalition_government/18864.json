        "additional_details": "This government should ban plans by City bankers to hold Christmas parties from 22 November to 17 December at the Trinity Square Memorial Gardens, a memorial to the 35,000 merchant seamen who have died in war since 1914, on the grounds of showing grotesque disrespect bordering on contempt for those who have given their lives for their country.\r\n\r\nIf they cannot ban the parties, the government should publicly censure them in Parliament, and pass legislation to prevent local authorities (in this case Tower Hamlets) granting further such entertainment licenses.\r\n\r\nDo we wish to live in a country where the wealthy, simply by virtue of their wealth, are allowed to buy the right to literally dance on the graves of the brave men and women who died for their country?\r\n\r\nFor more information read: http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/oct/08/christmas-parties-war-memorial-park",
