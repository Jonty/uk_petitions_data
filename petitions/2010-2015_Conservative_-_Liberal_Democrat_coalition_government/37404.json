        "additional_details": "Recently two cases were presented to the high court by individuals who suffered from \"locked-in syndrome\". This meant that they were perfecty aware of their surroundings and mentally sound but were unable to move from the neck down. The case they presented to court was that they should have the right to decide that their quality of life was low enough to justify assisted suicide by medical assistance. These cases were lost as the court stated that this would require changes to the law which was a governmental matter. This petition would make it so MPs would have to debate this law change in the house of commons and may even provide a bit of hope for individuals like this.",
