        "additional_details": "Protective Behaviours (PBs) is a practical and down to earth approach to personal safety. It is a simple, flexible and effective process which is inclusive and therefore accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nThe term 'Protective Behaviours' was originally used by Peg Flandreau \u2013West to name her Child Abuse Prevention Program (1970s). In retaining the quality and integrity of the process she devised, the name has remained the same worldwide. It aptly describes a personal safety process which has evolved to meet modern day needs and which has a broad range of applications. Pb looks at right and responsibilities and good and bad feelings. Pb has been used successfully in the UK since the early 90's. Simply, it is very much in depth version of stranger danger. The government should make pb compulsory in all primary schools as soon as possible.",
