        "additional_details": "Please may I ask can we ban these legal high shops. Their are many around and I feel they are dangerous to health and make those who are addicted to drugs, to still use these drugs as enhancements.  It is costing money to treat these people who end up in hospital through their behaviour and shops like legal highs are encouraging it.  We are a great country and our health and safety on the streets should be met.\r\n\r\nThanks Maria D",
