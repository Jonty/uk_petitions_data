Costs can be reduced by better use of the buildings and extra places can be provided for minimal cost.\r\n\r\nIn Africa,  where resources are tight,  students go to school in two shifts- the morning and then other students in the afternoon.  This maximised user of the school building doubling the places within the building (providing that teachers are available).\r\n\r\nCopying this in the UK makes a statement that we put education above political pride.  Using buildings in this way reduces overall maintenance costs when compared with running two separate facilities or expanding existing facilities.  Energy costs are lower add less buildings need heating up in winter. Sports can overlap to provide better potions for after school or before school activities and clubs.  Money David from building and dining the schools can provide extra teachers. ",
