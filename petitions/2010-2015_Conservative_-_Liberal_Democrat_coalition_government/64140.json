        "additional_details": "Rabbits are the third most popular pet in the UK, with an estimated 1.6 million kept in and outside of our homes. They are also the most neglected and mistreated animal companion in the nation. Out-dated preconceptions that rabbits are hutch loving, carrot crunching, cheap, small-child friendly pets is largely to blame.\r\n\r\nAccording to the RWAF an estimated 67,000 unwanted rabbits pass through rescues every year. Easter, with its association with the Easter Bunny, is a damaging period for rabbit welfare.\r\n\r\nThis petition urges the government to challenge the unethical and irreponsible advertising and trading of rabbits as \"Easter Bunnies\" by online pet sales forums, pet shops and animal charities. It also supports Camp Nibble's call to introduce a code of ethics for domestic rabbit welfare.\r\n\r\nIf we unite, \"Rabbits Are For Life, Not Just For Easter\", can be the positive slogan of 2015. Together, we can improve the lives of rabbits.\r\n\r\nDr Daniel Allen, Pet Nation",
