Most housing association tenants are taken from the council housing register, yet are not afforded the same rights, many are not aware of this prior to taking up offers of accommodation.  Those that are aware have little choice but to take the first available property offered.  As most housing association allocations, particularly in London, go to the council, tenants should be offered the same rights across the social housing sector.",
