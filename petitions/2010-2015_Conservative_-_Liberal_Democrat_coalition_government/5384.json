        "additional_details": "Naughty and disruptive pupils are a major hinderance to learning in a lot of our classrooms. Teachers are bending over backwards to accommodate them in the classrooms and yet lack of support from parents mean their efforts are being wasted. Parents are not stepping up to the plate and parenting their children to improve behaviour. I am talking about physical punishments but teachers need to be able to discipline pupils appropriately for the good of the rest of the class. Let teachers teach and make parents parent.",
