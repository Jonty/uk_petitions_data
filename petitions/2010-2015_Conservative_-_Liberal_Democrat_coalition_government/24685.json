It is important to maintain the principle of freedom of expression which political interference could undermine.\r\n\r\nThe Government believes it is important that the BBC is aware of the concerns of viewers and listeners, and in the first instance concerns may be raised with BBC Information (email via the website, http://www.bbc.co.uk, telephone 03700 100 222, or write to BBC Information, PO Box 1922, Glasgow G2 3WT), or by writing directly to the programme area concerned.\r\n\r\nIf unsatisfied with the response, there is an option to complain to the Editorial Complaints Unit (ECU). The unit examines complaints independently. Its address is Editorial Complaints Unit, BBC, Media Centre, Media Village, 201 Wood Lane, London W12 7TQ."
