        "additional_details": "In Japan, scientists have devised a wind turbine design which is up to 3 times more efficient than traditional wind turbines. Technology is used to speed up the wind entering the design, and thus more energy is produced.\r\n\r\nThe UK being an Island makes efficient wind power an ideal source of renewable energy. With strong winds hitting our west coast all-year-round, enough investment in this technology could mean an abundance of renewable energy for years to come and a move away from nuclear power which is extremely hazardous to our environment.",
