The court is a huge waste of money created by Tony Blair to make us more like America.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (Law Lords) are excellent. Less cost than the court, the expertise and representation of the Judiciary in Parliament and when they resign, experienced Judges in Parliament carrying on their great service.\r\n\r\nReturn them but they would be non-voting peers whilst in office only.
