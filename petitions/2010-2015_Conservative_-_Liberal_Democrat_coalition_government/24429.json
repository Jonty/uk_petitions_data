        "additional_details": "I believe that when the UK is under so much pressure and every penny is being squeezed from its public that it is ridiculous to send financial aid to ANY country that can afford to invest in nuclear and or space programs. In times when British pensioners may die from this winters cold and 1 million 16-24 year old's have no national industries to seek employment from it is diabolic that British taxpayers money can be spent on elite luxuries like nuclear deterrents and space launches. THIS NEEDS TO STOP.",
