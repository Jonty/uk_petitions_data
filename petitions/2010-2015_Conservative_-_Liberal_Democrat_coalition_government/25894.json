        "additional_details": "This petiton calls for the limitation on the size of fast food portions and manufactured foods in both calorific terms and physical terms.  The approach should be the same as that currently used for Paracetamol whereby a person can only buy a certain amount when they go out shopping or dining. Such an approach will help reduce the amount of calories available to overweight/obese people, which will also help reduce the financial burden on the NHS, and the emotional burden on families who have to try and look after an obese person.  It will also help reduce the numbers of individuals who 'graduate' from being overweight to obese, and who go on to suffer from type 2 diabetes. Also, trees planted as landscaping around social housing, schools, and new property developments should be fruit trees not ornamental trees as this would give greater access to fresh fruit to a wide range of people and increase the number who regular eat five portions of fruit/veg a day.",
