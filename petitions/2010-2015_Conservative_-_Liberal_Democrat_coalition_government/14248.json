This is the third summer when it has rained consistently throughout August, and finding things for children to do becomes increasingly difficult. The only people who enjoy this long break are teachers. For the rest of us it is a childcare juggling act, resulting sometimes in huge childcare bills. Children too suffer, it can take a few weeks for their brains to get back in to gear in September! with all the news on poor standards of the 3 Rs, how can we continue to justify such a long holiday?",
