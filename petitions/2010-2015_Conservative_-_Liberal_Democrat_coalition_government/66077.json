        "additional_details": "Art Psychotherapy needs to be part of the landscape of all NHS hospitals for complex mental illnesses, especially for those recovering from depressive illness.\r\nThis would:\r\n-combine deep inner trauma using art materials with verbal accounts of past experiences, when talking therapies alone have failed in the past.\r\n\r\n-act as a preventative/recovery program in an attempt to reduce hospitalisation which is costly.\r\n\r\n-attempt to contribute to reducing the bed crisis in mental hospitals when patients can be treated as out patients, thus sustaining a daily routine in own surroundings which also aids recovery.\r\n\r\nFor this reason it seems sense for the Government to invest in art psychotherapy for out patient care for a multitude of mental illnesses, for far more effective recovery treatment plans, which may contribute to cutting some aspects of the deficit throughout the NHS.",
