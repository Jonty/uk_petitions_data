        "additional_details": "From October 2014 vehicle tax discs are to be abolished and Vehicle Excise Duty (car tax to most of us) will become non-transferrable on the sale of a vehicle. This means you will not be able to offer a vehicle for sale with tax. The new owner will have to buy tax for the vehicle and the seller will be able to claim back unused months.\r\n\r\nThis inconveniences both the seller and the buyer and serves only to make money at the motorists expense. There is no other credible reason to do this.\r\n\r\nThe Government should scrap this plan and allow VED already purchased to remain on the vehicle.",
