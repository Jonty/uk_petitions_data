        "additional_details": "The motor industry is a very important industry worldwide.  Every year thousands of new cars are registered in the UK that have been manufactured abroad.  This affects the number of jobs in the UK and our trade balance of payments.\r\n\r\nThe UK government should introduce very significant incentive deals to encourage quality manufacturers to establish production in the UK. This will also boost employment in many other industries. We have hundreds of thousands of potential employees of all ages who could be employed in this work. The costs of the incentives could therefore be significantly offset by the reduction in state benefits and generate many social benefits.\r\n\r\nIncentives must be based on achievement of comparables with other manufacturers  and performance targets in UK and export markets.\r\n\r\n",
