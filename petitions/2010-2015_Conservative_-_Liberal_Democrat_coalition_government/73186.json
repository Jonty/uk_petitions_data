This would cover both Primary and secondary schools.\r\nThis maybe run as a separate entity within schools boundary or shared by close schools.\r\nThis care would ensure that every child can access to a health breakfast and after-school snack.\r\nThis would also ensure children of working parents are not deprived of joining after-school clubs or social events.\r\nThis solution would also ease the increasing congestion around schools. An estimated 50% of working parents would then stagger the collections times.\r\nImproved school attendance; Children at school for 7.30am\r\nFair pricing for all parents.\r\nAll the government talk about parents getting back to work, they need to help those already in work. As safe, reliable childcare places become more and more scarce.\r\n",
