        "additional_details": "Cowpen Road Blyth is a total nightmare for drivers at anytime of day and horrendous from 3pm/ 6pm in the evening. On a two mile stretch of road there are 8 sets of traffic lights.. There are 4 sets within a few hundred yards leading from the school,  leading into and out of the industrial estate, the housing estate. and the Premier shop. There are two Asda stores, two retail parks, a Mcdonalds, a KFC, a restaurant, two pubs, and two schools on this route. It could be made a better road simply by adding a couple of new roads one via the riverside leading on to the spine road vice versa and one taking you to Cowpen and Newsham from the spine road past the Main Asda store. This stretch of road is not suitable for the volume of traffic that use it and the Highways Department just keeps adding traffic lights and islands. Someone needs to get their head around this as it is the most frustrating stretch of road ever.",
