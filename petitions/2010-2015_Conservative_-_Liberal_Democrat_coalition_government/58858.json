If any of these games are shown on Sky, they're \"blacked out\" & I can't watch them live.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to make people sign up for Sky, however if I've already paid to watch the sport why should I have to sign up for Sky?\r\n\r\nThis practice is used in America to help ticket sales - games are blacked out unless a certain percentage of stadium tickets are sold.\r\n\r\nThis practice shouldn't be used in the UK & it should be made illegal. It's appauling that I pay \u00a3100 a year for a service that's crippled because of Sky.",
