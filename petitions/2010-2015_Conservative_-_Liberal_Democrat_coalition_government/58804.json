Can a system be introduced to make them release a radio edit version of the album alongside the explicit one so that consumers have the choice. Young children often want to buy albums of their favourite artists but as parents we often have to say no. This must also negatively affect the music industry as the only CDs that we can buy for our children with confidence are the 'Now' and 'pop party' compilations.",
