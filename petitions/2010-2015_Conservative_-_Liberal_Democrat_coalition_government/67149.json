        "additional_details": "Andargachew Tsege, a British national, who has been serving as secretary general of Ginbot 7 for Freedom and Democracy, an Ethiopian pro democracy movement, has been detained in Yemen airport while in transit to a third country. As diplomatic sources and a press release from his party , Ginbot 7 for Freedom and Democracy indicated, Andargachew has been illegally extradited to the tyrannical regime in Ethiopia. Andargachew has previously been sentenced to death in absentia by a kangaroo court in Ethiopian and there is a strong possibility of torture and possible execution in his detention. We supporters of the Ethiopian democratic movement both at home and in the diaspora strongly demand the Commonwealth and Foreign Office to make concerted effort for the immediate release of Mr Andargachew. As the Office has been complacent on the case we also strongly demand Her Majesty\u2019s Government to initiate an enquiry on to the Office\u2019s handling of the case. ",
