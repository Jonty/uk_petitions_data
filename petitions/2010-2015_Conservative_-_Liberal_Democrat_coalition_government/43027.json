        "additional_details": "We the undersigned, call upon the Prime Minister to boycott the Commonwealth Heads Of Government Meeting (CHOGM) to be held in Sri Lanka in 2013.\r\n\r\nWe ask him to abide by the recommendations of the fourth report of the Foreign Affairs Committee on The role and future of the Commonwealth that \u201ccontinuing evidence of serious human rights abuses in Sri Lanka shows that the Commonwealth's decision to hold the 2013 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Colombo was wrong. We are impressed by the clear and forthright stance taken by the Canadian Prime Minister, who has said he would attend the Meeting only if human rights were improved. The UK Prime Minister should publicly state his unwillingness to attend the meeting unless he receives convincing and independently-verified evidence of substantial and sustainable improvements in human and political rights in Sri Lanka\u201d.\r\n\r\n",
