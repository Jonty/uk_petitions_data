        "additional_details": "This universal benefit should not be means tested. \u00a350k is not a lot of money to a household with two children with one breadwinner. Tax and NI alone amounts to almost \u00a31k per month or \u00a312k per year of which the benefit payment is a very small percentage of. This is the only benefit left for honest hardworking families who strive to work hard and allow children to be brought up by a stay at home parent. The loss of this benefit equates to an almost \u00a33k per year pay cut to the single earner which in current times of fiscal pressures is unfair and morally wrong when a family with two working parents can earn \u00a349,999 each without loss of the benefit.\r\n\r\nI request that this proposal is withdrawn and reviewed to ensure fairness and equality to all households and not individuals.",
