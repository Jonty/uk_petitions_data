There was huge public interest in this vote with many feeling that their opinions are being ignored.  MP's are elected officials who work for the people.  They should therefore be allowed to consult with their constituents and form opinions which they can express in the house of commons.  Being told how to vote by party leaders is a huge insult to the people who voted for them.",
