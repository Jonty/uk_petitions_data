        "additional_details": "Cyberknife, a revolutionary way to treat common types of cancers such as liver, prostate, ovarian,breast,spine, neck and head. The cyberknife is amazingly precise, the radiation from it is focused only on the cancer tumour itself which means healthy tissue surrounding the tumour is unharmed.This is in stark contrast to traditional treatments which are often unsuitable for complex cancers or tumours close to vital organs. WE NEED ONE IN THE SOUTH WEST Lives can be saved if only government would give the hospitals in Bristol and Devon funding. Support this e petition PLEASE\r\nWe need 100,000 signatures.
