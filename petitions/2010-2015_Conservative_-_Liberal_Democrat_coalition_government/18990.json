        "additional_details": "We request that the whole aim, purpose and implementation of COMPULSORY WATER METERING is thoroughly investigated by parliament and is entirely withdrawn in favour of far more effective and more well established alternative water saving measures and responsible planning and construction of water utility infrastructure. If not HOUSEHOLDERS WILL HAVE TO PAY ON AVERAGE BETWEEN \u00a3200 TO \u00a3600 EXTRA PER HOUSEHOLD PER YEAR AD INFINITUM, (SOME LARGER OR EXTENDED FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS COULD PAY UP TO \u00a31400 EXTRA). Affected householders are invariably in older housing that has a long successful record of sustainable historic use of water, over many decades or even over a century, completely funded by the water and drainage rates. They should not be expected by the charge of an extra levy, to subsidise mismanagement by government, utility companies and new housing developers, of the planning and construction of utility infrastructure elsewhere.",
