        "additional_details": "The youth who go to school, get the grades required for their future career and can't ever manage to find their dream job. Over 1 million of youth are unemployed where there is no jobs. Apprenticeships are becoming more difficult to find such as construction which I am in. Plumbing apprenticeship's being offered to the youth has fallen over 40% in the past 10-15 years. The apprenticeship grant's that were invented have only done a small majority to boost apprenticeship's but the construction industry is slowly collapsing with youth trying to get into a career path, i'm asking the government to look into a better path to take into more apprenticeship's and encouraging business's to take more apprenticeship's on. Stop and look at the future and think how certain construction jobs and how many people won't be doing them jobs in years to come because of how difficult it is to get into.",
