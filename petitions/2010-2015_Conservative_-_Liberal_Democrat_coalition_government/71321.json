        "additional_details": "The welfare policy that covers the welfare and safe being for rabbits has not been updated since .  It does not include specific laws for minimum hutch sizes, keeping the rabbits in pairs and states that somebody as young as 16 is legally allowed to buy a rabbit unsupervised.\r\nOver 67,000 rabbits are abandoned every year in the UK alone.  This is only ones that have been counted and given to rehousing pet shelters.  This does not include the many that have been let loose into the wild to fend for themselves.  Many are abandoned because their owners do not realise what they are undertaking when they first pick a rabbit as a pet.\r\nMany laws have been passed in the last year alone, but for dogs and cats only.  The rabbit is the UK's third most popular pet.  But is also the most neglected.\r\nPlease help by adding your signature to make a review of the welfare laws 'protecting' pet rabbits happen now!",
