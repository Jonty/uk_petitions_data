        "additional_details": "At the moment, disabled people get free carparking in most UK hospitals, whereas pensioners, single parents, unemployed etc have to pay extortionet fees for the privilege.  We need the government to find a solution for all.  Hospital parking costs need to be reduced for all, especially those with sick children who need their parents with them at all times.  I want the goverment to implement changes to help people not cost them more money just when they need it most.",
