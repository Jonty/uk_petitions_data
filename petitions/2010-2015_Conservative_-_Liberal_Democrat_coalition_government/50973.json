        "additional_details": "The uk government should respect the risk prison officers take as frontline staffing everyday and as such they should be recognised and treated the same as police officers in terms of retirement age, pay & conditions of employment.  Prison staff are the forgotten service by government and are often portrayed as overpaid & lazy when this could not be further from the truth.  Prison staff face difficult, challenging and stressful situations as an everyday occurrence which takes its toll not only on health but on their home life as well. Respect the risk.",
