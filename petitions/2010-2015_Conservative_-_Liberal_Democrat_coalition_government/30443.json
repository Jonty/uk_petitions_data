        "additional_details": "In 2012 the Law Commission started a consultation to review the courts broad and discretionary treatment of assets with ancillary claims on premarital and inherited assets upon separation.  A further extension and expansion on this consultation period (Matrimonial Property, Needs and Agreements Project) has been extended and due for release by the Law Commission in Autumn 2013.  We urge for reform and offer support to this review, understanding that current legislation often assumes an automatic right of claim and appears not to take into account the personal and individual circumstances on a case by case pro rata basis.",
