        "additional_details": "PCSOs have limited powers, unlike attested constables, whilst often being the prime contact between public and police.  This does not reduce crime, or instill faith in the protection of the public by the police in the community.  Therefore we propose that PCSOs should be replaced by Special Constables paid pro-rata, possibly at the rate currently salaried to PCSOs in view of budgetary concerns.  A personal and open letter to the relevent persons will be drafted outlining the arguments.",
