        "additional_details": "Governments of all political hues seek to confuse voters who object to mass EU economic migration with a welter of unverified, generalisations about the effects of this modern phenomenon.\r\n\r\nMany voters believe that the cynical plundering of our benefits system and Health Service by Eastern Europeans and remittances from low paid jobs being sent out of the country cannot possibly add up to a net benefit to the UK and its native inhabitants. Furthermore, the unskilled jobs that Eastern European migrants secure are no longer available to young people at a time of scarce jobs.\r\n\r\nAs it seems likely that future Governments will give the green light to further expansion of the EU without making any attempt to argue for restrictions to the freedom of movement rules, it is essential that the full facts are known to inform political debate. This should be done by establishing a Royal Commission into the economic and social effects on the UK of mass EU economic migration",
