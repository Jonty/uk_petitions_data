This is fueling a disrespect for society and the rule of law amongst the young.\r\n\r\nIt is these products which are gateway to harder drugs for many young people which continue to life of dependancy and deliquency.\r\n\r\nGreater control of these products would lead to a more civilised society with greater benefits in respect of health and productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
