Millions of innocent civilians are now living under very difficult circumstances and with various illnesses without water, food or electricity, having been caught in this conflict outwith their control. Their salaries have been suspended.\r\n\r\nWe call on the United Kingdom to provide humanitarian aid and medical supplies for the civilians caught up in this conflict and to exert their maximal influence on the Iraqi government to make sure civilians are not targeted in this conflict.\r\n",
