        "additional_details": "This petition asks for two things; Firstly, a complete review of the system adopted by GPs, Health Visitors and any other health care professional that come into contact with babies suffering from reflux and/or allergies. Parents feel they are often dismissed by their GP as overreacting or anxious when they raise concerns. It seems GPs are not fully trained in this area of concern and therefore, do not take it serious enough at present. The government needs to put measures into place to make sure parents receive the right help and understanding when faced with a baby with reflux and /or allergies. Secondly, a major concern is that if the new draft guidance from the National Health and Care Excellence is followed, then the treatment and limited support for reflux babies and their parents that does exist at present will be made much worse. This means thousands of babies will be left with painful symptoms of acid reflux as a result of the new guidelines. ",
