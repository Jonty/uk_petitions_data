        "additional_details": "For the past 20 years government after government has cut the number of personnel in the Armed Forces and cut the defence budget. Yet the government still expects the Armed Forces to do as much around the world as they have ever done.\r\n\r\nWe, the people of Britain, are not militarists. We don't want a 1 million strong army or a UK Gendarmerie. What we want is a well-resourced and appropriately-sized military backed up by a well organised and well-funded MoD.\r\n\r\nWe demand that the SDSR is re-opened; a real, honest debate on what our military is expected to do takes place and the military is sized accordingly.",
