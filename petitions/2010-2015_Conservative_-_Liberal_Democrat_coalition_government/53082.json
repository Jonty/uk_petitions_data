Why should we stay at home and hide away.\r\n\r\nRather than boycott the games we should support LGBT athletes and fans by waiving our rainbow flags and being supportive of gay people around the world.  I would like the government to support and endorse rainbow flags and wristbands for all GB athletes and fans to show our dislike and disgust for Russia's Anti Gay legislation.",
