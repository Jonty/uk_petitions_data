It's about time it was opened up to market conditions and run by captains of industry and not artists and academics.\r\n3. The world service should be protected.\r\n4. Huge amounts of income is generated from program sales, the rest could be generated from program sponsorship.\r\n5. It's about time the huge bonuses, pay off's and presenters salaries coming from the tax payers pocket stopped.\r\n6. The \u00a3130 license fee I pay would be equivalent to an increase of \u00a3650 in my personnel tax allowance.",
