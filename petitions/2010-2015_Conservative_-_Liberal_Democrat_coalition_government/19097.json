        "additional_details": "The car insurance prices are now just a joke. There is no one who is regulating the price so the insurance companies are charging what they want.  People are already hit hard by the prices or fuel and tax. They shouldnt be penalising people because of where they live as much as they do. They say about uninsured drivers pushing up prices but if the prices were not that high more people would be able to afford it. Insurance companies should not ask about your previous non fault accidents it was not your fault so why should you pay and increased premium. If this dosent get stopped now the insurance will just keep rising. The government needs an independant authority who can regulate and the prices so they just dont spiral untill the point when no one can afford to drive. Or maybe thats what the government wants. ",
