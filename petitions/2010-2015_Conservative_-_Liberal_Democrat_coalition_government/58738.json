It's bad enough with British people adding to this problem and it's going to get worse with more Europeans entering our country.\r\n\r\nIf our parliament will not pull out of Europe and become more independent for our benefit, then laws should be put in place.\r\nWhite British/British citizens should have higher priority, and should be open to opportunities before any EU citizen is.\r\nWe should not be excluded out of certain areas of England and we should not be banned from entering shops which are run by Europeans or British citizens.\r\nMore importantly we must be able to feel secure in this country.
