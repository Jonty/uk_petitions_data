        "additional_details": "The British Public calls on the Government to withdraw the law that will let Fuel Companies charge an additional \u00a31bn a year over the next 7 years on top of the unfairly high current fuel charges. This is unneccessary and inapproprate in a time of economic downturn when wages have not kept pace with inflation for many years.  Fuel prices - domestic and vehicle - are already at an all time high causing distress and suffering to many people.  The Fuel Companies make more than enough profit to fund their own new technology and research.  That is what profit is for.  ",
