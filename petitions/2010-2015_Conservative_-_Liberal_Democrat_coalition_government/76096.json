        "additional_details": "I am studying in this country since last 5 years that means I am studying in english and I passed my all exams in english. So why we need to give IELTS exam while we are already studying in the uk in english medium system. I am not trying to go against the law as I respect to all UK immigration laws but I think this is international english exam for those students who comes first time to study in the uk.\r\n\r\nAccording to law we have to get score 5.5 in a each section. (Reading,Listening,Writing and Speaking). if home office people wants an ielts exam for international students who are studying in the uk then just make standard over all 5.5 band for those students.\r\n",
