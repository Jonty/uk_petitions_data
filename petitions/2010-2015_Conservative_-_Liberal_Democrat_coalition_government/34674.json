        "action": "Driving leglisation changes affecting people with epilepsy",
        "additional_details": "Proposed changes to legislation will potentially allow people who have epileptic seizures not affecting their consciousness to drive whilst still having seizures.  It disregards other contributing factors, for example, concentration, reaction time, vision disturbance from hallucinations to constant blinking for seconds to minutes.\r\n\r\nThe legislation ultimitely enables the individual to decide on their suitability to drive, and if someone is determined to drive, all they have to do is lie about how their seizures affect them.  The government needs to do its research into the 40 different seizure types, as it seems to have used a stereotypical (tonic-clonic) seizure upon which to base these changes.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to have this legislation re-assessed",
