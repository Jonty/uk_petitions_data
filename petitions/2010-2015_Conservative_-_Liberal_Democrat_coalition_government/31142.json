        "additional_details": "Currently, there is growing awareness of \"evil acts\" conducted by Joseph Kony and the Lords Resistance Army, an army which Kony has been accused of both creating and leading. The acts he has been accused of directly violate articles 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the European Convention of Human rights. The people of the UK (and others worldwide) would like to ask the PM, and his administration, for an objective account of his actions and an accurate account of the actions that the UK are prepared to take in support of the victims of his 'crimes against humanity'.",
