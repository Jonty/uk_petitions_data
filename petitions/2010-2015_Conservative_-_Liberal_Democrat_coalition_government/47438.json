        "action": "Eradicate Plastic Carrier Bags Now",
        "additional_details": "Due to increases in population we rely more on man made materials such as plastic.  We, in the UK use 12 Billion plastic carrier bags per year which go to land-fill, causing pollution to our soil & water tables & end up in our food chain. The rest cause litter, distress & death to sea creatures, birds and wildlife the world over.\r\nSome nations have placed a tax on plastic carrier bags, reducing their usage by 90% on average. These countries include Malta, Wales, Southern Ireland etc.\r\nWe here in the UK sadly prevaricate with no real leadership on this matter.\r\nTherfore I ask you humbly if you will do me the honour and sign this E-Petition calling for a minimum 10p tax on all plastic carrier bags. It just needs YOUR vote to count.\r\nThank you once again for reading this and Please vote and forward this link on.\r\nWith kind regards John W.Jones.\r\n\r\n\"We the undersigned ask this Government to impose a 10p tax on plastic carrier bags at point of sale.\"",
