        "additional_details": "Not all speeding motorists should be fined and given penalty points. Penalty points & fines should only be given for speeding recklessly, in the light of prevailing conditions at the time concerned, like traffic conditions (like heavy traffic), time of day (like rush hour), weather conditions (like snowing), location (like near zebra crossings) concerned. The next generation of speeding devices may make stationary fixed speed cameras obsolete, as a vehicle could be tracked everywhere it travels within a radius of 30 miles whatever roads it uses and its average speed in the light of prevailing conditions can be used as evidence of reckless speeding. The driver may also be biometrically identified using such hi-Tec speed cameras.",
