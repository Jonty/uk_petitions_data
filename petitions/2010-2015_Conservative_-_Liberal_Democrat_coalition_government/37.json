During the Edward Heath government, I seem to remember a referendum on \"The Common Market\" at the time we were promised border-less trade between the existing members. No one asked us if we wanted or needed a European parliament. We were promised a referendum by the last government , which never materialized, I wonder why? The reason all political party's and indeed MP's themselves are frightened of a referendum, is because they are worried about the outcome being, as the French president, famously said on several occasions Non. I don't want  a debate, I would like to fulfill my democratic right to Vote quite simply Yes or No to continue in a failing European Union    ",
