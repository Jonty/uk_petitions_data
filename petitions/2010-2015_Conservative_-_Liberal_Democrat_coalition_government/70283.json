        "additional_details": "In July 2013 the government introduced fees for taking an employer to an employment tribunal.  Their reasoning behind this was that it would stop people making bogus claims.\r\nIn reality, all introducing these fees has done is made it financially impossible for the majority of people who have been treated unfairly to take action against their employer.\r\n\r\nThe current fees for taking an employer to an employment tribunal are between \u00a3390 and \u00a31200\r\n\r\nAccording to research carried out by Citizens Advice, now only 14% of valid claims are being taken forward to a tribunal and from October 2013 to March 2014 there was a 73% drop in claims on the same period the previous year.\r\n\r\nAction: Stop making unfairly treated employees pay fees to take action against employers that are breaking the law.",
