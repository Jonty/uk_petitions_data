Many sufferers will not come forward for help nor feel able to discuss their issues freely due to the stigma attached to mental health issues by individuals and employers. We also want the Department of Health to supply better access to counselling and other therapies such as Art Therapy, Massage Therapy and Sports Therapy, and to support self-help groups such as Suffer In Silence No More to enable sufferers, their families and their friends to work towards getting well.",
