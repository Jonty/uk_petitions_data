In order for people to afford this, the Govt should seriously consider reducing income tax and VAT so people have more cash at hand. On top of this, the Goft should introduce compulsory individual pension fund (that helps in housing & retirement pension too) that contributes a certain percentage into a medical saving which is for hospitalisation and pay partially for their adhoc medical expenses.",
