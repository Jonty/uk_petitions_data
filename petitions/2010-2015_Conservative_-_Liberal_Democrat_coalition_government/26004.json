        "additional_details": "In 1974 Keighley fell into the greedy arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Bradford under the Local Government Act. The merger still causes a lot of bitterness among Keighley people who resented being 'taken over' by Bradford and accused the cities council of neglecting the town.\r\nThe residents of Ilkley and Keighley pay more in Council Tax than those who live in the three Bradford parliamentary seats combined \u2013 but do not get anything like value for money in return.\r\nSo claims MP Kris Hopkins, who is calling for the people of the two towns to be given the chance to vote to break away from Bradford.\r\nOnce the relative wealth is taken away from Bradford the true level of deprivation of the city would be seen and more help given.\r\nPeople do want accountable, locally-based representation.\r\nMoney should be spent on local priorities and not on projects dictated by City Hall.\r\n",
