        "additional_details": "The aim of this petition is to stop hard working UK citizens from paying for holidays abroad then losing either the holiday, or the money they paid, or in many cases both, when the travel company goes bust either before the holiday is taken, or while the holidaymakers are on the holiday! I would like any monies paid for such holidays to simply be held in an escrow account until the holiday has been taken by the people who have paid for it. Once the holidaymakers are back in the UK having completed their holday, then the money is relased from escrow to pay all suppliers such as flights, hotels etc. The travel company should have no right to access that money until the holiday has been fulfilled. I suggest a government department be appointed administrator of the escrow account, with a government guarantee on payment to the suppliers of flights, hotels etc.",
