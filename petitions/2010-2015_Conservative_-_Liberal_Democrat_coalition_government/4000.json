        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that the subject of gun restriction should be looked at again by the government after the kneejerk emotional reaction of Dunblane. Thomas Watt Hamilton was a known danger before the massacre and police failed to remove his licence or firearms. Now the whole country is paying for their mistakes.\r\n\r\n Due to current pistol law our own Olympic athletes must train overseas for pistol events.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the current FAC laws are more than enough to make sure these pistols only end up in the hands of upstanding law abiding citizens. It is important to note that Northern Ireland and The Isle of Mann do not have this ban and currently aren't experiencing a problem with handgun crime.\r\n\r\nAlthough the pistol ban was designed to stop gun crime it has steadily risen since 1997 because criminals don't abide by the law and will always be able to get firearms. Disarming the law abiding because you can't control the criminals doesn't make sense.\r\n",
