Once in a lifetime \"peoples olympics\" in United Kingdom and the majority of working people will not be able to watch them live. subject to employers consent i would like people who have got a tv liscence at home to be able to take it to work without fear of prosecution for the duration of the olympiss & paralympics. Simple, easy, just needs the government to make an announcement -nice touch for the working people from a government who proclaim to be \"in touch with the people\".",
