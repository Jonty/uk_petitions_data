        "additional_details": "If HMG introduces minimum price of 40p per unit of alcohol, 2 litres of strong cider will cost \u00a36, whilst a half bottle (35cl) of whisky \u00a35.60. However a bottle of wine will cost \u00a33.60. Who will make the huge profits on selling cider? HMG, cider industry, both, none? This could result in higher profits for distillers, breweries, off licences, pubs unless HMRC tax each unit at a fixed amount (say \u00a30.25). Alcohol, drugs & other addictive behaviours biochemically stimulate the release of neurotransmitters Dopamine, Serotonin & endorphins at the 'pleasure centre' (i.e. mesolimbic dopamine system) of the brain. As the high regression rates of alcoholics indicate, the only way for alcoholics to lower (or stop) their alcohol intake level is when they genuinely wanted to do so. If a recovering alcoholic has an actual aversion towards alcohol then it is certain that the person is not a RECOVERING alcoholic but a teetotaller.",
