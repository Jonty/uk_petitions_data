It's a screaming voice in your head demanding and dictating everything you do, leaving you with nothing but being stuck in a hospital bed, eating disorders kill and people need to be aware of this, the government don't put enough time or money into helping eating disorder sufferers and it needs to be sorted... Please help spread this round and get something done about raising awareness and get some help in the community. For a lot of people, you have to be at a BMI of below 14 to get taken seriously where actually weigh is just a symptom of this awful illness, you can get an eating disorder at any weight, any time, any gender, any race... We need to do something so please help!",
