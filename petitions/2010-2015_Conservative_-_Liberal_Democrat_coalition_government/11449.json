I believe the top 200/100 UK employers to offer a better/ less stricter requirements in terms of qualifications, a UK pass at grade C or above, and a 2.2 or above should be accepted on to graduate programmes.\r\n\r\nIts an unfair system that most UK top employers continue to request whereby 45% of graduates get a 2.2. They are being left out of the job graduate job market unfairly\r\n\r\nA grade C at A-level  or 2.2 at degree level is not a fail, and should not be treated as one by the top UK employers. If this is the case, the a 2.2 or grade C should be classed a fail within the education system.\r\n\r\nA requirement for a minimum grade of 2:2 will allow more people to progress within top companies career levels, particularly those from lower working class backgrounds.\r\n",
