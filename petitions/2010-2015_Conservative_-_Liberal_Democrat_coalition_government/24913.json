        "additional_details": "The Government should stop banks, particularly ones of which we are all shareholders (through tax payments) from removing people from their properties when they fall behind on repayments.\r\n\r\nThis action is particularly important as, in the present climate, the banks will not be able to sell the home on and the situtation will increasingly arise where people will be homeless and homes will be empty.\r\n\r\nthe key points for this action are:\r\n1. Banks will not be able to foreclose on those suffering liquidity problems rather than being completely unable to pay back the money in any foreseeable future.\r\n2. Banks will not be able to foreclose on a home without having first proven they already have a buyer for the property.\r\n3. Banks will not be able to foreclose if this action will lead to homes being demolished.\r\n4. Any member of the public currently being forced out of their home should be given a grace period payed for by their contribution to the banking bailout.",
