Amy had been struck by an overtaking truck and hit the central reservation; she was stuck in her car but she was okay. Other drivers saw Amy, braked and went around. But because the driver who hit her was speeding, he didn't have time. He killed a wonderful young woman.\r\n\r\n80mph limits would lead to more crashes: the faster you drive, the less time you have to brake if you need to, like if there's queuing traffic ahead. These crashes cause awful suffering, lead to hold-ups, and cost the taxpayer because of costs to NHS and emergency services.\r\n\r\nRead more http://www.brake.org.uk/mwayspeed\r\n",
