It should be a student right to know which A-levels will not help them in the long run if they want to get into that university. If the titles of the A-levels that universities do not accept are published and are accessible by any student/persons then those subjects won't be taking - therefore avoiding the subject of university reject once applying. Not publishing these lists is making A level choices increasing difficult for students. Let us know which ones are not acedemic enough for your standards.",
