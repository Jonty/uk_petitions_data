        "additional_details": "We call on the government to commission an independent and thorough investigation of the health risks of establishing comprehensive 4G coverage in the UK.\r\n\r\nIn Israel, the Health and Environmental Protection Ministries oppose the new technology as it is \"likely to increase the public's overall exposure to radiation... and therefore, further study of the need and justification for this technology is required\". The WHO and EU are also aware of the risks from Wifi and Mobile phones and the use of both is restricted in schools in many countries (such as France and Canada).\r\n\r\nCurrently it is possible to avoid wifi signals if we want, but with complete 4G coverage we will have no choice. Before this happens we want to know the increased health risks both from the 4G phones themselves, and the 4G signal network before implementation is allowed to progress further.\r\n\r\nData from the mobile phone companies themselves must not be used because they have a vested interest in the outcome.",
