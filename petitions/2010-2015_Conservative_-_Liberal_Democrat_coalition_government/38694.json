        "additional_details": "Please support a petition to stop further unecessary closing of Medium Wave broadcasts, for the following reasons :\r\n\r\n- DAB and FM/VHF do not provide full coverage in the target area of each BBC local and regional\r\n- DAB and FM/VHF do not reach outside the target areas (eg: I like to keep in touch with regional BBC Wales from England)\r\nDAB has not reached enough listeners yet, and when the signal is weak, the audio breaks up completely, unlike on Medium Wave\r\n- Fewer programmes can be simultaneously broadcast by each BBC local and regional (eg: sports commentary)\r\n\r\nWith Thanks",
