        "additional_details": "I would like you to look into increasing the speed limit for HGV lorries on the A75 from 40mph to 50 mph, even for a trial period.\r\nTechnology has advanced on HGVs in recent years and drivers feel that increasing the limit would be beneficial to themselves and other road users.\r\nWe are professional drivers who are more highly trained than in previous years due to the driver CPC.\r\nTrucks travelling at 40mph can be more of a danger to the public as it can cause other road users to carry out dangerous manoeuvres to overtake these slow moving vehicles.\r\nThere's been talk that Irish HGV drivers are currently boycotting using the A75 because of the time it takes to travel this stretch of road at 40mph.\r\nThis could lead to a financial impact at the port of Cairnryan and other services throughout the region.",
