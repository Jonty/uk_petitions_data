        "additional_details": "I feel that the government should put an age limit on the ability to buy energy drinks. I work in a school and a lot of the children (11yrs-16yrs) buy these drinks and they significantly affect their ability to concentrate and learn within the classroom. A warning on these drinks bottles is not enough and children should not be allowed to buy them at all. ",
