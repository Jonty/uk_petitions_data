        "additional_details": "This e-petition is to ask the Justice Minister to drop the prosecution against three men arrested for allegedly stealing 'discarded food\u2019 from a skip on the premises of Iceland, a large grocery chain. The matter has been extensively reported in the media and can be found online and in the national newspapers.\r\n\r\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has refused requests from the lawyers defending the trio to drop the prosecution, instead the CPS feel the case should go ahead, because \"we feel there is significant public interest in prosecuting these three individuals\".\r\n\r\nI disagree; I feel there will be over whelming support for the prosecution to be stopped. Anyone that needs to find food in a skip to live on is desperate and needs help and not criminal conviction.\r\n\r\nTherefore I call upon the Justice Minister to stop this prosecution in the public interest.\r\n",
