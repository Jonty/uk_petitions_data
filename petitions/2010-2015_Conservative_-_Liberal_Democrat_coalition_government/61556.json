I feel the RSPCA is dialling down the actual importance of this issue and although they deem it \"sad\" that this is happening, they aren't reporting it enough or raising awareness. I have taken it upon myself to raise awareness, via a Facebook page that it is becoming more common for cats to be poisoned by anti freeze, whether deliberate or accidental. ",
