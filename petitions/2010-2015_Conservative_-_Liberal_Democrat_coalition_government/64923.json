The key requirment is that the animal must NOT be stunned before it is slaughtered.\r\n\r\nTo increase sales amongst the Islamic community, the supermarket chains have been gradually sneaking Halal meat into their stores, but have been forgetting to mention it to us.\r\n\r\nWe request that the government require retailers to clearly label all products which contain 'halal' meat so that consumers can make an informed choice as to whether they wish to eat meat from an animal which was slaughtered in a disgusting, cruel, inhumane way.\r\n\r\n",
