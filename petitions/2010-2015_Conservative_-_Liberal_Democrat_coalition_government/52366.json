        "additional_details": "I propose that we introduce a licensing system to eradicate poor dog ownership/handling.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to enforce every dog owner to purchase a dog owners license that also includes half a day\u2019s dog handling training every year... 90% of dog lovers are bereaved with the bad name given to their breed when in reality, regardless of your canine\u2019s breed, a well disciplined/educated dog should not be delegated into the 10% category.\r\n\r\nThe funds generated from the license fee will ultimately pay for the \u00bd a day training and cover the cost of wardens who will scout the country seeking unlicensed dogs and fining poor owners.  A 3x strike system can be negotiated.\r\n\r\nA chargeable dog ownership system will deter careless and irresponsible owners to possess a potentially dangerous dog. It is seen careless owners will not wish to part with the \u00a350 nor will they justify taking 6 hours out their day to take the training...\r\n",
