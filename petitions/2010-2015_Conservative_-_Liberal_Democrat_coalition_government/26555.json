The 'plastic bag' has become a symbol of our throw away culture and will remain unless human behaviour changes dramatically.\r\n\r\nOutline of the PBTS \u2013 Cap & Trade\r\n\r\n\u2022\tHM Government sets a fixed number and price of plastic bag permits to be allocated each year to supermarkets and other retailers;\r\n\u2022\tTotal number of permits is the limit on pollution \u2018the cap\u2019;\r\n\u2022\tPermits can be traded i.e. \u2018cap and trade\u2019;\r\n\u2022\tRetailers which reduce (abate) pollution for less than the price of the permit can sell the spare ones for profit\r\n\u2022\tRetailers that find it more expensive to reduce pollution can buy extra permits;\r\n\u2022\tGradually the supply of permits is reduced and the market price rises. This gives firms an incentive to seek new technologies/processes that will reduce their pollution emissions i.e. higher recycled plastic content in plastic bags or use of alternative materials bioplastics\r\n",
