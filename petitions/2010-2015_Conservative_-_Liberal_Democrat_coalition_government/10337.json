        "additional_details": "Is it not completely unfair that the new tax, tax credit and 2013 child benefit thresholds, sees a family with a single working parent earning less income than the total household income of two working parents pay more tax and lose benefits compared to the two working parents?\r\nFor example, a single income family with a household income of \u00a345k lose an additional \u00a34k per year, whereas, two parents earning \u00a325k each (total of \u00a350k) will pay less tax and keep benefits.\r\n\r\nOur Government needs to address this unfair system and their hypocritical support for the family unit. Look at the recent riots, it\u2019s time the Government start supporting parents who want to raise their pre-school children rather than a nursery? How can parents be parents if they work all the hours in the day and not see them?\r\n\r\nPlease sign this if you agree that something needs to done. More and more single working parent families are financially and emotionally stressed by this.",
