        "additional_details": "The government should remove any law which removes a citizens right to the freedom of expression. This is for a number of reasons such as:\r\n-A law should be in place in order to protect society, not oppress it.\r\n-In terms of the argument that hate speech offends etc, the government should recognise that the freedom to someone's thoughts and expression is very different from their right to an audience.\r\n\r\nThe government should take the action of removing any law which restricts a citizens freedom to express opinion. This includes current crimes such as hate speech and sedition.\r\nThey should also install an equivalent of the first amendment of the American constitution in order to make sure that no future government can remove this fundamental right.\r\n\r\nThe freedom of speech is only truly free if it is the freedom of speech for the person who thinks differently.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
