        "additional_details": "Sadly, Winnie Johnson has passed away without being given the right to bury her son Keith Bennet who was killed during the infamous 'Moors Murders'. The Police investigation was closed several years ago as it was deemed to be 'dormant'. In light on Winnie's death and taking in to account, the leaps in technology used to investigate crimes, please sign this petition for the Police to re-open the case and search once more for Keith's body. Hopefully his mother is now once again reunited and finally at solace.",
