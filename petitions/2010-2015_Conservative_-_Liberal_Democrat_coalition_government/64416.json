        "additional_details": "We want any animal abusers to have to sign a life-long register so they are named and shamed for such cruelty. Just like sex offenders are always on a list, we want the same for animal abusers. Also, a life long ban from any animals would also be guaranteed. I feel that animals which have been tied up, abandoned, killed, starved, neglected etc are all serious and equal offenses which should result in the owners having a ban and signing a register because what is stopping them doing it again or to people? I technically think that the dog licenses should come back and also that owners should have information and lessons of how to take care of their animals but also have recent check ups on how they are dealing with each pet. If they do not take their animal to the vets this should also be looked up as neglection and micro chipping should be a must!",
