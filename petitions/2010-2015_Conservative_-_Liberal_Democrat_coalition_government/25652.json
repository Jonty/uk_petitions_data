(This not counting an additional three weeks of party conferences).\r\nThis will give considerably more time to debate issues and still result in their speedier resolution.\r\nTake, for example, a current petition which has reached 126,000 signatures. The date set for debate is over a year after the 100,000 signatures were achieved and 3 months after the due date for closure of the petition.\r\n",
