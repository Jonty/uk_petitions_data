        "additional_details": "The new 12-sided One Pound Coin proposed by the Chancellor will cause problems that outweigh the benefits.\r\nFirstly, both private and public sectors will be forced to make changes to coin-based machinery such as parking ticket machines, shopping trolleys and self-check out machines. This will cost a lot of public and private money to tackle a non-existent problem. Furthermore, the round pound looks a lot better and British than the proposed Euro-esque coin.\r\nSecondly, this proposal is based on a false premise that a 12-sided pound coin will be any harder to replicate by counterfeiters than a round one. Until it can be proved that these highly skilled criminals are not capable of producing these it is completely ridiculous that in a time of saving and cutting the government can waste money on such a useless venture that will hit the taxpayer and businesses.\r\nThis issue should be debated and scrutinised in parliament democratically.",
