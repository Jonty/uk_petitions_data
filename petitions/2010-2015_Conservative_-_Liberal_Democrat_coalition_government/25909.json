        "additional_details": "The government imposed Airline Passenger Duty is currently applied to four different regions or bands.  The Caribbean region is grouped with more distant regions such as South East Asia and South America. As a result, travelers will pay more taxes to travel  from the U.K. to the Caribbean than they would to anywhere in the U.S., including Hawaii.\r\n\r\nWe ask Her Majesty's Treasury to conduct a review of the current banding system and in turn reduce the APD.  This will enable the Caribbean region to remain competitive to travellers in this highly competitive marketplace, that has been greatly effected by a challenging economic climate\r\n\r\n\r\n",
