        "action": "Withdraw British taxpayer funding from Palestine if UN bid for  statehood goes ahead",
        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call upon the British government to withdraw the British taxpayer's commitment to Palestine which equates to  nearly \u00a3300m over three years if the Palestinian Authority bids for statehood in defiance of its neighbours. We see it as necessary to also call upon the European Union to withdraw spending taxpayers money if the bid goes ahead. The UN is being used as leverage for Palestine to over-ride some of their neighbours' demands such as their right to exist.\r\n\r\nSo when Hamas and Fatah request recognition of statehood at the 66th general assembly of the UN opening on the 20th September this year, British diplomats should make it clear the British government will be replicating this policy that has been successfully administered by U.S envoys as they have informed the Palestinians the US taxpayer will withhold future funds from Palestine if they proceed with the bid in defiance of their neighbours.",
