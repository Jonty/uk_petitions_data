It is crazy to plough billions into other nation whilst our own people suffer.\r\nThis money should go towards reducing cuts to the emergency services and the public sector. It seems crazy to think it is good economics to put people out of work by cuts to these services.\r\n\r\nWe need to look closely at who when we are on our feet we give overseas aid to, we should not give aid to countries with nuclear weapons, massive armed forces and we should ensure aid is not abused by corrupt government as we have seen one African leader bought a private jet from aid money.\r\n",
