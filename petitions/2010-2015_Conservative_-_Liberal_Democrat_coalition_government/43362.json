        "additional_details": "As people that are on carers allowance have to be caring for someone at least 35 hours a week they should be entitled to working tax credits. Carers allowance is a taxable income and as such the person is working even if it is for very little. Carers should be given the same rights as anyone else that is working and the same support regardless of their ability to have another Job along with being a care giver. For many caring for someone that has a disability is a 24/7 Job with no holiday pay and no other way of gaining an income. ",
