        "additional_details": "It is to proposed the UK government ensure that the title of \u2018Engineer\u2019 is legally protected as it is in many other countries around the world, including Germany, France, USA and Canada. The title needs to be legally protected for Professional Engineers.\r\n\r\nProtecting the title will aid in:\r\n- Improving the salaries of Engineers;\r\n- Increasing the respect society will have for Engineers;\r\n- Increasing the admiration and interest of the younger generation wanting to pursue careers in Engineering;\r\n- Heightening the reputation of British Engineers once more.\r\n\r\nWithin academia and the industry, Engineering is regarded as complex and in-depth subject; students and professionals deserve the rightful recognition.\r\n\r\nOther professions; such as a Doctor or an Architect, have protected titles, yet Engineering \u2013 a field that has aided Britain to what it is today is not protected.",
