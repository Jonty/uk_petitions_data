If MP\u2019s want more money than they should award more to nurses.\r\n\r\nThe argument that reducing MP\u2019s pay would deter high calibre people also applies to the very important role that nurses play.  Our nurses are extremely well trained and dedicated and yet manage on a fraction of the money paid to MP\u2019s , many of who also have additional avenues of income.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be greater parity between what MP\u2019s are paid and the people they serve.\r\n",
