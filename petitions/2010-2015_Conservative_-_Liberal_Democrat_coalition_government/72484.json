        "additional_details": "Every year thousands of UK Roadside recovery drivers are killed injured or involved in near misses when attending broken down vehicles.\r\n\r\nDespite working alongside the emergency services to keep our road network flowing and our motorists safe Recovery drivers are not afforded the simple protection of Red rear lights.\r\n\r\nThe amber light is no longer synonymous with a hazard but is daily site on many vehicles.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the government to amend the law to permit the use of red rear flashing lights on breakdown vehicles whilst stationary at an incident and whilst joining traffic.\r\nRed is the international colour for stop and would provide a safer working environment for recovery drivers.",
