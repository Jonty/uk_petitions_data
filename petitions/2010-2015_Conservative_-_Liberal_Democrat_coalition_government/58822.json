Over the last few years my savings have been stolen by this Government to subsidise those who borrowed and were profligate. Interest on my savings has been manipulated by the Government so that in real terms I lose money to subsidise those who were less responsible. This is hugely unfair, I will remember under whose watch this happened and I urge others in the same position to do likewise.",
