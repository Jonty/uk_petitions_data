        "additional_details": "Mental health research and treatment is seriously underfunded and this cannot continue. The government should follow Nick Clegg's lead by committing to increase funding for mental health research. Further it should also increase funding for mental health treatment and awareness. Everyone who is diagnosed by a medical professional as suffering from a mental health issue should see a psychiatrist to ensure optimal care. This will help stop the all too common cycle of misdiagnosis, mistreatment and the ongoing recurrence of illnesses. This destructive cycle fuels confusion about mental health conditions and exacerbates the stigma faced by sufferers. Mental health is just as an important part of a person's welfare as physical health. It is time for the welfare state and associated budget to be modernised to be reflective of the true cost that poor mental health has upon today's society relative to poor physical health.",
