        "additional_details": "In recent months Haringey Council have been actively investigating warehouse living communities.\r\n\r\nAt a Council Cabinet meeting on the 16th January, a decision was made to launch a task force into 'tackling' the issue of 'Unauthorised Living in Industrial Areas'.\r\n\r\nThe Council have powers to force purchase of the land to be used for redevelopment, putting an estimated 1800 people\u2019s tenancies are at risk.\r\n\r\nThe warehouses are home to many working in the creative industries but also students and professionals from all walks of life. The residents do not want to lose their homes and it would be a tragedy to destroy these vibrant and culturally rich communities.\r\n\r\nWe ask the UK Government to prevent the closure of the warehouses and protect the homes of hundreds of honest and hardworking people.",
