        "additional_details": "The local Council and Ombudsman Service between them can arrange to override a complainant through a Local Settlement .\r\nUnless maybe : if you consider the approval and legislate for local Councils to collect an amount of money ( Precept ? ) that is not for their disposal but to form a Legal Fund for local residents to , under strict conditions , take Council (s) to Court. An annual charge on the Council tax of \u00a31 per household / business would raise enough monies and not be a burden to the taxpayer.\r\nCouncils would need to work better knowing such monies are available to get redress in Court .\r\nCurrently  If a Settlement between them is agreed, further investigation is dropped and a report finding maladministration leading to injustice is never issued.\r\nThe complainant is ignored.\r\n\r\n Therefore, it can't really be classed as a settlement and neither can it be classed as local.\r\n\r\nScrap the Local Government Ombudsman",
