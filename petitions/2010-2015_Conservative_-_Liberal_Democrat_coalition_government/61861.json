        "additional_details": "To Install traffic calming measures, speed limit of 20mph, sufficient road markings and signage for local school and safety of pedestrians and local residents. To have the roads gritted / ploughed when the weather freezes or snows.\r\n\r\nCriftins C of E Primary School has a pupil number of 87.  The school is located on a single track lane.  At various times of the day there is increased traffic on the road which has a significant impact on road users and pedestrians.\r\nSpeed of traffic regularly exceeds 30mph which is excessive on a lane with a ridiculous speed limit of 60mph.\r\nNo road markings for school  - this is compromising childs, parents, teachers and all pedestrians safety.\r\nInsufficient signage to warn drivers to slow down near the school.\r\nBad weather poses a huge problem on a single track lane with many walking/cycling/driving to school.  Lanes have been reported as treacherous when the weather freezes and the snow falls. Lanes need to be gritted before 8am.",
