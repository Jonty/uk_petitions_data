If you have ever struggled to get a scan or referral and then had the stress of a misdiagnosis you will understand this petition. Money is a huge problem in the NHS so imagine a trust where the same people who refer also commission services etc...  are we about to witness a decrease in referrals and an increase in misdiagnosis? or are other NHS services going to loose out through lack of representation? This petition calls on the government to give all able NHS staff a right to have a seat in an equally represented democratically elected (GP) commissioning consortia and the removal of the secretary of health and trust board's power, as broadly stated within the Heath Bill (2010-11), to select people for, or to remove people from these positions. This petition believes that only in exceptional circumstances should the latter be possible and not without democratic processes in place.   ",
