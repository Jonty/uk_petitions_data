This includes all motorways and A roads from a radius of at least 40 miles from Stratford or the distance from the airports of Luton, Gatwick, Stansted and Heathrow.\r\n\r\nNon London venues to have similar with limits of at least 10 miles from any venue.\r\n\r\nUse to be made of those on community orders to help the clear up and sponsors to have a levy placed on them of 50 pence per attendee to the Games.",
