        "additional_details": "Before he died and whilst still enjoying the status of a dictator, Gaddafi admitted to providing the IRA with Semtex, along with other materials designed for the unlawful destruction of live and livelihoods. Even before this admission, British intelligence knew that this was the case.\r\nGaddafi having provided these materials, especially the Semtex, the IRA continued in its campaign of bombing towns and cities in the UK. Examples of this 'newly backed Libyan campaign are Enniskillen and Manchester. With such devastation in their hands, the IRA destroyed lives, families and livelihoods.\r\nHer Majesty's Government should seek compensation from Libya for the victims of these bombings.  Livelihoods were destroyed and many have not been able to rebuild their lives because of the loss of a living, for example per business, compensation here would be of great assistance to rebuilding lives.",
