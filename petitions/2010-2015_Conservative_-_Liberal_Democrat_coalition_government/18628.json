        "additional_details": "The electorate of this country pay taxes to provide free education. This should be extended to provide free education up to and including one degree. Students should pay for subsequent degrees.  All higher earners should pay a higher rate of tax not just graduates (which is in effect what the proposed increase in fees is - approx 9% extra tax for 25 years) as all elements of their education have helped them to develop their career. All graduates have the potential to earn more so why do graduates from less well off families, Wales, Scotland get subsidised degrees?  This is an inconsistent approach.The tax system should be amended to charge tax on a sliding scale, so higher earners pay more which is used to provide the free education for future graduates.\r\nEarnings up to \u00a312,000, to 42,000 20% tax, \u00a342,001 to  \u00a372,000 30% tax, \u00a372,00 to 150,000 40% tax, 150,000+ 50% tax ",
