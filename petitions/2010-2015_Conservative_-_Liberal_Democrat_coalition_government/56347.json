We believe that as a team we can work well and with the right support we can achieve success.\r\n\r\nThe Governors should be given a chance to correct all issues that have been highlighted alongside all those that are required for Al-Madinah to be a success. They have the passion, vision and commitment to move the school forward.\r\n\r\nThe media attention has been biased and the demands have been unreasonable. No other school has been treated in such a manner.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and forward this petition. This is the future of our children and communities. ",
