        "additional_details": "Individuals and families are struggling to make ends meet and struggling to live on very low wages, with rising VAT and tax duties on certain products; not to mention the level of inflation in comparrison to previous years, this is no secret.\r\n\r\nCertain voices from within the current government have said they believe that the tax threshold should rise from \u00a37475 to \u00a310,000 immediately, rather than a planned slow increase.\r\n\r\nDoing this immediately will give many families the means to get by, it could mean as much as an extra \u00a370 per month for many and will reduce poverty levels in the UK. It will also stimulate the economy as that money is spent and as people feel more confident about lending and paying the money they lend back.\r\n\r\nBy signing this petition we the Great British public agree that there would be no losers in raising the tax threshold and wish to stimulate a house of commons debate on taking the tax threshold to \u00a310,000 in 2012.
