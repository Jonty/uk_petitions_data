        "additional_details": "The UK government wish to replace nuclear weapons at significant cost to the taxpayer whilst banning other countries from having them. A debate should highlight that in no situations are the use of nuclear weapons a morally acceptable solution, and rather than providing a deterrent to other countries aggravate the situation, particularly when other nations are penalised for striving for them. The circa \u00a330 billion funds planned for nuclear weapons could significantly improve public services that are struggling at present, and a replacement for trident should not be produced.",
