        "additional_details": "This petition is calling for a specific law to be passed, guaranteeing the right for non resident parents to access their children at least every other weekend. See weekendaccess.com for more details.\r\n\r\nAt present, if one parent decides to restrict the other parent's rights of access to their children it is a very long and expensive legal process to gain access.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the government to enshrine in law the automatic right of access for the non resident  parent unless a court order is in place to prevent this.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the non resident parent should be entitled, as a minimum, to have access to the children every other weekend from Friday night to Monday morning. This right will ensure that the resident parent can not deny all access and hide behind a complex, slow and expensive legal system to the detriment of the children and the non resident parent.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
