Blaming an increase in the cost of fuel is the ongoing excuse, yet when the price of energy has fallen in previous years the cost to the householder has not matched these declines yet they continue to rise.\r\nSomething needs to be done and soon to reign in this greed before people are forced into increasingly spiraling poverty and debt.",
