Please help stop us stop the rogues destroying a fantastic industry.\r\nAt the moment only 10% of hairdressers are registered which can lead to danger in the salon.\r\nDavid Morris, a Conservative MP who used to run a salon himself, wants hairdressers to be regulated in the same way as doctors and dentists.\r\nHe thinks they should have to prove their qualifications before they practise on the public.\r\nThe issue was raised in the Commons on 30 November but the plans were blocked by MPs, who said there was no need for a change.\r\nAt the moment qualified stylists and colourists are invited to join the British Hairdressing Council, but this is voluntary.\r\nSally Styles from the council said: \"In other European countries and America and Australia, you need to have basic qualifications before you practise on the public, but in the UK you don't and we believe that is wrong.\"\r\n",
