        "additional_details": "The UK's roads, pavements and cycle paths are potholed, overgrown and hindering the Nation's leisure activities and recovery out of recession.  Yet, millions of hours of labour are lost when offenders are sent to prison for sentences of less than 12 months, as resources are too few and expensive to provide sufficient rehabilitative work and reoffending rates high after release.\r\n\r\nI propose offenders sentenced for all criminal offences and released from prison early should undertake some Unpaid Work.\r\n\r\nDifferent approaches would have to be implemented.  Community Payback would require investment and growth such as crews of supervised offenders working nights on closed roads.  Changing health and safety requirements that prevent Community Payback projects working on roads.",
