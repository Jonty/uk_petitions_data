        "additional_details": "Stop International students using education as an excuse to get married and settled in the UK. Many students come into the UK, to genuinely learn, and others simply to get married and settled in the UK.\r\nI was married to a student, who after receiving his spouse/visa began verbally and emotionally abusing and even attempting to emotionally blackmail me for money.  At one time even joking about throwing acid on my face to make me his. My ex-partner would call his student friends asking them if they wanted to get married and settled in the UK, giving them contact details of girls he met through work at a women\u2019s clothes store.  There are many innocent girls out their like me, I was lucky to escape but was left with an emotional scar. For this reason I believe it is important that students should stick to what they come to the UK to do, TO LEARN.\r\nI request the government to place a restriction on students from applying for a partner/spouse visa.\r\n",
