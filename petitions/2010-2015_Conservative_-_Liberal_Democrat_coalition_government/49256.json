        "additional_details": "Male Hypogonadism (testosterone deficiency) is severely underdiagnosed and untreated in the UK.\r\nTestosterone deficiency can occur at any age and can dramatically alter ones physical appearance, physical health, mental health, cognitive functions, and social interactions.\r\nTestosterone deficiency is diagnosed using two seperate blood tests, and treatment is testosterone replacement therapy.\r\nLow testosterone is currently diagnosed using laboratory reference ranges, however symptoms can present once total serum testosterone falls below 12nmol/L as per the UK guidlines (produced by medical experts in the field of urology, sexual medicine, and endocrinology). The result is that men with testosterone levels of 12 and below are not being treated.\r\nThe NHS must adapt the guidlines into practise as many men across Great Britain are suffering from condition which can wreck relationships, jobs, and enjoyment from life if left untreated.
