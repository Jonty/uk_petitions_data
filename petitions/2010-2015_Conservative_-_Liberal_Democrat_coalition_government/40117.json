Up to 30,000 parents and children would be prevented from joining their families in the UK because they are too poor, under proposed new immigration rules.According to estimates from independent government advisers on migration, the \u00a318,600 minimum salary would mean a 45 per cent reduction in family members settling in the UK.\r\n\r\nAll I could ask for in this situation is to change this rule, to help British citizens not to separate from the loved once.
