        "additional_details": "According to India's National Crime Records Bureau, the number of cases involving the rapes and assaults of girls and women are increasing substantially. This does not take into account all of the cases as not all incidents are reported.\r\n\r\nWe all have people that we want to protect. India's victims of rape and assaults are the mothers, sisters, daughters and partners of someone - people who also want to protect those close to them.\r\n\r\nIt may be viewed as 'India's problem' but it is the moral obligation of humanity to give support to India's ANTI-VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN MOVEMENT. By signing this petition, we are requesting that the UK government:\r\n\r\n* Places pressure on India's government to call for change in people's negative attitudes and ill-treatment towards females.\r\n\r\n* Help India stamp-out government corruption as well as improve police training in cases involving rape and assault of females.\r\n\r\n* Encourage the Indian government to provide better victim support.",
