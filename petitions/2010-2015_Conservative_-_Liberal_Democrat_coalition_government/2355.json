So prices being as high as \u00a34 (single) to go 6 miles down the road is just ridiculous. Especially as that is a lot of money which would be a useful saving for me and my parents. I strongly believe that Public Transport should be free for those under 18, and also that the private bus companies shouldn't be allowed to charge whatever they like.",
