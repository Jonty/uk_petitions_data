        "additional_details": "This petition refers to the SOA 2003 and how unjust it is towards men. However included should be lesbian and gay rape. Is it right that a lesbian rapist is only convicted of Assault by Penetration, and a gay man convicted of rape?? Needless to say is it right that a woman can drug a man and walk away on a sexual assualt charge? Under section 75 of the SOA 2003 anyone administering a drug in order to commit a sexual act is liable for a charge of rape, however this only applies to men. I would like this to be discussed in order for a just justice system. I thank you for your signatures.",
