The Dept for Transport must undertake to ensure that sufficient rolling-stock is available to Crosscountry Trains to allow them to upgrade this service to two trains an hour along the whole route thus doubling the frequency of services to and from Melton Mowbray, Oakham, Stamford & Peterborough. This service improvement should be in place by 2016 and be a condition of the extension of CrossCountry's franchise.\r\n\r\n2. The franchise extension agreement (currently being negotiated for this service) must also stipulate that services should run from Stansted & Birmingham up until 22.30 Mon - Sat.",
