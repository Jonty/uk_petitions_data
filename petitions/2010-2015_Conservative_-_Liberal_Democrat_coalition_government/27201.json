        "additional_details": "Oral cancer can be caused by smoking and drinking but it is also caused by  Human Papillomavirus (HPV), which is a sexually transmitted diseased and can be passed on by oral sex. 80% of adults are thought to have the HPV sometime in their lives and this can be passed on to their partners. In the UK, girls in year 8 at school (aged 12 to 13) are offered the Cervarix vaccine which also prevents HPV but boys and men are not offered this vaccine on the NHS. Consequently men dating women who have not had the vaccine are at danger of getting mouth/throat/gum cancer.",
