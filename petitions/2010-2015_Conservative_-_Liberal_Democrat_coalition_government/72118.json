        "additional_details": "Her Majesty the Queen has reigned for over sixty glorious years. Is it not time for this Government to give her the powers that she has her right to have. Every British man and woman knows that in all governments there is significant opposition with many leaders resigning due to the pressure of politics. Furthermore, many decisions our government has created is unpopular, such as the Iraq War under Tony Blair. It seems no politician can rule this country and earn the respect that her Majesty has achieved.  Her Majesty has the experience thus the wisdom to deal with political matters that many politicians struggle with. I ask this government to hand back some of their power to a woman who can do a better job representing the majority than a group of people who use their power for their own ambitions. ",
