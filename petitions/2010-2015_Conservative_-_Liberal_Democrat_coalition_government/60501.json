        "action": "Amend Article 4 of The Video Recordings (Labelling) Regulations 2010 to remove requirement of ratings to be displayed on discs",
        "additional_details": "Article 4 of the The Video Recordings (Labelling) Regulations 2010 states that a BBFC certificate rating must be present on the face of every disc or tape in a release, which is a restriction that serves only to damage the UK entertainment industry.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate and agree with the requirement for a certificate rating to be displayed on outer cases and packaging, but the restriction on discs can severely limit UK distributors, leaving them unable to share materials with foreign licensors (such as Region B blu-ray masters with Australian distributors) thus resulting in our market often receiving inferior products and as such, encouraging consumers to import superior editions from overseas.\r\n\r\nIf this restriction was lifted, manufacturing costs would be greatly decreased, relationships with foreign companies would increase and as there would be less insentive for consumers to import, profits would increase.\r\nThere is no downside to amending this out-dated segment of the legislation.",
