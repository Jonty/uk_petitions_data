        "additional_details": "Across the UK many housing estates contain numerous leasehold properties. Including my own, there are many estates where the Lease is getting to a critical stage, where the term has around 60 years left to run. Sounds great, but companies who own the lease are charging tens of thousands of pounds to renew the lease back up to 99 years, worse still, banks will not grant mortgages for properties with less than 60 years of a lease left. So for the many home owners out there who have a leasehold property, we are being backed into a corner and the situation is becoming worse, as the price of renewing leases goes up. The government needs to address this issue as thousands of people face being priced out of a renewal and potentially paying a mortgage for a lifetime, only to lose there properties at the end of the term. Please sign this petition to help the fight against the lease owners.",
