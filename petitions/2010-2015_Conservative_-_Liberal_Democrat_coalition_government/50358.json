One of the finest groups of musicians to come from the UK in the last 50 years.\r\n\r\nDespite the sad death of Syd and Rick I want the government to seek an agreement between the three surviving members that they will play one last UK tour together as Pink Floyd. It may require the diplomatic skills of the Foreign Office and the organisational skills of Lord Seb Coe but all thought and energy should be ploughed in to this task.",
