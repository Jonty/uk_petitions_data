        "additional_details": "Consideration should be given into the possibility of sending some categories of prisoners (like short-term prisoners, those nearing the end of their sentence) to work in a form of \u2018chain gang\u2019- like in areas of their usual (or desired) line of work or as labourers, cleaners, doing \u2018undesirable jobs\u2019 currently done by foreigners on work permits and working in places that needed development like a \u2018castaway\u2019 island. The introduction of chain gang schemes for prisoners could deter crimes, protect the public/society, as well as solving the problems of overcrowding in prisons, rehabilitating prisoners and paying for some of the massive costs incurred in keeping prisoners in custody, The closed extra prison places (created as a result of chain gang prisoners living in barrack style campus) can then be used to house illegal immigrants and persistent offenders.",
