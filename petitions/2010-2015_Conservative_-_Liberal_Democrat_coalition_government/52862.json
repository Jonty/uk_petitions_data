In the meantime these thieving  scumbags get to make a mockery of our judicial system, our Police and our law abiding citizens who save hard and pay legally for their two wheels.\r\n\r\nTherefore I ask the Attorney General to adopt a zero tolerance to this ever increasing crime and allow our Police to do whatever is necessary to remove these dangerous criminals from our streets.
