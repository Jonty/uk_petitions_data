        "additional_details": "Morton is a village that has the main A15 running through it.  Speed of traffic regularly exceeds 40mph. Witness accounts motorists exceed 50mph. Children are expected to cross this road to attend school which means crossing this very busy crossroad junction. It is an accident waiting to happen!  SKDC would not employ a lollipop lady as under Heath and Safety it was deemed too dangerous, but our children are still expected to cross this road to attend school and to catch buses. A few ideas, speed cameras like baston/langtoft nearby? Ideally traffic lights and a crossing for the safety of the many school children in this village!    ",
