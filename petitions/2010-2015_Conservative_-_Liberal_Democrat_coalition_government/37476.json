        "additional_details": "Please sign up and help us one step further to getting the bridle paths along the main Leam lane road fixed! Many people know how reckless and careless drivers can be so for us to have to travel along a 40mph road is ridiculous. One of our riders and horses has already been hit which involved a hit and run. It's getting beyond ridiculous and one day the damage that will be done is going to beyond repair. We wear hi-viz but the drivers do not seem to acknowledge us in any situation, with many young horses about it is very dangerous for the public aswell as us. We cannot get anywhere without the tracks except for using the road. Please sign up to our petition it would be greatly appreciated, thankyou.",
