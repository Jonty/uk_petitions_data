There are many people in the UK that would like to go a bit further and would like to participate in small volunteering global assignments but are unable to as employers won't allow them the time off.\r\n\r\nI think the Goverment needs to work with top employers in supporting and promoting time off for staff members who wish to undertake a short voluntary international development opportunity.",
