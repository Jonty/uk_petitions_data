        "additional_details": "On the 24th July 2014, the Government opted-out of all 135 provisions of the Justice & Home Affairs Legislation.  Under the terms of the Lisbon Treaty, any parts that were required to be kept obligated that the UK opt back in by 1st December 2014.  On the 7th May, Theresa May stated in Parliament that the UK was not subject to ANY of the provisions.  The proposed opt-ins include the European Arrest Warrant which has caused misery to many UK citizens and in any case, is already covered by existing legislation.  To opt back in to any of the provisions is an extension of EU powers and therefore is sufficient grounds to trigger a referendum on EU membership",
