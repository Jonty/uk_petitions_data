        "additional_details": "this petition is to ask the Government to overhaul the benefits system so that those in need of state-funded support receive it in the form of:\r\n\r\nfood vouchers (not eligible to be spent on cigarettes or alcohol),\r\nvouchers for paying utility bills,\r\nvouchers for children's clothes, etc\r\n\r\nA voucher system will ensure that any person or family in need will be guaranteed to receive food, warmth and clothing (at the very least).  The benefits system should not provide for luxuries such as a flat-screen television.  This approach would discourage the 'entitlement' generation and hopefully provide for those most at need while reinforcing the somewhat outdated view that luxuries need to be paid for by earning money.\r\n",
