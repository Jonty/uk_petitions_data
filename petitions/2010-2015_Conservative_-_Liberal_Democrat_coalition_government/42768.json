        "additional_details": "We call on our Government to acknowledge publicly that British policy and actions in Palestine from 1917 to 1948 led to catastrophe for the Palestinian people.\r\nAs Britain prepared to leave Palestine in 1948, its army stood by while Zionist forces terrorised hundreds of thousands of Palestinians into fleeing their homeland. In that way Palestine was transformed into Israel.\r\nMore than half of all Palestinians are still refugees today, most in dire straits. Israel denies them their right of return to their ancestral homes in what had been Palestine, and from the day of their flight has prevented them by force from returning.\r\nAs author of the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which was the origin of the catastrophe, and as the responsible power at the time of the crime, Britain has an obligation to make amends. It should acknowledge its share of responsibility for the creation of the refugee crisis, and recognize and promote the right of the refugees to return home.\r\n",
