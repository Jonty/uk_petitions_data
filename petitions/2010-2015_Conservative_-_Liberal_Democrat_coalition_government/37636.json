        "additional_details": "The government should ban the circumcision of children for non-medical purposes.\r\n\r\nChildren should be given the choice when they are of sufficient age as to what happens to their own body. Circumcision does not carry recognised health benefits and has in fact been shown to be potentially harmful.\r\n\r\nFemale circumcision has been banned, and so too should male circumcision. It is not fair on the child who has the right to the sanctity of his own body, which should exceed the right of the parents to exercise religious beliefs.\r\n\r\nFurther information can be found here: http://www.circumcision.org/",
