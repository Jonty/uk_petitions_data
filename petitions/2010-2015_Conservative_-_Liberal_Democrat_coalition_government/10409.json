Courts should have power to fine parents and order them to pay compensation for the criminal behaviour of their offspring. If they don't have money to pay, their benefits should be reduced accordingly until the fine is paid off.\r\n\r\nThe right to be a parent brings a responsibility. The children of today are the parents of tomorrow, and we need to break the generational cycle of declining responsibility and encourage good parenting by making parents see that there will be real consequences for them if they allow their children to run out of control and destroy our society.",
