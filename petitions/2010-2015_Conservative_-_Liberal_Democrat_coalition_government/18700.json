        "action": "How should veterinary nurses be regulated in the future?",
        "additional_details": "The title veterinary nurse is not protected, despite all veterinary nurses listed with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) having undertaken at least two years of training in order to safeguard animal health and welfare. Only those who are on the non-statutory RCVS Register have formally committed to keeping their skills and knowledge up to date by way of continuing professional development, follow a code of conduct and agree to be accountable for their professional practice. Meanwhile, there are individuals who call themselves veterinary nurses who have no formal veterinary nurse education and training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned therefore call on Government to support the work of the RCVS Veterinary Nurses Council, the British Veterinary Nursing Association and the British Veterinary Association to introduce a statutory regime for the regulation of veterinary nurses that will serve the public interest, and better protect animal health and welfare.",
