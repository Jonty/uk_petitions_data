        "additional_details": "A panel chaired by Claire Perry MP has stated a wish to censor the internet in order to 'protect the children'. She states it is difficult to prevent children from seeing adult material online, and this is just untrue, you can download free content blocking software in just a few minutes. It also shows a large amount of ignorance into how the internet actually works, a website only has to change it's protocol to https, and then any ISP/government crawler will be unable to see it.\r\nAn opt-out scheme will be much more beneficial, with parents requesting that adult material be blocked, since this won't result in adult websites rebelling to keep their revenues high.\r\nKeep the internet free.",
