        "additional_details": "it will benefit the uk economy to rethink the laws surrounding crb checks .there are many unemployed that wants to work but are being stopped from doing so because of crb checks.i understand the importance of crb checks to check against sexual / violence crimes & i completely agree to such checks.i believe that if crb checks was limited to sexual / violence crimes. then this would help thousands get off the unemployed scrap heap to which has been caused by the introduction of crb checks .i would therefore ask the government to look into this matter because crb checks are doing more harm than good. at the end of the day. anyone convicted of a criminal offence has been punished by the courts already & paid their debt to society. therefore surely such offenders must be given oppertunities to leave their past behind them & encouraged to go forward in life. offenders can & do change their ways but then find themselves knocked back down again when constabtly being declined job positions.
