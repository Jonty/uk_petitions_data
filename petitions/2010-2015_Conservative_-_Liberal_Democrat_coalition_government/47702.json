        "additional_details": "There is a high prevalence of emergent multi-drug resistant (MDR) Tuberculosis in Romania/Bulgaria and opening borders without controls from January 2014 poses a very significant health risk to the existing UK population. Borders should not be opened in 2014 unless TB screening is introduced for those coming from these high  incidence areas. Realistically, this cannot be implemented within a nine month time-frame. We ask for an urgent revision of the deadline on Public Health grounds.",
