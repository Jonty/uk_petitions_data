In order to facilitate a fair and thorough investigation into such matters an independent politicians complaints commission should be implemented. This commission should act as an internal affairs department and act in a similar way to the Independent Police Complaints Commission and should be empowered to submit cases directley to the Crown Prosecution Service.  The commission should not be too familiar with Members of Parliament nor should they employ someone with a conflict of interest.",
