        "additional_details": "Syncronised the gold cup winner died in the 2012 National along with another lovely horse. He threw his rider before the start and sped off on his own. My opinion is that this horse didn't want to run. He was checked over and given the all clear. The owner was hoping for the triple crown. He died at Beeches Brook. I am still shedding a tear for this animal he had a profound effect on me.\r\nThe fences are too high and difficult. Many horses don't make it and have to be destroyed.\r\nI propose that this race is barbaric, it should be radically reformed. If we must have fences then they should be radically lowered. Preferably there should be no fences at all. Also I propose that owners of racehorses should be responsible for an injured horses aftercare and not allowed to let them go for horsemeat.",
