        "additional_details": "The government's proposal is to cap total household benefits to max \u00a3500 per week.   This is the equivalent of earing \u00a335,000 pa before deduction of tax and National Insurance.\r\n\r\nMany working people would love to earn this amount. In my workplace nobody earns this much despite working 37 hours per week.\r\n\r\nYet people, even the Bishops in the House of Lords, are objecting.\r\n\r\nI think this amount is more than a generous handout from the state.\r\n\r\nSupport the cap and sign this petition.",
