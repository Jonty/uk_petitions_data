        "additional_details": "Recently I have seen a lot of people calling for a televised debate between David Cameron and Alex Salmond on the upcoming independence referendum. However, I feel that this would not be a fair and balanced debate as Mr Salmond's recent efforts have all been geared towards the details of an independent Scotland whilst on the other hand, keeping Britain together has not been Mr Cameron's main concern.\r\nI believe that Alistair Darling, director and chairman of the 'Better Together' campaign would be able to provide a much fairer and more informed argument for keeping Britain together and this would produce a much more balanced and helpful presentation of facts from both sides overall to help the people of Scotland make a well thought out choice on this big decision ahead of us.
