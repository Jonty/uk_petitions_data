In numerous cases this has been the result of the EU Court of Human Rights.\r\n   I strongly suggest that we decide to exit the Court thus transferring judicial powers to a wholly elected British Justice Body whose jurisdiction may not be undermined by any foreign department. After all, why should a European organisation have any say in British affairs?\r\n      In doing so confidence would be restored to all British people that the power is in the hands of fellow countrymen and that rulings directly affecting them would be made in British interests.",
