        "additional_details": "This is a petition to stop the contents of Antony Lords grave being taken away. The local grass cutter would like Antony's ornaments and fence to be taken down leaving just a headstone so it is easier for them to cut the grass. This has upset his family and friends as this is a place we have created over the last 7 years for us to go and remember Antony and spend some time with him. Please help us stop this from happening!!!",
