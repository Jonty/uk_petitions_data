        "additional_details": "World Environment day is a day that stimulates awareness for the environment. Not many people know of environment day which takes place on the fifth of June. This Petition proposes that the day should become a national holiday and bank holiday in order to educate and increase awareness for the environment.\r\n\r\nPeople take the environment for granted and a vast amount of people are uneducated on what underlying concequences their actions have on the world around them. Therefore, a day like this being made a national holiday will have many benefits, e.g. raising awareness and educating the public on the environment and looking after our future planet.",
