        "additional_details": "I believe that part of the revenue from business rates should be controlled by local businesses to be spent as decided by them. I believe that the present and proposed system of business rates disenfranchises businesses.\r\nThe present arrangement regarding business rate spending is nothing more than taxation without representation and is wrong in a democracy.\r\nThere are at present about 120 Business Improvement Districts in the United Kingdom raising a levy that is then spent for the good of their business community and that in turn benefits the general community.\r\nBy matching the BID funds out of business rates much more could be done by the BIDs to improve local towns both as shopping areas and communities. It would have the added benefit of businesses being seen as a partner in the community.\r\nWhere BIDs do not currently exist, a system could be set up for the local chambers of commerce to fulfil this function.\r\n\r\n",
