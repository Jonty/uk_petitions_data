        "additional_details": "The purpose of the petition is raise the debate on WHAT should be distribute by the government in order to support the populous. The government currently spends a huge amount of money on welfare benefits, in most cases distributed in a monetary form.\r\n\r\nThis has and does inevitability lead to a culture where the main reason to get a job i.e. earning money to support a household and afford luxuries, is inevitability marginalized. Based on this argument would another option of support be better served?\r\n\r\nPossible Option MAY include\r\n\r\nContinue Distributing Benefits as currently is.\r\n\r\nMove to a Rationing Allowances i.e.\r\nThis could come in any number of forms for example \"Ration cards\" where only some good and services are purchasable i.e. the essential for living, food, water, fuel etc.\r\n\r\nGovernment distributed goods\r\nMoved to Government distribution system, very restictives, no personal choice",
