        "additional_details": "Children are signing up to Facebook at the small age of 11 years old. This is increasing the rate of online bullying and trolling. There is a increase of children with psychological problems due to bullying. With them being able to create accounts so young this is giving other the opportunity to bully freely. There should be a law in place which means for them to create a social media account they need to provide proof of their ages. I have witnessed girls as young as 12 using foul language and beating each other's self esteem down verbally. This has to stop before more young children/teens hurt themselves or worse!",
