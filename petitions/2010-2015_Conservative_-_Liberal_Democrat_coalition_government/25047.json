        "additional_details": "Minister of Olympics (& others) should espouse the idea that all categories of Olympic sports should be completed on equal basis. This will ensure fair competition amongst all competitors despite of disability or lack of disability. Paralympics should be sports with competitors competing on equal terms, with equal disadvantage/handicaps & adaptations. Therefore in a wheelchair race, there should be categories that use the arms & another category using legs as means of prolusion of similarly adapted wheelchairs. Likewise in swimming, there should be different categories of those using arms, legs or one limb to propel themselves in water. In Paralympic basketball, tennis, Ping-Pong, volleyball, netball, hockey all competitors should use the same method of prolusion (like using wheelchair, sitting down on the ground, etc) even if a competitor is able bodied. Bind football, hockey should be open to all competitors (blind or sighted) provided they are all blind folded.",
