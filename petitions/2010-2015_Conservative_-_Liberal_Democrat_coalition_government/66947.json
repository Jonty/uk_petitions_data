I want to ask the Govt to make a law that\r\nevery house must be allowed to have a fire door oppening in the backyard of the house having a small balcony to stand out in case of any happening any such event.\r\nbecause if fire broke out downstaire how come you can go out from the downstair door.\r\ni belive it will save lives and will bring a lots of income and business for UK.\r\ni would like people to participate because it might be some one from us or from our coming generation to whome we save today....
