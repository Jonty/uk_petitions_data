        "additional_details": "The George Medal is issued to \"civilians for acts of great bravery.\" It is intended for those who display acts of selflessness other than in action with an enemy.\r\n\r\nThe George Cross is issued to \"civilians for acts of the highest gallantry.\"\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday 22nd May 2013, two armed men killed a serving soldier in Woolwich in broad daylight. As crowds gathered to witness the sickening display that followed, schools in the area were due to finish for the day. Ingrid Loyau-Kennett stepped from the crowds to engage one of the assailants in conversation to try and de-escalate the dangerous situation then attempted to negotiate the surrender of his weapons so that he may not harm nearby children.\r\n\r\nThis selfless act should not go without honourable recognition.\r\n\r\nI thereby propose that Ingrid Loyau-Kennett is nominated for award of at least the George Medal, with preference for her to be issued the George Cross.",
