Why didn't professionals ask for proof of the medication the child was supposed to be taking for the eating disorder?\r\n\r\nWhy did teachers not highlight a child losing weight and yet not bringing in adequate food to eat, witness him stealing food and witness him eating from bins?\r\n\r\nWhy were so many concerns ignored and not acted upon?\r\n\r\n",
