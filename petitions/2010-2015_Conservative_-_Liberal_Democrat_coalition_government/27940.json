        "additional_details": "Under this proposal anyone who is long term unemployed and claiming job seekers allowance for more than 2 years should be given an unconditional job and made to work for their benefits.\r\n\r\nThe level of benefits received should be performance based and designed to motivate the individuals involved to work rather than just turn up, do nothing and get their name ticked off the register.\r\n\r\nExamples could include:\r\nLitter Picking - Fill 3 bags a day to get your full benefits, anything less and you receive half pay.\r\n\r\nManufacture - The government could produce cheap \"I love London/...\" tshirts or other tourist souvenirs using cheap benefit labor rather than importing from china thus simultaneously boosting the UK economy. Again failing to meet a manufacturing target results in benefit cuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
