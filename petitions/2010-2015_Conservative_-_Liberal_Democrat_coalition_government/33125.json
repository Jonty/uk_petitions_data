        "additional_details": "Our dog Cairo was taken by dog handlers today (20 April 2012) as he was branded as a type of 'pit bull'. We raised cairo since he was 2 weeks old and his features never showed that of a pit bull. As you all will know, Cairo is a loving family dog, he has never caused any harm to any one and loves the company of humans and other dogs! We fear the worst that he may be put down if the court believe he is 'dangerous'. We should be grateful if you could take some time to sign this petition in agreement that he is not dangerous. Many thanks.",
