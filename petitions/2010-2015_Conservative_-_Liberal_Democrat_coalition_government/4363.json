This is highlighted in recent Operations in Libya, we are sending more vulnerable helicopters to do a job that the Harrier is ideal for. It is also a complete waste to think of all the tax payers money that has been ploughed into the Harrier GR9 and Nimrod projects, its just silly to throw them away!",
