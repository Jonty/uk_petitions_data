Evidence presented to the UN by Nancy Faulkner Ph.D simply states that \u201cParental Child Abduction is Child Abuse\u201d, \"Parental Alienation\" is viewed in the same strong terms by the UN as a form of Child Abuse - UK Law must recognise Parental Child Abduction & Alienation does not necessarily require a Child to be removed from the UK, or even a specific legal jurisdiction within the UK.\r\n\r\nThe UK signed the Convention on the Rights of a Child in 1992.\r\n\r\nUK Justice & Courts do not presently support the \"Rights of the Child\" to sustain a relationship with both Parents, & it is proposed the UK follow Denmark's presumption for Shared Residence when Parents separate in the interests of Child rights.",
