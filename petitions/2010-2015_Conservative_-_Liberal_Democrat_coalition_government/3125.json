Those clients who wish to look at porn can ask to have this filter lifted and can pay for the privilege, just as they would pay extra to have the satellite porn channels on their TV.\r\n\r\nOne major ISP is already offering a filtering service but, it has to be requested. However, this proves that it is technically possible to do this. Children need to be proected from the damaging effects of hard core porn.",
