        "additional_details": "Since Tony Blairs disastrous open door immigration policy, the habitat one of Britains most beloved indigenous species the Cockney has increasingly fallen into migrant hands which has resulted for the first time in English History with Londoners being officially classed as a minority in their own city.  As politicians wilfully refuse to stem the relentless tide of migration it's time to recognise that the Cockney is an endangered species, pushed further and further from their home, the destruction of their habitat should serve as a warning to the rest of the UK. Geordies, Scousers even Glaswegians should all be concerned by the plight of the cockney, all should be done now to preserve what is left of a once proud and abundant race before they become extinct. Politicians have failed the Cockney, before they fail you then sign this petition",
