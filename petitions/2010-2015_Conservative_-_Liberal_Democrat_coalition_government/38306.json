        "additional_details": "The present formulation for permitted development rules makes no reference to the size of the house. In small houses it allows developments which are over-bearing on neighbours both in an absolute sense - being overlooked and intruded upon by the extension once completed and during  development when debris and materials and noise and scaffolding and impact on shared facilities interfere considerably with the neighbours' ongoing living arrangements. The rules for permitted development should be altered for houses below a certain size attached to other houses to restrict the total additional floorspace created through permitted development to no more than 30% of the groundfloor area of the original building. Put the  impact on neighbours back into the equation.",
