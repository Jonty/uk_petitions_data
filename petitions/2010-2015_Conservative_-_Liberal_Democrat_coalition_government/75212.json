        "additional_details": "I believe every effort should be made to prevent USA influencing the UKRAINE or its capital city. I guess they have been up to their usual tricks of creating a power vacuum in order to incite CHAOS into the region before stabilizing it with its own chosen officials.\r\n\r\nThey have consistenly made very bad decision for the last decade or so. You just have to look at Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Cambodia, Vietnam to name but a few.\r\n\r\nThe corruption in the White House is becoming quite transparent as they become more desparate. The bankers and Lobbyists with Agendas and legal bribary are more dangerous than the so called terrorists in my opinion.\r\n\r\nI am very CONCERNED that the U.S will drag our country into making very bad decisions. Your WAR ON TERROR should start with SAYING NO TO THE U.S. As far as I can see, the only country to stand up to America is RUSSIA. ",
