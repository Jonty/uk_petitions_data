LOCOG has decided that the Olympic Flame should visit Henley and Bisham Abbey, but bypass Marlow, the home of Steve Redgrave, Britain's greatest ever Olympian. It would be a wonderful sight for everyone in Britain if the Flame were to pass the statue of Steve Redgrave in Higginson Park on its way to Maidenhead.",
