        "additional_details": "Firstly, the British national anthem should be changed to \"Rule Britannia\" or \"Land of Hope and Glory\" - as lovely as \"God Save the Queen\" is, in this day and age, the monarchy is not as prominent in our society as it used to be, and no longer represents British culture.\r\n\r\nAlso, England should adopt \"Jerusalem\" as her national anthem to represent the English at certain events - Scotland, Wales and Ireland already have separate anthems. Official acknowledgement of this would help the English to find an identity of their own in this new world.",
