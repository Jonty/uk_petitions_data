        "additional_details": "Through improved education and awareness we are successfully preventing many diseases of the mouth. However as we are moving forwards there are certain groups we are leaving behind\r\n\r\nThere are certain barriers to good oral health some people face such as people with reduced motor function or restricted manual dexterity. Thorough brushing is the main way in preventing periodontal diseases however people with such restrictions are not physically able to clean their teeth as thoroughly as those without such restrictions.\r\n\r\nWith the advances in technology we\u2019ve seen and particularly the introduction of electric toothbrushes this barrier can be removed\r\n\r\nThe problem however is many of the people with such disabilities do not have the finances to invest in such an invaluable tool. I am therefore looking to launch  \u201cBrush Better\u201d an incentive to provide under privileged people in the UK who have restricted motor function with electric toothbrushes",
