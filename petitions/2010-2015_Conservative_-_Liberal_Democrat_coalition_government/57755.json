        "additional_details": "please make the tethering of horses illegal.  The method of keeping horses this way  is against the RSPCA advice, often they do not have access to food, water or shelter/ Many injuries are the result of being tethered. Injuries to legs are common place, death by hanging or choking when chain becomes entangled  often happens.  Many are only checked every few days so injuries are not seen and often too late for treatment.  No animal should be kept in this way, they are free roaming animals and tethering is against their natural instinct.  If people want to own a horse they should have a field or livery and keep the animal in a natural environment. ",
