        "additional_details": "Better support provisions are needed to protect UK sex workers. It has been widely voiced that criminalising clients forces the sex trade underground, stigmatises the women and ultimately places them at risk. There are currently a substantial amount of women being arrested and charged. With Police being more approachable it would enable sex workers to express any concerns for safety (i.e trafficking). Decriminalising sex working would allow respect for dignity and human rights; increase access to justice, increase police understanding, promote safer working, challenges oppression and discrimination and enables a stronger system of approaching trafficking (Open University Foundations; New York). Having a zero tolerance from police forces makes the women unable to seek help and support for fear of prosecution. If standardised policing guidelines/policy were placed into force it would keep the women safe and they would be less exposed.",
