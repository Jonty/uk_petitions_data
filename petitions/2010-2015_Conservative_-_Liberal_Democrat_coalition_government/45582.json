By this I mean if made sure our education system was a high quality we could then charge international students high rates to study here for essentially the best qualifications. It could be seen that a student studying a degree here would be similar to a tourist living here for three years with little choice but to spend money locally.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the points I would like considered\r\n\r\n1. Why is there so little job creation in ways that create any economic value?\r\n2. What does the U.K. provide to the international community?\r\n3. Why are we only focused on reducing costs rather than increasing our worth?\r\n\r\na heavily cut version due to word limit Im insulted that 200 words is too much.",
