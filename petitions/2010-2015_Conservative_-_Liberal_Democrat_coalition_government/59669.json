        "additional_details": "Manorial rights are an important issue across England & Wales. They are outdated laws that give lords of the manor rights to over 100,000 properties in England and Wales.\r\n\r\nThey allow wealthy landowners to make claims over farms, commercial, local authority-owned and residential property they no longer own. These rights include hunting, shooting and fishing rights and the right to extract minerals underground.\r\n\r\nThese laws date back to the time of William the Conqueror. They are relics of the past and have no place in a twenty-first century democracy \u2013 Scotland\u2019s parliament abolished them in 2000. We want the national parliament in Westminster to do the same. Protected interests of the landed gentry have NO place in today\u2019s socially and culturally diverse Britain. We must get rid of these outdated rights.\r\n\r\nWe need your vote now to get this issue debated in parliament.\r\n\r\nPlease sign our e-petition now to end manorial rights.\r\n",
