Regardless of which species,whether domesticated animals and/or livestock,\r\nWe would like local authorities to approve such establishments for licensing on the grounds of whether or not the organisation applying can meet the needs of said animals.\r\nAny sanctuary, rescue or re-homing centre should be subject to at least one annual inspection, and have to provide detailed records for any animal they take in, providing basic vaccinations, neutering, worm and flea treatments, micro-chipping and any other veterinary assistance their animals may need.\r\nPersons employed by said organisations, should have basic animal care training and/or qualifications. Such establishments should also be held accountable for breaches of the Animal Welfare Act 2006.",
