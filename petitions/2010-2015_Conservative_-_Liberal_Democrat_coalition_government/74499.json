        "additional_details": "Most people agree that Council Tax is not fair to all households, and there have been many attempts to change the way it is charged. This proposal is that all houses stay on the current band, but after a house has been sold then the council tax should be levied as 0.05% of the sales value. The benefits of this is that there is no costly and onerous revaluation exercise, someone buying an \u00a380,000 house/flat will pay less than half of the current band A charge, someone paying \u00a3300,000 for house will pay \u00a31,500 per year, and someone who has just paid \u00a31 million for a house will pay \u00a35,000 per year.\r\nSomeone who has lived in their house for 40 years and that house is now worth over \u00a31 million will not pay any more than they do today. The new council Tax would only kick in after a property is sold and as a result of the sale the information is held by the land registry. Anyone buying a house knows exactly how much they will pay.\r\n",
