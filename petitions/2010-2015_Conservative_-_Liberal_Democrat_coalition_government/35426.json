        "additional_details": "At the primary school my children attend, almost every child has a Facebook profile. These children are aged 7 to 11 and many of the profiles that I have seen have no restriction on access. I want parliament to discuss what measures can be taken to have accounts verified by credit-card. That way, only an adult could create an account for the child.\r\n\r\nI am calling for a law to enshrine this and to include fines and/or community service or, as a last resort, imprisonment for adults that consent to a child under 13 having a Facebook (or any other social network)  profile.\r\n\r\nI would like to see a select comittee set up to investigate this and recommend the necessary changes to the law to protect children from the risks of social networking and what punishments should apply to parents who flout the new restrictions.",
