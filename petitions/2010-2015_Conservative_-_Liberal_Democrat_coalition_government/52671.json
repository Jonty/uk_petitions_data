        "additional_details": "Lyrics from the recently released song \u201cJodeci Freestyle\u201d from hip hop artists Drake and J.Cole have many in the autism community up in arms. The song, which was released last month and is now getting airplay, contains the following lyric by J. Cole: \u201cI\u2019m artistic, you n----s is autistic, retarded.\"\r\n\r\nThese lyrics are offensive and perpetuate negative stereotypes. There are many inspiring individuals with autism and other disabilities who have achieved great success across a variety of artforms, including music. We encourage J. Cole to recognize their talents and learn from the positive example they have set for all of us.\r\n",
