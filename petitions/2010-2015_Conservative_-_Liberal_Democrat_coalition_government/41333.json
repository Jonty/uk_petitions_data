I have sat each night for almost a 2 weeks watching my pets tremble with fear.\r\n\r\nI know there is medication out there that they can have to ease this stress but I cant/wont keep them on this medication for almost 2 weeks when this should be a ONE night event.\r\n\r\nThis petition is not only for the myself and the Animals. This is for anyone out there with small children/babies that have been up for nights on end upset because they don\u2019t understand what the noise is and anyone with a fear of fireworks for any reason what so ever.",
