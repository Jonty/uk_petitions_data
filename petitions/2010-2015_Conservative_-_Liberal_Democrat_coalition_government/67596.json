Encourage large retailers to showcase new and innovative 'Made in the UK' products in-store.\r\n4. Create or support a series of 'Meet the UK Innovators' trade events aimed at UK private and public sector buyers.\r\n5. Develop a Government-led steering group with public and private sector representation to help commercialise UK small business innovation.\r\n6. Create a permanent group within the Government to implement further small business-friendly strategies.",
