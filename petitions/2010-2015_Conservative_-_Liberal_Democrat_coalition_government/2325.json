        "additional_details": "There should be a blanket ban on any type of  surgery of this kind, male or female unless there is a serious medical condition that deems it necessary.\r\n\r\nMost of the time these proceedures are not necesary and deny the child of their basic human & equal rights.\r\n\r\nHow do human rights help you?\r\n\r\nHuman rights are based on core principles like dignity, fairness, equality, respect and autonomy. They are relevant to your day-to-day life and protect your freedom to control your own life, effectively take part in decisions made by public authorities which impact upon your rights and get fair and equal services from public authorities.\r\n\r\nThis type of surgery is invasive, permanent and totally out of control of the individual.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly contraversial as it is practiced in several major religions, and faiths. If an individuals rights are to be maintained, circumcision should be offered to the individuals at an appropriate age so they can make an informed decision.",
