        "additional_details": "We all know that places such as Brick Lane market generates lots of tourism and trade for East London.The street market has been ongoing for a long time and has been extremely popular.Unfortunately the licensing  process is very complicated and discourages people in gaining legal access to the selling sites.In the past the public could visit brick lane and see a lot of young, bright people using their initiative and skills to showcase raw, undiscovered talent.By providing reasonably priced on the day, on the spot licenses you are giving the young culture of today a chance to work alongside with the successful businesses, and for the businesses to thrive of the tourism marker attracts.What we are proposing here is not NOT the cancellation of the legit license but a on the day seller's permit that would let people come early, take their spot and start trading.That would make it easier for both of the sides to regulate the trading.\r\nWe appreciate your time and consideration.\r\n",
