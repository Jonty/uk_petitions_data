        "additional_details": "I think it is fair to say that we all know someone who has lost or had an animal/child suffer horrific injuries due to owners lacking ability to control their dogs on and off a lead. Especially dogs Bred for fighting and killing.\r\nI want to see Adults require handling training to keep dangerous dogs.\r\nA car is a killing machine in the wrong hands, without being trained to use it and earning a licence.\r\nWhy should it be any different with dangerous dogs, they are also killing machines (in the wrong hands). Young lads freely admit that they keep these dogs as a weapon, not a loved cherished pet.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to punish dogs or sensible owners; I want to stop inadequate people keeping these dogs, especially those using them as a weapon.\r\nThere would be no reason for all the savage attacks of loved and cherished pets or small children if dogs were treated and handled properly.\r\n\r\nPlease help change this law and save lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
