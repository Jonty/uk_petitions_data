We recognise that whilst the vast majority of immigrants have integrated, there is a very real and dangerous problem. We demand those refusing to integrate be told \"integrate now or leave\".\r\nWe demand a debate to introduce legislation to allow the removal of British Citizenship from any one previously granted it, and their deportation, should they be found to be involved in activities contrary to the wellbeing of society, including but not limited to: acts of violence, preaching hatred, acts of grooming children for sexual exploitation, burning the Union Flag. Furthermore we demand that the practice of giving British Passports to immigrants stops. Being replaced with \"Leave to remain indefinitely\". This is sufficient to allow honest, hardworking, decent immigrants to live their life in the UK. ",
