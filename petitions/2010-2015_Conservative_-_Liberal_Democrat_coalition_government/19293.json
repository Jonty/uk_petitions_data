        "additional_details": "Through the economic downfall of Britain due to the collapse of financial lending and growth I invite the general public who have suffered a downfall in income due to redundancy or loss of earnings to join the petition in the request of a government decision to rule banks to allow an extension to people's mortgages by way of a mortgage holiday. This in turn will allow to people to pay off debts and regain a standard of living so that household bills can be paid and food can be put on the table. I believe this will regain personal spending power which will kick start the economic growth and also will allow the government relief in paying housing benefit for those who are unable to pay. The Government can bring this into force by application from the public through their mortgage lenders and in a period of time the 'economy' will get back on its feet. This should then create Britain getting back to work.",
