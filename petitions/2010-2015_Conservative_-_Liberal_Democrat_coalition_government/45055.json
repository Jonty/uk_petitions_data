        "additional_details": "The series of catastrophic floods in the Somerset Levels (and elsewhere in the country) is entirely avoidable. It stems, largely, from the Environment Agency's refusal to dredge the river system for the past 25 years. We want to see the rivers in the Somerset Levels and in other flooding hotspots to be properly dredged.\r\nCurrently large sums of money are being wasted tryoing to pump water off the fields, many of which have been flooded for over 10 months. Please spend this money on preventative measures, ie dredging.",
