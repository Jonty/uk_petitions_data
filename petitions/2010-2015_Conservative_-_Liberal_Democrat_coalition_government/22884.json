        "additional_details": "We believe that the \"Net Book Agreement\" should be reinstated so that supermarkets, on-line book sellers and independent bookshops have equal selling prices on new books and an even playing field.  Independent bookshops cannot sustain a price cutting model like the giant corporations. The net book agreement is vital to secure a future where small independent bookshops can flourish. Without this only large corporations will survive making for a poorer cultural life in this country.  You may not be aware but small businesses cannot buy books for the price the large corporations are selling them for, does this seem fair practice?  This practice has gone on for long enough, please give a thought for those who are having their livelihoods taken away from them.  ",
