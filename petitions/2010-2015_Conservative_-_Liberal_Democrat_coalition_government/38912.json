Some, currently classed as recreational, drugs would be beneficial to a lot of people suffering with pain, chronic illnesses and mental problems.\r\n\r\nThe public should be educated and drugs should be regulated.\r\n\r\nWe petition the government to decriminalise and educate as the HIV epidemic will never come under control otherwise.",
