They help cover other cosmetic surgery for insecure people so why cant they help towards this treatment? This is the only treatment which is effective and works immediately but costs a huge price for someone's happiness. Hirsuitism is a unlucky diagnosis for people who get excess hair growth for no reason and is very common. From mild cases to really obscene cases of hair.",
