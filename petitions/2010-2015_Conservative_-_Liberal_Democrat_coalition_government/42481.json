        "additional_details": "Government minister Nick Boles has stated that he wants  more than 1500 square miles of open countryside developed to meet Britain's housing needs.\r\nWe believe that this will lead to a loss of farmland, recreational space and wildlife habitat and will result in developments that necessitate the use of cars, trains and buses for residents.\r\nWe believe that the Government should be encouraging the development of high-rise housing developments. They will be modelled on successful developments in cities such as Vancouver and Melbourne which are consistently ranked well in livability surveys.\r\nHigh-rise developments can shift commutes from the streets to the elevators, reducing local and global pollution.\r\nThey must not be confined to the large cities but will include larger towns such as Maidenhead in Berkshire.\r\nIn summary, housing developments must be designed to look upon Britain's beautiful countryside, not be built upon it.",
