The majority of small businesses find it far too expensive to pay inept staff. How can it be justified that someone with nothing to offer whatsoever gets paid the same as someone who has been doing a job for years. The whole set up is a farce and crippling the economy - scrap it now or reduce it to a reasonable rate. ( \u00a32.50 an hour should be the absolute maximum )",
