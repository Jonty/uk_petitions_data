An increase in consumer confidence, spending power.\r\n2. Loans and mortgages reduced.\r\n3.  Savings and Investment.\r\nWhilst banks have issued bonuses to themselves the taxpayer has seen no return in their pockets for the bailout or been issued with any shares.\r\nThe issue of cash or shares would boost taxpayers\u2019 confidence in the government and the banks.\r\n",
