        "additional_details": "Steven Gregory Cusack was stillborn on the 23/02/2013 after an induced labour of 41 hours at 42+1 weeks. I was told while I was on very strong painkillers that I would have to deliver Steven by natural childbirth. This crippled me emotionally and I screamed that I couldn't do it. I begged for a c section so I wouldn't have to go through that pain. It was only when they realised I couldn't give birth to him due to an obstructive labour that I had an emergency caesarean as soon as I woke up Steven was handed to me. It was such a relief knowing I didn't have to give birth to him and I now will petition for as long as needed for all women to have this option. It is so hard to find out your baby has died and to then be told you have to give birth to him/her is unbearable. I also wish for women being induced to be monitored constantly from start to finish. Please help me in making this possible. Thank you.",
