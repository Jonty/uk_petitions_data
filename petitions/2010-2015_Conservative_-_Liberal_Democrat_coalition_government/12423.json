Current building work on private homes is substantially \"black market\": unregulated, unchecked and often substandard.  This critical and enormous economy must be brought into the daylight.  To properly regulate and rebuild for a carbon neutral future the cost must be held to a minimum.  Lower costs to the consumer of building services will increase demand and pull apprentices into employment.",
