I worked overseas for 4 years as an 'Entry Clearance Officer' (Visa Officer) at two British Embassies on the sub-continent. I therefore know from first hand experience that the situation is far far worse than the government would have you believe. A massive & comprehensive review and overhaul of the immigration rules that allow people to enter the UK is needed URGENTLY. The measures taken by the government so far & those planned for the future, are simply not enough.",
