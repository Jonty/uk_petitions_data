        "additional_details": "I call upon the Government to raise the national drinking age from 18 to 21 years of age. I feel that too many children and young adults are under the influence of alcohol, which in my opinion, is affecting not only their health but their education.\r\nThere are also a series of laws that I feel that the Government should abolish:\r\n1. Abolish the law that people aged between 5-17 years can get legal permission for a parent/legal guardian to drink alcohol at home or at a friend's house.\r\n2. Abolish the law that a 16-17 year old can consume wine, beer or cider on licensed premises when ordered with a meal.\r\nI feel that these actions can provide a long term improvement in terms of our health, which will help improve our education and well being.\r\nI urge the Government to abolish a series of these Alcohol related laws to help safeguard our children's future.
