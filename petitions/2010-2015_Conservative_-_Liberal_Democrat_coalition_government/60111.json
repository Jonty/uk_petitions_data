        "action": "Abolish Sham Retail Price Discounts",
        "additional_details": "In about 1974 the Edward Heath Conservative Government abolished retail price maintenance to stop over pricing and protective high price agreements. A good idea but they got the legislation wrong.\r\nIn all the subsequent retail pricing legislation one fundamental flaw exists and that is the \u201c28 days at a higher price\u201d which allows the retailers to put a phoney high  price which they know they will never sell at and discount from that high price. End result is no one actually knows what the real value of any item is. Take a look at furniture retailers they milk this to the extreme.\r\nIt would take one small change in the legislation to correct this anomaly. Remove the higher price at 28 days and have a single level of retail pricing; this would be what the item sells for on general sale . A retail price must be maintained for 6 months. The point of this is to have real stock at a real price so any subsequent sale prices are genuine discounts which benefit the public.",
