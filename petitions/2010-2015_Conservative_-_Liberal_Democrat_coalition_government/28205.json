        "additional_details": "While single women and families with 2-7 children sit on benefits with free rents/council tax and recieve over \u00a31000 per month tax free. The working man who earns \u00a31000 per month has to pay tax and out of what is left has to pay rents and council tax too. This is wrong. Reduce the benefits and Higher tax credits to help all workers on low incomes which will gain overall higher tax income for the economy. (common sense)",
