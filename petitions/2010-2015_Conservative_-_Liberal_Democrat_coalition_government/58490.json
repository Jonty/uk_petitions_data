        "additional_details": "A new fund to help deprived people in the European Union has been created by the European Commission. The fund aims to support schemes in member states providing food to the most deprived people.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has a budget of \u20ac2.5 billion (about \u00a32 billion) for the fund over the period 2014\u20132020 and would provide 85% of total costs.\r\n\r\nBritish has since rejected EU funding for food banks, which would have brought in around \u00a322m, on the grounds that individual member states are best placed to take charge of such funding. It was also rejected last year; http://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/eu-sub-com-b/FoodSubsidiarity/FINALTSOFoodReport21212.pdf\r\n\r\nWe urgently seek for the government to address this specific rejection in parliament with a view to reviewing the decision at a time of national emergency, as the food bank crisis has been described by leading charities.\r\n\r\n",
