All are patently bogus and vindictive.\r\n\r\nWe demand the Home Office instruct the MPS, via the Mayor's Office if required, to retract all untrue statements made, or issued to the press, concerning this officer and to apologise publicly to PC Patrick and his family for the deliberate damage to their good name so caused.\r\n\r\nWe demand the MPS is instructed to apologise for their vengeful intimidation of PC Patrick and his young family and to apologise publicly for the immense stress to them which these outrageous actions have caused.\r\n\r\nWe demand the MPS be instructed to inform the public of the time and true cost of all activities pertaining to the PC Patrick case by the police and apologise to the public for their waste of scarce, tax-payer funded, resources.",
