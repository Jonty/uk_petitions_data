        "additional_details": "The diagnostic practise of allopathic medicine blames our health for symptoms of ill health and does not look for the natural causes.  It is impossible for our health to recover naturally from this practise.  In addition to this, its drugs in long-term use cause addiction and a more chronic problem, for it turns illnesses in which natural cause is not known into a long-term biological condition that depends upon the drugs to relieve it.  This school of medicine is the reason that the cost of the NHS and the welfare state is ever rising.  We need the NHS to look for natural causes, eg: ankylosing spondylitis (calcified RSI of the spine), breast cancer (the continuous habitual wearing of bras), etc.",
