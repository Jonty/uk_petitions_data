However, I also propose that prisoners should be made to work for their keep. The cost of running our expensive 5-star prisons need to be reduced, and can be by less pandering to prisoners and by the income generated by prison labour (such as manufacturing).\r\n\r\nOne oddity worth metioning is that you need to pay for parking to visit someone in hospital, but if you visit someone in prison the parking is free!",
