Also, to lower premiums for new learners, and young drivers.\r\n\r\nAt this moment in time, we are paying far too much for our insurance, in the bb area of england.\r\n\r\nThe BB area of england are being VICTIMIZED of high cost of insurance, and new learners and young drivers are being discriminated against, which is AGAINST THE LAW.\r\n\r\nWe are on a mission to get our local mps, local media and authorities on our side, to get it to the House of Commons to try to sort this.\r\n\r\nEven if you dont drive, please join, sign and share. We need as many people as possible to make an impact, and make our voices heard. ",
