Under the E-3 work visa, Australian's are free from external country competitions and are placed upon their own quota and the application process is much quicker. As a close ally of the Americans, and realising how hard it is to actually Immigrate to America. That FCO, and parliament begin to Lobby the American government for our inclusion in this visa processing.\r\n\r\nWe have suffered war on the Americas behalf, we have stuck by them many times we deserve something. This may be a small issue, but it has a bigger meaning, of formulating an idea of trust between the two nations and it's people's.\r\n\r\n To help relief the frustrations of thousands of Brits that are planning to move, or are planning it in the future.
