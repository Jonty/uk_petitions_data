        "additional_details": "Drugs are a growing problem throughout the country 2day,even the world. There has to come a point when we need to say STOP giving out needles to users by the box full, this only encourages iv drug users to continue using and abusing. Not all users clean up after themselves and they just leave needles anywhere eg. playgrounds , backlanes , back yards of empty properties , which is of course unsafe and who would be held responsible if a child hurts themselves by accident on a discarded needle ? would it be that of the needle exchange ?\r\nIf you agree please sign to stop users being given needles to fuel their addiction it should be 1 for 1 policy , this might help combat the rising number of discarded drug paraphenalia around our children",
