        "additional_details": "Paedophiles take away every human right of the child/children they abuse. If a person takes away another's human rights they should not have their own taken into account. The children they abuse have their lives ruined forever, yet these monsters get short pointless sentences or don't get a custodial sentence at all. How can this happen? And now a paedophile who abused a young girl has the right to keep photos of her in underwear on his phone because deleting them would breach his human rights. It is unbelievable and should not be happening. The law needs to change to take rights away from these people and give them harsher sentences. The poor children don't have a choice or a voice and we have to do it for them. ",
