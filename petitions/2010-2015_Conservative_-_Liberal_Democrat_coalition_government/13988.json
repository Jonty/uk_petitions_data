        "additional_details": "All Bats, in the UK, are protected under THE WILDLIFE & COUNTRYLIFE ACT of 1981 which, as a threatened species, is understandable, but there does`nt seem to be a solution to the following true situation :-  Bats have taken to nesting in the eaves of a church, their droppings, which are acidic, are ruining the church furniture. short of constant cleaning, the building will become a health risk & so unusable , A commonsense solution may be found, but there are no guidelines . It is propossed that the Government provide an amendment to this Act, to resolve such situations for all protected species (Bats in house lofts, for instance), so that lawfull means are readily available in the future . Your votes for this petition will be greatly appreciated",
