        "additional_details": "Recent revelations make it extremely clear that what was portrayed as fictitious in the production was, in fact, ACTUALLY what was happening.  Recent television interviews have also revealed that it was common knowledge the Chief Whips of political parties (with the complicit knowledge of the Party Leader) kept a 'Dirt Book' of incidents involving MPs so that the MP concerned could be blackmailed into compliance whenever it was necessary in the future.  This demonstrates the extreme level of corruption which exists in our party political system, so much so that enormous benefit would accrue to the country if MPs had to rescind their membership of political parties on election to the House of Commons - in fact it should be illegal for a sitting member of the House of commons to be a paid up member of ANY political party.  ALL OF THEM ARE SUBVERSIVE ORGANISATIONS AND HAVE NOW BEEN PROVEN TO BE SO.",
