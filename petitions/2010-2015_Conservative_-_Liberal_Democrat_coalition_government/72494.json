        "additional_details": "We believe that violence should be on the national curriculum and that all secondary schools should teach children about the consequences of violence to the victims, the victims families and the perpetrator. We believe that children should be taught how the criminal justice system works and how traumatic the process is for victims and families. We believe that children should also be taught about the types of convictions and job roles that are exempt from the Rehabilitation of offenders Act. We believe that this will reduce youth and gang violence. ",
