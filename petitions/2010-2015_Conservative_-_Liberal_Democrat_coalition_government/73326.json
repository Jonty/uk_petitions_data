It\u2019s time to show support and recognition for the work the Emergency Services do in the same manner that the Armed Forces currently do.\r\n\r\nI propose a recognition day celebrating the work of the Emergency Services. Such an event would include a Parade showcasing our Emergency Services; concluded by a speech of recognition from a Senior Member Of Government.",
