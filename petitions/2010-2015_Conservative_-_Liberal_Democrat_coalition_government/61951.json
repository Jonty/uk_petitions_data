My aim is to have a law put in place that landlord's/ estate agents, can not charge such high prices to have pets, in rented accommodation.\r\n\r\nI have two lovely cats, Part of the family, I am forced to rehome, them due to estate agents wanting rent in advance, per pet!\r\n\r\nThis is ridiculous, \u00a31400 to keep my two lovely cats. My hards are forced to rehome, them due to not being able to afford extortionate prices!\r\n\r\nthey wonder why there is a high increase of pets being abandoned, when some charity, don't really want to get out there and voice their opinion!\r\n\r\nIts Time to stand up and voice our opinions, because if we don't then more and more pets will end up homeless!
