The latter two options to be mandatorily provided with modern ventilation systems.\r\n\r\nAll three options to be agreed under contract with all staff. Management to be allowed to refuse to employ staff who do not agree with new policy.\r\n\r\nAs Public Houses are private businesses, the decision to allow smoking to be the sole prerogative of Breweries and/or Landlords.\r\n\r\nThe Smoking Ban is certainly one of the elements leading to the decline of the Pub as a British institution, sometimes the only social hub of small villages. This amendment would also give freedom of choice back to pub-goers (clientele) and Breweries / Landlords (private businesses) to decide their social lives for themselves. ",
