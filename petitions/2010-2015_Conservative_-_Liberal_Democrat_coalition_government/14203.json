        "additional_details": "A select few companies make money by offering 0844 numbers and all large companies use them, costing the public unnecessary expense.\r\nSky makes \u00a3250000 a year from its paid access numbers which do not fall part of the call packages fm phone companies. In USA 800 numbers are widespread. We have been forced to use 0844 numbers, which have replaced 0870 and 0845 since they became part of call packages. This petition is so that the government legislates for all companies and organisations to provide a 01/02/03/800 number for the public. The existence of websites like www.saynoto0870.com confirms that people dont want to pay premium prices to make calls. The 0844 numbers are not useful to any member of the public but a mere angle to increase revenue, especially for  GP surgeries. I ask the government to legislate for this Thanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
