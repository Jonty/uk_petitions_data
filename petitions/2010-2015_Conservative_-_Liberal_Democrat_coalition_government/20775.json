When I was younger, a medical negligence case was started on my behalf, but got nowhere. My winning compensation would have meant that I would not be receiving Income Support, Incapacity Benefit, and Housing Benefit, and would spend money on a house build, my own care (rather than Social Services) and many other things that would also help my local economy.\r\n\r\nConsidering all of the money spent on DLA, Disabled Facilities Grants, and other essentials for disabled adults, we call upon the government to give disabled people a lump sum of \u00a32m+ instead of benefits and future help from Social Services, both of which can leave you feeling belittled. In the long term, this would be cheaper for the tax payer, and would be a very good way of using quantitive easing.",
