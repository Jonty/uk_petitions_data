Removal implies this is less important \u2013 potentially costing life and limb, as well as damaging businesses and the economy.\r\n\r\nEmployers rely on the authoritative \u2018special legal\u2019 status and assurance of the ACoP to ensure they are legally compliant. Removal could cause confusion and uncertainty.\r\n\r\nIn a recent consultation, the majority of respondents wanted it retained and neither Lord Young nor Professor L\u00f6fstedt recommended withdrawal.\r\n\r\nReplacing the ACoP with non-approved guidance would NOT provide the same authority, assurance or convenience as a single reference. The Government should work with stakeholders to improve the ACoP and its high-level guidance.\r\n\r\nWe urge the Government to IMPROVE and RETAIN the \u2018Management of Health and Safety at Work Approved Code of Practice\u2019 for the benefit of all concerned.",
