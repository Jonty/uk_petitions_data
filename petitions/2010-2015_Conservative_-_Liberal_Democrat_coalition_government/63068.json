        "additional_details": "Since the Dunblane massacre in 1996, pistols have been completely banned in Britain. A new restriction was put in place by Tony Blair that any firearm with a barrel length under 30cm or an overall length of less than 60cm was banned as it is classes as a small firearm, the only exception to this legislation was if it was an antique weapon or if it was a muzzle-loading pistol.\r\n\r\nDespite this new law to tighten gun control, firearm related fatalities rose rather dramatically in the following years before returning to normal. If we ban them then only the criminals will have them.\r\n\r\nFirearms in the UK are licensed properly and with control so why can we not own a handgun when we are allowed to own other firearm with a license? As citizens we should also have the right to defend ourselves against criminals and criminal acts if your life or the lives of your family are in immediate danger.  By taking away handguns they are making us toothless lions who are vulnerable to crime.",
