There has only ever been 1 reported death from smoking cannabis, and countless from drinking,smoking and other drug use! Cannabis has now been found to be able to cure cancer, stimulate brain cells! Put an age limit on it if you must but make it legal for us to smoke! So what if you cant put tax on it! Let us grow it for ourselves like we grow our own vegetables!! I say the law ends now! Whos with me!!!",
