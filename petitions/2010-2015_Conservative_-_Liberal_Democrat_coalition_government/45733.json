A lot of us parent are using these spaces as its the closest way to get to the school and we are only there for ten minutes. However we are now being told we cannot park there and have to find somewhere else to go. But the only place to park is by a busy main road which would be unsafe and are alot of buses running at these times. we would like these space to be made  avaliable durning these times. ",
