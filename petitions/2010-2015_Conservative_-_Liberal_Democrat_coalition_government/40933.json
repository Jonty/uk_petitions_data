        "additional_details": "I propose that all electronic goods made or sold in the UK from 2013 should be 'A' rated for energy efficiency; 'A+++' for fridges, washing machines or dishwashers. In doing so, the government would be stepping in the right direction towards its 'greenest government ever' pledge as energy efficiency reduces energy demand and subsequent pollution. Moreover, Britain would become a world leader in this neglected area. Furthermore, with rising energy bills, many consumers would welcome the decision as swapping a single 'C' rated product for an 'A' rated one has \u00a329/yr savings on running costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, the government must protect consumers from price rises due to the alleged costs of producing efficient products and create a multi-billion pound fund for people who simply cannot afford to replace their 10 year old fridge, TV, oven et cetera.",
