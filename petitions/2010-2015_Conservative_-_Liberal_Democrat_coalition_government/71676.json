We all know Amazon charge their fees as a percentage of the product value, normally around 15% this seems fair.\r\nAs an Amazon Seller I sell small products for \u00a31 each or less; Amazon now charge a 40p flat rate on these products, in addition if a bulk order is supplied (say 10 products at \u00a31 each) this flat fee is multiplied pro rata rather than reverting to a percentage figure. Amazon make 40% on the sale. We think this is extortion and want to poll opinion to see:\r\nA) if sellers are aware of this new Amazon Policy\r\nB) if there enough of us to make them amend the Policy.\r\n\r\nPlease sign our petition and leave your email, so that we can update you.",
