How can someone be allowed to sit on facebook all day mocking people for going to work? He clams he has a disability, I see no real reason why this man can't get a job. he can quite easily operate a computer so why can't he quite easily stack shelves? All I want our government to do is look into why this man can't work? and if he can why are we paying him to do nothing?",
