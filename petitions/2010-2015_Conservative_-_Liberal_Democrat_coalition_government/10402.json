        "additional_details": "I would like a review of the Mortgage System in the UK.Given most Banks and Mortgage providers are asking for substantial deposits up to 20% for mortgage provision, it is now time to address the imbalance when the housing market retracts.\r\nThe Government should make sure whatever percentage you pay as a deposit you own that percentage of the house and when the value of the house goes down the loss is shared. This will stop banks selling houses far under the market value and deliver a much more reasonable unbiased mortgage system.",
