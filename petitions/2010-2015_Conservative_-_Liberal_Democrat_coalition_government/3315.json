        "additional_details": "Given the hard times that we are all experiencing at the moment it would be prudent for the government to try and help the public by addressing a major concern that affects the vast majority of the population.  The price of fuel!  It is ridiculous that we are not only taxed highly on the pence per litre but we then have to pay an annual tax to use the roads.  I think it would be in the \"moral\" interest of the current government and may even help to increase the popularity of politicians, as a whole, if they were seen to be helping out rather than just cutting services and increasing prices on everything.",
