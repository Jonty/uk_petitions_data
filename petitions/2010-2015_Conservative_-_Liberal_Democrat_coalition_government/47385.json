They can take action, but choose not to because of their out of touch and out of date laws.\r\n\r\nEvery other league, like in France and Germany, decisions can be made after the final whistle in hindsight. However, the FA have refused to take any action, ONCE AGAIN.\r\n\r\nI am only 17 years old but have seen the likes of Diaby, Eduardo and Ramsey, all of Arsenal, suffer almost career ending injuries, yet no more than 3 match bans have been given.\r\n\r\nLast week Mcmanaman most probably ended Haidara's season, if not more, yet there was no card and no ban.\r\n\r\nThings must change",
