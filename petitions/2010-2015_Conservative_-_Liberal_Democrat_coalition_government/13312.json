        "additional_details": "My proposal is that vehicle insurance should be done per car not per driver, This is common in many European countries (e.g Sweden) as well as America. This will allow children to learn to drive without parents having to pay a large premium for them to do so, allow for families to not worry about anyone with a valid license who has asked permission to take the car in regards to insurance (For example, Allowing a family friend to drive the car to and from an airport) and will help regulate the premiums that are being expected for inexperienced drivers.\r\n\r\nIf it is felt that this may put inexperienced drivers behind the wheel of larger cars then I suggest increasing the expectation of the Driving Test.\r\n  ",
