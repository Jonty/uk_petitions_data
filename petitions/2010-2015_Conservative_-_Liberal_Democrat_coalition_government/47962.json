Yearly health checks.\r\nAt the moment the law stands it is self regulating and needs to be updated we are all an ageing population,and need to be safe on the road, this is about prevention & common sense. This is not anti-OAP on the roads this is a highlighted area which needs to be addressed and the Law changed.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\nhttp://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/10126623.Grandmother_of_teen_crash_victim_calls_for_law_change/\r\n",
