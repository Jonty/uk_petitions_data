        "additional_details": "With the current riots, and the Belfast riots leaving police powerless to take action due to all legislation; it is time to enact emergency legislation to deal with rioters who statistically speaking are mostly in receipt of benefits. If we enact a law that all of those found to be illegally rioting will have their benefits removed from them for 6 months we will be without this level of trouble at a time when we do not need to foot the bill to look after these people. If they turn their back on society we should turn our back on them.",
