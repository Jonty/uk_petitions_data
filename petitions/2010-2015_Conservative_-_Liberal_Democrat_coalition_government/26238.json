        "additional_details": "Since the treaty of the Utrecht & the emergence of the former colony of Gibraltar to a fully democratic state,there has been a bellicose relationship with their neighbours,Spain.\r\nMost recently there has been incursions by Spanish trying enforce there unilateral declaration regarding Maritime Law & constant harassment of boarder traffic to & from Spain -including trying to charge people to cross the boarder. Since Britain's relationship with Gibraltar is steeped in a long history,trade & tourism, I feel it is incumbent on the Government to act seriously & protect the rights of Gibraltar by:\r\nInitiating dialogue with Spanish State through the European Parliament impressing that current situation is intolerable, childish & not becoming of behaviour an EU State. Bring pressure to bear on Spain to act swiftly to 'normalise' the flow of people and goods crossing the boarder. &, bring pressure to bear on the EU & Spain to protect access to the water's around Gibraltar.",
