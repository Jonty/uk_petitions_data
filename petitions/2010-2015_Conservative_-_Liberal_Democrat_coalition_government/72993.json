Asda (Walmart) has brought this to Britain and it is utter madness. All we saw were scenes of people fighting over products, violence and utterly disgraceful behaviour. We do not need this. We can have sales instore and online but this goes way beyond anything sensible. Let's cancel Black Friday and make shopping safer for everyone.  ",
