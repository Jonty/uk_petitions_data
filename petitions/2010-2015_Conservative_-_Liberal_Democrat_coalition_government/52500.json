        "additional_details": "We welcome the Government\u2019s efforts to tackle irresponsible dog owners and petition for a continued focus on preventing dogs from attacking both people and other dogs. I don't feel this is going far enough.\r\n\r\nIn recent years there have been several high-profile attacks, most recently in Warrington my local town, where a small dog was killed when a lady was unable to keep her dog under control. If the dog was muzzled this would prevent this incident from ever happening and the other dog from being put to sleep.\r\n\r\nThis petition is for any type of breed which is known by it's owner to be vicious, this is to ensure that people who own a dog understand their temperament, if they are aware the dog has potential to cause harm it should be muzzled, failure to do this should result in longer sentencing and fines, this should be made law.\r\n\r\nResponsible owner should be able to walk their dogs who aren't a danger freely, without the fear of being attacked.",
