        "additional_details": "Tony Blair's government agreed that all motorways and trunk roads that were surfaced with concrete were too noisy and would be replaced by tarmac. A programme of work to do this was set out, but sadly this was scrapped before any resurfacing work was carried out. The situation was particularly bad on the new A30 Exeter to Honiton road opened in August 1999 by John Prescott. The road noise was considerably higher than predicted and after much protest concrete surfacing was abandoned by that Government.\r\nThe Government should adopt the original pledge and ensure all concrete roads are resurfaced with quiet tarmac as quickly as possible.",
