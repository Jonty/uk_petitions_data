        "additional_details": "This e petition has been produced in a bid to ask the government to educate families about the kinds of dogs which are acceptable to have in a family environment. Too many children are dying in environments where they are not suitably safeguarded because their families have them in their homes with dogs who are classed as dangerous or working dogs. As a responsible dog owner with children, I fully understand the importance of safeguarding my children and ensuring my animal's welfare at the same time. Working dogs don't make good domestic pets. They are bred for working. I have seen too many families recently in my community taking on working dogs or questionable breeds with young children, with insufficient time to give their full attention to exercising and training these animals. I am making my plea as a parent and responsible dog owner to the government to educate people. ",
