        "additional_details": "The government has changed the format of gcse exams. There are no retakes and there are no January exams. This will result into probably a lot of bad gcse results. Mainly because of the sudden change. If this law carries on it should be delayed for another 2 years. This law will put stress on students. It is not fair and quite silly. Please sign this petition to ensure you or your children achieve the best they can in their exams. If you don't sign it for yours, do it for everyone else suffering this. We need this.",
