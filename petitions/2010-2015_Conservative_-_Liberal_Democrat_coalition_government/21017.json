        "additional_details": "Would Parliament debate the increase of the current 'final mile' arrangement between Royal Mail and private delivery companies?  Under this arrangement companies such as TNT deliver their bulk mail to Royal mail sorting offices whereby the Royal Mail is obliged to deliver to the most rural communities in the UK.  The rate is currently 13p per item, regardless of size.  With the general public paying 36p per item (2nd class) surely an increase for business is called for.\r\nAlternatively they could set up their own delivery networks but would already have done so if delivering to the most rural communities was profitable.\r\nThe implied subsidy from 'piggybacking' the Royal Mail delivery network has served to increase profits and helped successive governments to paint a picture of private sector efficiency against public sector inefficiency.",
