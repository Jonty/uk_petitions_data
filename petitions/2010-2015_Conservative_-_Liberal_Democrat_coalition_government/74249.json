Exercise that properly by putting DAVID Cameron in jail and keep him there until Greece and the EU sort themselves out after the left wing vote.  We taxpayers simply do not want him rushing off carrying bucketsful of our taxes which he can hand to the Greeks to try to look like he is an international statesman, and not the political minnow he really is.",
