        "additional_details": "The current legislation allows for an employee to raise a tribunal against an employer with no recourse if they find the employer to be in the right. This creates a nothing to loose culture for the employee while putting any employer under significant pressure. This pressure can be significant on any business but can be crippling for small business. Employees should be more accountable if there is no claim to answer.",
