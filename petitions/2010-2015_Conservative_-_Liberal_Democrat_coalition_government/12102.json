        "additional_details": "The Police are a unique case.They cannot play an active part in politics. They cannot strike. They do not have a contract of employment to protect them as they are not employees but agents of their Chief Constable. The Offices, Shops and Railway premises Act does not extend to them but they are held responsible for certain aspects of the Health and Safety Legislation. They can face all of these difficulties but why, especially at a time of massive civil disobedience, does the Goverment think it\u00b4s right to withold previously agreed pay increase awards? To announce massive cuts whilst introducing inordinate increases to pension contributions. Doubling the number of officers on the street would do little if the Government don\u00b4t get the morale issues right, I want the Government to honour previous pay agreements, to stop the cuts and to reduce police pension contributions to their former level.",
