        "additional_details": "We the undersigned ask that the UK government acknowledge the Humanitarian crisis in Iraq and Syria, and in the Kurdish Regions.\r\n\r\nWe note that the UK Government has Committed to bombing the ISIL forces but has not committed itself fully to aiding the Kurdish refugees fleeing from ISIL Terror and genocide. Deportations are still ongoing, which in many cases will lead to the deaths of those refugees.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the UK government to establish proper provision for Kurdish refugees fleeing the genocide by the ISIL to be given full Asylum in Britain and stop any ongoing deportations of Kurdish Refugees by the UK Government.\r\n\r\nWe would further ask that proscription be removed from the Kurdish groups fighting the ISIL so that we may begin to properly aid them in their struggle against the ISIL.",
