Specifically we call on the Government to provide patients with life-threatening illnesses the legal right to choose to try drugs at an earlier stage in the development process - when there is scientific evidence for safety and efficacy but before the very lengthy late stage trials currently required.\r\n\r\nThis could be done by:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Giving patients access to medicine during development stages, if the risk of \u201cdoing nothing\u201d outweighs the risk of negative side effects\r\n\u2022 Giving patients the right to access drugs licensed for any condition other than their own\r\n\u2022 Making it possible for patients to give legally binding indemnities when agreeing to take drugs under these conditions.\r\n",
