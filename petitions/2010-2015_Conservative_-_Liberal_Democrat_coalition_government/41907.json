They constantly collaborate with anti-Palestine terrorists, engaging in acts of violence themselves, and reaping the natural resources of its Arab neighbours. The Arabs had lived in the lands long before Arthur Balfour decided the Jews could occupy this land. Britain are undoubtidly the author of this violence yet we distance ourselves.\r\n Is it not the entire purpose of the UN to stand up to bullies?\r\nYes, it is but along with other disillusioned western governments, they seem to collaborate with Israel and classify them as allies?\r\n\r\n It is time that Britain officially recognised Palestine as a state, and pledged their support to the country, who has been oppressed for several decades.",
