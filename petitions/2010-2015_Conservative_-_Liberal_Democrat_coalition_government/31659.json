The ripple-effect of his theories on modern life continues to grow, and may never stop.\r\n\r\nThe current Bank of England \u00a310 notes are Series E, but Series F notes are already in circulation for some denominations. We therefore call upon the Treasury to request the Bank of England to consider depicting Alan Turing when Series F \u00a310 banknotes are designed.",
