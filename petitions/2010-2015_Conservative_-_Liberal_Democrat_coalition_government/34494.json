These include stately homes and other prestigious buildings, hotels and restaurants.\"\r\n\r\nThis is taken from the drectgov website.\r\nSo, why can people living in Scotland marry outside, yet in England and Wales we are limited and restricted to specific venues?\r\n\r\nAs an atheist who does not wish to stand hypocritically in church and make religious vows, I would like an option as to where my wedding takes place. I do not want to make a lifetime commitment in conference room B; I want to make a lifetime commitment somewhere that means something to myself and my partner.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and pass onto your friends and family. Let's spread the word and get this huge inequality in what is supposed to be the UNITED Kingdom quashed!",
