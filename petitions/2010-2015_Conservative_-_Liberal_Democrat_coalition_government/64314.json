        "additional_details": "Admission charges to Britain's important historical sites should be discounted significantly for UK citizens in line with policies in other countries. This will encourage attendance, understanding and participation from those inheriting their national and community cultures, currently discouraged or denied access through high charges, particularly for families. An international comparison is the Taj Mahal charging Rs510 for Indian citizens and Rs750 for foreigners.  The Tower of London charges \u00a322.00 for all adults; \u00a359.00 for a family of whatever origin.",
