I would say if APD was abolished we could get vital business links back to Belfast such as flights to Canada, Dubai and possibly China but all airlines leave when they see how much tax they have to pass on to their passengers adding more cost to us.\r\n Glasgow Prestwick is struggling as routes are no longer being launched due to airline thinking about we're else they could have routes with no tax.\r\n Heathrow could lose its status as an EU hub as airlines are considering Paris, Brussels and Dublin as hubs for interchanging flights.\r\n\r\nI loving flying but would prefer to use my local airport then travel to Dublin to get a flight.
