        "additional_details": "Many upcomming developed economies (including those of the BRIC nations) all seem to have one thing in common. High exports in comparison to imports. The UK has become too dependent on imports, and needs to start developing more exports to raise its income. Through developing more manufacturers in the UK, unemployment will decrease, more foreign exchange will take place, and indeed more disposible expenditure, which would help the housing, retail and other markets. The Government must endorse UK manufacturers, and lower export taxation, to increase custom from other countries.",
