        "additional_details": "The Hoover dam created employment, construction and hydro-electric power and helped reverse the great depression. Public spending now on energy would boost construction and produce cheaper electricity. Either re-nationalisation or new competitors would employ many people in the UK, give cheap electricity and little carbon. Some green energy schemes are unsuitable. Wind turbine and photovoltaic electricity are at a fairly high price. Nuclear has too long a time scale.\r\nTidal turbines are functioning in Northern Ireland and a tidal lagoon is possible.  The Thames barrier could have turbines. 800MW of wave energy is being commissioned in the Pentland Firth. Pumped storage like Dinorwic is needed.  Gas is currently cheapest but comes from Qatar. Methane from landfill and animal manure could be harvested in anaerobic digesters. Selling heat for greenhouses or buildings improves cost-efficiency.  The capital could be ten-year gilts at 1.85% interest, repaid by electricity sales.  ",
