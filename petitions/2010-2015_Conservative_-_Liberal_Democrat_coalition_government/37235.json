How much of tax payer's money has been wasted in baseless and irrational legal cases which the council has lost against community institutions whilst the Mayor has been in office.\r\n\r\n2. The Mayor's in/formal correspondence with third parties in relation to the sale or acquisition of land and assets belonging to charitable organisations/ trusts within Newham.\r\n\r\nWe call for the subsequent resignation of the Mayor, giving way for a tolerant Mayor who can really lead this diverse community with justice and harmony.",
