        "additional_details": "Abolish the rights of the Scottish and Northern Irish banks to print there own bank notes and instead centralise this process the next time bank notes have to be replaced on mass.i.e. when the Queen dies with a new single set of Bank of Great Britain notes. There are three banks in Scotland and four in Ireland which all print there own unique notes. This serves no purpose other than to cause problems when changing money abroad or even within the UK and encourages the production of fake notes as there are 8 different versions of the tenner alone (not to mention the ones jersey etc have)",
