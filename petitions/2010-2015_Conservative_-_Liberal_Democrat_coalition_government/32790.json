        "additional_details": "This petiton calls for the amendment of the Child Poverty Act introduced by the last Labour government.\r\n\r\nThe Act defines poverty as having a household income that is 40% below the national average. This results in people living in the South East and Central London being doubly penalised, as they receive the same amount as someone living in the North East or in rural Wales, and allows governments to declare someone being out of poverty even though they may have as little as little as 5 pence over the 40% national threshold.\r\n\r\nClearly a more intelligent measure needs to be introduced namely a measure of poverty that takes account of the actual cost of living in a local area/region.\r\n\r\n",
