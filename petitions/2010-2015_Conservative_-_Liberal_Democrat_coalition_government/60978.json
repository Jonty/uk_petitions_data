Countries have granted Syrian refugees asylum but they are living in make shift camps.\r\n\r\nThe British government is letting in people from all over the EU who are not in the middle of a war where as Syrians are. Anyone who claims asylum or who is in an asylum camp in a neighbouring country to Syria should be allowed to come to Britain with their children.\r\n\r\nA lot of children are now orphaned and have no one. By giving them British citizenship they will have somewhere to live which is safe and not gripped by war. ",
