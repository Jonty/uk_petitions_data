        "additional_details": "I propose for potential dog owners to obtain a license through a new governing body.\r\n\r\nThe license would be a one off fee and the licensing process would be a mixture of dog & owner training, owner assessment inc living arrangements and personal circumstances, a final examination to determine if the license is granted.\r\n\r\nThe one off fee would pay for the training courses and the process as a whole, the money would also go towards employing more wardens.\r\n\r\nWhen buying a dog from a dog breeder. It should be illegal for the breeder to sell a dog without the buyer owning a dog licence.\r\nAll dogs must be micro chipped, this would reduce the amount of strays.\r\nThis process would wheedle out potential dog owners that live in flats with no gardens, the examination would stop uneducated people owning dogs that cant look after them properly.",
