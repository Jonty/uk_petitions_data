So little research has gone into this yet it vastly reduces the quality of life for most people suffering from it. Most medical professionals have never even heard of it, leading to no diagnosis and further distress for those living with it.\r\n\r\nWe would like the government to fund research into this condition in order to better understand it and find a possible treatment.",
