        "additional_details": "Many house buyers & sellers are put under unfair pressure by mortgage lenders & estate agents to have chemical damp proof courses installed in their homes.  Chemical damp-proof courses are however, generally never needed, as any qualified INDEPENDENT surveyor will attest.  It is unknown just how many people have been pressured unfairly to pay thousands for chemical damp-proof courses or treatment for woodworm infestation that was not needed.\r\n\r\nThis is a request that the Government launches an investigation into the practice, to tighten industry regulation relating to what conditions are permitted by mortgage lenders, what companies estate agents can or cannot recommend, what mandatory text should be included in any damp survey, what rights consumers should be reminded of in such surveys & whether building regulations should be extended to protect buildings & owners from disreputable companies trying to sell unnecessary damp proof courses or woodworm treatment.",
