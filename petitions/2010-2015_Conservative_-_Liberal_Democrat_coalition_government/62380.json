        "additional_details": "The Governmment should amend the appropriate laws to allow Community First Responders to use Green Strobe or Rotating Beacons on their vehicles. The purpose (as currently with doctors) is not to demand priority or to allow breaking of any Road Traffic Regulations, but to indicate that they are on an emergency call and to request courtesy from other drivers in facilitating their progress to the incident. The warning beacons/strobes may only be used when the responder is running to a incident on the request of the Ambulance Service Control. As the breaking of Traffic Regulations will not take place this should not affect the Insurance premium for the Responders.",
