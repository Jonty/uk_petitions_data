The Bill was in no manifesto, it has been forced through Parliament without due process, and the government continue to refuse to release information from the Risk Register which it has twice been ordered to do.  This information has been deemed to be \"overwhelmingly in the public interest\".\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister, as head of the Government, should take responsible for this contempt of the Democratic system, particularly in light of his personal promise not to impose any top-down reorganisation of the NHS.  He should resign now. ",
