The chemical can also be found in other products such as henna tattoos, printing inks, fur dyes and other cosmetics.\r\nThis chemical is extremely dangerous and can cause severe allergic reactions, resulting in significant injuries to those who use/work with such products. Other European countries have banned this chemical from sale due to the risk it poses to consumers.\r\nWe call on the government to ban/restrict the sale of products containing PPD (para-phenylenediamine)\r\n",
