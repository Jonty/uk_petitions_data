Benefits that support those who choose not to work or those who claim to be seeking employment, do not encourage people to support themselves and demoralise those who work hard to earn, what is in most cases, a modest living.\r\nI propose a radical overhaul of the benefit system to try and improve the country's economic crisis and to try and restore some pride to the British people.
