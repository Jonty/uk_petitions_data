        "additional_details": "Operation Pride (see Facebook Page) has been established to encourage people to approach their local Member of Parliament (M.P) to push the conceptual idea of a formal British Military Veterans I.D. Card forward.\r\n\r\nThe on-going Military workload and more specifically the long term PTSD effects of this workload means that it is more important than ever to make sure that our Veterans have the long term support networks in place for their health care needs : this is owed to them under the Military Covenant.\r\n\r\nAn integral part this of long term support should be an I.D. Card that is robust enough to be SECURE and easy enough to produce to facilitate fast-track aid for those that need it as they need it.\r\n\r\nIf benefits are to be given to our Veterans such that the Military Covenant is satisfied then this ROBUST means of Identification becomes necessary to PROVE LEGAL ENTITLEMENT.",
