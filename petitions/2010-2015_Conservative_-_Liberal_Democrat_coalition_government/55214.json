        "additional_details": "At present the Guardian's 'Comment is Free' Moderation team exercise tyrannical control over the views of it's readership with a trigger happy approach to censoring the views of it's readers.  Considering the free speech editorial policy of Alan Rusbridger, it is a great irony that the Cif team exercise zero restraint when deleting users profiles and comments on often weak and flippant grounds.  I propose that this censorship be exorcised completely and let people comment free of interference as the name misleadingly suggests. ",
