        "additional_details": "Energy resources are depleting. Energy demand is still increasing. Soon the UK will be completely dependant on other countries for its energy supply. With the much needed decommissioning of the coal fired power plants in the next 10-15 years action needs to be taken now to insure our energy independence for future generations and to make sure energy prices remain affordable.\r\n\r\nFor a sustainable future we need more onshore wind turbines, biomass, hyro-power, tidal, geothermal, solar. Studies show we can reach a sustainable energy efficient future without nuclear.\r\n\r\nPlanning for on-shore wind and other renewable energy needs to be EASIER. Complaints about it 'spoiling the natural British countryside' need to be set aside as ignorant. The countryside is man made now and it is the personal opinion of the minority that wind turbines spoil it.\r\n\r\nSign this petition now and lets work together for a cleaner, more energy efficient future for future generations and ourselves.",
