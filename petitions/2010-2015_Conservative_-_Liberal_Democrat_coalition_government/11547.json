These people still vote on bills and make decisions that effect all voters and therefore they too should be voted for by the public rather than chosen by MP's.\r\n\r\nThe current format of choosing members boosts the House of Lords numbers to ridiculous numbers and by changing to an elected house this would reduce the numbers as well as make the house accountable as well as the House of Commons. Even if it is 300 members with one third up for election every 6 years",
