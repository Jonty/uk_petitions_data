        "additional_details": "HMG should legislate against abortion on grounds of social circumstances or mild psychological conditions of the parent but allow abortion, on medical advice, if life threating to the mother or for crippling genetic disease of the embryo. There is no need to abort a healthy child for social circumstances as she/he can be taken into care. However screening embryos for genetic diseases before implanting IVF embryos OR during early stages of pregnancy (like less than 13 weeks old) in order to identify carriers of crippling genetic diseases is an ethical & worthwhile cause. Human embryos less than 13 weeks old are a group of cells without consciousness. Therefore abortion should preferably be done for embryos less than 13 weeks old. However due to the series tests needed to support the medical grounds for abortion, it may not always be possible for an abortion to be much less than 24 weeks of pregnancy.",
