Thus meaning the air base faces closure.\r\n\r\nI urge the Government to consider taking on board this historic and significant aviation landmark as either an air museum like Duxford in Cambridgeshire or as a potenial site to renovate as a 'small capacity' airport e.g. Stansted; instead of building a new runway at Heathrow or Gatwick.\r\n\r\nOr in the interest of the RAF, use it as a base to train pilots and / or keep open as an emergency landing airport.\r\n\r\nProtect our aviation history.",
