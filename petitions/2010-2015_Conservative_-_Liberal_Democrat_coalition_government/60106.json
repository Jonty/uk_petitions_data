        "additional_details": "This petition seeks to ask the government to abolish ATOS Assessments and Tribunals which have had a detremental damaging effect on the emotional, physical and financial welfare of sick and disabled British Citizens since legislation changed favouring a system that imposes a stricter fear orientated reigime.\r\n\r\nWe are fully aware that a small majority of the British Public misuse the benefits system but these assessments let down the people who need help the most. It is time to put a stop to them and ask for a fairer way to help people back into work and actually support those who cant. Sign now for change.",
