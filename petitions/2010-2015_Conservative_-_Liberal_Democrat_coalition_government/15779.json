        "additional_details": "I watch a lot of police programmes and see that people who commit crimes often then do it again mainly because the punishment is too soft, for example if you are caught for the first time with an illegal drug you are given a caution which to some people means absolutely nothing, they should include more hefty fines and improve the system of which justice is done, punishments for the rioters earlier last month are much more tough and I think we will see results.",
