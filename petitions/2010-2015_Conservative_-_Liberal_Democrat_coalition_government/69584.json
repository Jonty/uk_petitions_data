        "additional_details": "To stop the proposed closures of the village schools in Tonmawr, Pontrhydyfen and Bryn in the Neath Port Talbot area.\r\n\r\nThe closures of these schools will be detrimental to the village life as it will mean less people will move to the areas as there will be no schools for their children.\r\nCosts will rise as pupils will have to be transported to schools a couple of miles away.  Also there will be knock on effect with these schools as they will have to accommodate the extra numbers of pupils which will mean larger class sizes and less resources.\r\n\r\nPlease put a stop to these closures and ensure the future of the education of the children in the villages is preserved and enhanced.",
