Poor Tyrone is goin to get the book thrown at him.... Or is he?!?\r\nNow I KNOW it's only a soap, but if the writers of corrie let Kirsty get away with these heinous crimes... Then I vow to stop watching corrie... And the more that sign this petition the more they may listen to us!!!\r\nJUSTICE FOR TYRONE DOBBS!!!\r\n",
