It is much easier for underage teenagers to get alcohol from supermarkets and corner shops which leads to other social issues such as anti-social behaviour.  I would like to see a complete change to the selling and advertisement of alcohol, a ban on supermarkets and corner shops selling alcohol.  A price rise and a ban on alcohol advertisement on social network sites and stricter control on TV advertisement.",
