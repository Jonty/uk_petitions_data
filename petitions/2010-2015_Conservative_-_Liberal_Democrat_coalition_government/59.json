        "additional_details": "IR35 was implemented to prevent people from avoiding tax by becoming a contractor but receiving all the perks of a permanent employee.\r\n\r\nWhere the legislation fails is that a lot of contractors do not receive any of the perks that an employee may receive such as holiday entitlements, sick pay, training and pensions.\r\n\r\nThe contractor also has a short notice period and can often be laid off instantly without reason.\r\n\r\nThe point of this e-petition is to bring to the government's attention that IR35 is unfair because it over penalises contractors because after IR35 is paid the contractor has paid as much tax as a permanent employee without any of the benefits.\r\n\r\nI would seek to get either IR35 removed entirely or a reduction in the amount of tax liable for being inside an IR35 contract",
