Yet we see little of this dripping into actually society. It is the feeling of the nation that this government blames inheritance for misfortune but neglects to rectify what it was handed in any acceptable or fair way. Why should those with the greatest wounds be those to suffer the greatest cuts?\r\n\r\nA Big Society starts at the bottom and works up. If you shut a plant in the basement it will die. Lift it to the sun and it will grow. That crop could feed a village and beyond, left in the darkness you starve the world.",
