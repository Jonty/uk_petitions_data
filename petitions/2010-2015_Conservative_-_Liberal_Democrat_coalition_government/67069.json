It's been found out that the council had falsified the height in order to get an enforcement action in place. Several signatures by neighbours we signed, survey report and there own officer measurement proved it had never been made any higher.  Amended plans submitted in 1996 on request of a officer Ms H Morgan planning permission was granted but the amended plans have mysteriously disappeared. Now there is  no one in dependant to investigate and look into our claim a their should be a safety net in place to carry out an internal investigation to stop this wrong doing.not the ombudsman because if you have appealed then they cannot carry out an investigation and the council know that.",
