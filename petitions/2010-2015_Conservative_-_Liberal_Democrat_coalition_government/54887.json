        "additional_details": "The technology world is fast moving, with newer, improved gadgets being released at regular intervals. It does not however excuse the blatant decision to shorten the life of our devices by making the battery not replaceable.\r\n\r\nBurying the battery within a device for the sake of adding a removable back is not only irresponsible to the earth it is unfair on the consumer. It wastes resources, creates e-waste and wastes your money for their profit.\r\n\r\nThe UK and the EU collectively need to act on behalf of the environment and the consumers to make it clear to manufacturers that planned obsolescence is not an acceptable business model.\r\n\r\nIn can be achieved, just as in 2009, when the EU forced all phone companies to use micro-usb for charging.",
