        "action": "A referendum to be had before the proposed 3 year trial of Centralised European Time in 2012",
        "additional_details": "This petition is to insist that the government hold a national referendum on the proposals to trial the changing of the UK's time to Central European Time in 2012, which would put forward GMT +2 hours in winter, and put forward BST +1 hour in summer.\r\n\r\nThe referendum should aim to find what support there is amongst the general public within the United Kingdom towards this trial and possible implementation in 2015. This is so that the people who will be affected the most will have their say, rather than those with business or economic interests if the move was to take place.",
