        "additional_details": "The current fines for driving offences do not reflect the damage and mayhem caused by drivers not obeying the current driving laws.\r\n\r\nCurrently people can choose to go on a driving course to learn about driving safely, this is not adequate enough and people re-offend.\r\n\r\nPeople need to be made aware that driving dangerously or without due care and attention does have dramatic repercussions.\r\n\r\nI propose that fines are reassessed and significantly increased, for example;\r\n\r\nSpeeding fine - \u00a3200 plus 3 points\r\nUse of phone while driving - \u00a3200 plus 3 points\r\nDriving under influence - \u00a3500 plus 3 mnth ban minimum\r\nDangerous driving - \u00a3500 minimum\r\nNo tax/test/insurance - \u00a3200 per\r\nCausing injury to others due to dangerous driving and/or without due care or attention - \u00a31000 minimum plus 3 month ban\r\nCausing death by dangerous driving and/or without due care or attention - \u00a310000 5 yr sentence minimum.",
