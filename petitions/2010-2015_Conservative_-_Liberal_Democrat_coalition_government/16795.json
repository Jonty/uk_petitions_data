        "additional_details": "The basic rate of child support is currently calculated as a percentage of the non-resident parent's income.  This is nonsense.\r\n\r\nThe costs of raising children are related to the prices of food, clothes and accommodation.  These basic costs should be shared equally by both parents.  The Child Support Agency could easily calculate these costs on an annual basis and collect appropriate payments from non-resident parents.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why the non-resident parent's income is relevant to this calculation, unless they are on low income or living on benefits.",
