It costs thousands of pounds to organise a benefit tribunal , such as that for ESA. A judge and medical specialist have to be paid and also a presenting officer for the DWP. After all, it is the claimants whom have asked for the appeal. If they do not turn up - make them contribute towards the cost.",
