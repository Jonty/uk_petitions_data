        "additional_details": "Enough is enough, over the previous few years we have seen, felt and experienced sex grooming gangs and rapists, prey on little girls as little as nine.\r\n\r\nIn many cases defendants are released with five to fifteen year sentences. These children are the future.\r\n\r\nJudges also take into consideration the defendants families, children and personal circumstances, is justice being served or customer service?\r\n\r\nThe basic rule of English Law is \"if a defendant is a threat to society he must be locked up\" However this is not the case being released after  some years what is the guarantee that the defendant is corrected can this sickness be cured?\r\n\r\nWe want child sex grooming gangs and individual   predators to be sentenced to life without parole no matter what there involvement is leading  to a minor being raped.\r\n\r\nPlease support our pledge, for the many more children who may face this.
