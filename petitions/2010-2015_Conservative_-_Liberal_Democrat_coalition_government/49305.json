        "additional_details": "This petition aims to help keep our beautiful countryside and towns clean and free of plastic waste. We would like the government to regulate the packaging used by all retailers of fast food, takeaways and such like to be biodegradeable. All retailers of such items should by law have to label their packaging to ensure litter and waste is properly disposed of and if not they should be taxed/fined accordingly. All packaging waste  should at the very least be able to be recycled or re-used if it is not biodegradable. We should name and shame the worst businesses and make them pay to clean up our countryside and towns.",
