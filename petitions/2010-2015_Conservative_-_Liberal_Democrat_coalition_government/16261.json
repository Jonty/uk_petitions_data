        "additional_details": "The government should re-evaluate the entitlement for Working Tax Credits. Under 25s with no children are not entitled to any help at all. This is no incentive to work. People work 40 hour weeks and receive less wages than people older than them, regardless of experience, and on top of that the older people are then entitled to Working Tax Credits, which we aren't. No wonder so many young people are having kids, they get paid to do nothing. While others work hard and honestly and receive less. This is unacceptable and should be re-evaluated!",
