If the UK and other developed nations of the world and indeed the United Nations work on this root cause, there would be less need for foreign aids for these countries and there would be less crisis to resolve. It is worthwhile to set up a unit specifically to speak and work against this problem as it's done with the crimes on humanity. A coordinated European Union voice would also be an added advantage.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\nAdekunle Adetoba\r\nCEO: Link Management Consultants Ltd. (London, UK)",
