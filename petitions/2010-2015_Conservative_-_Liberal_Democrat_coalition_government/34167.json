        "additional_details": "The Olympics is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to show the world that the UK is a great place to develop your talents  - whatever they may be. Sporting, scientific, artistic, industrial, agricultural, environmental or other, in every field the UK has been and continues to be novel and innovative. Ours is a country where democracy rules, unhindered by dogma and enhanced by the UK's unique mix of religious beliefs and racial origins. The song \"Brilliant\" by Ultravox encapsulates this perfectly. This petition requests the UK government to direct the nation to adopt the song \"Brilliant\" as the official anthem of the Olympic Games 2012. ",
