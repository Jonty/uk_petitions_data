        "additional_details": "This petition has the aim of banning the Environmental Enforcement Officers. They have been known to follow people and wait for them to drop litter, use tactics where they hide out of view before running and cornering people and for accidentally dropping things. We all understand that we must do something to stop litter but these people are not the answer. They are not their to stop people from littering but simply get money from them if they do. Not to mention the strain they must put on the police who have to be called away from their jobs when ever someones runs away from their fines. It is also unbelievable to see in this country two or even three grown men surrounding a woman and trying to intimidate her into accepting her fine. We live in a country where we are innocent until proven guilty yet a lot of the time they are mistaken and try to fine people who they think littered, as such they have no evidence yet a fine is still issued.",
