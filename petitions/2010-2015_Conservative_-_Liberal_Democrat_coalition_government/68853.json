Market confidence bases currency value upon the size,prestige, prospects and governance of the parent economy. Comparison of  currencies fixes their relative world value.\r\nGovernment maintains the currency/economy through taxation,spending and borrowing (fiscal) controls.\r\nEuro-club nations agree spending limits proportional to national income and if such a sterling relationship was applied to Scotland their spending would have to mirror N. Sea oil decline. Alternatively a shared currency beyond parental control would spell \"Greek Tragedy\"r for all but a few. ",
