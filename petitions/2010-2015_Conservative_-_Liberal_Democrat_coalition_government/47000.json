I believe that 5 years is too long if members of the public are potentially suffering at the hands of new policy and somewhat radical 'shake-ups'.\r\n\r\nMany of these Petitions are dismissed as 'they are a matter for Parliament, not the Government', however it seems that Petitions to the Parliament directly are almost impossible since:\r\n\r\nThe Chairman of Committees indicated that, 'public petitions to the House of Lords are rare: the last occasion on which a petition was presented was on 13 December 2000. I do not therefore believe that expenditure on developing a system of e- petitioning unique to the House of Lords could be justified.'\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, petition Parliament to hold a vote of no confidence, to allow a fair and immediate consideration of what the public want and require from their Government.
