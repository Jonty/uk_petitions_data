        "additional_details": "The 1997 Protection from Harassment Act was originally brought in to protect people from stalkers.\r\nSo if the government want to protect people from stalkers why did they not make a Protection From Stalking Act?\r\nSince this was created the act has been twisted so much that even writing two letters to your MP with a six month period constitutes harassment if your MP decides to complain. Fair complaint about your treatment by a hospital or a school \u2013 then their easy remedy is a complaint.\r\nIn a free society individuals should be able to express their point of view and complaints.\r\nIt is frightening that a family may have a perfectly reasonable row with a neighbour, supplier, client or contractor and yet could face prosecution if their adversary becomes aware of the law in this regard.  There have already been ridiculous prosecutions.\r\nSurely the police have better things to do but are driven by statistics.\r\n",
