        "additional_details": "I cite the case of a man who was stabbed in Southend-on-Sea in the early hours of Friday 29th July 2011.  The police arrested a man who they think was responsible for the stabbing and he is now on bail until the 7th October 2011.  I also cite the case of Jonathan Vass.  He was arrested on suspicion of rape and then granted bail.  He subsequently stabbed the complainant 71 times.  Rape is a violent crime and if he had not been granted bail, the complainant would still be alive.   Allowing suspected violent people to be given bail is not protecting the community.  Those arrested on suspicion of committing violent crimes should be kept in custody unless it is subsequently believed they are innocent.",
