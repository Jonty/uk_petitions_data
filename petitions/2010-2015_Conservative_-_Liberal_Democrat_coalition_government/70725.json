The IPSA want to keep the names of Mp's who fiddle their expenses secret, to prevent reputal damage.\r\nAlso the IPSA want to ban the public from hearings.\r\nThis creates a number of issues. Who votes for the Mp's? The general public. OUR Mp's are elected by the public to make them accountable to us.\r\nWe the undersigned demand that the names of Mp's whom fiddle their expenses will remain public, as we have a right to know. We also demand you drop plans to ban the public from hearings.",
