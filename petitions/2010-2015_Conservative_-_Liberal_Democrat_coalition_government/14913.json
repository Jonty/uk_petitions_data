        "additional_details": "Why, when we are experiencing the toughest economic outlook in living memory, has Conservative controlled West Dorset District Council, decided to spend \u00a313M of local Council Tax payers hard earned money on building itself a 'prestigious' new office block and library on a piece of prime real estate, closing a vital town centre shopper's car park in the process. Can the council explain why the building is necessary when they already have adequate offices and have recently upgraded the existing perfectly serviceable library with a new IT system? Why, when a historic Parish poll in which the citizens of Dorchester voted overwhelmingly against the development (2044 votes cast against the development; just 156 in favour), did the Council ignore the views of local people? Furthermore, the closure of the shoppers car park is causing unbearable loss of custom for local independent traders, already forcing several out of business.\r\nWhere is the logic in this undemocratic folly?",
