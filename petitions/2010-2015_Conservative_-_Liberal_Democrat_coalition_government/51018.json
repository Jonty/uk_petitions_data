        "additional_details": "The Government and the UK taxpayer has to fund many worthwhile causes and families in difficulty, due to the economic climate and personal circumstances.  The media has highlighted that extremists who incite hate towards the UK public and government  are cost to the economy and non deserving and should not be funded in any way.\r\n\r\n\r\nCol Richard Kemp, former Commander of British Forces in Afghanistan, insisted: \u201cThe DWP is unwittingly funding terrorism by paying benefits to Anjem Choudary. You could say that by paying taxes, and putting money into his pocket, I am funding terrorism. I resent that.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful the taxpayer is being forced to fund someone who has had an active hand in indoctrinating people who have then carried out violence against us. I believe a law needs to be found. Choudary needs to be stopped.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you support this sign this petition, don't let extremists be able to air their hate and then be supported by anyone in the UK",
