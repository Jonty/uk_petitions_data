        "additional_details": "We the undersigned hereby request that the Prime Minister and associated Ministers and MPs of the British government repeal the law to make changes within the confines of the Enhanced Criminal Records Bureau disclosure. Since its inception, there have been numerous cases where a person has been the recipient of a disclosure when being offered work and found that false allegations, lies, misinformation and slander has been included under the section offered by the Chief Constable of a local Police force.\r\n\r\nInnocent men and women are being lablled a criminal when nothing has been proven, ridiculed and embarrassed, sometimes being forced to move locality. As a governmental process, this must cease with immediate effect. An enhanced CRB check when needed, must be undertaken fairly and without malice or slander to a person's good name. Please delete the section at the discretion of the Chief Constable forthwith and make the CRB process more open and accountable in future cases.",
