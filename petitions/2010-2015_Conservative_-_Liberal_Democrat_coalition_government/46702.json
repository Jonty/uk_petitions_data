The city of Hasselt in Belgium is a famous example: fares were abolished in 1997 and ridership was as much as \"13 times higher\" by 2006.\r\nThe United Kingdom Produces The 8th most CO2 omissions. Ahead of many larger countries such as France. It produces approximately 400,000 more tonnes of CO2 per year than Belgium. The results are proven. Belgium now produces 3.1% less of CO2 than what they produces 10 years ago. Noting the fact that the amount of cars have almost doubled.\r\n\r\nThe amount of cars and traffic will decrease. It will be less chaotic on the road. Students will arrive to school on time. I am sure there are many more benefits to this matter.\r\n\r\nThe government could only make the busses and trams free. ",
