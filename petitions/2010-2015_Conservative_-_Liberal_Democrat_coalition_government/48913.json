        "additional_details": "The pensioner's winter fuel allowance should be doubled to reflect that it has not increased since introduction many years ago although the costs of energy supplies, electric, gas and oil have gone up significantly.    An increase from the present rate of \u00a3200 to a new rate of \u00a3400 should be introduced\r\n\r\nPensioner's income free allowance has also been frozen although living costs have escalated greatly over the past few years.   Whereby many pensioners had put aside funds to live on in retirement the minimal interest rates have also significantly reduced our disposable income.\r\n\r\nThe last two or three winters have been extremely cold and have seen massive increases in the amount of energy used to keep homes at reasonable temperatures over longer periods of time.
