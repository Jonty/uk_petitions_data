Making more flats and houses will not only be a stress to already crippled infrastructure of borehamwood, it will also lead to deterioration of the town and its life. Already the local surgeries are struggling to cope with the number of patients, there are constant traffic jams. These new developments will be the downfall of Borehamwood. Planning application can be seen on Hertmere website. Please stop this development going forward. Help save our town. ",
