        "additional_details": "With there being a coalition government in Zimbabwe there are no longer any political refugees.When shanty towns were demolished in Harare the Uk news media reported the event as an attack on opposition supporters in Harare presumably in line with the them British Governments budget for counter propaganda against Zimbabwe, in fact as none had a fixed address in Harare,not one was even a voter. It was in fact a move against criminals as all who lived there survived on the proceeds of crime.I was a victim who made many complaints,even polce were afraid of entering these areas.How do the unemployed and homeless afford an air ticket to uk onless with the proceeds of crime.It is thus the UK became Zimbabwes penal colony.These people are a drain on social services in Britain and should be repatriated by the British Govt back to Zimbabwe.",
