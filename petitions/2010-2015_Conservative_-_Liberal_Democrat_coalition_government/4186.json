An insanely long time, especially for parents who work and can't afford child care.  Why don't kids get two weeks during summer, like everyone else and use those spare weeks to teach them something?  Not only that but it wold let people out to work.\r\n\r\nLet's start schools at 8am instead of 9am.  Let's have schools finish at 6pm insterad of 4pm.  Then parents can go to work, children can actually learn something and everyone benefits.\r\n\r\nIt's a no-brainer.",
