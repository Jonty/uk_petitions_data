        "additional_details": "Prime Minister David Cameron has recently announced that filters used to block pornography under the ISP filtering bill will also block websites espousing \"extremist\" views in order \"to keep our country safe\". Stating, \"We have put in place some of the toughest controls that one can possibly have within a democratic Government[...]\", giving a terrifying eye-opener on how the boundaries of democracy are being pushed with this bill and others like it.\r\n\r\nThe key to an educated, well informed and emotionally mature population is freedom of speech and the ability to discuss and investigate these \"extremist\" views.\r\n\r\nWe urge the government to allow the UK public to vote on whether ISPs should be forced to filter content under this bill and any others like it. If UK consumers do not want their internet content filtered, they deserve the right not to have this censorship forced upon them.",
