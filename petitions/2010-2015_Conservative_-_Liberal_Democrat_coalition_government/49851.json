        "action": "Petition for a 4:1 mandatory minimum staffing ratio for nurses in the NHS",
        "additional_details": "Most nurses employed by the NHS have to look after unmanageable numbers of patients. A single nurse cares for on average 9 patients on a medical ward, 11 on an Elderly Care ward. This puts patients at risk and is the biggest reason for adverse patient care. A survey of nursing staff in March 2013 found only 31% reported having enough staff. 76.8% reported not having enough time to care for patients. 19.7% said conditions in their hospital were like those at Mid Staffordshire. The Francis Report showed the role low staffing plays in poor patient care. Research by nursing academics show the maximum number of patients that a nurse can effectively and safely care for is four. We ask the Department of Health to implement a mandatory minimum staffing ratio of 4:1 to govern nurse staffing levels in the NHS, with the necessary increased requirements for complex areas like HDU and ICU, and develop mandatory staffing levels for primary care, to ensure all patients in the NHS are given safe care.",
