        "additional_details": "Animal cruelty charges need to be toughened to make them akin to charges for criminal injury or death of a human. For example, if someone heartlessly drowns 5 new born kittens this should be treated in the same way as it would if they were to drown 5 new born babies. A life is a life, and criminal action that leads to the loss or injury of that life should be treated as murder, manslaughter, GBH etc.; why should animals have less rights than humans?! Besides, if someone is sick enough to harm a poor defenceless kitten or puppy, it is only a matter of time before their deranged attention is fixed on harming human life. If an animal is murdered by a human, they should receive a sentence for murder!!",
