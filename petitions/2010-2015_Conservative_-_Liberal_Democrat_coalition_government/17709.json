        "additional_details": "Too many of Brighton's Art Deco buildings have been demolished, and there are several under threat. The latest is the Astoria in the centre of town, on Gloucester Place. Opening in 1933 as a 1800-seat cinema, it became a Bingo hall in 1977 and closed in 1997. In 2000 November it was granted Grade II listed building status.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Brighton planning committee has voted 9:3 in favour of demolition of the Brighton Astoria. Standard of debate, very low. Most Councillors unable to grasp the complex issues of the conservation rules. Building will now most likely sit empty while the economic conditions improve, time we could spend developing our proposals. Next stop - Secretary of State.",
