        "additional_details": "My brother got sent to prison for a year in September, basically for standing up to a meow selling bully. He got punched by this man twice in the face earlier on in the night. He saw him outside a bit later on and did hit him back. The guy fell and hit his head and ended up in hospital. My brother put him in the recovery position before instructing 'the victims' girlfriend to call the ambulance. My brother admitted everything and was wrongly advised to plead guilty (he believed it was the right thing to do) Obviously because of the guilty plea none of the other circumstances were taken into account I.e one being that he got hit by this violent man who had only recently come out of prison for nearly killing someone.  My brother is a first time offender and is a hardworking taxpayer. We believe the criminal justice system should be made to look at all circumstances in each case and give an appropriate sentence ",
