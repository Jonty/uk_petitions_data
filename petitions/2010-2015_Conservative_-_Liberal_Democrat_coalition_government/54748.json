        "additional_details": "The British high street is a worldrenowned institution. We can\u2019t just sit back and watch it wither away. This means ministers have to make business rates a fairer tax that doesn\u2019t disproportionately burden smaller businesses and retail. Property values must be realigned and the business rates system needs reforming. At the moment it\u2019s not fit for purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Grimsey Review are, therefore, calling on the government to:-\r\n\r\n1)Reintroduce immediately the 2015 business rates\r\nrevaluation to realign property values and freeze\r\nbusiness rates from 2014.\r\n2)Once revaluations have taken place any future\r\nincreases should be an annualised CPI rate rather\r\nthan a one-month snapshot.\r\n3)From 2017 revaluations must be conducted annually.\r\n4)Undertake a route and branch review to establish a flexible system that will reflect changes in economic conditions as they occur.\r\n",
