        "additional_details": "Schedule 7(9) of the Data Protection Act 1998 exempts personal data consisting of information recorded by candidates during an academic, professional or other examination from being disclosed to said candidate.\r\n\r\nThis is a completely irrational exemption that limits students' ability to continuously improve their performance throughout their academic career and belittles the effort put in by such students.  Furthermore, this is likely limiting potential by simply awarding poor marks due to exam technique and not knowledge, which is surely not what we are looking to exam.  Warwick University has already recognised the absurdity of this exemption and have recently granted students access to their examination scripts.  I believe this exemption should be scrapped removing the cloak of secrecy under which university exams operate and providing students with the information they need in order to continuously improve.",
