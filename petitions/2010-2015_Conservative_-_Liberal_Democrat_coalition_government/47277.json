It is obviously unfair that the English should not be given an opportunity to celebrate their patron saint on 23 April. England gets only 8 bank holidays a year, fewer than most European countries. Our Cultural Heritage needs to be celebrated. We call on the government to make St. George's Day a bank holiday in England.",
