        "additional_details": "Legalise but control cannabis production, just as alcohol content is controlled, so should THC content be. We would not allow 90% alcohol content as we know such a high concentration of alcohol will very likely provoke medical conditions. Take the power of regulation away from the illegal drug dealer, restrict and control the THC content of cannabis and allow an undeniable pattern of human behaviour to occur in controlled conditions rather than through the shadow of illegality.\r\n\r\nThe greatest harm cannabis produces is it's ability to provoke psychotic disorder in a small proportion of users and contribute to lung cancer. However, the integral chemical compound of cannabis that produces this reaction is of a much higher concentration where the drug is produced illegally. Shift the power of production to business, with legal regulation, and allow only the safest form of the drug to reach the public. Legalise cannabis, but safely.\r\n",
