        "additional_details": "The UC cap must not be implemented in Bristol. It will have costly effects on the health and wellbeing of individuals, parents and children. Government Office for Science has shown that debt and mental illness are related. London School of Economics researches show that the stress of the parents affects the immune system of children. Comfortable tax payers should reflect on the unreasonable stress to Bristol tenants when rent is made unaffordable by government policies, and on the loss to many already vulnerable children of the protection of the local authorities and schools when they are forcibly moved. We call on Parliament to prevent the mass changing of locks by bailiffs in Bristol by stopping the cap on the Universal Credit for Bristol claimants, reforming the Housing Benefit Regulations and creating a policy for affordable housing in all tenures which will improve not damage the health, wellbeing and security of every citizen of Bristol.",
