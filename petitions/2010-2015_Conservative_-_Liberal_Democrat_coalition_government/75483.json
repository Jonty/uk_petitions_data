        "additional_details": "School league tables put terrible stress on schools,  staff and especially children who are told their chances in life will be seriously curtailed if they don't achieve the highest possible results. Some like my son become so depressed or dis-engaged that they leave or become ill so achieving far less than they would've done without the pressure. Additionally children are told to aim at university and discouraged from more achievable vocational routes less dependent on qualifications.  Either league tables should be banned or changed to be far less dependent on academic results.",
