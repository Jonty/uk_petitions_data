        "additional_details": "It has become a trend in the current fiscal crisis for highstreet business to go into administration with little notice, leaving consumers who have purchased gift vouchers out of pocket - often to high value.\r\nThese gift vouchers are often sold until the day of administration and then rendered invalid - consumers then become the final creditor once administration is announced- leading to most unable to claim a return in their credit purchase.\r\n\r\nI propose a change in the law to either:\r\n1: The consumer becomes the primary creditor when a company goes into administration and all credit notes and vouchers are fulfilled or refunded before debt is paid to other outstanding creditors. OR\r\n2: Business must notify their customers in print and online a minimum 30 days before vouchers are to be withdrawn in order for them to be satisfied.\r\nI believe this will rebuild trust between the customer and the marketplace.",
