        "additional_details": "On Monday 23rd January the \u201cfor sale\u201d sign went up outside Ledbury Ambulance Station as staff and vehicles move to the town\u2019s Police station. The asking price for Ledbury Ambulance Station will be about \u00a3115,000 but the cost to the people of Ledbury and the surrounding area will be much dearer. During the night, the ambulance will be stored in Hereford, meaning anyone who needs an ambulance during that time will have to wait at least 20 minutes before one arrives....if you're lucky!\r\nThe Town Council and Herefordshire Council gave no warning of this and gave no opportunity for discussion so sign this petition if you would like Government to review the sale and give us back the service we need and deserve!!
