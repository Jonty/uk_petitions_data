        "additional_details": "With all the fear of autism caused by the combined MMR vaccine (real or imagined), it is no surprise that many parents are deciding not to immunise their children at all. This puts those children, and others, at risk of infection.\r\n\r\nThe blame for this lies squarely with the Government, which has forced pharmaceutical firms to concentrate on the single MMR jab. As a result, it is not possible to get the single measles, mumps and rubella jabs without great expense, if we can get them at all.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of public health, the Government must reinstate for parents the choice to decide between combined or seperate jabs on the NHS.\r\n\r\n",
