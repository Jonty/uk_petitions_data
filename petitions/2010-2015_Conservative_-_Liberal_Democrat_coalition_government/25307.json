        "additional_details": "This petiton seeks to ask the treasury to amend taxation rules to try to save the british pub. A truly historic uk institution which is dying, largely at the threat of supermarkets.\r\n Think about your area how many pubs have gone for ever?How many supermarkets have closed?\r\nWe need to campaign to change the tax on beer,wine and spirits. Leave the tax level as it is for outlets where the drink is consumed at the point of sale. Any other sales outlets,will see the treasurey increase their tax on their alcohol sales. Pubs become price competitive. Supermarkets and other bottle/can outlets become relatively uncompetitive as their tax goes up. Thus people are encouraged back into pubs where drink is competively priced. Its win win.HMRC get in more tax, supermarket sales reduce, pub sales go up, some forms of binge drinking are reduced.",
