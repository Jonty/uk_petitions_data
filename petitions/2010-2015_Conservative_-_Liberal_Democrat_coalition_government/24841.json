        "additional_details": "Motability was created to help disabled people achieve greater independent mobility, however at what point does the provision of a vehicle, extend to the right to chose any model or specification, subsidised by the state.\r\n\r\nTo reduce costs, the government should put out to tender for the supply of cars each year. There will be a economy of scale from purchasing a large number of vehicles, and the company who can provide a vehicle at the lowest cost then gains the business.  Two classes of vehicle should be available, one standard vehicle, and a second wheelchair adapted model.  The vehicle should be available in a basic range of colours only.\r\n\r\nAny vehicle provided under the state scheme, should then have a registration number that identifies it as motability provided vehicle. This would then reduce the potential for abuse of the scheme.\r\n\r\nAn urgent reform of the current DLA motability scheme is required, to reduce cost, and the high level of abuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
