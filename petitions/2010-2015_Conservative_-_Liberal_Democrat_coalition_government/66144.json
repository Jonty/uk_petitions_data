        "additional_details": "I wrote this Mushu is a French bulldog who was taken away from his owner because of a woman wrongly accusing her partner of cruelty  and tried to take the dog off him. He was running low on sugar as he is a type 1 diabetic the police have seen this and pulled over. Taken the dog away and are now saying there is no record of him and his owner Betsy has no idea where her boy is as she's getting told nothing!  You can follow @mushufrench on twitter and return mushu home on a facebook group to see how much he is loved and cared for! So Please sign this petition to BRING MUSHU HOME!!! Thank you x",
