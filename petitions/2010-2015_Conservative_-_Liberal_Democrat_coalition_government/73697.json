Yous know exactly who these people are through your intelligence agencies and rather than \"monitor them\", yous cannot take any risks with innocent British peoples lifes and must put safety first by removing them immediately. It is a basic right that people in Britain should be protected before ANY of these extremists human rights.\r\n\r\nIf the extremist was not born in this country, they have to be returned to there country of origin as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n",
