        "additional_details": "Exam boards raised grade boundaries for the June 2012 GCSEs in order to curb grade inflation. This means that grades from this year are not worth the same as last year. This has not been announced officially. It also means that this year's students will come up against those who may have taken a gap year when applying for university places. These students will have comparatively higher grades. In short it will make any comparison between this year and older years, based on GCSEs, unfair.\r\n\r\nThis petition seeks to have either the grade boundary changes revoked, or for it to be officially recognised that grades from this year are worth more than last year's.\r\n",
