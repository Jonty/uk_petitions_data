        "additional_details": "A loophole in the law is allowing Trade Unions to call for strikes without majority support. As long as the Trade Unions gain a majority support at the ballot, they can go on strike regardless of what the turnout is.\r\n\r\nThis has lead to Trade Unions putting pressure on members opposing a strike to abstain from the vote, causing a victory from a majority in a very low turnout even though they have not won the vote of the majority of members.\r\n\r\nThese laws need reforming and my suggestion would be to have a minimum turnout of 50% and then a Qualified Majority (62%) in favour of the strike.",
