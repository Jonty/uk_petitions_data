        "additional_details": "Since 1999 average house prices have increased at a rate of FOUR TIMES that of the average salary.\r\n The average worker now cannot afford the average home. Since it's inception, right to buy has helped more than 2 million people buy their homes, but only 344,000 new council houses have been built in that same time. There are currently 400,000 new council houses that have been approved planning permission but have not been built. We would like to see the council housing development program reinvigorated, These 400,000 houses built and twice as many again built, to replace those sold off through right to buy, and the right to buy scheme itself reworked to ensure that as well as providing assistance to tenants to buy their homes, it also provides a sustainable and profitable program to the government, and also provides a competitor to private residential housing to help maintain housing costs at a level that matches earnings",
