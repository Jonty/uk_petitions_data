Any HMG that makes the blunder of allowing hundreds of thousands of undesirable & illegitimate immigrants into UK permanently is incompetent & definitely do not deserve to be in government. Whatever benefits of toned-down passports checks on a \u2018profit and loss\u2019 balance sheet, UK will lose as a result of illegitimate immigrants allowed to enter & remain in UK forever. This will then increase the demand on resources like health, education, housing, social benefits, law & order by immigrants & their family members. Immigrants would serve their own self-serving perceived cultural needs (thus requiring more foreign cooks, spouses, religious leaders, elders etc), adding to congestions & queues in UK. Immigrants would also serve the self-serving interests of their extensive overseas relatives, cousins & countrymen. This is a vicious circle, changing the future demographics, identity, cultural background & security of UK forever.",
