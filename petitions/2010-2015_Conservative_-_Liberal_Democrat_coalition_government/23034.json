        "additional_details": "Given the current of 2.62 million unemployed, new work permits should only be issued to recognised world experts with current know-how in their respective fields (like PhDs, professors) in science & engineering. The previous HMG promised \u2018British jobs for British people\u2019 yet they issued work permits to foreigners at the \u2018drop of a hat\u2019, including to non-professional workers (like nannies, waiters, care workers, etc) employed by private organisations (like nursing homes, nursing agencies, restaurants, hotels). Clearly work permits are open to abuse by economic migrants & their extended family members to immigrate legally & permanently into UK. Many nurses in UK, for example, are finding it hard to get jobs, thanks to the lack of immigration control for foreign nurses (& doctors) over the years. Many foreign nurses in nursing homes are sometimes paid less by their proprietors than for UK nurses, thus eventually lowering wages & job opportunities of UK nurses. ",
