        "additional_details": "The stunning performances by our Olympic Athletes in the 2012 Summer Olympics are being rewarded by their faces being put on new stamps.  This is not enough.\r\n\r\nMany other countries are also providing a financial reward.  Our athletes deserve the same.  This is especially true of the less well-financed sports such as shooting, canoeing and weight lifting, but should also extend to all of our other winners.\r\n\r\nI suggest the following tiers of payment:\r\nGold - \u00a3100,000\r\nSilver - \u00a375,000\r\nBronze - \u00a350,000\r\n\r\nThis small token (in Government terms), would not only provide additional support to our athletes, but give the nation more of a feeling that they have been rewarded for their huge efforts.",
