The Sentencing Coucil purports to promote public confidence in the justice system but the opposite has been achieved as public perception is that sentences are being 'watered down'.  I seek public support for the abolition of the Sentencing Council and the sentencing guidelines they promote. This will allow judges discretion  to use full power of existing laws, save money and restore confidence in British justice.\r\n",
