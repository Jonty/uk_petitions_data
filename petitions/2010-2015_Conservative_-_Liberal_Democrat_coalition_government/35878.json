        "additional_details": "The signatories hereby petition for reform of the House of Lords. It is to be replaced by a fixed four year term, 100 member chamber. Candidates will be elected from a fully open list. Political parties are to have no say on the drawing up of the candidates list and there will be no Lords Spiritual.  Members of the second chamber will not be eligible to hold government office; i.e. they cannot be Ministers, or Secretaries of State. All members will be subject to recall and expense claims will be available for public scrutiny. Any member proved to have falsified their expense claim, or of committing a serious criminal offence will be ejected from the chamber and have to reapply for inclusion on the candidate list at the next election.\r\nWe want real democracy and honest representatives.",
