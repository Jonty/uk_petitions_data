        "additional_details": "There has been much media attention on this subject, more innocent families are put through child care proceedings mainly due to negligence on behalf of the NHS. Family law is guilty until proven innocent but combined with an unjust system, if you admit to abuse the child is returned and social care work with you, if you can't or don't you are treated like scum and the parties stack everything against you with threats to remove the child, most of the time the child ends up in foster care and the police involved sometimes with convictions. Medical experts have to be jointly instructed and 99% of the time they all agree on one concencous. The whole system is hell bent on removing children from innocent families, there has to be a change to clearly define boundries between abusive and non-abusive families, at the moment its black and white. If you get dragged into this scenario you face a battle of a lifetime against the odds to prove your innocence and re-unite your family.",
