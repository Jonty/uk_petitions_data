        "additional_details": "How could it ever be in the public interest to imprison anyone over the age of 70 years? The current spate of self interest associated with \"historic trials and imprisonment\" of 70 & 80 year old calls to mind the absurdity of this punishment. It is enough to convict them but why send them to jail. Of course let the law take it's course but commute the sentence rather than spend public money to keep them in prison and occupy the spaces needed for more dangerous and vicious offenders.",
