        "additional_details": "The abolition of the monarchy must be brought about as expediently as is possible. It is an undemocratic anachronism, that is both expensive and discriminatory. The UK is currently one of forty four countries that has a monarchy, whilst there are 152 countries which do not have a monarchy. This e-petition acknowledges that the monarchy is not the direct responsibility of the Cabinet office; however, it seemed the most appropriate choice, given the options. ",
