There have been attempts to help by spreading out winter payments but the fact is: they still have to pay whether it is delayed, spread or not.\r\n\r\nA recent survey indicated that as many as 427,000 house-holds in the over 70s group are financially vulnerable.\r\n\r\nI propose a scheme with the following:\r\n * Participants must be over 70 and have a minimum income.\r\n * The payments are fixed for life.\r\n * The payments are the same each month.\r\n * Actual KWh does not have an impact.",
