        "additional_details": "Reconsider the decision for majority of commercial and 4 x 4 diesel vehicles registered before 01st January 2006, to have to comply with strict European low emission laws. This will impact many small businesses. Phase 4 of the scheme is scheduled to start in January 2012 and will affect  up to 90,000 smaller vehicles, including vans and minibuses. A daily charge of \u00a3100 is due to be imposed on those that did not meet the emissions standards. Failure to pay will incur a \u00a3500 fine for each day that the vans enter the zone, which covers the Greater London area. It is not the right time to press ahead with extending it in the current economic downturn.\r\n\r\nMany of these will be owned by small businesses,  and self-employed Londoners.\r\n\r\nSimply put - you will have to either sell your vehicle and replace it with a newer model, or have costly filters fitted which take up to 3 months to order.\r\nRefer to the following website:\r\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/lez/17678.aspx\r\n\r\n\r\n",
