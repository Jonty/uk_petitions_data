        "additional_details": "On 29th July 2011 it was announced that the rights of Formula One would be shared with Sky Sports. The contract for the rights was the sole responsibility of the BBC and was five year deal from 2009. Therefore the current deal has been completed before the current contract has ended.\r\n\r\nThe new deal consists of all races shown live on Sky Sports and only 10 of the races to be shown live on the BBC the remainder of of the season would be shown as highlights.\r\n\r\nPlease find the proposed deal which was originally reported in the Mirror newspaper which has now been removed. This was not considered as an option and would ensure that Formula One remained free to air for all.\r\nhttp://m.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a334793/channel-4s-failed-formula-one-bid-revealed.html ",
