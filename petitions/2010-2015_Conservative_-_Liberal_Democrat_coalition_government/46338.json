        "additional_details": "We strongly object to the government\u2019s proposed new history curriculum and want it to be scrapped on the following grounds:\r\n1) An almost exclusively British history course encourages insularity, needlessly narrows the horizons of pupils and is a poor preparation for later life.\r\n2) The content of the course is impractical to deliver, dry and likely to disengage pupils from history.\r\n3) The proposals have been made without adequate consultation with professionals.\r\n4) The use of the education system to promote a nationalist political agenda will stop history being a vehicle for teaching critical thought and is an assault on academic freedom.",
