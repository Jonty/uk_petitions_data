        "additional_details": "Domestic glue traps are currently on general sale throughout the UK, marketed as a DIY means of administering rodent pest control.\r\n\r\nComprising of a simple cardboard or plastic strip coated in a strong adhesive, the glue trap is designed to ensnare mice and other small creatures, resulting in untold physical suffering and a needlessly lingering and tortuous death.\r\n\r\nVarious animal welfare groups are vociferously opposed to the sale and use of glue traps in the UK and the RSPCA has previously attempted to make representations to Parliament on the introduction of an outright ban.\r\n\r\nGlue traps have already been outlawed in the Republic of Ireland and a growing number of other countries around the world, therefore we, the undersigned, request that the Government considers the introduction of an outright ban on the sale and use of glue traps in the United Kingdom.\r\n",
