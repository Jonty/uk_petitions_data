Tourism is the life and soul of the Egyptians, Please help bringing tourists back to Egypt.\r\nEgypt is a country of very friendly, generous and hospitable people, a stroll through the narrow alleys of cairo, away from the tourist areas, is the best way to realize how nice the average Egyptian is. Hardly a person does not say \"welcome\" or offer to help. People seem to genuinely appreciate a foreigner walking through their streets and shopping where they shop.\r\nIn Egypt, a crime is something that you did, but it is debatable whether it has to be punished or excused. Of course, a great advantage is that \"real\" crime (as in theft, rape and murder) is virtually inexistent. The average \"crime\" committed by a citizen is to break a regulation (such as traffic rules). Generally speaking, one gets a feeling of \"freedom\" while walking around Cairo. ",
