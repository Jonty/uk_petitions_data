With voter turn outs lamentably low it is becoming apparent that changes must be made to the way in which English citizens vote. This tyranny of the minority can not be tolerated any longer and this one puts it down to the fact there is little to no emphasis on the importance of voting and representative democracy. This one proposes that the government introduce legislature that would make it illegal not to vote. Citizens who do not wish to vote for any party should still be required to vote, however, they should be free to have the choice on the ballot paper to not vote for any party. ",
