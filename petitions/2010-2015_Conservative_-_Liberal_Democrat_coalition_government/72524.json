        "additional_details": "The recent incidents occurring up and down the country, due to black Friday event have been shocking. Reports of people being trampled on, many injured and even a 9 year old boy punched in the face\r\nBy allowing this reckless practice we risk people being seriously injured or even killed.\r\n\r\nI propose that stores keep Black Friday exclusively to online. This way customers still get the bargains they desire and the retailers get rid themselves of unwanted stock",
