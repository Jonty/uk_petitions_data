They are also sold from breeders to un checked owners who again may not treat them with the rights they deserve.\r\n\r\nWe need to take action to stop such irresponsible breeding, selling and rehoming of animals. Why should poor defenceless animals be suffering and continually being bred from when there are millions of animals in shelters across the uk!\r\n\r\nHELP STOP THIS NOW!!",
