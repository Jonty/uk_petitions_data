        "additional_details": "The Foreign Aid budget should remain at 0.7% of GDP and an additional 0.3% of GDP should be used as a foreign investment scheme which if successful should increase by 0.1% for the next 5 years whilst at the same time the Foreign Aid budget should be reduced by 0.05% for the next four years to 0.5% with the option of reviewing the budget every four years. The Foreign Investment scheme would be used to support small to medium British businesses expanding abroad in poor developing countries by offering several bursaries a year in return for a 10% stake of their annual profits for 5 to 10 years depending on the size and success of business. This scheme will be designed to reduce some of the immigration as it will provide stable jobs and communities and reduce poverty in LEDs as well as create national and global economic growth which will stem the need for spending cuts as well as provide funds for further investment programmes in the UK.",
