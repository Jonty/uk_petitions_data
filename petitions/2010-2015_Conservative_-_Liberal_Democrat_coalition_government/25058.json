        "additional_details": "We the undersigned commend the Italian Prime Minister Mario MONTO who has just announced, as part of his austerity measures that he will not take his salary (for being Prime Minister) as a gesture to the Italian people that they \"are all in this together\".\r\n\r\nGiven the severe financial re-structuring that the UK government assert is necessary, we the undersigned would like to see similar measures relating to both salaries and pensions of government ministers in order to demonstrate similar character and leadership from all cabinet ministers but especially from the Prime Minister, David Cameron, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne and the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Iain Duncan-Smith.\r\n\r\nGiven that accommodation goes with the job, as do plenty of meals, do they really need more than an MP's salary, could they not forego part or all of their ministerial salary?",
