        "additional_details": "The judicial system has become too soft on young offenders. The rights of the criminal often seem to trump the right to a peaceful existence for the law abiding majority. The undersigned require HM Government to enact the reinstatement of borstal detention for violent young offenders. For the safety of the community, they should be removed from the areas where they have committed crimes into places where the emphasis is on the education, training and moral influence, conducive to their reformation and the prevention of crime. In the new borstals the regime should be highly regulated, with a focus on routine, discipline and respect for authority. There should be a zero tolerance on drugs, strict uniform rules, minimal visitation rights and no access to technology of any kind. Failure to comply with the regime should be met with extended sentences and in the worst cases prison.",
