        "additional_details": "CRB checks render the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1978 completely worthless. Once a conviction is spent under the Act, it should be spent, full stop, no exceptions. CRB highlights all the wrongs of someone's life from 30 years ago while ignoring all the good they have done since then. Because of CRB there is no such thing as a spent conviction so people who smoked a joint aged 16 are stigmatised forever and are completely unemployable for any jobs requiring a CRB check. For people considered very dangerous, they should be banned from working with vulnerable people and/or children - such a list already exists, and any conviction over 30 months' imprisonment is never spent anyway so would have to be declared even without CRB, so this should suffice, there is NO need for CRB checks, they are intrusive and paint false pictures of good people.",
