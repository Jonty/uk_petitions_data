We are hearing that things are getting better but for the average person on the street, they are not.\r\nA reduction in the amount of VAT we all pay on goods would give everyone the confidence to spend a little more.\r\nEven a 2.5% reduction would go a long way to helping people who are struggling to get by in daily life. A 5% reduction would be even better.\r\nCome on - give us all a break and reduce VAT - it's the sensible thing to do to get the economy moving properly again instead of stalling.\r\n\r\n",
