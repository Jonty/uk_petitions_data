You wait forever after a claim but this isn't explained when you are sold insurance. This amongst hundreds of other negatives is all IN THE SMALL PRINT! Small print is full of ifs,buts and maybes all favouring the insurance company! It should be law that when you are sold a policy all aspects good and bad should be explained in full. IN NORMAL SIZE PRINT NOT SMALL PRINT. Members of the public please stop insurance companies being a law unto themselves and robbing us day in day out. No what you are buying before parting with your money! ",
