        "additional_details": "Due to there being no provision for 24/7 child and adolescent mental health care in Hull I have to travel over 60 miles to visit my autistic daughter who is currently receiving treatment under a section 3 of the mental health act . Should anything happen it would take me over 60 minutes to reach her. No parent should be so far from their child while they are in hospital/care. This is NOT acceptable. I demand the Ministry of Health and National health Uk review the provision available and reinstate 24/7 care in Hull for children. ",
