I believe not as we are a country which strongly supports human rights!\r\nAs an MEDC we should not be taking advantage of 3rd world countries when we must be helping them rise above the poverty line.\r\nWe must get together and 'name and shame' those businesses to stop there unrighteous acts. We can stop Sweatshops and encourage fair trade!\r\nWE MUST STAND TOGETHER AND REMIND EVERYONE WHAT WE ARE KNOWN FOR... EQUALITY!",
