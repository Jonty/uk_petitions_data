        "additional_details": "I would like the government to introduce a penalty similar to that which the police have of obstructing them in the course of their duty for ambulance crews which don't have any protection whatsoever. An ambulance crew go out to a job without knowing what they will find. There have been two incidents in the news recently where crew members have been attacked and injured, both by drunken patients. This is unacceptable, and violence towards crews should not be tolerated in any form.",
