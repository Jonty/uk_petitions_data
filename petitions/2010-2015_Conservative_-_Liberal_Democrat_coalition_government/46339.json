I remember going there as a child with my aunty  to fill up her old renault car backin The early  80s\r\nits one of the friendliest garages iv ever known   as well as the busy mechanical side of the business it is one of the only garages that will actually offer to fill yr car up FOR you which for some is a godsend.  whenever you go there  you are greeted by a friendly face and all the staff go out of their way  to help.\r\nPlease sign this petition to save yet another small business from disappearing and putting more people out of work.\r\nThank you ",
