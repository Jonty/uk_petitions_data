It seems like all the current Government wants to do is make the whole country suffer at the cost of reducing the deficit. Regardless whether or not it needs paying off is not really the fault of taxpayers and because of this we do not see why that schools, hospitals, and every other public sector department are being made to \"pay the price\" because David Cameron and Nick Clegg are useless. By signing this petition we call for the Labour party to take over with immediate effect and sort this mess out that the Con-Dem Government have made.",
