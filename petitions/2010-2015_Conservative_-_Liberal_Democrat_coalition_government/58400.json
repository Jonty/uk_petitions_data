        "additional_details": "It is noticeable that ALL the people who make these decisions are LEAST affected by those decisions because none of them pay tax on all of the benefits they receive because they have voted for it to be that way.  There are NO standard rate taxpayers in the decision making group and therefore the ONLY people worst affected by the decisions are excluded from the decision making process.  In this day and age this CANNOT be an honest situation because the decision makers know that whatever they decide to do will have no effect upon them.  THIS HAS TO CHANGE AND ONLY THOSE WITH AN INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME - STANDARD RATE TAXPAYERS - SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS.",
