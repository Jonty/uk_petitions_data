This effectively means that those wealthy enough to own multiple properties can tax those without either the income or savings to buy a home.\r\n\r\nTwo tier Capital Gains tax would tax more heavily those safe investments (properties), increasing government revenues. This would allow the government to lower capital gains on business investments. This would decrease business reliance on a strained banking sector and encourage people to invest is the small business round the corner that could be working on the next big thing.\r\n\r\nLets innovate out of this recession, not ride the property bubble wave that serves only the wealthy and perhaps MP's.",
