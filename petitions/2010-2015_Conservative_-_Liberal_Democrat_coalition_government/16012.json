        "additional_details": "Currently The Royal National Lifeboat Institution  receives no funding from the UK government and relies on more than 40,000 volunteers. To many people this is an incredibly frustrating situation given the obscene amount of money the government wastes each year, grossly overpriced IT projects and premium rate calls to the speaking clock being just a few examples that we have seen of late. Given government funding the RNLI could focus more of its resources on saving lives and helping ensure our coastline remains safe not just for the residents of coastal areas but for the many thousands of people who visit them each and every year. To date the RNLI has saved more than 139,000 lives, a remarkable feat given their current methods of funding. Imagine how many lives they could save given the funding they so readily deserve.",
