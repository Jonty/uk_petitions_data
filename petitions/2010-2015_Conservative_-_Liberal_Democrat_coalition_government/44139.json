        "additional_details": "A penalty charge notice (PCN) may be issued if a local authority ot their agent believes you have parked your car in contravention to local rules. The recipient has to right to go to a tribuneral where an independent adjudicator will decide if the PCN was correctly issued.\r\nIf the PCN was wrongfully issued then the recpient has no right to claim any of their out of pocket expenses - time and expenses gathering evidence and/or attending the tribuneral for example. All other parties present at a tribuneral are actually getting paid to be there.\r\nGiven that more than half of all these tribunerals go in the favour of the motorist and that PCN's are usually (if not always) issued by non-law enforcement officers (quite often private, profit driven companies) I believe that the government should require local authorities to cover the reasonable epenses of innocent motorists.",
