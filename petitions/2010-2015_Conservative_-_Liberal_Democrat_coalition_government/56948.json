People in Whitehall will never understand what this marine has been through seeing his comrades being killed and then there body parting hanging in trees! This marine should be show dignity and respect for him willing to lay down his life for another politician wanting war! This government shows no leadership to the forces, undermanned, under funding, job cuts, and when something goes wrong the shutters come down! The Geneva Convention needs to be changed as this will have a massive impact of our fighting forces!",
