        "additional_details": "My son has autism and is in receipt of disability living allowance, which was paid to me, his mother and legal guardian since his birth. I have been told however that I am no longer able to receive the money on my sons behalf, unless I am appointed as his legal guardian for this purpose by an officer from the DWP, because he has turned 16 and once a child turns 16 they are considered to be responsible for their own affairs, even though my son is not classed as an adult in this country until he is 18. This is also true for other child benefits which is why they stop at 16. The legal age of an adult in the UK is 18 and it is only when they are 18 that they can legally vote. I am petitioning the government to change this ridiculous policy, so that parents of children do not lose the right to represent their children at the age of 16 and that benefits for children are not stopped at age 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
