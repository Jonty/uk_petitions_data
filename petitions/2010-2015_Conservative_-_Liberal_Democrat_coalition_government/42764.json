        "action": "'Pylon Power', solves UK energy crisis",
        "additional_details": "This petition proposes that National Grid be required to utilise the national pylon network for the generation and distribution of wind and solar energy.\r\nThere are in the region of 80,000 pylons which could be capable of producing the entire country's electricity need. Simply, cheaply and with little or no environmental impact.\r\nVertical axis wind generators and solar panels would be placed on viable pylons and linked to the grid for distribution purposes.\r\nThe benefits are many and the cost would be small in comparison to building new wind farms.",
