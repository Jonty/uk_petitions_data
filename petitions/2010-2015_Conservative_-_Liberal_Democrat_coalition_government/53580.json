        "additional_details": "Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law one of the most draconian anti-gay laws on the planet. The law permits the detention of foreigners for up to 14 days and expulsion from the country for promoting the rights of the LGBT community. It has also come to light that a Neo Nazi group is operating in the country and is torturing and abusing young LGBT people with no threat of arrest from the Russian authorities who simply turn a blind eye. Russians have also recently been beaten up in Moscow just for 'looking' gay.\r\n\r\nThat is why We, the undersigned, want the British Government to take a stand against the Russian authorities by trying to take away the Winter Olmpics 2014 from them in the first instance, and secondly we want a trade embargo putting in place that will ensure that no commerce is conducted with Russia until this draconian and evil law is repealed.",
