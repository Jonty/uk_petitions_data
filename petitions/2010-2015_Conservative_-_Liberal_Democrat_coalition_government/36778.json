        "additional_details": "The government needs to amend the existing law that limits the height of bamboo hedges by including bamboo in the existing legal legislation limiting the height of conifer and other boundary hedges, fences and walls.\r\nBamboo is an evasive plant that grows rapidly as a hedge to the roof level of two storey houses and is so dense that it produces a screen that cuts out all light. It can also damage adjoining property by penetrating walls, concrete and cause subsidence.\r\nBamboo is not included in current legislation because it is classified as a grass which is botanically correct but does not take into account its capability to form a dense hedge which garden centres have noticed and now market bamboo specifically for hedging causing problems with neighbours throughout the country.",
