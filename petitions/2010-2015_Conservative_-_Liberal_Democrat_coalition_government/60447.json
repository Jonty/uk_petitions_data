        "additional_details": "I agree that everyone is entitled to an opinion, but before that opinion is broadcast, its relevance should be taken into consideration and Katie Hopkins is being used as media propaganda to create a bigger rift between the classes by raising issues such as names, weight, diet, profession, and money to name just a few. Acts like she should win mum of the year but probably spends more time on tv than with her children. The government is doing more than enough to cause an unnecessary class divide as it is without people like Katie being used in the media to make it worse and preventing this should be a starting point.",
