        "additional_details": "The UK Government should ban GMO food from being produced in the UK and being imported into the UK.\r\n\r\nNumerous studies show the damage that GMO food causes. Its effecting our health, plants, animals, soil, air, water and the entire eco system. Without clean water, soil, food and air everyone will die. There will be no world for the future generations to live in, and the current generation will just try to survive in a toxic world.\r\n\r\nTo save your future, your families and friends future and to save the planet.... please sign this petition.\r\n\r\nGMO's are toxic and killing people and this is fact. We can do two things about it\r\n1) Nothing\r\nor\r\n2) Something to stop this criminality\r\n\r\nI prefer the second option and by starting this petition at least I can say I tried something to stop this wrong doing. Please join me and sign this petition, the future will thank you for it. ",
