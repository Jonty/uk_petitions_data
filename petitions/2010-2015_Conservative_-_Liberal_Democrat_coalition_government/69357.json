        "additional_details": "Our intention with this petition is to ensure not only criminals but also victims both get equal and fair representation in the judicial system, As it stands, only criminals are entitled to free legal aid which means the victims of serious crimes are left in many instances relying on their own personal funding to fight for justice. This seems very unjust when it is victims and their families in the cases of unjust trials, in particular in the case of murder and manslaughter, which are left having to rely on personal funding to fight for re-trial to get justice. We just want government tax payers funding to be allocated equally between both defendants and prosecutors. ",
