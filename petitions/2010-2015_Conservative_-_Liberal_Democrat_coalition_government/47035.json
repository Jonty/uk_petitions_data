        "additional_details": "I propose we follow the likes of Ireland and have a blanket ban on all benefits for a period of two years, this would include EU Citizens, if someone cannot maintain themselves for this period of time we should not have to pick up the cost of their lifestyle change. We should encourage people with money of their own to come here. This would ease many already overstreched services. If a small country like Ireland can enforce this law it should be easy for the UK.",
