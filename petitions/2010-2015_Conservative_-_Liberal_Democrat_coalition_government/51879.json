        "additional_details": "Ant n' Dec have been on tv and in the public eye for a very long time and deserve a nice long rest a.k.a retirement, so who better to replace them than two very knowledgeable people.\r\nThe first is already one of her majesty's subjects, the latter is a subject to all of Jim's requests, together they have gone above and beyond the call of duty to make \"Podtoid\" the internet's #1 Willem Defoe and Gordon Ramsay Appreciation Podcast sending both of these gentlemen's careers to new heights.\r\nSelfless and always outgoing Holmes and Sterling are not only wonderful orators but they are great minds as well with TV and movie ideas literally oozing out of their pores which would of course save expenses on writers as well as talent because Gordon Ramsay and Willem Defoe would be the only full time contracts since Jonathan takes pleasure from behind the curtain and being in Jim's aura whilst Mr Sterling finds solace in giving it to him.",
