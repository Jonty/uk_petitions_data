        "additional_details": "Cornwall County Council have instigated drastic cuts to Bus Services in Cornwall, specifically to Supported Services in Rural Areas. West Penwith will lose one bus operator and many of it's rural routes, although there are many other Rural Communities within Cornwall who will also suffer such cuts. This is due to a cut in subsidy from The Government. To drastically cut rural supported bus services will cause unemployment, lower employment prospects,damage the local economies of Rural Communities and has the potential to cause social exclusion for many people living in these areas. I want the Government to  re-instate with immediate effect, the supported services subsidies paid to Cornwall Council for public bus transport to a financially appropriate level to which Bus Companies can then continue to provide rural bus services to the areas of Cornwall affected.",
