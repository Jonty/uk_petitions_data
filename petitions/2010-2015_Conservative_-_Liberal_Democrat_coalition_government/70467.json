        "additional_details": "My 7 year old son was stabbed with a dirty used needle behind our house . He was taken to A&E where he was given blood tests for HIV which needs to be repeated in 6 months so we are looking at at least a year wait to see if he gets the all clear! He had to have a hepB vaccination which he will need again in November and April 2015! He also now has to have antibiotics 3 times daily for a week. .. If he does catch something there is no way of finding out who left the needle! So there will be no one held accountable for what happened to my son.  Im petitioning for all needles that are given out be barcoded so left needles can be traced back .. because someone carelessly left behind our lives are in Limbo for a year. Needle awareness needs to be as well taught as road safety amd stranger danger!!",
