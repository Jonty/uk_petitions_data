        "additional_details": "In recent weeks, the Russian government has enacted legislation that has made homosexuality effectively illegal - and punishable by significant fines and/or jail time.\r\n\r\nRussian Neo-Nazis, Militias and Gangs are using this hostile legal climate as an excuse to rape, torture and murder LGBT Russians in increasing numbers. The government and police are reported to either be participating directly or electing not to stop vigilantes from committing these atrocities.\r\n\r\nWe ask the home office to accept Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Russians as Refugees based on this systemic violence and persecution.\r\n",
