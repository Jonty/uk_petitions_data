        "additional_details": "There is a Craze at the moment  for people to make Crystalised Dummies, made from a varied assortment of gems and crystals and glue of various descriptions..\r\nThese are a posing a danger to young babies and children using them as the glue compostion is often broken down with saliva and being ingested, and gemstones becoming lose and getting inhaled.\r\nObviously there is a risk of the baby being poisoned by the glue or choking on a gemstone all for the sake of parents wanting them to look pretty!\r\nAlot of the online businesses selling these think they are getting around not having the product safety tested by claiming they are a keepsake only, but parents often dont understand the risk thinking the product they are buying is safe.\r\nI am campaigning to make it illegal to sell these things for the safety of babies and children.\r\n",
