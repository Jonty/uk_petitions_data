        "additional_details": "SMA is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that in every pregnancy there is a 1\r\nin 4 chance of the child being affected by SMA, One in 40 people carry the gene, do you know if your a carrier? Can you take the risk? My beautiful son Alfie passed away at just age 6 weeks because of this awful disease. We want the government to ensure that every woman is offered free genetic screening for this disease in the same way that they are currently offered screening for cervical cancer. This one off blood test should be provided for free to all women. Every 8 hours a baby with SMA is born, every 7 hours a baby dies because of SMA, Don't let that happen to you!",
