        "additional_details": "Childrens ears should not be pierced until they are old enough to be able to consent to the procedure themselves. Infants are a vulnerable group who cannot speak up for themselves and this makes it an appropriate area for legislation. In addition:\r\n1) It provides no health benefit.\r\n2) It Increases the risk of infection.\r\n3) The earrings can present a choking hazard.\r\n4) It inflicts unnecessary pain on the child.\r\n5) It takes away an individuals right (the babies) to choose whether their body is permanently scarred in this manner.\r\n6) The piercings can end up lop-sided and uneven as young infants are more likely to move during the procedure.\r\n7) At such a young age the ears are not yet fully formed, meaning that the piercings can migrate to a position which is not visually pleasing when they grow older.\r\n8) The individual will never be able to remove the scars that were made on their body without their consent.",
