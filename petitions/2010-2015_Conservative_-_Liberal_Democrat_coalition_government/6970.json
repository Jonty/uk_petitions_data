        "additional_details": "\r\n\r\nResponsible department: Department for Transport\r\n\r\nThe current laws together with the seemingly endless list of technicalities allows insurance companies to charge extortionate premiums over details such as a persons post code based on their crime or accident rating. The current rule is however grossly unjust as citizens are required by law to be insured and stay insured, however the insurance premiums are set by private companies who are only concerned about their bottom line and with the law on their side can set their premiums as high as they please. I propose that the government impose these limits making them more realistic about just how much low earners, student, young drivers, etc, can actually afford rather than the current situation which seems to be designed to only serve the interests of the insurance companies and not the public.",
