        "additional_details": "Although mainly rejected in the UK, Nottingham is still home to this business.\r\nHooters is all part of the normalisation of the sexual objectification of women, and a business of general immodesty. The men, women and children of this country deserve better than the sexual commodities that come alongside this business.\r\nIt's about time the industry and society grew up, the idea is outdated and generally degrading for women. If media didn't make it hard enough, franchises such as this highlight the idea of 'ideal' women with strict criteria of body size and shape that are 'attractive'. How do you want your daughters, wives, mothers and sisters to feel? Like they must compare themselves to this fabricated ideal? Comparisons like this cross every woman's mind at some point in her life. With businesses like this why wouldn't they?\r\nHooters needs to close in the UK for good.\r\nWe need to get rid of gender stereotypes one step at a time.",
