        "additional_details": "Diabetes affects around 2.9 million people In the UK and is predicted to rise to 5 million before 2025 (Quality and Outcomes Framework 2012). This is not just a chronic medical condition but can have adverse affects on an individual's psychological wellbeing. For instance the prevalence of major depressive disorder for individuals with diabetes is double of the general population (Anderson et al 2001). This is problematic as depression not only affects an individual's quality of life but has been linked to developing physical health complications which is problematic for the individual and the NHS (de Groot et al 2001) Despite this knowledge detection of depression is hampered in clinical practice and many psychological problems go undetected (Anderson 2001). Therefore, screening for conditions like depression should be incorporated as standard into clinical practice to ensure mental health problems do not go undetected in this vulnerable population. ",
