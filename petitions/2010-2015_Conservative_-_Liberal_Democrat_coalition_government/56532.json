I have had a notice by post stating that I now owe \u00a319.21 in import tax, fine. The notice also surprisingly informs me that Parcelforce have without permission paid the tax and will be charging me a 70% interest fine ('admin/clearance' charge) for the privilege. This is a wholly unacceptable and extortionate charge and would not be allowed under the Postal Act.    ",
