        "action": "Scrap the law which allows only condensing boilers in British homes",
        "additional_details": "The 2005 law that all new central heating boilers must be condensing types should be repealed.\r\n1.Gas usage may be reduced by \u00a3200 a year by a new boiler costing \u00a32000 \u2013 but these boilers may only last five years.\r\n2.Conventional boilers last twenty years \u2013 so the overall manufacturing carbon footprint is far lower.  A saving on gas of \u00a34000 is offset by replacement costs of \u00a36000-\u00a38000.\r\n3.The new boilers break down in cold weather. During one cold snap British Gas had 60,000 emergency calls in just one county.\r\n4.If the existing boiler is not on an outside wall \u2013 or that wall backs onto a neighbour\u2019s property \u2013 the new boiler must be re-sited, which can cost \u00a35000. Dispensation to fit a new conventional one is almost impossible to obtain.\r\nThis law enables British Gas to increase its vast profits. People are persuaded during the annual service to fit a new boiler.\r\nThe law should be scrapped, not reliable, long lasting, conventional boilers.\r\nReference:  thisismoney.co.uk\r\n",
