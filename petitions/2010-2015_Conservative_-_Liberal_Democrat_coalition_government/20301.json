        "additional_details": "This e-petition calls for the immediate repealing of Sections 2 and 3 of the European Communities Act 1972. This would remove any further imposition of EU directives or other EU law into UK law. This would also support the Coalition stance that they want the UK in the EU but not controlled by the EU. Failure to do this would confirm that the Conservative led UK coalition government is interested only in becoming a full member of the EU.",
