        "additional_details": "The population of the UK is growing and accelerating. These people will need energy, food, water, education, employment and financial support, at the very least. Our population will certainly peak bringing with it undesirable consequences.\r\n\r\nThis will put major strains on our already wilting economic system and will effect every member of the population as resources are shared.\r\n\r\nPlease, consider with an open mind what we must do to halt or slow this growth.\r\n\r\nI suggest, with no pride, that we implement such a policy in the United Kingdom. It is popular knowledge that the idle and unemployed who contribute little or nothing to society have far more children than the hard working and successful. Which of course drains the capacity of our social services.\r\n\r\nA One-child policy will enable further economic growth and better living conditions for the existing population, also securing our dwindling resources for generations to come.",
