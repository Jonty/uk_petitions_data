I.e physically able, academically capable of completing the national curriculum.\r\n\r\nStudent with ASD are expected to attend main stream primary and secondary schools with support of LSA's as they can do the academic work. However this fails to address the social , sensory and emotional difficulties these students face.\r\n\r\nSpecialist schools have an individual need approach to students with autism and the department of education needs to expand the services of specialist schools to include high functioning students, who cannot cope with mainstream school approach to education.\r\n\r\n",
