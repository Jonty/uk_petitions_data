This is absolutely disgusting. What message does this send to people committing the same sort of vile offences and ruining childrens lives forever? He has blamed his wife's cancer for committing this vile crime. Hundreds of people are diagnosed with cancer every day but there is no excuse what so ever for this disturbing and life destroying behaviour. On behalf of all the innocent children in these images we must stand up and voice our disgust on their behalf. There is also no reference to him being put on the Sex Offenders register. ",

If you believe a sentence given in a Crown Court appears to be very low, or unduly lenient, anyone can contact the Attorney General's office asking for the sentence to be reviewed as long as it is within 28 days of sentencing.\r\n\r\nIt also only takes one person to make such a request. In the case of Dennis Igo he was sentenced for an offence that does not fall within the unduly lenient scheme and it is therefore not possible for the Law Officers to refer the case to the Court of Appeal."
