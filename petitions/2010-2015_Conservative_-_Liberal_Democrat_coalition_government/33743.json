        "additional_details": "Authority for setting public sector remuneration packages has been devolved to the point where local authorities, government departments, quangos and other tax-funded bodies have total freedom to set whatever packages they see fit.\r\nPushing up salaries at lower levels is self-serving for those higher up in the organisation, supposedly justifying their own unrealistic levels of remuneration.\r\nPayment of so-called performance bonuses set by themselves against their own targets is simply a means of further rewarding people for doing their jobs. They are also a means of getting around pay freezes.\r\nAt best this is slack government and at worst it is misappropriation of hard-earned taxes.\r\nGovernment needs to recover central control over the setting of remuneration packages based on realistic and well-founded job evaluation tecniques providing fair pay for a fair day's work.",
