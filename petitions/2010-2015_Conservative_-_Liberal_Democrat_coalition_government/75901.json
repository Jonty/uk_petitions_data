        "additional_details": "The QE2 (Queen Elizabeth 2) was an ocean liner of England's most recognised shipping line, Cunard.\r\nShe was named after our monarch and is currently sat rotting in Dubai. She served in the falklands war as a troop carrier and helped our country greatly. She is the longest serving ocean liner (total service of 39 years).\r\nIf this petition is successful, the QE2 would make a perfect testament to Liverpool or Southamptons shipping history. She could become a museum, hotel, conference centre and offices all at the same time. Which would bring tourists and businesses into the area where she is, meaning jobs, and extra money in the local economy.",
