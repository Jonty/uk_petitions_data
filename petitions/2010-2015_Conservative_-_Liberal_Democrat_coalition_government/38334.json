        "additional_details": "A recent investigation by BBC has revealed that the British government has failed to freeze assets linked to former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his regime.\r\nIt took Switzerland 30 minutes after Mubarak was toppled to begin freezing the former Egyptian regime\u2019s assets, freezing almost \u00a3500m to date. In contrast, the UK took 37 days to begin freezing assets and has so far frozen less than \u00a3100m-none of which has been returned to Egypt.\r\nWhilst the levels of poverty in Egypt relentlessly increased, the corrupt and powerful elite embezzled the nation\u2019s riches. The Foreign Office has voiced its support for the popular revolution in Egypt yet the British government has not followed this up with any tangible action.\r\nWe urge both Foreign Office and Treasury department to cooperate with the Egyptian government and freeze these assets and help return the money back to the Egyptian people.",
