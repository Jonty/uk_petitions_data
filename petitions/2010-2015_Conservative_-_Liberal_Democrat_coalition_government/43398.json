These brave men suffered at the hands of the Taliban the same as our troops and should be given support to settle in the UK when we draw back from Afghanistan. Doing nothing will leave them in a position where the government think they are spies for the west and the Taliban think they are collaborators with the enemy. These men have suffered with our boys I've seen it first hand. This needs to happen it did in Iraq but this is more urgent!  ",
