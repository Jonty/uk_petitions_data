        "additional_details": "Sign the petition to encourage and emphasise the use of waterways.\r\n\r\nSign for the government to create more waterways in the UK. Due to housing shortages and the difficulty first time buyers are having entering the property market this will give them a chance. Instead of building unattractive modern housing estates build new waterways and moorings.\r\n\r\nI believe it should be in the governents interest to maintain existing waterways as it gives people a chance to explore areas of natural beauty around the UK.\r\n\r\nCreating Marinas or moorings can benefit local towns and villages. It will boost local business and it is not an eyesore for the local population.",
