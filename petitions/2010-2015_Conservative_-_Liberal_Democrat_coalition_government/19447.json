        "additional_details": "We believe that the Government should legalise the use and possession of Cannabis, as well as its sale for specially licenses shops (the licenses would be awarded by the Government in a similar fashion to the procedure for the sale of alcohol). We believe that Cannabis should be restricted to those aged 18 and over.\r\n\r\nIt is highly debated as to whether Cannabis causes actual physical harm. Even if it does, it certainly causes less harm than alcohol and tobacco- both legal substances.\r\n\r\nCannabis has useful medicinal uses.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we believe that Cannabis has no significant negative effect on scoiety in general; it is not addictive and it does not cause crime like Heroin, Cocaine and Alcohol. In a free society such as ours, a mentally healthy adult has the right to smoke Cannabis if it does affect other people.\r\n",
