Audience numbers are huge/record breaking?\r\n\r\nCan we, for once, celebrate British talent (sporting and engineering) on the BBC?\r\n\r\nGovernment should make British F1 achievments available to all - a question of national pride.  The Director of BBC sport is blaming government 'cut backs'.   I don't think that she understands how much motor sport is part of the national psyche, or how much our motor engineering expertise adds to the local economy and our worldwide reputation.\r\n\r\nIn view of recent events do we want the Murdoch empire to control coverage of a national success story?",
