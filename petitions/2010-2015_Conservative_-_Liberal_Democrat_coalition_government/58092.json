Insurance prices should be more transparent as to why we pay them and how much of this goes into company profit. A regulation should be brought in to cap how much profit companies can make on things that are required by law.\r\nTransport is usually required to gain employment in this country, how can a young person be expected to pay such hideous fees such as \u00a33000 on a car which is only worth \u00a3300 when they are yet to even get a job? I hope sincerely that the government would act on this to help the people instead of appeasing the large corporations of today like they so often do.",
