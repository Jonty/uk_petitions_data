        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call on the Secretary of State to reject Natural England\u2019s application to erect a fence on Greenrigg Common CL40, known as Fell End Clouds in south east Cumbria.\r\n\r\nThis is an easily accessible and popular site of special scientific interest, used regularly for recreation and education.  Natural England plan to erect a fence and introduce cattle, which will spoil the visual beauty of the area and the presence of cattle will significantly increase risk to people who enjoy The Clouds, including families with young children.\r\n\r\nThe science behind the need for this fence has been questioned by the leading botanist who originally designated the SSSI.\r\n\r\nThe application fails to recognise that prior to the outbreak of Foot and Mouth in 2001 the area was overgrazed but many farmers didn\u2019t restock to previous levels and changes in the subsidy payment system have significantly reduced the problem of overgrazing.\r\n\r\n",
