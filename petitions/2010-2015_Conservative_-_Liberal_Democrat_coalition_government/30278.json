        "additional_details": "What we are asking is that David Cameron take a proper look at real struggling communities and take note of who needs and doesn't need the benefits.Try taking benefits COMPLETELY from those who have made no effort to make a life for themselves, the ones who have never worked or studied a day since they left school-age and yet have had a flat/house handed to them and enough money to support themselves aswell as any habits.Give those benefits to families where one or both parents are working (and to single parents who don't receive an CSA in the understanding that part will be paid back when they begin work).also make it so that EVERY person must be working atleast part-time hours by the time their youngest child becomes of school age and cap this to a maximum of 3 children (for example)...Sign this petition to get this discussed by Parliament! We have 9 months (the length of one pregnancy) to get 100,000 signatures and potentially secure the welfare of future babies and families!",
