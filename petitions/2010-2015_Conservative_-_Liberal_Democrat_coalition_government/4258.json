        "additional_details": "People who commit serious sex offences, such as rape and child sex abuse - and continue to do so after one or more convictions - should be rendered permanently incapable of sexual activity. Having their genital organs amputated would be a fitting punishment for those who have repeatedly used them to hurt others. Plus, removing the source of  physical desires might help rehabilitate offenders and enable at least some of them to become productive citizens.",
