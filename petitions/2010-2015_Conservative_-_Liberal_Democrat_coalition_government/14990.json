        "additional_details": "3 policemen and as many CSOs again stand on the corner of Kensington High Street  to give some sort of advice/assistance to passing cyclists. 6 months ago I was knocked over by a cyclist travelling the wrong way along Kensington High Street. He fled. A few months earlier, I narrowly missed another collision with one going the wrong way down a one-way street.  In the Park cyclists regularly use no-cycling paths. Any attempt to stop them gets you verbal abuse.  Every day in London, cyclists routinely jump red lights. They are never stopped by the police. Is it because our Mayor and  PM are both cyclists that this group is above the law?  I want the Government to  a) stop spending taxpayer money and police time on helping them with their bikes and b) start spending it on regulating them and enforcing the laws against them and not just other road users trying to circumvent them.",
