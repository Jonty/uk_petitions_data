I've lost huge amounts of money in the past on wasted surveys and searches, which I've paid for as soon as my house has sold, only to discover weeks ahead that the buyer has had a change of heart and pulled out. I know I'm not alone in this. Buyers should not be allowed to be so irresponsible. Please show your support for this e petition, and let's see if we can turn some heads.\r\n",
