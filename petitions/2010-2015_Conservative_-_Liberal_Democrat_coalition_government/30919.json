        "additional_details": "I want legal aid to be available to anyone who has suffered domestic violence at the hands of their partner regardless of age, sex and race, but especially regardless of their circumstances. Legal aid should be available not only to people on welfare benefits, but also those trying to improve their lives (and also their children\u2019s), who are working for a low income and also students. It is unfair that people who are trying to make a better life for themselves, after experiencing such traumatic events, should be penalised and not be able to secure the protection and assistance of the courts for the application of orders such as non-molestation orders and prohibited steps orders. These people have made the bravest step of their lives by leaving the person who had ultimate control over them and should not suffer further at the hands of the legal system. The government should do ALL they can to protect these victims from further harm and abuse. They\u2019re not rich, just getting by.",
