        "additional_details": "Could we change the Law to allow people the right to choose the time of their death. Choosing a time to die will save the tax payers' money in an overstretched NHS, relieve relatives of extended heartache and give doctors freedom to really consider patient's choice. The disabled and terminally ill should have an equal choice to choose to live. The system should begin when a person is healthy and mentally fit and sends a letter to their doctor with the proviso that it can be rescinded at any time. In an ageing population it seems odd not to allow those who want to die to make that choice.",
