        "additional_details": "My name is Samar Barakat, I am 16 years old female from the London Borough of Barnet.\r\n\r\nThe London Borough of Barnet has a few violent crime hotpoints where the youth can be both victims and offenders. Because the youth centre provision in the Borough is patchy they simply hang around in the streets until late.\r\n\r\nThe existing youth centres are poorly known and typically open only 1 or 2 evenings a week. We require an initiative to increase the appeal of existing youth centres by advertising them and opening them 7 evenings a week and opening new centres where required.\r\n\r\nWithin all youth centres, there should be a variety of free activities, including sports, music and lessons.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition,to make sure that the youth in Barnet get the future they deserve!\r\n",
