Given the failure to have managed their showcase final of 2012 is a poor reflection of our national sport.\r\n\r\nGoal line technology or a TV review of all available evidence, as per rugby union matches for example, should and could have been utilised to have prevented a travesty occurring in the Liverpool v Chelsea FA Cup final 2012.\r\n\r\nAll initial evidence would support that the disallowed goal of Andy Carroll should have stood and in the modern game these human failures should not determine the outcome of the Football Association showpiece final.  Only when modern technology is utilised, as per RFU matches, and when the importance of certain decisions is taken out of the hands of humans can the integrity of the FA be reaffirmed.\r\n\r\nWe demand a review of goal line technology or video replay evidence on certain and crucial decisions as and where appropriate.\r\n",
