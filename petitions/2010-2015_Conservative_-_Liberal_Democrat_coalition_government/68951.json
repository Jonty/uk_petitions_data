        "additional_details": "In the modern age of the internet, it's really easy to buy or upgrade new products and services using the retailer's website, but not so easy when you want to cancel products and services. Often you'll not find a cancel button anywhere on the website. That's because retailers don't want you to cancel and you're sometimes forced to telephone to cancel a service, so that the retailer can persuade you not to. This petition is to change consumer protection laws to include a mandatory cancellation option for products and services on retailer's websites so that consumers can cancel products and services as well as buy them.",
