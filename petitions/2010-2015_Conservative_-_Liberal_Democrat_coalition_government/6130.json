        "action": "A petition to increase fuel duty exponentially",
        "additional_details": "The petitioners accept that petrol and diesel supplies that are affordable to the average family are not sustainable for much longer. The petitioners also accept that since that day is coming, there's no sense putting off the inevitable. The petitioners believe the time has come to make the switch from fossil fuel based transport, to carbon neutral forms of energy and infrastructure, however as long as petrol based car's remain more convenient than electric and hydrogen cars, and public transport, the public will not willingly make the switch. The petitioners believe that if the carrot does not work then it is time for the stick, and the only way to do so is to make it more convenient to make the switch than to stay with the status quo, and that the only way to do that is to price people out of petrol by raising fuel duty. The petitioners believe that we owe it to future generations to put a sustainable fuel and transport infrastructure before out own personal conveniences.",
