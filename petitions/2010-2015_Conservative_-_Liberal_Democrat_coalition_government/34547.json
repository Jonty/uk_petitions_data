Because of the tailbacks it creates mean the buses cannot reach it. The normal commuters for whom the buses aren't an option are severely delayed. Many of these are business people who have come down the motorway.\r\nIt increases pollution, causes massive tailbacks, reduces the efficiency of the city for the sakes of a No1 bus that may come once every 11 minutes. It is absolutely pointless and badly thought out.\r\nThe council should revert it to a normal traffic lane and get the traffic going again. Please support this cause. We the ratepayers object to this bottleneck and want it changed back.\r\n",
