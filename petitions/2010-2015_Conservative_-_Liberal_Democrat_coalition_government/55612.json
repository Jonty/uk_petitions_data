        "additional_details": "On Saturday 12 October 2013, there will be no live football above Conference South level. In recent times, the second Saturday in October has been used for World Cup and European Championship qualifiers. These games have unilaterally moved to Friday nights, which makes it difficult for young children to enjoy them, as well as further diminishing the grand tradition of Saturday afternoon football.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the Government to lobby FIFA and UEFA to return weekend European qualifiers to Saturdays.",
