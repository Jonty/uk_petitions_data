        "additional_details": "The coalition Government is pledging \u00a38.4 billion this year, rising to over \u00a311 billion by 2015. Why not use the massive funds allocated to aid by HMG for projects like the cost to defend a country\u2019s (as in Libya) inhabitants from their brutal, megalomaniac, pariah, corrupt, dictator, suspected of committing massive crimes against humanity. Aid funds can also be used to build desalination & hospital ships to serve areas affected by famine, drought & epidemics. Registered charities should work with HMG to coordinate their efforts in delivering aid directly & effectively, rather giving aid funds to corrupt overseas governments to 'distribute' aid to their populace. British Industry & workforce should preferably be involved & paid at commercial rates to deliver aid. When our armed forces withdraw from active combat duties in Afghanistan by end of 2014, any surplus helicopters, armoured vehicles & other equipment should be sold at commercial rates rather than donating them to Afghanistan.",
