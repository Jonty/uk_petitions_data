        "additional_details": "Please bring back local tax offices who will deal with enquiries, from a specific geographic area,  for self employment and PAYE. When HMRC had local offices post and enquiries were dealt with much quicker and there were a lot less mistakes when the staff were properly trained. The post is dealt with by any staff member and no one takes responsibility for any mistakes made. It takes ages to get through on the phone (I have spent 50 minutes on phone today and am no further forward) One department cannot contact another  department other than by email which causes more delays. Speaking from experience when there were local districts post was dealt with much quicker and you knew who you were talking to. The Government should realise that they need to collect the correct amount of tax to pay for services. The only way to do that is to learn from the past and bring back local offices.",
