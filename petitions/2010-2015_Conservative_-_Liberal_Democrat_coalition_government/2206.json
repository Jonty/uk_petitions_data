We want to change mothers from receiving a heartless certificate of stillbirth and a\r\nmore companionate death certificate.\r\n\r\n\u201cHowever the mother has also given birth. Therefore it is only right that the mother be given a Birth  Certificate also.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis way the baby will by law be able to have been named and the birth will be legally registered.\u201d\r\n",
