In these times of Credit difficulties and the struggle to escape the poverty trap it would be a very significant help to poorer people if these charges for water were reduced or at least restriction placed so they can't increase them every year.....This is also fair as millions of pounds are being reaped by the water companies and yet we are still asked to save water on a regular basis due to shortages.  Are they going to spend some profit to rectify this ?",
