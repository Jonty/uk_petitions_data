        "additional_details": "American service personnel who are wounded in combat by the enemy receive the decoration the Purple Heart to recognise the sacrifice they have made in service of their country. This, in even a minor way, shows that their sacrifice has been appreciated by a grateful nation.\r\n\r\nI believe British service personnel should receive a similar award to show the appreciation we all feel for their courageous sacrifice. When British Casualties where published by the MoD last month total personnel wounded in action (in Afghanistan from 7/10/2001 to 31/12/2011) was shown as 1,854 with 270 very seriously injured and 279 seriously injured. The fact is the vast majority of these casualties will only have their scars to show what they have given in service of this nation. I feel that this is not enough and  the men and women of our armed forces deserve more.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you feel that British personnel wounded in action deserve a decoration to show their sacrifice.",
