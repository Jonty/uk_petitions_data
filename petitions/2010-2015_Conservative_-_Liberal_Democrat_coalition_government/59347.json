        "additional_details": "Hydraulic Fracturing or \"Fracking\" is a deeply unpopular policy that harms the environment, causes permanent damage and finally does not alleviate our reliance on Fossil Fuels...\r\n\r\nYou, I & the people, call on the Government to review the \"go ahead\" on Fracking and ban it just like in France or Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nTo add insult to injury, TOTAL - a French company, is firmly rooted to destroying our land because they can't to theirs.\r\n\r\nPlease see sense Mr Cameron + Co.\r\n\r\nTo quote DEFRA:\r\n\r\n\"The government believes that we need to protect the environment for future generations, make our economy more environmentally sustainable, and improve our quality of life and well-being. We also believe that much more needs to be done to support the farming industry, protect biodiversity and encourage sustainable food production.\"\r\n\r\nAny support is of course, as always muchly appreciated :)",
