        "additional_details": "Remove the current, unfair form of vehicle excise duty and add lost revenue on to the price of fuel as an additional form of fuel duty. The change would save millions of pounds in administration costs and save motorists unnecessary hassle. There would be no costs in policing or enforcing non-payment as no one could avoid it.\r\n\r\nBased on rough calculations, the average motorist doing 10,000 miles per annum would pay around \u00a3100 more each year on their fuel bill whilst saving a similar amount from the removal of VED.\r\n\r\nThe change would also boost consumer spending on classic/leisure vehicles, the cost of \u00a3225 per year per vehicle covering only a few hundred miles puts many off the prospect of ownership.\r\n\r\nI require a 4x4 for my work on rare but necessary occasions and the VED costs me more than the fuel does.\r\n\r\nForeign vehicles would also be contributing when filling up at UK pumps, rather than using our roads for free.
