        "additional_details": "Many students in schools today are having to deal with the reality of the education curriculum and system that had been taught from the start of the academic year, being scrapped half way through the year, leaving exams that have been set or planned to have been set this year, scrapped or the results becoming irrelevant. Such as Year 9 GCSE Physics students who have been allowed to take teir GCSE's early, have had their planned GCSE exam scrapped, and the current syllabus becoming irrelevant to the new exam to be set for them in 2014. Students should be able to sit these exams anyway. Since they have been studing for these exams since the beginning of the acadamic year.",
