If this proposal is agreed and implemented it will mean that (for the 2013 11plus examination for entry into the schools in September 2014) 80% of the children will be selected from within a 12.5 mile radius from the school. Only 20% of the places will be given to children who live outside of this area (i.e. 22 places for boys and 24 places for girls).\r\n\r\nI think this is unfair to the children of the neighbouring boroughs and by signing this petition, you agree that proposed changes should not go ahead.\r\n",
