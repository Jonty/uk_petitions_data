        "additional_details": "The Government should reduce the UK energy requirement by creating a phased programme of free home insulation, coordinated and paid for from public funds. Funding could possibly be found by channeling funds otherwise destined for the ROCs on inefficient and environmentally unfriendly renewable energy.\r\nSuch a scheme would reduce fuel poverty and need for energy generation. A cost assessment might be helpful.\r\nLocal Authorities could be responsible for implementation by identifying and prioritising in their areas according to severity / property type.\r\nSuch a scheme should include external and between-joist cladding for the many properties with little or no lofts and with no cavity to insulate.\r\n",
