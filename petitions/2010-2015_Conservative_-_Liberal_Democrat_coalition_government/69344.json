        "additional_details": "This is a petition calling for HM Government to do more to protect the UK video game industry, by offering more tax reliefs, additional funding to be available for individuals who wish to start up their own company within this field alongside some form of Heritage set up to protect British investment from moving overseas. Loads of UK talented developers have created games that have excelled globally, games that get so much bad press, but yet rake in millions in profit, should be seen, not as an enemy, but as a triumph of British excellence with Grand Theft Auto being the best example of this.\r\n\r\nIn part of supplying direct help to developers, more needs to be done in recognizing the industry better by  way of promoting it.\r\n\r\nThankyou",
