A central database of all reported cases will ensure that no investigation gets 'overlooked' and all potential offenders are highlighted and properly investigated. With the Pope making a statement that all child abuse cases within the Catholic Church must be kept secret and the Department of Education suggesting that there is no report to suggest that reporting child abuse to the Police will improve the situation (Breakfast TV November 2013), as a Country we need to ensure that we do not allow the shroud of secrecy to continue to protect abusers of children. The Government has a duty to collect and monitor all that data.",
