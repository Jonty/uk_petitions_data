        "additional_details": "In February 2014, a friend, a young pregnant lady, was walking on her way to work when an uncontrollable car took hers & her unborn sons life. Several weeks later, another collision in the same place but luckily was not fatal. Over the last 4 months numerous accidents have happened on the stretch of saffron lane. On 23rd October a two car collision has seen 2 people cut out of cars. We are currently unaware of their condition.\r\nSomething needs to change. Every single day, people are speeding down saffron lane putting others life's in danger. Without putting in place speed cameras, speed bumps or even mobile speed cameras, history will keep repeating itself. We do not need to put more life's at risk, things can and should change! We deserve safer roads. We deserve to not be filled with fear everytime there's another crash wondering if it's a loved one. We are not asking for much. I believe a speed camera will completely change this road. ",
