        "additional_details": "\r\nIn 2010 the Ministry of Defence (MOD) investigated approx 300 infant deaths, in Cyprus during the period 1960-66.\r\n\r\nThey concluded that the mortality rates were not notably out of line with what might be expected in the conditions that existing in Cyprus in the 1960s. The MOD was advised by an expert in Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\r\n\r\nBehind the statistics lies pain and suffering for the parents and siblings, it is understood that at the time little information was shared with the bereaved about the causes of these deaths, leading to a general feeling of a \"cover up\".\r\n\r\nWe ask that the Government re-opens the investigation, enlisting an expert in Infant Health and Development, with a view to better understanding the medical, pathological and environmental conditions that led to these deaths. Perhaps it is possible with our modern understanding of \"cot death\" to look back 50 years and offer a more informed explanation as to what most likely lies behind these deaths.",
