        "additional_details": "I would like to petition for a full smoking ban in Northern Ireland bus stations. Please enforce or change a law to protect school children, like myself, from passive smoking and associated undesirable issues, such as arriving to school stinking of cigarette smoke. Ulsterbus are unable to enforce the no smoking rule which they have tried to implement. The 'Tobacco Control Officer' from my local council has advised me that the no smoking area is not enforceable because the bus stands are more than 50% open space. No one is taking responsibility to ensure non-smokers are protected in public places.",
