        "additional_details": "This is where leaders battle it out to win your vote and get there views across. Cameron wants to avoid a debate, this shows how cowardly our Prime Minister really is (by not allowing live tv debates in 2015 to take place)! We think its appalling that the televised political debates aren't going ahead in 2015, this shows how the government is against free speech! All FOUR party leaders should take to the stage and compete against each other like in 2010 because this destroys the foundation of a democracy. If there is no live TV debates in 2015 then what is the difference between the government (a democracy by the way) and all those dictators that have been topled in these past years... I call on the goverment to KEEP the 2015 general election live tv debates and NOT to scrap it.",
