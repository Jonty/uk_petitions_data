        "additional_details": "We ask the government to ban the use of cats and kittens in medical testing in the UK.\r\n\r\nMillions of people in Britain keep cats as pets and they are often considered to be part of a family. The knowledge that this country allows cats and kittens to be used in vivisection causes a considerable amount of distress to many of these people.\r\n\r\nOne example of testing is the 2010 study completed by Cardiff University which involved experimentation on felines relating to eye function.\r\n\r\nThe Cardiff study was designed to research amblyopia, or \"lazy eye\", in humans - a non-life-threatening condition which is usually easily treatable in younger children.\r\n\r\nWe believe it is inappropriate to use animals which are foremost kept as pets in the UK in any testing programs.\r\n\r\nCats are not close genetic relations to humans, so it is debatable how beneficial such testing programs are to medical science.\u00a0\r\n",
