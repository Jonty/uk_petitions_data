It's not fair parents with more than one child or very young children have to suffer the difficulty of finding spaces when there's none available as mother and child spaces aren't important like disabled parking although most with blue badges have nothing wrong with them as they have fooled the system. So more mother and child spaces n closers to shop doors. ",
