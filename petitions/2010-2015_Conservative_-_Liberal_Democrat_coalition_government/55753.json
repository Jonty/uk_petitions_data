        "additional_details": "The government seems to think it's fair not to allocate any Royal Mail shares to the \"rich\" eg those applying for more than 10,000 shares. Yet it is quite happy for most of the shares to go to the multi-millionaires and foreigners behind hedge funds and financial institutions.\r\n\r\nThis is a disgrace and anti-aspirational. The government needs to urgently rethink who it wants to give away this national institution to.",
