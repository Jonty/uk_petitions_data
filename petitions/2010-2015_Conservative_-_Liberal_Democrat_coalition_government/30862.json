        "additional_details": "Reducing the current legal drink-drive limit from 80 mg of alcohol to 20 mg/100mls of blood will remove the ambiguity that 1 or 2 drinks is safe to drive and the temptation to have just 1 more pint of beer or glass of wine when driving.  Even 1 or 2 drinks can affect a driver's reactions.  1 in 6 people die on the UK roads every day through drink driving. I never thought I would lose my son and there are so many people who do lose their lives in this terrible tragic way leaving families devastated forever. Let's stop this blatant disregard for life and help change the law to ZERO TOLERANCE ON DRINK DRIVING.",
