        "additional_details": "My sister Sorcha Glenn was a beautiful and inspirational young lady, sadly taken from us aged just 23 following a 13 month battle with cervical cancer.\r\n\r\nSorcha had initially asked for a smear test in June 2013 but was refused based on age.  After experiencing symptoms, Sorcha managed to get a smear test and was diagnosed in September 2013.\r\n\r\nWe do not want any more young ladies to be refused a vital smear test that could save their life, because of an age limit. We would like to campaign to lower the age limit from 25 yrs old to 18 yrs old & to allow those who request a smear test to be provided with one.",
