Classed as \u2018rare\u2019, the lack of informed medical knowledge about HD can lead to misunderstanding of its likely progression. Those diagnosed currently have a life expectancy of below 20 years from symptom onset.\r\n\r\nThe government previously singled out HD in the case of insurance. Having already decided positive testing means a life is of limited timescale, we urge the government to recognise the need to streamline the benefits process for those suffering and their carers.\r\n",
