        "additional_details": "I am very fortunate that in when I go to University in September I will only be paying \u00a33,500 per year fro my course, however when my sister goes in about a years time she will be forced to pay the shocking amount of \u00a39,000 and that total isn't even including halls of residence fees, books etc.\r\nA friend's father who is a Professor told me that for him to pay for his four children to go to University and pay for all of them out of his own money will cost him in excess of \u00a3308,000 in total.\r\nI just don't think its fair that the politicians who have approved these rises all got to go to University when it was free, yet now they want us to pay \u00a39,000.\r\nSo many bright and intelligent people are going to be stopped from accessing their true potential now because of the amount of debts that they will be burdened with once they leave University with a degree or they just won't go to Uni at all.",
