        "additional_details": "The government has, in April 2012, announced plans to revive the previously abandoned carbon capture schemes.\r\n\r\nThese schemes have already been dismissed as impractical. Even if they can be made to work they will NOT provide us with energy security, as carbon capture is NOT an energy source. In fact they will hasten the exhaustion of fossil fuel reserves by making power stations less efficient.\r\n\r\nThe cost will be colossal, at over a billion per plant. It will, quite simply, be money wasted on a scam designed to line the pockets of investors in this sector. We believe that funding of this kind should instead be awarded to research into new energy sources, a strategy which will provide for long-term energy security and the protection of the environment.\r\n\r\n",
