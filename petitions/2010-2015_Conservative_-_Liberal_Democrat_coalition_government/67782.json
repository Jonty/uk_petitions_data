Israel is being allowed to commit mass genocide while the world silently allows it to continue.\r\n\r\nThe government and Saudi embassy need to exercise their power, take immediate action and ask for immediate ceasefire. Allow the Palestinians to return to their rightful country and live peacefully.\r\n\r\nDespite the biased media reports, the truth will not be contained. Thousands have marched (old, young, black, white and brown) to show that we are NOT with the oppressors; but where are the Muslim leaders and why are you not leading by example?\r\n\r\nYou should be upholding your responsibility by providing urgent medical facilities, food, clean water, shelter and financial aid to this fragile and broken country which have the victims of an ethnic cleanse. These are the first steps in the Muslim leaders gaining some respect and credibility back for failing humanity.\r\n\r\nEnd this suffering, STOP THIS GENOCIDE!",
