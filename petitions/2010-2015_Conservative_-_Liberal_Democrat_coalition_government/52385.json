        "additional_details": "Currently in the UK political parties are either funded by Union Leaders or by wealthy individual donors. This in turn means governments allow just a few individuals to determine government policy.\r\nWe should introduce a system whereby every time you vote an amount eg \u00a33 is given to the party you have voted for.\r\nThis would ensure that:\r\n1) Parties would need to pursue popular policies\r\n2) No wealthy individual or union would control politics\r\n3) If you feel no-one is worthy of your vote then no-one will receive your \u00a33 meaning that either parties would need to change their policies or cut their cloth in the same way businesses & households do.\r\n4) It would be worth parties making an effort in all local areas as they would still benefit from looking for votes.\r\n5) No longer is any vote 'wasted' as even if your party does not win they still benefit from your donation.\r\n6) For approx. 1p per week we can have a political system that responds to the desires of the people.",
