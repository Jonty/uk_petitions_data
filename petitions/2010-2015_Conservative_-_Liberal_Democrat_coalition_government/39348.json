        "additional_details": "Nick Cleg has suggested that 'Wealthy Pensioners' should not receive benefits such as the Winter Fuel Allowance and free Bus Passes.\r\n\r\nThis makes a mockery of the principle of making provision for old age. The majority of pensioners have paid taxes all their lives, who is to say they should not receive assisitance with heating or travel? This threshold will inevitably be subject to a slippery slope until only the very poorest will qualify. There are people who come into this country having never paid any taxes, or indeed others who have never worked who receive State Benefits. This is where economies should be made. The Principle of the Welfare State is that all should pay in and all should benefit, it is the hallmark of a civilised society that it provides respect and support to older people, and that older people should not be subject to the humilation of means testing to receive recognition and assistance. .",
