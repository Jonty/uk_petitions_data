        "additional_details": "Currently there is a disincentive to save for a pension as you lose your pension savings when you die.  If a pension can be treated as a special bequest that can be passed on (but only as a pension), it would be an incentive to each generation to add to the family pension fund which could be passed on.  This would in turn alleviate the pressure on the government to provide increased pensions by encouraging more people to start personal pensions",
