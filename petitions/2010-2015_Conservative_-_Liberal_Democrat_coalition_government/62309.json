But it is extremely unfair that English people have to pay \u00a38.20 for their prescriptions when people in Wales and Scotland get them for free. This should be stopped. Everybody who is able should pay and reduce the cost for us in England to make it more affordable. This is just too much money for a lot of people and health will be compromised. ",
