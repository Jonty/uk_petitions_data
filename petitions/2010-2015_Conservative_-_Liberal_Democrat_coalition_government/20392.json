These toilets have also lacked usables like toilet paper, soap, water and hand drier.\r\n\r\nI have also sent evidence to Sec for State of Transport, & Health, Chief Execs HSE, VOSA, Health Protection Agency, Env Health Officers Brent, Camden & Westminster Council & others along the way being passed from pillar to post. But to no avail.\r\n\r\nHence this e-petition as there is not a single regulatory body that monitors such coaches that carry public.\r\n",
