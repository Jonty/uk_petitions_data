        "additional_details": "There are so many drivers now using hand held mobile phones that the only conclusion you can come to is that these people have no regard for their own safety, the safety of other road users and no fear of being caught. This attitude has to change.\r\nThe legislation introduced eight years ago banning the use of hand held mobile phones whilst driving is clearly ineffective and must change.\r\nIf, as has been suggested, a number of times that  the practice is just as dangerous as drinking and driving then the penalty should be the same i.e an automatic 12 month disqualification.\r\n",
