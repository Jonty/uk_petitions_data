I call for legislation capping eligibility for council or housing association homes at a household income of \u00a356,500, inflation-adjusted annually. I used median adult earnings (\u00a326,500 for tax year 2011/12) plus child benefit. This is fairer: the more fortunate should not be subsidised by those less well-off. Policy will be more complex: what if income crests the median? Must the family leave, or pay into the public purse?  If they must leave, how long do they have to find somewhere?  What may be set off - extra costs of coping with disabilities, etc.  But that's detail - the principle is \u2013 are you in the more fortunate half of the population? Congratulations, now get out of the way so we can help someone else.  ONS uses the median because, as the value below which 50% of people fall, it is preferred to the mean (average), being less affected by the skewed distribution and extreme values in earnings data.",
