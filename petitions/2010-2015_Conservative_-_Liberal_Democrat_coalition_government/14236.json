If you could find out the truth about a man before starting a serious relationship, then domestic violence issues could be deterred, avoided and even lives saved.\r\n\r\nAt least two women a week are murder...ed by their partners or ex partners and, 1 in 4 women are suffering domestic violence at present. It is acknowledged men suffer too but numbers indicate that women are the main victims and something needs to be done NOW.\r\n\r\n",
