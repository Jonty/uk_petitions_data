        "additional_details": "At present Planning Authories and CADW and English Heritage have no duty of care responsibilities in law regarding (in the case of planning authorities) planning decisions and (in the case of CADW and English Heritage) that the listings they provide are accurate. Although these are two separate organisations with separate responsiblities and duties their work is intertwined. This is an anomaly which renders both these organisations unchallengable in law and as such constitutes a basic infringment of human rights in the UK. CADW and English Heritage must be made to have a duty of care to the subsequent owners of listed buildings to ensure that the listing is correct, that at least the address of the property included in the list is accurate.",
