        "additional_details": "The application of red wave principle where traffic lights are set to go red as soon as one leaves the previous set, Implemented by the Labour Administration in London in order to frustrate, annoy and make the use of a car unbearable in the hope that the public will stay away from the affected roads and switch to public transport as well as to gather more taxation as fuel is wasted and burned sitting in the artificial jams.\r\nThis scheme is wasteful and environmentally unfriendly. During the Olympics it was switched to 'green wave' and the traffic ran fine, even with restricted road space. So it can be done. 1 in 7 children suffer with asthma which costs us all - There are currently no hospital beds available for respiratory complaints.\r\nThese odious schemes are implemented nationwide in all our towns and cities. They, with the high price of fuel are an attack on our freedom of movement and must be rescinded. ",
