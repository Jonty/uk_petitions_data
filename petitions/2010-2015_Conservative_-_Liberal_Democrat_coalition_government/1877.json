        "additional_details": "Given the tough financial climate, and the necessary cuts to the BBC, it is surely time to prioritise its better quality programming.  BBC Three is a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money, and there is no justification for licence fee money going towards endless repeats of 'Family Guy', ludicrous shows such as \"Snog Marry Avoid?\" and \"World's Craziest Fools\", and rubbish sitcoms that come and go without trace. Not to mention pseudo-reality programming including \u201cJamie: Drag Queen at 16\u201d, \"My Life As An Animal\", \"Geordie Finishing School for Girls\", and \"Danny Dyer: I believe in UFOs\".",
