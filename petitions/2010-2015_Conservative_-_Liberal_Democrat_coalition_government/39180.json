The statistics show one killing a week could have been prevented if the suspect had been remanded in custody.\r\n\r\nTell the Dept of Justice that this is not good enough and that innocent people must be protected from criminals who seem to think that our Laws do not apply to them and bail should not be given to any indivduals who are charged with Murder and/or Rape.\r\n",
