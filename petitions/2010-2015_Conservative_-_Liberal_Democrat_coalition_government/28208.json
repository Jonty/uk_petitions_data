If you don't want to elect a PCC you should have the option to tell the government you want to keep things how they are.\r\nPolice authorities consult with the public already about the issues that matter and put this into the policing priorities for your local force. They have a vast amount of experience in overseeing the way the police work and the levels of funding required to deliver an efficient service.\r\nThe government want to do away with all that experience and put the power in the hands of people they control to make massive cuts to the budgets which will ultimately reduce frontline police officer numbers. PCC's will politicise the police exactly what police authorities are there to avoid.",
