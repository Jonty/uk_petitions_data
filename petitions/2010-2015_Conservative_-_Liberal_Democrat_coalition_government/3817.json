        "additional_details": "Currently politicians are free to decide without public support or questioning what wars we as a nation enter, common examples include the current war in Lybia, the war in Iraq, Afganistan and many others such as WW2 and the Korean War,\r\n\r\nThese wars are in the eyes of the British public often unnecessary or unwanted and go against the rights of the British population who are forced by duty to serve in them resulting in death or life changing injury in some cases, often not for \"country\" but for the simple acts of a political party whos only goals are obviously not in the interest of the British public in the majority of cases,\r\n\r\nThis petition asks the government to install a law which unless Britan and its allies are directly in danger all wars which are optionally enterd have to undergo a referendum, this includes wars enterd by allies which in no way directly effect the sovereignty or safety of the British public.",
