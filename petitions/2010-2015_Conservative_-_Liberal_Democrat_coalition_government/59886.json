        "additional_details": "  The government needs to do more for the elderly in care homes. The national minimum standards say that it is up for the home to decide on how many staff they need based on the needs of the residents. All they are, are minimum standards. Based on reports in the media there is lack of staff  in some care homes and lack of staff training  leading to the residents receiving poor care.\r\n   I propose the government to stop ignoring this issue and set figures for a staff ratio of carers to residents. By setting a legal ratio, care home providers must follow and if fail, be accounted for this by the justice system. By having a realistic legal ratio the elderly in care homes have a better chance of receiving quality care that meets all their needs. ",
