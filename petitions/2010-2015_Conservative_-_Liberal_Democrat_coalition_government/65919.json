        "additional_details": "We the undersigned do not believe that the current proposed Core Strategy or the inclusion of 3,000 houses at Gaydon Lighthorne Heath is in the best interests of our community and we call on Stratford District Council to reconsider it and work with Town and Parish Councils as well as local residents to develop an alternative.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the building of 3,000 houses at GLH would devastate the Local Countryside in respect of heritage, landscape, biodiversity and habitat. The site is a noise-polluted, light-polluted carcinogenic corridor. Increased traffic would adversely affect communities within a 15 mile radius. The site lacks infrastructure, a disclosed finance package and deliverability.\r\n",
