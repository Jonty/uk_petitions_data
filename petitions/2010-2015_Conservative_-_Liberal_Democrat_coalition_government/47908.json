Bad practices by all have caused many to loose a lot of money and faith in the whole system. Our neighbours (Scotland) and cross Atlantic partners (USA) have developed systems which eliminate many bad practices including renegotiating once a sale has been agreed, Gazumping, Gazundering and delays through negligence.\r\n\r\nIt is time this government did something which truly benefits the masses and closed many of the loopholes which make this system archaic and out of place in a 21st century society.\r\n\r\nI propose that the government reviews the whole residential/commercial buying and selling process, and implements a clear concise system that implements the best features of alternate systems and creates a process which locks in both parties once an offer has been agreed and speeds up the process on whole.
