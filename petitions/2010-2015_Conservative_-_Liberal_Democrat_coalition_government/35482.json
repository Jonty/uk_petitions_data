        "additional_details": " My plan is to have a national awareness day in schools and colleges/universities where students wear a certain colour of clothing (like pink for breast cancer) in support of gay students.\r\n\r\nMy idea for the day would be called \"National be Gay for a Day\". For a slogan, It could be a slogan similar to that of \"Show Racism the Red Card\". I was thinking of making a cloured symbol, for example \"Give homophobia the Blue Heart\". So students understand that they can end homophobia through love.\r\n\r\nSo please sign if you believe in tackling an ancient prejudice thorugh educating the next generation.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to make this event nationwide.
