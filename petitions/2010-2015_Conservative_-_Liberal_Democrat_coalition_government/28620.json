        "additional_details": "When a gift card is purchased and given to somebody, the card should not expire after 12 months.  People pay out millions of pounds every year on gift cards which then expire.  If a card is presented after 12 months some stores will no longer accept it even though somebody has paid cash for the gift card.  This is unfair.  Gift cards should not expire.  Please support this e-petition.",
