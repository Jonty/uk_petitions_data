        "additional_details": "Local parents in Hong Kong can hardly buy baby formula milk powder in drugstores and supermarkets, as smugglers from mainland China stormed into this tiny city to buy milk powder and resell them for huge profits in China. Many retailers stockpiled milk powder and are reluctant to sell to local parents as the shops can sell their stocks, in big cartons, to mainland smuggler for huge profits. Countries like Germany, the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand have already exercised rationed sale to tourist buyers from China for milk powder. However, the Hong Kong government simply framed the situation as a matter of free trade and refuse to exercise the law which is already there to stop cross-border smuggling. We request for international support and assistance, as babies in Hong Kong will face malnutrition very soon.",
