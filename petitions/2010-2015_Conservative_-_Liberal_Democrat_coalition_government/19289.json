        "additional_details": "Thousands assembled on the 15th October 2011 in a peaceful demonstration aiming to occupy the London Stock Exchange against the corporate greed of the few at the top of the economic ladder, that's paid for with the lives and standard of living of the many below them. It was immediately blocked from reaching its destination, and surrounded by riot police. This occured in spite of it being an entirely peaceful assembly.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to cease the obstruction of legitimate and peaceful demonstration and assembly, and to support democracy in doing so, rather than undermining it as it is currently the case. We call on the government to allow the 99% a voice, rather than creating a situation where the only means of protesting effectively is through riot and disorder.\r\n\r\nWe are the 99%. We WILL be heared.",
