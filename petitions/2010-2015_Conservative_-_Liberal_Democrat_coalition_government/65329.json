This resulted in an unfair advantage for them during the 2013/14 Barclays Premier League season, The FA Cup, League Cup and the UEFA Champions League. They should be docked points from this previous season for attaining an unfair advantage and/or be docked points for the 2014/15 season and also receive a ban on transfers for the following two transfer windows.",
