        "additional_details": "The motorway hard shoulder is a very frightening and hazardous place to be. Most of the time the driver is put onto this situation due to a puncture or breakdown. With the disappearance of motorway hard shoulders, vehicles may be stranded in live running lanes with nowhere to go. The current hazard warning system is not effective enough to prevent vehicles hitting stranded vehicles. Approx 200 people a year are injured or killed just waiting for breakdown assistance in the UK alone. The law must be changed to allow the alternate flashing of the amber and red brake/fog lamps for any vehicle stopped in a live lane or hard shoulder of a motorway or carriage way 50 mph plus. Red is the first colour we see. Amber lights tend to get missed or lost in the surrounding area. This change in the law will reduce injury's, loss of life, reduce costs and ease traffic flow\r\n\r\n",
