        "additional_details": "I am asking that the government extend and amend the Freedom of Information Act to cover all the deliberations of local authorities so that it would NOT be legal to prevent local voters from hearing their debates and decision-making processes including committee work.\r\n\r\nAt present there is far too much secrecy about local decision-making. All local decisions should be OPEN to public scrutiny throughout their pathway - from inception, to deliberation - to final decision.\r\n\r\nThis is true representative democracy and it would stimulate more voters to get out and vote because they would actually get to hear the arguments - and how effective councillors really were in debate.\r\n\r\nGood councillors would be voted back in and those not competent would lose - thus increasing the quality of democratic government.\r\n\r\nIt would also encourage more young people to go into politics - a vital need at present.",
