        "additional_details": "Due to the massive price increases announced by Royal Mail for parcel services the Post Office network should be able to negotiate with other carriers to provide their services through the Post Office.\r\nRoyal Mails new parcel prices will be massively damaging to a lot of small businesses, Ebay & Amazon sellers & the only reason they think they can get away with it is because of the monopoly they have with the Post Office.\r\nWith the impending privatization of Royal Mail the Post Office will eventually have to be opened up other carriers anyway so better to do it now than wait for businesses to go bust.
