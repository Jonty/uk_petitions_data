        "additional_details": "More help is needed for families to cover childcare costs. There are families out there where both parents work full time and the cost for a full time childcare place is over \u00a31000 a month per child, add to that the travel costs to get to work and there is very little left to make it worthwhile actually working. More parents seeing this and not working equals less tax revenue for the government so it stands to reason that it is in the governments best interest to provide more help towards childcare costs. The childcare vouchers provide a little relief but not nearly enough.\r\n\r\nSome families are no longer entitled to child tax credits which is putting further strain on hard working parents.\r\n\r\nIf the government wants to get more people into work the amount of help offered towards childcare costs seriously needs to be reconsidered to actually 'make work pay'!",
