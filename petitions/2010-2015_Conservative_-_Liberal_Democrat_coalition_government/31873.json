        "additional_details": "Hi All\r\n\r\n\r\nThe government should not be considering a U-turn to buy F35B fighter planes from the JSF programme, and instead continue with the decision to buy F35C and install catapults and arrestor wires on the new Queen Elisabeth and Prince of Wales Aircraft Carriers.\r\n\r\n\r\nA little extra build cost now for the catapults will mean we can buy the much more capable F35C for our aircraft carriers and in the future consider them as replacements for the RAF's Tornado force too meaning much lower overall operational costs.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there are issues with the F35C we can always get other navalised fighter and bomber aircraft as long as we have a CATOBAR on our aircraft carriers. It also allows interoperability with French and USA aircraft meaning we can train and use their carriers too.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOD please confirm your commitment to the Aircraft Carrier CATOBAR design and confirm your commitment to the F35C programme in which we have heavily invested already.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease support this e-petition.",
