This cannot go on and the BBC needs to be closed down just like any other company would. It's one rule for one and none for the other. As the public we are the voice and if our voice is not heard will scream louder until we get the point across. Stop the BBC from broadcasting it's lie's and creating tensions amongst the public.",
