        "additional_details": "The proposed Edinburgh Tram Line should not stop at Haymarket but be continued on to the other end of Princes Street or St Andrew Square bus station.\r\n\r\nThere are currently tram lines on Princes Street and this is a complete waste of the tax payer's money if the potential tram line can not be extended by approximately half a mile. The tram service should at least be connected to lines that have already been completed, with a considerable amount of upheaval and time potentially wasted if they do not.",
