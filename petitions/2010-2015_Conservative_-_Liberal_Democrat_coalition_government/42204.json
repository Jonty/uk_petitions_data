These are the first elements of the widespread changes expected to be made to our exam system.\r\n\r\nThe watchdog has published the results of a consultation on proposed changes and we feel that these changes are unfair and unfounded.\r\n\r\nMany of us are already taking our AS Level exams, and we are going to have our exam structure changed half way through our exams. This is unfair.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to scrap the proposed changes to the A Level system.\r\n",
