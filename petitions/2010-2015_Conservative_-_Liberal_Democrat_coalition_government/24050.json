If we can put down our pets because they suffer, then let's be compassionate and help our family to die in dignity! It's hypocritical that we can turn off life support in hospitals, but not help people in major pain and suffering to end it all. We urge the Government to consult with the British public, to legalize Euthanasia and to regulate it to prevent abuse! ",
