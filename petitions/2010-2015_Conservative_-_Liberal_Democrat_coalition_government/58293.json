He was jailed for executing a wounded Taliban fighter, he is not a murderer and acted in a moment of madness that he wishes he could undo, his wife has told the Daily Telegraph. Many would agree with his wife that the act was committed under great stress after a number of tours in Afghanistan and other war zones throughout the world and that the sentence  is too severe.\r\n",
