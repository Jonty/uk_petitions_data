This would cease to be a problem once we pull out of the EEC.\r\n\r\nAs we get all our luxury goods from the Asian tiger economies, which are increasing in strength this century, it make better sense to secure effective trading links with the wider part of the world which was responsible for putting the 'great' in Great Britain.\r\n",
