Right now there are innocent people serving unjust sentences because they supposedly knew what what going to happen, well unless they are mind readers how can this be!! Im all for fairness, but there is no consistency in the justice system and it needs to change. Right now i personally know a group of people who are serving these sentences, thry were the ones ynder attack and at least 3 of them had no part in the offence but were given life sentences because 'they knew what was goung to happen' well, they were minding their own business when they and their families were attacked and some of them didnt even tried to stop it happening. Yet you have murderers killing and torturing babies and elderly people snd only serving 3 or 4 years in prison... WHERE IS THE JUSTICE IN THAT??",
