Big businesses are recording record profits for supplying these services to consumers.\r\n\r\nThe Government should commission an independent non-profit company to supply fuel, gas, water and electricity to consumers.\r\n\r\nThe company should be able to purchase from current wholesalers, cover it's own running costs and aim to supply to consumers for no-profit. The company should not be nationalised and instead should be owned by it's customers.",
