        "additional_details": "I live in London and every day I commute from Earlsfield (Zone 3) to London Waterloo and face a train so packed that often you aren't able to physically get on it. However this situation is needlessly made far worse by the fact that many commuter trains don't have air conditioning.\r\n\r\nAs well as being packed into a crowded train, passengers are also overheating. Numerous times I have seen people faint in what is a totally avoidable predicament.\r\n\r\nIt's my belief that a law should be introduced that every overland commuter train should be fitted with air condition.",
