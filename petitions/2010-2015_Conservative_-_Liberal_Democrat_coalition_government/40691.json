        "additional_details": "The BBC turned a blind eye to Jimmy Savile's predatory pedophile behaviour for decades.\r\nMany BBC Radio & Television staff  \"heard rumours\" of his behaviour and none felt they would be listened to if they came forwards. These same people have risen through the ranks of the BBC over the years and even in their senior positions still didn't take responsibility and bring their concerns to management or HR. Why?\r\nNow is the time to discuss the structure and accountability of how the BBC is run.\r\nThe British public have no choice in paying for the BBC services, but we do have the power to expect it to be run professionally and legally.\r\nUntil people serving at management level in the BBC during Savile's years there are independently investigated and held accountable for their complicit behaviour, the British public should not be expected to continue to pay their license fee.
