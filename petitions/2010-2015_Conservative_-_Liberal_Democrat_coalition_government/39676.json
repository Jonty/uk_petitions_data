These figures are way above the national average for other countries.\r\n\r\nSo many families are being ripped apart due to losing a loved one because some person thought it was cool to carry a knife or managed to get their hands on a gun and dont care what the outcome will be. 99 per cent of the the time the outcome will result in a death.\r\n\r\nEnough is enough its time to bring back the death sentence for anyone found guilty of murder where there is enough evidence to prove it was them.
