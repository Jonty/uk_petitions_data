UK taxpayers (not including MPs and rich celebrities who legally evade tax on advice from HMRC, of course) are the highest donators to foreign countries through their tax payments.  Charities should NOT be allowed to ask for additional donations to any country receiving UK foreign aid payments and their TV adverts should be banned.",
