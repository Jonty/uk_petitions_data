        "additional_details": "We are petitioning to Ban the unlicensed sale of ornamental knives to the general public.\r\nIt became evident during a recent anti-knife campaign that many of these blades sold under the pretence of being kept on display are in fact being used to carry out violent crimes. Thousands of knives, swords other weaponry where handed in under amnesty during this campaign, with hundreds of supposed display and replica pieces arriving stained and battered from misuse.\r\nWe would like the government to put a stop to the free sale of these display blades and help create safer streets in our towns and cities. We recommend a background check should be performed on the sale of any commercial blade, with a trace to everyone who buys one (similar to TV licensing). Anyone selling blades must hold a license to do so, and ensure anyone who purchases from them will use them responsibly.\r\n",
