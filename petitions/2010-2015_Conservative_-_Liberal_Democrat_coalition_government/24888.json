        "additional_details": "Government representatives must conduct public sector pay/pension negotiations in a transparent way providing requested evidence to trade union negotiators within a reasonable time frame. Stamp out the trend towards a \"race to the bottom\" yet take into account our aging population. Stop fostering an image pitching public sector against private sector. Develop a workforce so that each citizen is able to contribute to a deferred wages pension fund providing for later years without need to seek benefit hand outs. Any agreed increase in pension contributions should be paid into member\u2019s pension fund not to the government as an unfair tax. Conduct fair negotiation not a \"I win - you lose\" proposition. Rather a process to secure mutual agreement that is reasonable to workers and tax payers alike. Aim for a sense of \"win - win\" outcome and a fair compromise. Acknowledge failure of negotiators who move to a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d position removing unfair non-competent negotiators soonest.",
