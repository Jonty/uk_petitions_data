        "additional_details": "From April 2013 some people will get less housing benefit than they did before.  Your benefit may be reduced if you have bedrooms that the government thinks you do not need. This could affect you if you:\r\n\r\n\u00b7 are 16 to 61 years old\r\n\r\n\u00b7 get housing benefit for part or all of your rent\r\n\r\n\u00b7 are sick or disabled\r\n\r\nTHIS IS SIMPLY OUTRAGEOUS CUTS BY THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST FAMILIES ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH THE COST OF LIVING RISING BY THE DAY. IT'S AN EVEN BIGGER OUTRAGE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED AND LIVE IN SPECIALLY ADAPTED HOUSING BUT ARE BEING FORCED INTO CHANGES THAT COULD HAVE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES IN SOME CASES.\r\n\r\nWE THE PEOPLE CAN STOP THIS LEGALISED THEFT & FORCED POVERTY BY SIMPLY SIGNING THIS PETITION & FORCE THE ISSUE TO BE BROUGHT UP IN PARLIAMENT SO WE CAN TELL THEM 'NO'!!!!!!
