        "additional_details": "Recently revealed plans show police forces planning to use private workers on the beat. Company employees are responsible for profit, not to the public; therefore they cannot properly fulfil a policing role. They will not prioritise the public, nor be responsible to us.\r\n\r\nSupporting victims and witnesses should not be a source of profit. Crimes should not be investigated based on their cost-efficiency. Private companies should not be able to decide whether to detain us, nor control those in custody.\r\n\r\nFurther, the police should not be divided by being employed by the public or private sectors. They should have one priority, be responsible to the same degree, and anyone policing us should be refereed by the IPCC.\r\n\r\nThe police on the beat should be police. They cannot afford to be if they have to suffer the 20% cuts. Ask the government to rethink this and the cuts to police.
