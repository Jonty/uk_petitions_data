Greeks would be forced to lower prices to accommodate the direct tax- this would be money Greeks don't even get their hands on so they can't fiddle the taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you buy a BMW from Germany there would be none of this euro-VAT since they have a low deficit. All countries (even outside the euro) could pay the tax for that countries products. The money would then be used to pay off the deficits when they go broke. (it would be like a limited deficit dependent export duty)",
