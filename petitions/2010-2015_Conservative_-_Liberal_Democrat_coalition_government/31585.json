        "additional_details": "The government should create a centralised body that works within a single framework therefore creating a level playing field for resources and funds available to people with learning disabilities in the UK.  Eradicating the current postcode lottery we have at present.\r\nIt may have smaller offices throughout the UK with administration and assessment duties.\r\n(Similar to the present Independent Living Fund model).  The difference being that the local authority should be relieved of their role of funding allocation, that in some cases presently doubles up on the work done by ILF.  The centralised body would have ring fenced funds for allocation to services for people with a learning disability from their birth to death.  Currently there are too many bodies involved obviously increasing cost of delivery and repeating work unnecessarily.  This organisation should deal specifically with people with a learning disability and should be separated from the generic umbrella term of \u201cDisability\u201d.",
