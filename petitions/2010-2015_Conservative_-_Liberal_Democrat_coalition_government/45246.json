        "additional_details": "Calling a judge to judicial review is onerous under current guidelines as no presiding judge will wish to find against a fellow judge. The existing review procedure is weighted against petitioners and strong discouragement against proceeding is meted out by the Ministry of Justice even in cases where the offending judge has admitted an obvious error.\r\nThe purpose of law is that no matter how high your station, you are within the confines of the law, and accountable.\r\nThe Government is requested to create a mandatory procedure whereby judicial reviews are carried out by a panel of assessors, said panel to include non-judicatory persons to ensure reasonable and equitable conduct. Judges and courts are responsible to the public for providing justice under the law but where that justice is biased due to errors human and otherwise, judges are immune from correction and, if necessary, disciplinary charges or prosecution.\r\nThat is not justice and legal remedy is sought via this petition.
