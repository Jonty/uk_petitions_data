        "action": "Remove Michael Gove as Secretary of State for education",
        "additional_details": "After a virtually unanimous vote against his policies from the professionals who work within the education system, I feel that allowing Michael Gove to continue as secretary of state for this department would be hugely detrimental to the education system within this country. His support of school inspectors over teachers represents a dangerously imbalanced perspective and highlights his inadequacies to proceed within his current position. His inability to listen and work with teachers has created an irreparable division and if he continues in this role, the future educational welfare of the children of this country and their mostly excellent teachers will be jeopardised therefore I suggest he should be removed from his position with immediate effect. Thank you for reading.       ",
