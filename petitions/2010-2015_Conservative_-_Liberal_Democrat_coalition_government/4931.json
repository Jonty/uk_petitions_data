And of course the risk is not with the Annuity provider. I am uninsurable for life assurance but strangely my annuity rate is normal - talk about having your cake and eating it.\r\nPP holders have sacrificed over the years to make provision and then to be forced to make a gamble that is loaded not to their advantage is wrong.\r\nI want to make a genuine choice at my retirement - not forced into only one.",
