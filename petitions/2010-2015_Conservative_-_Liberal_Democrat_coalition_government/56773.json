You cannot put a price tag on the safe-keeping of people's lives and livelihoods. Commuter cyclists grow in number each year and are contributing to a greener, more sustainable future. Government and local authorities have no excuse then to not invest in the building of (proper) cycle lanes and encourage better vigilance and respect between motorists and cyclists alike. The deaths of cyclists in the capital need not have been in vain, we should learn from these mistakes and pave the way for sustainable, multi-vehicular transport system across the nation. ",
