        "additional_details": "Whilst acknowledging the short term pain of increasing taxation, especially in the current financial circumstances, we, the undersigned, believe that continued increasing road use by vehicles using the internal combustion engine is detrimental to the long term future of the planet. Rather than leaving the costs to future generations to manage the clearup, we request that HM Treasury continues its policy of increasing taxation on fossil fuels above inflation, and petitions HMG to negotiate with the EU that UK fuel tax can be levied on vehicles arriving from the remainder of the EU to cover the differential in prices, so that current users pay the full economic cost of their activity.",
