Both the Electrical Safety Council and Recall UK are pushing for Government action to improve the way product recalls are handled by the manufacturers, however the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has stated that 'In our view the current obligations on manufacturers are quite strong and effective'.\r\n\r\nThe Government should improve the current regulations by creating a central recall communication team, creating a national product recall website, setting minimum recall communication requirements and publicising critical recall data.",
