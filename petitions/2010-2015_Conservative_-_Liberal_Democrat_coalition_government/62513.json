        "additional_details": "Sadly the Sophie's Choice petition closed 3 days ago without reaching the number of signatures required. The age in England is 25 for your first smear test, this is based on it taking 10 years for an abnormal cell to turn cancerous, this figure is based on cervical cancer being linked to sexual intercourse. Some cases aren't linked to sexual intercourse. The age limit is lower in Scotland and Wales so this should be reflected here in England. The age limit should be lowered to 18 for all females in the UK, sign his and help save lives",
