If all ISPs had to purchase Copyright Licences to cover legal downloading of media such as music and films on the Internet by their subscribers, the money raised from the sale of the Copyright Licences could be given to the music and film industries, which would mean that all the people working in those industries would be fairly rewarded for their work. The ISPs could then charge their subscribers a small additional fee on top of their regular monthly charge, say and extra \u00a31 to \u00a32, to recover the cost of the Copyright Licence fee that they themselves had to pay. In this way, downloading would become legal for EVERYONE with Internet access, but the music and film industries would also receive adequate remuneration and the ISPs wouldn't be out of pocket, so EVERYONE would benefit!",
