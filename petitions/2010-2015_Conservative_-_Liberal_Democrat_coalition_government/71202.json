        "additional_details": "I know of no other utility or organisation that makes an additional charge for direct debit payments. Often utilities offer a discount for paying by direct debit as it is overall a cheaper collection mechanism than traditional call centres or taking credit card payments.\r\n\r\nWhy then does the vehicle tax attract a 5% surcharge for direct debit payment?\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, petition the government to abolish this additional charge which is simply designed to extract another few pounds from a consumer who is trying to manage his monthly finances in a regular way and doing this by using  a standard and very common payment method these days.\r\n\r\n",
