This type of hiring practice not only perpetuates discrimination but it further injures our economic recovery as a nation.\r\nYou need a job to pay off debts, but you can't get a job because of your debt - when will the government do something about this discrimination?\r\nHow does hiring someone to do a job have anything to do with their credit? When did hiring someone have anything to do with anything other than their qualifications and abilities?\r\nHow can the elimination of a hard working and qualified candidate because of a County Court Judgment or IVA be right? First penalized by the economy, now penalized by employers. How is the workforce supposed to recover? We should be questioning laws that allow any kind of discrimination in the work force.\r\n",
