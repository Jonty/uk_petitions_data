        "additional_details": "Restore Britain's car industry instead of importing these European and Asian 'bubble cars' that were designed by computers and the wind tunnel. Keep the classic British car image and designs such as the Morris Minors and Rover P4s - the way auto-mobiles should be, stylish, characteristic and serviceable in the working-man's own garage instead of being ripped off by commercial garages. Britain having an actual car industry would create so many more jobs as well, and not to mention the profit the country would make if the public were encouraged to buy British made cars.",
