        "additional_details": "During this period of austerity and budget cuts, it surely cannot be good use of public money to provide funding for meals that parents could easily pay for themselves. I work in a school and have observed pupils having school meals - portion control is quite restrictive and this coupled with aversion to healthy choices will not solve childhood obesity. Kids will fill up later on whatever is available that they prefer.Logistics indicate that the length of school day would need to be altered to accommodate the extra uptake of \"free\" meals- My school has 500 pupils - how does govt hope to get KS1 through in the designated half hour? But govt has already indicated the intention for schools to be open longer ! When will parents be able to interact with their own children ?",
