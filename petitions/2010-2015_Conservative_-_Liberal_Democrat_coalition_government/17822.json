This system allows for trains to run at higher speeds than the current proposed HS2, does not require the overhead infrastructure of the proposed HS2 so reducing the visual impact of HS2.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to look into all rail alternatives and not just go with the current standard when better technologies exist.",
