Education is a privilege and these vandals do NOT deserve to cause this much pain and destruction and still have most things handed to them. They felt the need to prove they are in control by destroying peoples lives, homes and business's. What did these innocent people do to deserve this? These criminals think they are hard done by as they don't have the latest phones or trainers, what about the families that struggle to make ends meet by working 14-18 hour days in their shop/pub/cafe, to have it destroyed. To then have to figure out how their going to pay the bills at the end of the month, how they are going to feed their families and how this has affected the whole future.\r\nThey NEED to learn the world doesn't owe them anything, they are NO different to anyone else.",
