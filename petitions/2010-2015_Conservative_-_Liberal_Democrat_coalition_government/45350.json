I don't live in London and I'm being made to pay for this project. It will not help people that do not live IN London.\r\n\r\n'Max. estimated impact on bills is \u00a370-80 per year' as stated on a Thames Water leaflet but this is still a major cost to all our rising bills.I am on a meter and my yearly bill at present is only around \u00a3170.
