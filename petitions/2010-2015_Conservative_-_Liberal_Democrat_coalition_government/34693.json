        "additional_details": "\r\nI want NICE & the Dept of Health to make inhaled mannitol available on the NHS for children & young people with cystic fibrosis (CF).\r\n\r\nThese children suffer frequent illness and hospital admissions, and many still die in their 20\u2019s. Mannitol is the ONLY inhaled treatment which helps rid their lungs of the thick, sticky mucus which makes it hard for them to breathe and causes chest infections and lung damage. It has been approved by the European Medicines Agency, yet  NICE has suggested it should NOT be available on the NHS. Mannitol can reduce suffering and prolong lives. Please sign this petition.\r\n\r\n",
