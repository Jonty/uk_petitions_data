        "additional_details": "We have a situation in Eastleigh where local Councillors serve on the Borough Council and can vote to approve a particular measure. That measure is then referred down to the Town or Parish Council for approval, but because those Borough Councillors also serve on the lower tier they are able to vote on the measure again. If that wasn't bad enough, Borough Councillors also pop-up on the local area committee and can vote for it a third-time. The result is that certain measures (good and bad) can be easily swept through the various tiers of local Government, irrespective of what the constituents think. It is most undemocratic and very unhealthy. I want the Government to prevent this from happening and to strengthen local democracy, by making it against the law for Councillors to serve on more than one tier of Local Government.",
