        "additional_details": "I believe alcohol abuse is the cause of many problems in society. It causes anti-social behaviour, crime, family breakdowns and is a burgeoning cost to the NHS.\r\n\r\nOne radical solution is to have a personal licencing system similar to a driving licence. It would be given gratis at aged 18, but would accumulate points if the individual abuses alcohol (e.g. an assault while drunk) and would ultimaltely be revoked for serious alcohol related offenses or persistant abuse.\r\n\r\nAlthough this may at first seem illiberal, I would emphasize that the licence would specifically deal with instances where there is direct harm to society and would not stop someone from drinking what they pleased provided this was not harming others (as many are able to do so).\r\n",
