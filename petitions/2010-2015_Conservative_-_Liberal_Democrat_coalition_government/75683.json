The FCO continues to do nothing concrete to help these poor ex servicemen who were all working on anti piracy duties in the Indian ocean. Full details are available  https://www.humanrightsatsea.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/20150310-HRAS-MV-Seaman-Guard-Ohio-Report-FINAL.pdf\r\nThere are Estonian sevicemen also in this situation but their government has at least helped their people with loans etc and even awarded them one of the highest awards available for their help in making sailing safer.\r\n\r\ni can not vote for a government that leaves its own people to rot whilst quoting due process without even reading the facts.\r\ni will happily vote for a government that arranges to get  these six ex servicemen home whatever it takes\r\n",
