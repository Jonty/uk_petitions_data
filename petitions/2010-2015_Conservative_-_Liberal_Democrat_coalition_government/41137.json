        "additional_details": "This petition is to challenge the availability of antiandronic medications for child sex abusers. Pharmaceutical treatments are currently used on a voluntary basis for convicted sexual offenders. However, if an individual approaches their GP with concerns that they, themselves, are going to sexually abuse a child they are not permitted to undergo the medical treatments. I would like the government to change this so medications used to treat sex offenders is available to non-offenders on a voluntary basis. This prevents an individual standing up in court, using the excuse, \"I abused that child to receive medical treatments.\"",
