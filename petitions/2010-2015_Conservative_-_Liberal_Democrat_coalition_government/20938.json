It teaches our children nothing accept that they deserve something for nothing and that it is okay to disturb people in their homes with a tradition many people young and old find intimidating. At no other point in the year is behaviour seen during Trick or Treating acceptable in our streets.\r\n\r\nOur supermarkets continue to make money from this festival, forgetting the original purpose of Halloween itself and instead they focus on making money and encouraging inappropriate behaviour.\r\n\r\nI want to see this stop.",
