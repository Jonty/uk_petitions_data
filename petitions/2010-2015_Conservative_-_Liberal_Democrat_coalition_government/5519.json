        "additional_details": "Many Universities in the UK have courses which allow students to study subjects of little or no relevance to their own and the country's future prosperity.  The Dept. for Education should force such Universities either to close down these courses or downgrade the qualification from degree level.  Far too much money is being wasted running courses like these and too little on scientific research.",
