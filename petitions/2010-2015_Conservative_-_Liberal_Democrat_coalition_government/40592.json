        "additional_details": "This petition seeks to make it a legal requirement for publishers of explicit magazines (such as 'Lads Mags', like Nuts, Loaded and Zoo) to provide their magazines covered in a 'Modesty Wrap'. This 'wrap' is a plastic cover which hides the explicit images on the front of the magazine, with the exception of its title.\r\n\r\nWe seek to protect the eyes of young children being able to view these covers in supermarkets and newsagents, and try to stem the sexualisation of young people in our communities.",
