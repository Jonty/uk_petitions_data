        "additional_details": "We are urging the government to reconsider its decision to withhold the 1 per cent annual pay rise next year to nurses who are due to receive incremental pay rises.\r\n\r\nThe UK\u2019s 670,000-strong nursing workforce is the backbone of our NHS, and deserve to be fairly rewarded for their continued hard work and commitment.\r\n\r\nThe independent NHS Pay Review Body has recommended all NHS staff have a 1 per cent increase.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish Government has agreed to this, yet health secretary Jeremy Hunt has said only those who are not in line for an increment in 2014/15 will benefit.\r\n\r\nIgnoring this recommendation seriously undervalues the contribution nurses make to the health service every single day.\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition if you want to see nurses fairly rewarded for their hard work.\r\n",
