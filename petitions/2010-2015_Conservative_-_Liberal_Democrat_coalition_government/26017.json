        "additional_details": "Currently in America, the US Congress is attempting to pass two new pieces of legislation that will be apparently cracking down on piracy and copyright infringement.\r\nThis is only the tip of the iceberg, as in reality, it will allow media companies and internet regulators to shut down anything that could even potentially be performing acts of 'copyright infringement', without need of any warning. You might think this is fine, and a good step towards cracking down on piracy; that's where you are wrong. This includes well-known and respectable websites, such as Facebook, Youtube, and Last FM. We cannot blame these websites for what their users do, so why should they be punished?\r\n\r\nFor more, detailed information, I suggest you go to Youtube, and search up Totalbiscuit's video entitled 'WTF is SOPA?' where hopfully, most of your questions will be answered.",
