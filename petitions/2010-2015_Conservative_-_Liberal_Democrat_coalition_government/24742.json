        "additional_details": "The Well is a five bedroomed house providing supported accommodation for women leaving the sex industry; the only one of its kind in Bristol, it has been running since 2003. So far 163 women have benefited from this provision.\r\n\r\nYet Bristol City Council have begun a 10 week consultation around Homelessness Prevention High Support Services, proposing 3 things: the closure of The Well; a reduction in the number of women\u2019s bed spaces; and the provision of women's support by generic hostels which are considerably larger in size.\r\n\r\nWe are asking you to get behind this essential service. With running costs of only \u00a3150,000 per year, this is an affordable service that must be saved.\r\nIf there is no secure accommodation such as the Well, these vulnerable women will have no where to go. The Well is their only refuge in Bristol.\r\n\r\nWe therefore ask you the government to reconsider your plans, and to keep this vital service open so that vulnerable women are given a chance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
