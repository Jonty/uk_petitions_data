        "additional_details": "The situation that caring, loving seperated parents find themselves in with the csa is wholly discriminatory, unfair and it leads to bias and inappropriate labelling of the parent not receiving the Child Benefit. This is especially so for all parents, who after separation, continue to love, care and support their children equally regardless of the circumstances of the parental split. Children are needlessly being affected by the way this country labels and handles separated caring parents. There is no distinction between the loving caring separated parent who just happens not to hold the Child Benefit, and the errant feckless parent who selfishly abandons their responsibility and duty of care and support. A problem the CSA are well aware of, but do nothing to correct. This HAS to change!",
