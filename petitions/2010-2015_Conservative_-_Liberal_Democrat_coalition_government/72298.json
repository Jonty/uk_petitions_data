        "additional_details": "We as a focus group would like to raise concerns about Ofsted and its specific targeting of muslims and Islamic schools.\r\n\r\nThe Islamic schools as stated have an emphasis on Islamic topics and we base our syllabus on guidance by Ofsted.\r\n\r\nOfsted feedback on 6 Islamic schools and the media coverage as a result of this has caused grave concern about Islam and muslims.\r\n\r\nAfter discussions in groups and community leaders in London,  Birmingham , Lancashire and Yorkshire we reject Ofsted claims that any Islam related schools are at risk from extremism.\r\n\r\nWe reject extremism and would like to object to the Ofsted notion of Islamic schools have extremist ahenda  or Muslims are prone to extremism at Islamic schools.\r\n\r\nBritain is about diversity and tolerance and Ofsted reports appears to target Islamic schools tand muslims.\r\n\r\nTerrorism has been rife in Northern Ireland between 1970-1990s but no one blames Roman Catholic/protestant religion for causing the conflict.\r\n\r\n",
