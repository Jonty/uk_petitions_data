        "additional_details": "\r\nI am trying to make the medical profession have more consideration to the families of angel babies. It is hard enough to give birth to a baby with no life signs or lose a child at a young age, without having to cope with staff that has little or no consideration to our feelings. The stories I have heard are truly horrific. I have been sent emails from many parents or close friends describing incidents from mothers being ignored all day to being made to give birth over a bucket. These stories have urged me to start this campaign to make a real difference to all future families that experience their worst nightmare becoming true.\r\n\r\n facebook petition for more consideration for angel families gives more details http://www.facebook.com/groups/petitionforconsideration/doc/?id=248905405134038\r\n or email me petitionforconsideration@hotmail.co.uk",
