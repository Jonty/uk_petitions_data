        "additional_details": "Under the latest round of budget cuts by Doncaster Council it has been decided that all council run care homes will undergo a phased closure. This will mean the loss of hundreds of jobs and a number of elderly residents will be forced to leave their homes. This is totally unacceptable and it\u2019s about time someone stepped in to stop these drastic cuts!\r\n\r\nThe article below clearly highlights the impact that moves like this can have on the elderly.\r\n\r\nhttp://blogs.lse.ac.uk/healthandsocialcare/2013/06/21/the-impact-of-involuntary-nursing-home-relocation-on-health-outcomes-what-can-be-done-to-help/\r\n\r\nWe would like both Doncaster Council and the Government to reconsider their decision to close all Doncaster Council run care homes.\r\n",
