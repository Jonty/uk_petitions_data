This is also to compensate for the mental and physical trauma they went through for not having been allowed to live with their families for several years due to the third class policy that was deliberately made for the Brigade of Gurkhas.\r\n\r\nGurkhas who have served for over four years must be eligible for preserved pensions at the age of sixty years just like their British/Commonwealth counterparts.\r\n\r\nThe Gurkha widows must be treated equally like the British/Commonwealth widows in terms of pensions and other facilities.\r\n\r\n",
