        "additional_details": "The word Doctor, means teacher, it does not mean 'one who practices medicine'. This has been true since the 12 the century when the first Universities were established.\r\n\r\nThe word Doctor is therefore correctly used when one has taken the final degree and awarded a doctorate eg LLD, PhD, Litt.D, DD etc.\r\n\r\nMedical professionals in the UK have the degree MB BS or ChB and do not have a doctorate. Its use is therefore fraudulent and is contrary to regulations contained in the 1983 medical act.\r\n\r\nWe believe this use of courtesy titles should cease until medical professionals have taken the MD degree.\r\n\r\n ",
