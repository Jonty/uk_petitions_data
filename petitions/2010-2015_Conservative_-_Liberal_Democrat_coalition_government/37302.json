        "additional_details": "Across the United Kingdom, peoples view on the rights of Homosexuality can greatly differ.\r\n\r\nHowever the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill, also known as the 'Kill the gays' bill should not be one the United Kingdom should support, and funding should come to a end to ensure money from United Kingdom taxpayers, is not used to pay for the murder of human beings purely based on sexual orientation.\r\n\r\nThis petition suggests that the Parliament of the United Kingdom should officially pass into law that any country that creates laws that creates the death penalty for a individual on the sole basis of sexual orientation will also forfeit their chance to receiving any aid money by the United Kingdom.",
