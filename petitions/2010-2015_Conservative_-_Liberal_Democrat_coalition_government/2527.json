        "additional_details": "Britain is a rich nation thanks largely to being a former Imperial and Colonial power. The British have benefited from the relationship with our former colonies through a strong economy developed during the colonial period, the NHS, a healthcare sysytem that ensures high quality care to people FREE, an education sysytem also FREE and anda Welfare state that protects the poor. Our Colonies have however not shared in the benefits. Almost all have suffered chronic and absolute poverty. Aid has made little impact in the past 5 decades, with most of the Millenium Goals (remember them?) not close to be met. Increase Africa's share of world trade by 1% and it will generate many many times more than we give in Aid in a single year ",
