        "additional_details": "Terrorism, hijacking or piracies require effective counter measures like air/ship marshals, surveillance, as well as psychological profiling. Stopping or targeting an individual for further questioning or investigation on grounds of security, HM border & custom control, criminal justice, etc should not necessarily be regarded as discriminatory. Forensic psychological profiling (or personality profiling) of criminal suspects, passengers, spectators, audience, users of  services in order to effect covert surveillance, further questioning, searches & other investigations are a necessary fact of life nowadays. Potential terrorists, hijackers or pirates can be more differentiable from the rest of the populace by psychological profiling various aspects of suspects\u2019 behaviour, demeanour, country of origin, immigration status, cultural background, beliefs, habits and rituals, motives, social background, age, education, etc.",
