        "additional_details": "The UK Government must not get involved in supporting or participating in any attack on Iran over allegations that they are developing nuclear weapons. We note that the war in Iraq was justified on the basis that Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) were held by Saddam Hussein, which proved, after the deaths of thousands of innocent Iraqi citizens,(including children),and British service men and women, to be false.\r\n\r\nAny attack on Iran would risk a wave of destruction across the region. Plans for an attack, along with sanctions against Iran, must be scrapped immediately.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to publicly pledge that they will have no involvement in any military action against Iran, including not allowing Diego Garcia to be used as a launch pad for air strikes.",
