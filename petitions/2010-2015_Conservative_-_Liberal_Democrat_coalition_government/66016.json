        "additional_details": "\"Social Education\", or whatever name you give it, is compulsory in high schools across the U.K, dealing with topics like sex education, drugs, and alcohol. However, within the sex education aspect of the subject, there is crucial information not being given to young people, information about sexual assault and abuse. From my own personal experience, I have never had a lesson discussing the importance of consensual sex, and I believe that a lot of other young people haven't either. Consent is absolutely vital and isn't always as simple as yes or no. The reason the statistics for rape are so high in this country could potentially have a lot to do with the lack of education upon the subject. I believe this could be changed-an education system that leaves 17 year old sexually active boys not knowing the definition of the word \"consent\" is failing all of us. Discussion on rape and sexual assault is important, and must be made compulsory.",
