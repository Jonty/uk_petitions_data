        "additional_details": "In the eyes of most young people politics is 'boring and it is pointless' this is a very wrong statement to make. Politics has a link to nearly everything in some way shape or form. This petition is to lobby the government to make schools teach political education to every student- this will allow young people to have an insight into what politics is really about and how it shapes their country! I feel poltical education should start around year 5 and this could be some light education on the political parties and then it starts to go into more detail as they move up the education ladder. Sex education is already compulsary so why can't political education be? Having compulsary poltical education will then make young people more aware of 'why it is important to vote and who they want to vote for'. Politics is the beadrock of our great country, so lets spread the word and get young people involved!",
