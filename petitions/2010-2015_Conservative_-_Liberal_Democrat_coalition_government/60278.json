        "additional_details": "The split of 62% of fracking revenues to central governement and 1% locally is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe figures should be reversed so that 62% goes to local government and 1% to Central.\r\n\r\nThe money should be invested in 4 institutions:\r\n\r\n1.) Regional disaster relief fund which can help provide assitence in regional emergencies such as those caused by fracking.\r\n\r\n2.) Regional Infrastructure Development Bank. Guarantees and provides investment in regional infrastructure projects.\r\n\r\n3.) Scrience and Research Investment fund. Invests in angel companys and research groups.\r\n\r\n4.) Education Improvement fund. Regional fund that invests in Education.\r\n\r\nNorth west communities have suffered from years of poor growth and under investment. If communities are suffering the risks and potential environmental damge of fracking they should receive the lions share of the cut.\r\n\r\nThis would be another case of London and the south east profiting from the regions.",
