        "additional_details": "Figures released show 6.4 million carers save Britain \u00a3119 billion per year.  Carers benefit is \u00a355.55 per week for 35 hours of full-time care or \u00a31.59 per hour.  At this rate a carer paid for providing 168 hours of care would receive \u00a3267.12 per week; just under 5 times the value of carers benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\nI propose:-\r\n\r\nCarers benefit be paid for ALL hours of care provided.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining in care (manual handling, drug administration etc) be offered to safeguard the health of carers and those for whom they provide care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarers leaving their caring role be offered free training to update their working skills and knowledge to support a return to the job market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarers perform their daily tasks out of a mixture of love, concern, responsibility and respect for the person or persons they care for; it would be both a decent and financially responsible action to choose to help them to carry on their vital  work in supporting the most vulnerable members of our society.\r\n\r\n",
