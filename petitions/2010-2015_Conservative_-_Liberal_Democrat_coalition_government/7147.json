        "additional_details": "There are many young directionless youths in this country who would benefit from National Service by teaching them self discipline and giving them the opportunity to learn that there is life outside of their own, often hopeless, environments. A classic example of what such hopelessness spawns is the riots this weekend in Tottenham.  National Service would give young men the chance to make something of their lives by following strong, positive leaders and in doing so would make our towns and cities better places to live in.",
