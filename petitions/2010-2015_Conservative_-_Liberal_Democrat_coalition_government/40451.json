        "additional_details": "We call on the government to recognise that austerity isn\u2019t working and to develop an alternative that will provide decent jobs, rising prosperity for all and maintain high quality public services.  People across the UK face the steepest fall in living standards in living memory, long term unemployment, job insecurity and huge cuts to public services.   We note that policies being pursued by the government  to cut back spending are making matters worse  \u2013 prolonging the economic crisis, hurting consumer confidence and resulting in higher borrowing.  As such we call for the government to adopt an alternative approach that prioritises investment, growth and decent jobs, as well as measures to boost wages for households on low to middle incomes who continue to see their living standards squeezed.",
