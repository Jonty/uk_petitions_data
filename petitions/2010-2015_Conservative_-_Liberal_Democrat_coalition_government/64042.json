We are told to vary our passwords.  If you have to remember dozens of them, you have to record a list and that list can be hacked into.  We have recently been told of a major breach of security and we have been advised to change all our passwords!\r\n\r\nWe only need passwords for our bank cards and our personal communcations (emails, Skype etc).  We do not need to dream up separate passwords for different companies in order to buy the odd book, pizza, peanut or ironing board.\r\n\r\nIf we reduce the number of useless passwords, we reduce the need for lists and we reduce the risk of being hacked.\r\n\r\nOnly companies who can justify the need for a separate password should be allowed to demand one.  License them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
