        "additional_details": "Considering rising inflation and rising energy prices there is increased pressure on household budget. Government members including the Prime minister have expressed concern and sympathy towards the ordinary citizens who are struggling. Unfortunately these words of sympathy have not been met with any concrete action. Recent energy summit was a white wash.\r\nGovernment can reduce VAT specifically on energy bills as it will mitigate some of the effect of the huge increase in energy prices.",
