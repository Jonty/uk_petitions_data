        "additional_details": "This petition is to raise awareness of animals and the conditions some are kept in. I want the government to allow humans the right to free an animal in the event of proven abuse or neglect. This however, needs evidence and needs to be assessed as so before action can be taken, however, people should be allowed to question the final decision. I feel it's too much to wait around for charities to help animals as most don't, won't or don't have the funding. People should be entitled to care for the animals of this earth and if one is in danger, we should be allowed the right to act.",
