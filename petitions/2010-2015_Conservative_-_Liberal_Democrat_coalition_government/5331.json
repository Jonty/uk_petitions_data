        "additional_details": "It's high time the world government took a rational approach to the spiralling debt problem on our Earth. We have dug ourselves into a deep hole we can never scrabble our way out from; and the situation will only get worse. People are dying through war famine and pestilence across the globe. It's high time we resolved  and set to rights the errors of the past. With one small vertical strike over the - precursing the number with far too many ' 0 's on the total sheet that signifies international debt, the big red - will, suddenly, become a big black + so, therefore, every negative balance then becomes a positive. Every debt in the world suddenly becomes a credit, every arrears an advance; meaning everyone benefits and we all get money to rebuild our economies. Job done. World Financial Crisis over, Poverty becomes Fortune. Ultimately; it's not like we owe the money to some other planet;- We Owe It To Ourselves.. Peace Love Unity :)\r\nAmen to that.",
