We can now see the benefits that devolution and  levels of autonomy have brought to Scotland, Wales and N Ireland.\r\nWe petition Parliament to debate the breaking-up of the UK Union, thus allowing the creation of  four independent nation states.\r\nEach of these four nations will then have their own parliament and government, and will be responsible for raising their own taxes, deciding how to spend them, and how to develop and manage their own economy.\r\nThe four home nations when independent will be able to choose the levels of cooperation they seek with the other home nations on an issue by issue basis, and may choose to keep the Monarchy, Sterling and the shared use of defence and overseas representation. But, these decisions and others will be made by  voters and elected representatives in each of the home nations and not as now imposed on them by London.",
