What do the Government expect the carer to live on?\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, carers save this country millions of pounds and as such, they should not be penalised by having their benefit stopped.\r\n\r\nThe government should realise that the carer is not well themselves and neither is the person that they are caring for.",
