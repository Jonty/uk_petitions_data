We hope this is helpful.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem for citizens is the ability of the officials one company to incur huge debts before going into self-administration on one day before opening up another new company the following day by simply changing the order of the letters in the company name and, as a result, be no longer responsible for the debts of the old company.  Any CEO, Chairman, Director of a company going into self administration MUST be banned from being involved in any new companies for a MINIMUM of 10 years from going into administration with the old company.",
