        "additional_details": "621 young people between the age of 15-24 committed suicide in the UK in 2011. We need Mental Health classes in schools for children over the age of 11 to educate and help vulnerable children. Knowledge is power, and we need to empower the younger generations.\r\nMental illnesses can develop at any age so it is best to raise awareness of depression and bipolar disorder, especially in today's society with the increasing risk of cyber bullying and online influences.\r\nWe need to ensure that children do not feel alone and  that they do not suffer in silence.
