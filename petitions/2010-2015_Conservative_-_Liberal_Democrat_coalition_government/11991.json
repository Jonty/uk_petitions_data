        "additional_details": "This petition is to ask the government to make it illegal for schools and academies to use people without Qualified Teacher Status to cover, supervise and teach classes in England.\r\n\r\nThe government talks about improving teaching standards and of supporting the professional status of teachers, but fails to address the issue that it is estimated that around 1 in 5 teachers are either unemployed or working on supply due to the lack of permanent posts. This is while schools are allowed to recruit cover supervisors, instructors, HLTA's and TA's to teach lessons. This cannot be good for education and if it is allowed to continue will not see standards improve.\r\n\r\nThat is why we are asking the government to follow Scotlands lead and introduce the rule making it a legal requirement for anyone supervising, covering and teaching classes to have QTS.",
