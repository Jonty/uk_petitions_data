        "additional_details": "I think that we can all agree that the benefit system has been abused terribly by european and non european nationals alike but i would like to suggest a step i think the government should take to prevent abuse by non uk nationals.\r\n\r\nI believe that all foreign nationals should not be entitled to uk benefits as soon as they arrive into the UK as they have not contributed to british society through paying taxes. I believe foreign nationals should work and pay taxes for a minimum of 5 cumulative years before they are entitled to any form of benefits. This will prevent the benefit tourism in the UK and the drain on public funds and it should have a knock-on effect on the influx of immigration.\r\n\r\nThe UK have a responsibility towards the UK and it's public purse and to make sure that the money is used wisely.",
