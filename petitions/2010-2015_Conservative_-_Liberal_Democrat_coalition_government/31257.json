The competition could be held biannually or quad annually and invitations could be issued to nations that are not necessarily close allies so as to foster mutual understanding and the exchange of ideas in the field as is currently done between air forces and in other military fields.\r\nAdditional benefits of this competition would be:\r\n\r\n-\tTo help demonstrate the continued importance of the Royal Armoured Corps and its role within the British military.\r\n\r\n-\tEncourage the retention and development of skills and new technology and act as a recruitment tool.\r\n\r\n-\tAct as a sales point for the British Defence industry as a demonstrator for their products.\r\n",
