The mobile operators seem to care very little about this especially as it's the quality of their network service that is disputed.\r\n\r\nWhere poor service is experienced, the operators should be compelled by law to offer compensation and/or termination of contract.\r\n\r\nI think this is only fair as we give so much money to them whether they perform or not.",
