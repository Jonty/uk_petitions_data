The commonwealth office and Ministry of Health should have a direct impact to help get rid of alarming death rate. The expertise and provision of healthcare materials will go a long way to help stamp out  Ebola. UK goverment help stop the rebel war just in time and the Ebola outbreak is proving just like a war on the people of Sierra Leone.
