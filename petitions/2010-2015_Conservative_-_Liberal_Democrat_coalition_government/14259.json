        "additional_details": "Genetic screening to prevent and therefore to weed out carriers of crippling genetic diseases for future generations is an ethical cause. Abortion is a serious affair and should only be performed for identified incurable crippling genetic diseases of embryos or to save the pregnant mothers\u2019 lives; not for convenience, social or innocuous psychological conditions of mothers. Abortion on embryos should not be done for innocuous curable characteristics like the colour of hair or for clef lips. Human embryos less than 13 weeks old are a group of cells without consciousness. Also billions of potential embryos are rejected every minute in nature from becoming potential living beings. Therefore abortion for embryos with incurable crippling genetic diseases should preferably be done for embryos less than 13 weeks old. However due to the series tests needed to support the medical grounds for abortion, it may not always be possible for an abortion to be much less than 24 weeks of pregnancy.",
