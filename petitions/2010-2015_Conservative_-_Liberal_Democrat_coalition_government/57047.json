        "additional_details": "UK Citizenship for Naturalised citizens is a privilege and should be regarded as such. Privileges should be deprived from those who abuse it and in so doing betray the many advantages UK Citizenship carries. I propose the Government introduce a law to revoke the UK Citizenship, and deport to the country of origin, all those UK naturalised individuals who facilitate, seek to gain material benefit, or otherwise dishonestly enable sham marriages to secure a right to remain in the UK. I believe this to be an important step towards better restoring pride and respect of being a UK National while also safeguarding our Borders and resources.\r\n\r\nReply",
