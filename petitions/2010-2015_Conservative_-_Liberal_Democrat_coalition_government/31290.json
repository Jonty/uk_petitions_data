        "additional_details": "This is analogous to border checks in England & Wales to prevent illegal immigration from Eire. The time to debate, discuss & contingency plan on this issue is now. HMG must insist that an independent Scotland find the resources herself to secure her borders, in addition to free NHS, prescriptions, schooling and higher education, as well as funding affairs of state like: border checks, immigration, Scottish passports & driving licences, embassies, foreign affairs, EU membership, civil service, Inland Revenue, momentary system, policing, prisons, legal aid, welfare benefits, etc, etc. Independent Scotland\u2019s economy may well be stretched. Also new RN warships may not be built in an independent Scotland.",
