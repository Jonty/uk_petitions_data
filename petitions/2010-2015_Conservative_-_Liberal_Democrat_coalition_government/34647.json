        "additional_details": "Due to government cuts youth clubs, that provide young people somewhere safe to go at night, are being closed. Youth workers who are supportive of young people are being axed, because of government cuts. Drugs, alcohol and career's advice are being stopped by young people's services in school.\r\n\r\nThe government wonder why youth-related crime is on the rise. Being a young person myself, i think it is wrong that young people vandalise and lots more but yet i don't blame them because when they are out they have nothing better to do.\r\n\r\nIf more funds were directed at youth clubs and youth workers then we would see a massive drop in youth related crime and young people will be able to have a fun time again and we can be more like children then just being thrown out on the street because of the government cutting funds in youth related work.\r\n\r\nPlease join this e-petition and lets bring the fun times back.\r\n\r\n",
