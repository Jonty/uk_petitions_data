        "additional_details": "Vivisection is a scientific fraud and is responsible for deaths of millions of animals and hundreds of animals every single year\r\n\r\nLess than 2% of human illnesses (1.16%) are ever seen in animals.  Over 98% never affect animals.\r\n\r\n92% of drugs passed by animal tests immediately fail when first tried on humans because they\u2019re useless, dangerous or both\r\n\r\nVioxx was shown to protect the heart of mice, dogs, monkeys and other lab animals.  It was linked to heart attacks and strokes in up to 139,000 humans.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call for a complete ban on vivisection Whether it is in Universities OR in Privet Animal Testing Laboratories ",
