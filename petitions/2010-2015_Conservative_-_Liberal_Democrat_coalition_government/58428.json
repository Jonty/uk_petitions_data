This is rubbish.\r\n\r\nUniversal Credit is about cutting the Social Security bill meaning millions will be worse off.\r\n\r\nOnce fully implemented Universal Credit :-\r\n\r\nWill mean easier sanctioning forcing people to live off nothing.\r\n\r\nHousing subsidy will be time limited forcing more to be homeless.\r\n\r\nSupport for child care drastically cut.\r\n\r\nDisability elements cut or abolished altogether.\r\n\r\nThousands of small businesses will be forced out of business.\r\n\r\nSome rates are lower than current benefit rates.\r\n\r\nFor the unemployed UC will eventually become time-limited.\r\n\r\nThe government has so far wasted hundreds of millions in IT and other failures but even they admit the benefit savings will be in the BILLIONS.\r\n\r\nBILLIONS taken from the needy and most vulnerable in society.
