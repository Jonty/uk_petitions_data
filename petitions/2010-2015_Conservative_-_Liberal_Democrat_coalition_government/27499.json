In all cases all proposals be supported by the UN.\r\nIn the case of Iraq the entire electorate was misled and without  any accountability the electorate was left with the bill by way of austerity measures imposed. Double standards were adopted.\r\nThere is a serious need to prevent reoccurrence of Iraq and give assurance that restrictions have been put in place for the safety of the electorate so that they will not be once again left with the bill for negligence, We  simply cannot afford it.\r\nSadly we have moved from the policy of promoting peace and British Trade to the US policy of aggression and regime change, reducing trade and tarnishing Britain\u2019s international repute.\r\nAusterity will not succeed without Parliamentary reform. .\r\n\r\n",
