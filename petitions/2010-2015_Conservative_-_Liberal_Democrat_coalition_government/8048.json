        "additional_details": "Looking at the Houses of Commons we regularly see MPs standing in the doorways and on steps if this was the O2 or any other public venue it would be shut down on H&S grounds. I propose that we cut 20% of MPs (same as Civil Servant reductions) to relieve this issue and reduce costs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore when in the House of Commons they should set an example to society by not interrupting those speaking with geers or other legible comments or noise. By doing this they will show respect for each other and hopefully set an example to the County how we should conduct ourselves in a respectful manner. Unfortunately bad manners is a widespread issue, luckily not universal to everyone, but we need to see role models and the MPs need to do this. The country must come first not party political point scoring. The US Senate is a good example of how the House should work.",
