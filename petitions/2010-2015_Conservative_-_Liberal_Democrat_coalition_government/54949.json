After the controversy of Robin Thicke's song 'Blurred Lines' promoting rape and lad culture, I believe laws should be introduced to censor music that is played on radio and in public places further than the 'Parental Advisory' symbol as messages of a harmful nature are constantly being blasted over the radio and into the public conscience. This includes rape, lad, drug and violent culture. ",
