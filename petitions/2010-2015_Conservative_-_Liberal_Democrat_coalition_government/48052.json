        "additional_details": "There should be no bans on videogames due to the fact that videogames are art, it is incorrect to state that violent videogames are to blame for violence in children as it is in fact the parents fault for buying the game for their children in the first place. Every violent game has an age rating on it and children who are not of the age requirement shouldn't be playing these games anyway. Bans of this nature not only harm the communities involved, but also harm the economies all over the world.\r\n\r\nThe actions I wish to have taken place are for any petitions about the banning of any type of videogame to be rejected and for punishments for those who buy age restricted games for minors to be put in place.",
