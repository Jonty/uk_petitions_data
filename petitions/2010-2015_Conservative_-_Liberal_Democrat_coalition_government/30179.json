You cannot expect us not to feel racist when so much of the problems here today are because of huge amounts of people who come here draining all our resources. Life has become intolerable here today and we, the indigenous people have no voice or anyone to speak for us.Is it any wonder there is so much racism around. We cannot keep supoorting the rest of the world whilst neglecting our own that is why we have so much crime.",
