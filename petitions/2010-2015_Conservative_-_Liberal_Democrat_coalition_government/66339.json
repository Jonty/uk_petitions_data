        "additional_details": "England has an excellent food hygiene inspection regime, covering all food outlets, in the form of the Food Standards Agency's Food Hygiene Ratings Scheme.\r\n\r\nHowever, in England, following inspection, there is no requirement for the food outlet to display the results.   Inevitably,  the bad operator is able to hide a poor score from customers.\r\n\r\nThis is aggravated by too little publicity for the Scheme resulting in a customer base that is largely unsuspecting.\r\n\r\nAn inevitable correlation exists between poor standards of food hygiene in premises and general bad practice and we must not allow this gap in the law to fuel the next food scandal.\r\n\r\nEngland must follow the example of other countries within the United Kingdom and ensure that Food Hygiene Ratings are properly displayed at all food outlets.",
