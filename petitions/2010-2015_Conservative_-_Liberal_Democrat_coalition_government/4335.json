        "additional_details": "By halfing the military budget from 36 billion to 18 billion, frontline services and councils and charity supported services could be brought back into abundance. There is no point in spending billions on Weapons, Millions on missiles, tanks, etc when people at home are suffering from a lack of support. The wars are a huge waste of money. The 18 billion saved could be spread across education, the NHS, Councils, the paying of national debt and would make the present goverment go down in history as one of the most intelligent goverments in the last 100 years.",
