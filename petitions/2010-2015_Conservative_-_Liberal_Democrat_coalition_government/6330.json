Developement of this scale would kill communities, creating urban sprawl a loss of identity and untold pressure on infrastructure. Not to mention the loss of valuble farming land, and wildlife. The damage to the environment would be huge and totally irreversable. We simply cannot stand by and let everthing be destroyed by short termist law makers who do not realise the long term consequences of their actions.\r\n\r\nOur population is growing but there are other ways to tackle this such as restricting our borders.
