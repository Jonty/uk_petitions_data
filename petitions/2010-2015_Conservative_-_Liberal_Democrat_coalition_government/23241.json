        "additional_details": " The war on drugs has failed, said a government minister from the very department this petition is addressed to. Change is necessary. Countries, such as Portugal, who have more liberal drugs laws and choose to treat addicts as victims rather than criminals see reduced rates of drug abuse and an increase in people seeking help with their addiction. If the government were to license and strictly monitor certain pharmicies, they could control the amount they dealt and ensure a new batch of stronger heroin didn't suddenly hit the street and claim the lives of three or four addicts. A small tax, the cost offset by the smaller price the pharmacy would charge, would be re-invested in education and persuading people not to abuse drugs. The government should legalise drugs and supply and regulate them to close down the illegal gangs who make such large profits and begin to persuade rather than miserabely fail in forcing people away from drugs.",
