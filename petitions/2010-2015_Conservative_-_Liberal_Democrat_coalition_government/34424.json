Campaign of not drink driving, and random on-the-spot checks will be more fruitful.\r\n\r\nMany lives have been lost by drink-driving, the government is not doing enough to reduce this number, and whilst EU rules are 50/100ml for once GB should set a trend and reduce this limit more.\r\n\r\nIt is not penalising the sensible, it's coming down hard on the irresponsible.
