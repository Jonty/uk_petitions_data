        "action": "Reduce domestic supply voltage to 230v",
        "additional_details": "The European Community domestic supply voltage is 230 volts. All appliances are rat for 230volts.  It is not necessary to supply at 240voltd.  Domestic power supply companies in the UK produce 240v  {plus or minus 10%}. If the national grid and power supply companies were to supply at 230 volts every household in the country would receive 8% less domestic bills. The subsequent drop in supply would increase the resilience of the UK supply network therefore reducing our dependence on costly fossil fuels.",
