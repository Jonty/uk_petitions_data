        "additional_details": "We wish the government to bring into force a complete ban on all gambling advertisement in this country. These advertisements not only make television viewing and internet browsing highly unpleasant, but encourage those who do not ordinarily gamble to do so and also encourages those who are trying to stop gambling to continue. In an economy where we need growth through people saving money then spending in the right way and the avoidance of huge personal debt, it would be a step in the right direction all advertisements encouraging people to gamble to be banned.",
