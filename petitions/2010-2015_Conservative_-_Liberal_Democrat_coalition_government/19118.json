However, more & more lakes are being designated dog-free zones denying dogs the ability to partake in a healthy & natural activity - swimming.\r\n\r\nThis petition aims to emphasize the urgent need to designate at least one lake or pond in each of Britain's National Nature Reserves as dog-friendly. This will allow dog owners to take their dogs swimming in specific areas without risk of harming local wildlife.",
