        "additional_details": "The BBC expect everyone who owns a TV to legally hold a valid TV licence. However with the BBC now moving TV channels like BBC3 online only, the BBC should now be limiting access to iplayer services by licence number and passwords only. I want the government to hold a debate to either scrap the licence fee or bring the rules of the need of a licence into the 21st century for it to include access via iplayer through licence number and passwords. If the BBC did this they can generate more income by allowing anyone in the world to purchase a licence, enabling them to access anywhere in the world. It's simply unfair to charge those who have a TV, yet nearly everyone can access via a computer or tablet over wifi without the need to prove they have a licence.",
