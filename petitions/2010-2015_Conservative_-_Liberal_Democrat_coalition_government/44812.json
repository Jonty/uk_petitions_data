People may have died under the unfluence of cannabis, but its not a direct cause of death.\r\n\r\nCannabis is proven to stop production, and kill cells, including cancer, so it has medicinal purposes too.\r\n\r\nOverdosing on cannabis is physically impossible as an un-imaginable amount of cannabis needs to be consumed in a extremely short period of time. It is not physically possible to do so.",
