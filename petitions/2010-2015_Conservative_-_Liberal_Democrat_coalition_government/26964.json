        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to consider that because truck drivers need to have designated rest periods, the small amount of service facilities in place at the moment throughout the UK, restrict where a driver can safely and securely park. More service facilities should become available, at an affordable price and preferably subsidised, to allow drivers to rest adequately and then continue with their work. Truck drivers are the backbone of this country and deserve to be treated with a certain level of respect. UK wide dedicated service facilities are very much needed.",
