Miles they do in the month are paid for petrol used and wear and tear on their cars.\r\n\r\nThey are paid for the miles they on their pay slips each month. On that pay slip they are taxed again by both Income Tax and National Insurance so in reality they are taxed 4 times to fill up with petrol. Also when their car needs repairing they again get charged VAT.\r\n\r\nHow on Earth is this fair or right? I want the government to debate this and make it fair and stop taxing people 4 times when the majority of people pay the tax to fill their cars. ",
