        "additional_details": "Currently drivers of motor vehicles who use a non hands free mobile telephone whilst driving their vehicle on a road are dealt with by means of Fine and Fixed Penalty. Usually this is a \u00a360 fine and three points. Research has shown that use of mobile phones whilst driving is dangerous. Despite the current penalty drivers continue to disregard the law. This petition is for the government to increase the penalty to a fine and mandatory disqualification of 2 to 6 months.",
