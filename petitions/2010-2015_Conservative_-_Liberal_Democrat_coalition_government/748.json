        "additional_details": "Too often the police reps say we do not have the resources to police the road in Cairnryan and catch/deter motorists from speeding. This small village has now got 2 major ferry ports running out of it (P&O and Stena Line) carrying almost 2million passengers a year along with hundreds of thousands of 40+ ton trucks. Cairnryan is now the gateway to Ireland from Scotland and If the police do not have the manpower to police the speeding problem then the installation of fixed average speed cameras would police the problem for them. The police cannot come up with a solid argument to oppose these cameras so why are we still waiting?",
