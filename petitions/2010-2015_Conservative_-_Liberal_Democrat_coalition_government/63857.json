We are proud of England's multi-culturalism, but sick of the pride in being English being associated with right-wing fanaticism.\r\nThe union of England and Scotland in 1707 was overwhelmingly opposed by Scottish people: had a referendum been called then it would have been thrown out in a landslide.\r\nScottish and Welsh people are sick of being dictated to by a Westminster government, just as we are sick of being forced into a nationality that does not exist - Britishness.\r\nGive us a vote in the Scottish independence elections  (after all, it affects us as much as them) and we will see the will of the people.",
