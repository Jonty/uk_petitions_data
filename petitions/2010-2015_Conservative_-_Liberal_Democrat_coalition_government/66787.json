Thankfully I got away with just a few stitches and a black eye... If it was a little lower I could have lost my eye sight. Public houses and clubs should be made to use plastic glasses and bottels (even if it's just on weekends)  to reduse the risk of people being bottled or glassed whilst on a night out.\r\n\r\n",
