        "additional_details": "Although support for veterans has increased over recent years with many generous and helpful charities being set up, the government still aren't doing enough in certain areas. Injured and wounded service men and women still aren't being given the help they need when it is needed most after leaving the services. This also includes the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) and the War Disablement Pension (WDisP). People who are injured or wounded aren't getting the compensation they deserve, aren't getting it quickly enough and in some cases aren't getting any at all. Due to severe undermanning decisions are taking far too long to resolve and in some cases it is taking years of appeals. Quality of life is affected while decisions are made which could otherwise be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to re-asses how veterans are looked after and if necessary launch an investigation in to how Veterans UK operates, the compensation that it offers and the time taken to resolve cases.\r\n",
