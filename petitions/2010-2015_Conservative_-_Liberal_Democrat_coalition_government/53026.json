        "additional_details": "Despite the Government policy Valuing People Now 2009, Health Visitor education does not currently include any training on working with parents with a learning disability.\r\nSome parents with mild Learning disabilities do not meet adult learning disability team service criteria. Unfortunately research shows parents with learning disabilities are more likely to have their children removed from their care.\r\nWith More training Health visitors could provide more in-depth early interventions to prevent child protection issues being raised.\r\nI wish the government to make such training mandatory to the Health Visiting educational programme to truly give these parents the best care possible.",
