        "additional_details": "Currently if a trade union ballots its members it can call industrial action, such as a strike, with out majority support from its members - provided that of those who respond more vote in favour than against. This is unfair on those members who do not want to strike but have not been able to reply in time. It also is unecessarily disruptive to business and government departments who are affected by strikes that do not have workers' full support.\r\nWe call for the rules to be reformed such that a strike or other industrial action can only be called with 50% or more of members responding with a vote in favour.",
