This centre is a lifeline to so many people, and if the proposals go ahead then families with young children wishing to access their local centre will need to travel over 3 miles.  This centre provides a wide range of activities and services, which are accessed by a large proportion of the local community.\r\nPlease help us to save Butterflies Children's centre",
