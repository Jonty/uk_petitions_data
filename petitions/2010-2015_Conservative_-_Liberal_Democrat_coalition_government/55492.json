        "additional_details": "Bolton Council have submitted an outline planning application for the building of five large new houses on the site of Burnthwaite Old Hall.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to stop building development of five large new houses and save this beautiful woodland area.\r\n\r\nThis area is designated Green Belt. It is one of the few remaining areas of natural woodland in the town's suburbs and a haven for wildlife including deer, owls, bats, and hedgehogs.  It hosts many protected and endangered plant species. including a swathe of bluebell woodlands in the spring.\r\n\r\nIn the twenty years since the Old Hall in the woods was demolished the area has been accessible and much used by members of the public.  It is a beautiful and much loved amenity, used by walkers, by families and children, by horse riders and cyclists.\r\n\r\nAs council owned land it should be protected for the benefit of future generations not destroyed by housing development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
