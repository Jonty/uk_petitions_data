        "additional_details": "GP surgeries should be open 24hrs, 7 days per week. This action would take pressure off our A & E services and help with all types of situations where care is needed. Considering GP salaries they should provide their services during unsociable hours. The government should debate this as there are millions of working parents who may need access out of hours, and the action would have positive economic impact across point of entry services.",
