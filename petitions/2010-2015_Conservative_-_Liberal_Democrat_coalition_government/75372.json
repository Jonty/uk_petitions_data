        "additional_details": "Rhea Page was set up on by a gang of Muslim girls they beat her up and shouted \"Kill the white sla*\" This is a racially motivated assault on one girl by 4 girls. These girls were not given prison sentences because their defence argued because of their religion they were not used to drinking alcohol. This is a disgrace no one else would escape prison sentences for a crime like this and no one should be able to on religious grounds. Rhea Page has suffered and is still suffering because of this and the girls don't show any remorse. After being told they won't go to prison one boasted on her twitter account that she can't wait to go out and it's a happy happy day. No remorse or apology. Disgusting behaviour from 4 vile women and they need to be punished. ",
