        "additional_details": "Lets face it, MC Finchy is a widely renowned Musical Talent and inspirational hero of Wigan Town, and has been an influential component of the development of Culture and Image for the disenfranchised and Impoverished youth of Wigan Town.\r\nIt is my personal view that MC Finchy is more than reasonably qualified for the Managerial position of Wigan Athletic football club, rather than any other, presumably foreign, manager due to the hours of football played on local recreational facilities with the aforementioned youth, and only with the backing of The People and the Government can we make this stunning prospect a Reality.",
