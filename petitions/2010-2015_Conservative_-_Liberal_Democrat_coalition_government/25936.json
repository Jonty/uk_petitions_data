        "additional_details": "The UK Government should review the rates of car tax for vehicles purchased before 1st March 2001 because they discriminate against the less well-off, poor and those with financial problems.\r\n\r\nMany people cannot afford to purchase a new or nearly car.\r\n\r\nFor these people, older vehicles are the only option. Car tax for cars registered before 1 March 2001 follows a standard two rate car tax system which applies depending on whether the car's engine is above or below 1549 cc. Both annual rates are expensive compared to the rates charged for new vehicles that have CO2 emissions of 185 g/km or less.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it follows, that people who cannot afford to purchase new cars outright, which this policy is designed to encourage, or who cannot secure credit to do so, are being discriminated against by incurring a higher car tax rate for the vehicles that they can afford (ie - older cars)",
