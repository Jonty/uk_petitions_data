I've worked with Mencap and been an Asst Team Manager for adults with LD. I have a psychology degree and get fed up with the lack of care in homes for vulnerable people. We all MUST make a change. That's with anyone vulnerable, the elderly very much in my thoughts. People rant on about privacy issues, ASK THE FAMILY!!! Fed up of people thinking they know better. We don't put family members into care homes through abuse SO STOP MAKING FAMILY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG!!! MP'S TAKE NOTE.",
