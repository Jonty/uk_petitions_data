        "additional_details": "This petition is to make dog on dog attacks illegal and for action to be taken on owners and dogs, through new legislation.\r\nViolent dogs should not be given several warnings to stop attacking, if they have done it once they will again.\r\nLegislation should be brought in so they are assessed after attacking and destroyed if necessary to prevent further harm to other animals.\r\n\r\nMy dog recently got violently attacked by an American Bulldog, a complete was put into the local dog warden. Since then the Dog has attacked a further two dogs and also successfully killed one. Only now are the dog wardens considering to take some form of action from a law that was created over 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has witnessed a dog on dog attack you will understand how distressing it is for owner and dog in the aftermath, and how little action can be taken!",
