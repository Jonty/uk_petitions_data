        "additional_details": "To ensure the 1975 Discrimination Act is better imposed and create a clear path to identify potential breeches in this act.\r\nOne example of this would be males being charged higher entry into nightclubs than females. This is a clear act of discrimination that happens regularly however it is very rarely reported as people are unsure of how to report such a minor incident.\r\nI propose the government setting up a website where such cases can be reported as long as significant proof is given and a system where a business can be fined and the person discriminated against receives a refund on the difference in price if significant evidence is shown.",
