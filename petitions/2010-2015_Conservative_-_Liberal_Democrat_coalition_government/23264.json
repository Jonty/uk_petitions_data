British workers contribute back into Britain by spending their money here.\r\n\r\nBritish workers are being branded lazy and unwilling to work. We are becoming a laughing stock.\r\n\r\n- Offer businesses an incentive to hire British workers\r\n- Enforce a higher tax or other deduction to non-British workers\r\n- Restrict the amount of money non-British workers can send overseas\r\n- Restrict working benefits non-British workers can claim (currently EU workers can claim tax credits and child benefit even when their children do not reside in the UK)",
