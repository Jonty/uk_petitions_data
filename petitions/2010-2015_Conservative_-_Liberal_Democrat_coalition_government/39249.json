        "action": "Removal of Ethylene Glycol from anti - freeze",
        "additional_details": "There have been a spate of cat poisonings across the UK over the past few years and months. Many cats have died or have been extremely ill after ingesting anti - freeze. Ethylene Glycol is a sweet tasting chemical and is therefore appealing to cats,however it is highly toxic and in most cases causes a slow and agonising death. The purpose of creating this petition is to urge the Government to pass a Bill in Parliment which will ensure that anti - freeze manufacturers stop using Ethylene Glycol and replace it with another substance which is not toxic. As someone who has recently lost a cat due to anti-freeze poisoning I am determined that nobody else has to go through the heartbreak of losing a much loved pet. If you feel the same way, then please sign this petition and get your friends and family to do the same.",
