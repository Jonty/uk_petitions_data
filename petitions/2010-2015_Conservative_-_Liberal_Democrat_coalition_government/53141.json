The energy wasted in this day and age when resources are being depleted is quite shocking. Building Management Systems are installed in most stores. These should be set to control the stores at a temperature that would keep areas at a reasonable temperature and doors should be fitted to all freezers and fridges. So it may take a little longer to shop but the energy saved would be enormous and the stores could reduce prices.",
