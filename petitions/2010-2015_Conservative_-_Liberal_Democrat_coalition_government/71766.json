        "additional_details": "It has recently become apparent to me that there is a significant lack of opportunities for people with a passion for off road vehicles to use them freely without the feeling of committing a crime. Specifically I feel that there are more than adequate pieces of unused land in which have potential for ATVs to be used without causing  disruption to any nearby areas due to the distance between the  densely populated area and the desolate zones. For example, Thurcrofts' ex-coal mine is commonly used, may i state illegally, as an off-road vehicle track. Personally i don't not see the issue with this as there are no close neighbouring villages, however it seems the law is determined to prevent this. With reason and careful consideration I feel it would be beneficial and satisfying if the government were to amend the law on where ATVs can be used so that there is a great choice, even if there are some slight conditions to be followed in some way or another.",
