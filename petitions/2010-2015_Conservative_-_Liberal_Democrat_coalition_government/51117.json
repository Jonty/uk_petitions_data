        "additional_details": "Lee Rigby't two killers admitted their guilt on the word stage/court, they\u2019ve behaved like animalistic barbarians and don\u2019t deserve our sympathy or compassion or rights. However, we\u2019re not Barbarians so; we\u2019ll afford them a basic human right, TO LIFE, which they robbed off poor Lee. A man who\u2019d done nothing but be a brave soldier & loving father and husband. We shouldn\u2019t waste a penny of tax payers\u2019 money on trials for these thugs! Any others involved of course should be tried, the whole world knows who did what and the outcome. We ask the government: Table a motion for THESE TWO ONLY to have no trial & for the Law Lords to sentence them to Life without parole. In future if they wish to apply for parole they fund their own legal bills.\r\n\r\nIn prison they should be given basics, bed, food, clothing, washing facilities, radio, newspapers & books with restricted access, so as not to fuel their lunacy. Solitary confinement for 5 years,give them time to think about what they\u2019ve done.\r\n",
