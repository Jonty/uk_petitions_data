Often multiple agencies post the same vacancy giving jobseekers a false impression of the number of true vacancies. Practically every agency requires that you register your details with them and then all too often offer no work.\r\nA provision should be set out to allow UK national jobseekers, with the right to work in the UK, a fast track verification process by the Department of Works & Pensions securely to the recruiters thereby giving UK jobseekers advanced opportunities to secure employment.\r\nThe website should display clearly, at all times, which recruiter is posting the vacancy and the DWP collect a nominal charge for each recruitment agencies advertisement.
