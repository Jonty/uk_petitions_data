At present we are forcing children to learning different programming languages, yes we need a basic understanding, but we also need to learn how to lay out a letter or a CV, how to setup a spread sheet and a database.\r\n\r\nWhere will the UK be in the next 5-10 years with no IT skills coming out of schools, it is very worring.\r\n",
