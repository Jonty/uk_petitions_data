Genetically engineering an animal to feel no pain so you can freely cause it pain is monstrous and unacceptable the answer is not to stop eating meat. It's to stop eating meat which is produced in these totally unethical ways.There are many ethical producers out there. We must introduce ways for the consumer to recognise their products - regulation, monitoring and TRUTHFUL LABELLING to allow the consumer to reject meat produced in these inhumane ways.\r\nWherever you stand on eating animals, \u201cI think we agree that making their lives hell is too high a price for cheap meat.",
