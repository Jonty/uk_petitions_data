        "additional_details": "In October 2011, a well-publicised meeting between then Energy Secretary Chris Huhne and 'the big six' resulted in nothing more than encouragement for consumers to switch suppliers if not on the cheapest tariff. But with prices high on any tariff, with any supplier, many see no benefit in switching. Every Autumn, energy suppliers increase prices, typically by around 10%, despite making \u00a3billions in profit. While our energy prices may still be cheaper than many countries in Europe, many believe that increases in price alongside ever-increasing profits are unacceptable, and that the government should step in to put a stop to such price increases. This is particularly true today, when so many struggle to keep their houses warm through the winter because of punishing prices. It is time that energy companies did the fair and reasonable thing, and help their consumers out, and the government should act to prevent further energy price rises.",
