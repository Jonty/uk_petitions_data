As it stands many people go through their entire lives without the correct understanding of what their body needs, these bad habits are then passed on to their children and a vicious cycle is maintained.\r\nI propose that by teaching children about the negative effects of a poor diet, as well as teaching them how to avoid and treat a variety of common medical issues, that this would not only improve the lives of countless people, but also alleviate some of the future (and immediate) pressure to the NHS that will be faced by a growing and ageing population.\r\nI would like to see the government implement regular lessons of this nature to school time tables across the UK.
