        "additional_details": "The UK would be a stronger European contender and would strengthen our ability to conduct business globally if we joined the Euro, which would support the growth of jobs and trade in the UK.\r\n\r\n- A saving of \u00a34.5 billion in converting \u00a3 into a foreign currency,\r\n- Saving conversion costs will mean competitive pricing with current European traders using the Euro\r\n- A single and transparent currency will tempt more UK businesses to compete in mainland Europe,\r\n- A single European market \u2013 without trading restrictions \u2013 should benefit the UK as we produce quality goods and services,\r\n- UK will have more of a say in European trade policy: we will maintain most of our economic control measures.\r\n\r\nPlease sign to support this, as despite problems in the Eurozone at present, the UK's strength will give us more of a say in European issues and strengthen our economy if we joined the single currency.",
