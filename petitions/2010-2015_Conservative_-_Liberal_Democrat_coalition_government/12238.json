The banks need to have tighter sanctions and no more bonuses!!! They need to start paying back this money that they have borrowed and giving back all that they have taken over the years. If this happened in any other company or industry everyone would be sacked and that company would not continuously be rewarded. Something has got to change or it will happen again and again. ",
