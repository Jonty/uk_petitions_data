Bangladesh Biman sometime operate direct flight and sometime they stop. They provide Terabol service which we don't like to travel with biman. If British Airways start a direct flight then it will be very easy for us and we British citizen we have right to fly with British airways. We want that British airways should start a direct flight from London to sylhet ",
