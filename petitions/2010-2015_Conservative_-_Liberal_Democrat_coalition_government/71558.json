        "additional_details": "As a blue badge holder I regularly see abuse of private disabled and child friendly spaces in car parks.  Disabled spaces clearly being used by people who have no disability or are using someone else's card.  I also observe people using child friendly with spaces when there are two parents there to deal with the child or the children are of an age where they can easily get themselves in and out of the car.  I propose legislation be passed forcing car park owners, such as supermarkets, to police the use of these spaces and issue fixed penalty notices to offenders.",
