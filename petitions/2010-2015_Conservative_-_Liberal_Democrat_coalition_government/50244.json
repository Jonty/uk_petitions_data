        "additional_details": "Banks are introducing credit and debit cards which are \"contactless\", i.e the card simply has to be place on or near a reader for the card to be debited with no PIN or signature required. For many people, this introduces a serious risk of fraud with no benefit as for such low value purchases, they already use and will continue to use cash.\r\n\r\nEven if banks reimburse the lost money (which inevitably will require the customer to prove the fraud), the system gives a strong incentive to muggers.\r\n\r\nA code of practice, failing which legislation, to require banks to allow customers to opt out of these systems is urgently needed.",
