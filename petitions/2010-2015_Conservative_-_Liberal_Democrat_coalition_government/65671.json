        "additional_details": "Due to the fact social media sites do not have to remove vile video's and photo's of child abuse (even after complaints) i think it is now time that the government get involved and make it law that sites do not show child abuse video's/photo's..\r\n\r\nI recently witnessed one such video and i was shocked and horrified by it, the NSPCC do a magnificent job of getting these removed.\r\nHowever it should not be left to the great charities to be doing the work which the government could easily make law....\r\n\r\nTimes are changing, the internet is changing and now is the time to show our voice and tell the government what we want to see and dont want to see on the internet. and i think there are millions around the world that will agree with me, THERE IS NO PLACE FOR CHILD ABUSE VIDEO'S/PHOTO'S ON SOCIAL MEDIA SITES.",
