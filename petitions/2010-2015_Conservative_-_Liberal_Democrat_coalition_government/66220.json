        "additional_details": "I would like to see the practice of mobile phone providers charging for tethering outlawed by the govornment, or at very least pressure being put on offcom to investigate this practice.\r\n\r\nReason being that you are using data that you would have already payed for with your mobile phone contract.\r\n\r\nI liken this to buying a bottle of soft drink and emptying the contents into a glass before drinking it.  You consume no more soft drink than have bought already, yet you are drinking it from another container.\r\n\r\nYou wouldn't expect to pay more for your bottle of soft drink because you will be drinking it from a glass instead of the bottle, so neither should you be paying more for your data because you are accessing the internet from another device via your phone.",
