        "additional_details": "Many HGV professionals see the EU Directive requiring drivers to complete 35 hours of CPC training in five yearly cycles as a money making scam. Unless the programme is cleaned up, it could be argued that they have a point!\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is nothing to stop drivers completing the same training module over and over again to reach the required number of hours. When this is allowed to happen, it's no surprise that drivers feel the training is a waste of time.\r\n\r\nWe would ask that the training requirements be reviewed at the earliest opportunity. We accept that CPC is a legislative requirement, but would argue that it should be useful, and that measures be in place to ensure that drivers benefit from the training, rather than simply wasting their valuable time in a box ticking exercise.\r\n\r\nWe ask that the relevant people in our UK Government take action on this and, if necessary, take these issues forward to the relevant EU departments.\r\n",
