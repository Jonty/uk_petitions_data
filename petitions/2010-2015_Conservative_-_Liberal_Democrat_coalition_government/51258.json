Businesses are making it easier for you to change your contact details, payment details, and, most importantly, the ability to sign up to additional products and services.\r\n\r\nAlthough it's become easier to commit to financial commitments it's not become easier to cancel them. Some businesses require you to: send a letter, an email where someone will call you, or perhaps to call their call centre. These can be time consuming, stressful, and even used as active deterrents for cancellation.\r\n\r\nI call for the Government to discuss and consider making a law such that businesses who have online subscriptions or online account managements must also allow for online cancellation. This is such that it's just as easy to cancel as it is to commit.\r\n\r\nWhatever charges that would result from cancellations should still apply just as if a cancellation was made over the phone.",
