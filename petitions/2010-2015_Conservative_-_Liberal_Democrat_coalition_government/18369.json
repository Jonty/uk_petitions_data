        "additional_details": "Currently many famous footballers and other celebrities avoid paying basic rate tax by diverting payments via an image rights company. This allows them to pay a much lower 22% rate of tax.\r\n\r\nThis loophole needs to be removed and instead an initiative launched that encourages celebrities to donate a percentage of their wages to charity in exchange for a lower rate of income tax.\r\n\r\nThis will not only boost non government funded charities incomes during the hard financial times it will also show celebrities giving back to the communities and people around them.",
