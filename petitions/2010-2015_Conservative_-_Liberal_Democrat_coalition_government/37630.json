        "additional_details": "Forget the work programmes, there are not enough jobs to go around, and getting pushed into back to work schemes is just controlling and pointless, a waste of the taxpayers money. I think there should be a new type of allowance created to replace JSA, for people who wish to further their education and go back to college as a mature student. There should be one year allowed for each level needed for the desired course, to achieve a good enough qualification to get back into the workplace. This would give people a better chance of a sought after job, or to start their own business.",
