        "additional_details": "Jeremy Hunt is proposing to introduce legislation to make it a criminal offence punishable by up to 5 years in prison for Doctors, Nurses and Heathcare Managers guilty of \"Wilful Neglect\". This petition proposes that the proposed legislation is amended so that politicians, ministers of the crown and MPs who vote for legislative changes which impose funding restrictions, NHS restructuring proposals and/or artificial target cultures which cause or contribute towards the decision making and actions of such Doctors, Nurses and Health Managers, should also themselves be liable to the same charges of \"Wilful Neglect\" and carry the same penalties.
