        "additional_details": "We wish to support Southend University Hospital and highlight our concerns relating to the delay of a positive decision in choosing Southend University Hospital as the location of the intended new Vascular Hub. We trust this will be given due consideration.\r\n\r\nSouthend University Hospital was originally seen as the best option for the new Vascular Hub. Southend University Hospital has a higher percentage of patients referred for carotid surgery, and of those, a considerably higher percentage received surgery within a very short time frame compared to other units.\r\n\r\nSouthend University Hospital is renowned for its award winning Stroke Unit. It is hailed as the best in the region, and one of the best centres in the country.\r\n\r\nSouthend Hospital has a national award winning wound unit, which deals with all chronic wounds but is particularly involved in the management of the acute diabetic foot. The major lower limb amputation rate has been reduced by 2/3 since its inception in 2009.",
