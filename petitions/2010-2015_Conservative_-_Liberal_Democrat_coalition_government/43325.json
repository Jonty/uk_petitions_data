Within two weeks they are to be flown out of the country to live with the family that abused and neglected them, who speak a language they have never spoken, in a country they have never lived in.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to put pressure on the Government for the case to be heard as a welfare case, away from political intervention.",
