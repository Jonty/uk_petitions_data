        "additional_details": "This petition is to bring the standards attached to dog kennels up to date with the 21st century.As it stands most kennels are passing inspections by the council as they are meeting with the regulations,unfortunatley these regulations have not been brought up to date for some years so in reality these kennels should be failing inspections.Im sure we are all aware that we are no longer a nation of dog lovers,we are a nation who abandons,over breeds + just generally mistreats our dogs.Thankfully there is also alot of people who are willing to speak out for these animals.Most people would think a dog put in kennels would be looked after + given the attention they require,unfortunately they would be shocked to learn this is not the case as some kennels are in appauling conditions.We do not expect cruelty to go on in local authority kennels and this is why we need to get kennel laws made stronger and up to date with whats going on in the 21st century.",
