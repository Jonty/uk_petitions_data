        "additional_details": "We want the government to order Ask.fm to change their security rules, so that users are protected from being bullied. We feel that the anonymous button is a major factor that encourages bullies to abuse others on the internet, where they can hide behind a computer screen. Cyber bullying is a major issue for teenagers, and most recently has resulted in a number of suicides, with Ask.fm being the centre cause for many of them.  We urge users to not talk to anyone they don't know, and to report abuse. In our eyes, the anonymous button should no longer be available on the site, which is what we would like to achieve from this campaign. If we get enough signatures then the government has to listen to us.",
