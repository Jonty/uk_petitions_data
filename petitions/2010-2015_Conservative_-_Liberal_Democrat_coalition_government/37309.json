        "additional_details": "The Edinburgh to Glasgow section of the M8 is running at capacity much of the time and is costing Scottish businesses and the Scottish economy tens of millions in wasted time on journeys. This crucial artery needs to be upgraded to 3 lanes urgently.\r\n A short term improvement on this routes could be:\r\n a) introducing variable speed limits using average speed cameras at peak times - this would allow traffic to flow much more smoothl. Average speed cameras would not prevent this entirely when the road is at peak capacity but it would reduce the time of 'loss of flow' substantially.\r\n b) Use of a hard shoulder during peak times, this is successful south of the border and could be tried here.\r\n This  would be an infrastructure project which would benefit the Scottish economy greatly",
