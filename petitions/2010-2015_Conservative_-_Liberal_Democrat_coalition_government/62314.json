        "additional_details": "Some soldiers are having their passports revoked unless they sit an english test to allow them to remain a british citizen. This is outrageous these servicemen and women have sworn an oath of aligeance and have served their country 'Great Britain' in some of the most hostile areas of the world putting their lives at risk. While they are wearing the uniform of a serviceman they are being asked to sit the english test despite them speaking and understanding english better than those indiginous population, these men and women should be granted automatic rights to a british passport because they have demonstrated beyond any shadow of doubt that they are truely British and that Great Britain is their Country. Grant them Citizenship.",
