        "additional_details": "Asthmatics should be exempt from paying for life saving medication! I suffer from chronic asthma /border COPD and I am 24. I have never smoked so it is not a condition I could have prevented! On average a month my medication would cost approx \u00a356 just to keep me alive and breathing. Instead I have to pay \u00a310.40 a month to just be able to breathe and live my life. Diabetics get medication for free as theirs is life threatening like wise asthma.  Whats the difference? People that have unfortunately taken the route to be on drugs /drink etc get help for free (i.e methadone and drinking support)  they put their selves there no body else when theres people like me that would do anything not to have this lung condition and especially having to pay to live.
