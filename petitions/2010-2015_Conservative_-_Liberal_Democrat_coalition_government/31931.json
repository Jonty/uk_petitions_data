        "additional_details": "This is a petition that calls on all MP\u2019s to oppose the planned minimum alcohol price.\r\n\r\n This proposal does not seek to resolve, or offer any suggestions to fix, the problem of \u2018binge-drinking\u2019.  Responsible consumers, who fall within the low-middle income brackets, will be the ones hardest hit and those who persist in the anti-social drinking culture will still continue.  The government should invest time in resolving the issues rather than using these to increase tax revenues.\r\n\r\nPubs and restaurants will be hit and it will lead to may closures.  The introduction will lead to a massive 'black market', as has happened with tobacco, and the UK tax income from alcohol will fall.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is a disaster waiting to happen at a time where the country\u2019s economy needs a boost the government will force it down.  The rich continue to benefit with receiving tax cuts whilst the \u2018average\u2019 person is penalise.\r\n\r\nSupport this petition and bring power back to the people.",
