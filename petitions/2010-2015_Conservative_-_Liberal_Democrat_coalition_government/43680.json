Top flight clubs can earn millions out of home grown players out of sponsership and image rights. More and more young players are being bought for big fees from abroad and bypassing the possibility of a future international star we should be investing in British children at all levels of Amature football.\r\nOur grass roots footballing facilities and playing surfaces in most parts of the country are nothing more than recreation grounds with a shipping container used for changing and storage of equipment. Yet premier league clubs are happy to send scouts to local parks to deliver talented young players and dismiss them after a stint in the clubs academy.  We must invest at ground level to give children a real chance of fulfilling thier dreams.",
