        "additional_details": "Fluoride has been added to public water supplies across the world. While the benefits of fluoridation have been held to be unquestionable, accumulating evidence points to the prospect that fluoride may have serious adverse health effects, including infant mortality, congenital defects and IQ.\r\n\r\nFrom a common sense perspective, adding any kind of substance into the common water supply is unwise because the dosage ingested by any individual is not controlled, there is no consent and there is no choice. If people believe fluoride prevents tooth decay, they can obtain fluoridated water/toothpaste for themselves without exposing millions to a substance with a questionable safety record and no proven benefits. Parliament should debate this issue in full, immediately remove all fluoride from the water supply as a precaution, and investigate how fluoridation was permitted in the first place and more importantly, why.\r\n",
