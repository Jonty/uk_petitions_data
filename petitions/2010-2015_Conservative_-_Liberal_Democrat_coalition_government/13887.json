David Cameron also stated that, \u201cWhat matters most to a child\u2019s life chances is not the wealth of their upbringing but the warmth of their parenting.\u201d This sweeping generalisation serves only to promote a lack of hope amongst those growing up within a dysfunctional family. A child should surely be taught that regardless of such, their life chances are equally as strong as those from a stable family background. Is it not David Cameron\u2019s responsibility to promote a sense of self-belief and ultimately a responsibility for one\u2019s own actions irrespective of upbringing?",
