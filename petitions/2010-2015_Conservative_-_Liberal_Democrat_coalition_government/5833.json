        "additional_details": "The East Coast rail franchise is heavily dependant on long distance travel between London, North East England and Scotland.  This leaves it vunerable to economic variation.  In re-letting the franchise the Government should seek to expand the East Coast market by including local commuter style services between Corby and Peterborough (with possible extension to Kettering) and between Peterborough and Cambridge (with possible extension to Whittlesford).  As part of this package, the March to Wisbech line should also be reopened.  Provision will need to be included for infrastructure modification and improvment.\r\n\r\nThese services serve growth areas. As an additional benefit this package may reduce congestion on major roads such as the A14 and A10 in the area",
