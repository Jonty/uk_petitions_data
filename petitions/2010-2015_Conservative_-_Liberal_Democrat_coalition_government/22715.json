        "additional_details": "This is a petition aimed at stopping MP's from being constantly elected to sit in Parliament.  After a while a career politician is not looking after the interests of the electorate but they are looking after themselves.  I propose that a MP can only be elected for 2 terms and then is forced to stand down for 1 term of office.  This will stand a chance of breaking the strangle hold that some people have on politics and get fresh views on matters that concern us all.",
