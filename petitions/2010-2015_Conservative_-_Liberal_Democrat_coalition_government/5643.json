        "additional_details": "I propose the British government develop and issue \"government debt free money\" and make it legal tender for all debts.  As Abraham Lincoln did between 1862-1865 when he printed $450 million of what he called US notes, also known as \"green backs\"\r\n\r\nThis printed money could then be circulated into the British economy via the government using it to develop the infrastructure of the country, paying civil servants or even building schools and reduce these austerity measures.\r\n\r\nThis would also mean that banks can only invest the money they actually have.\r\n\r\nFor more information and history to this, please watch this award winning documentary;\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U71-KsDArFM&feature=player_embedded#at=2665    Abraham Lincolns debt free money starts at 39:00 mins.\r\n\r\nIf you are worried about debt and the current economic situation, then please put your name to this petition.
