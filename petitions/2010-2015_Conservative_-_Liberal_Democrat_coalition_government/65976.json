Not just for personal use which as free people should be our own decision to make.\r\nBut so they can be properly researched for other purposes, for healthcare in body and mind.\r\nTo decriminlise those that are prosecuted for using drugs when they do not negatively impact on the life of another.\r\nControl them and do so heavily, keep it away from the young, keep it illegal to drive whilst intoxicated on any drug.\r\nBut in this day and age why is it we are not allowed to do what we want with what is truly ours, our body and our mind, let us make our own decisions and allow us to deal with the consequences of what we decide.\r\n\r\n",
