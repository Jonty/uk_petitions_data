        "additional_details": "We want the government to phase in a more rational drug control policy, starting with the over the counter sale of short acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam in a localised preliminary trial.\r\nEach sale will be accompanied with a short questionnaire to determine the real world abuse potential of such drugs. The local police and hospital will record all instances of abuse within the trial and the results will be given to the department of health to help pass legislation on controlled drugs in future.\r\n\r\nWe believe that adults can make informed choices, and that current drug control policies are outdated and biased.
