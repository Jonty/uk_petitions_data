No women should be raped, hung, stoned, or tortured because she is a woman. India, Pakistan  and other  countries are  increasingly anti women. We have to stop  giving overseas aid to these countries,as  in doing so we condone these attacks on women as their governments fail to  outlaw and act to stop these barbaric acts.",
