        "additional_details": "10% of the UK residents have asthma, and many more suffer from respiratory diseases & the law in the UK is stacked against them because nuisance law excludes anybody that are very sensitive.\r\n\r\nSo vulnerable citizens of the country are singled out, leaving their lives in danger. Builders & councils etc. do not have to do anything to help respiratory disease & asthma sufferers from the nuisance that they cause by their works.\r\n\r\nTherefore we call on the Government to change the law so that people at home would have legal redress when affected by local external influences such as road-works and building works.\r\n\r\nA very small provision in works contracts to move people away, would save unnecessary deaths & illnesses in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis would also free the NHS from care needed by these patients at the Dr\u2019s or hospital & prescriptions needed. This would also help them live healthy & more productive lives, which would be better for them & the economy.",
