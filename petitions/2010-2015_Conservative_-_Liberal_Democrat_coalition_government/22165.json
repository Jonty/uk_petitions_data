        "additional_details": "Stop the UK from backing a Washington-led bid to overturn the global ban on cluster bombs.\r\n\r\nThe UK has, in recent years, played a key role in trying to rid the world of cluster bombs. However, the UK Government is supporting a draft proposal that would permit the use of cluster bombs as long as they were manufactured after 1980 and had a failure rate of less than one per cent. An international treaty banning cluster munitions already exists, which the UK played a role in securing. Such a proposal would overturn the treaty, itself only two years old.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that the UK opposes such a proposal and supports the existing ban on cluster munitions, once more playing a key role in ensuring such illegal and indiscriminate arms are banned in warfare.",
