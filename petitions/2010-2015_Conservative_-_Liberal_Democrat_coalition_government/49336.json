        "additional_details": "The FA is clearly a rascist organisation and the evidence is clear with the way they have treated luis suarez they have racially discriminated against him. When jermaine defoe took a bite out of an opponent they deemed a yellow card sufficient punishment in retrospect but they give suarez 10 game ban and the same prejudice again when suarez was accused of rascism albeit not enough evidence to pursue a conviction but they give him an 8 game ban but when john terry clearly racially abused anton ferdinand and was dragged through the courts of law bringing the english game into disrepute aswell as being rascist to an opponent the FA saw fit to give him a 4 game ban this is clear evidence of a RASCIST and PREJUDICE FA who only serve themselves and are in need of serious reform!",
