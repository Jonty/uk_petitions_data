THIS IS WRONG.  Changing the law in April for a select few is not good enough.  I accept rents can be high in some areas but these people who have put nothing into the economy should not get this much out of it.  The house that they had previously was generous enough for them.\r\n\r\n'Unemployed Saeed Kahliif, 49, from Somalia, his wife Sayida and their children have been handed the keys to a sprawling six-bedroom home in West Hampstead, in North London.They will pay the rent on their luxurious six-bedroom house with a monthly \u00a38,000 housing benefit. The house boasts a 90ft garden and is thought to be one of the most expensive houses ever paid for by housing benefit.'\r\n\r\n",
