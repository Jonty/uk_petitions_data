I\u2019m appealing on behalf of my family and myself.\r\n\r\nMum has been there for me for the whole of my thirteen years, along with my Dad, is the rock that supports me. My Filipino mother married my Dad (a British national) in UK, 20yrs ago. I was born in Bath 7yrs later.\r\n\r\nMy emotions are running out of control. The way I feel right now, I am not sure I can take any more blows. I am at a critical point in my schooling and need stability. My Nan (92, who lives with us) has advancing dementia. If Mum is sent away, I would lose my Nan as well, because without Mums daily care, Nan will need to live in a nursing home.\r\n\r\nHome Office, I beg you let the family remain together as close knit, caring and supportive as it has always been. I pray that somewhere in your politics there\u2019s room for compassion.\r\n\r\nEuropean rules state \u201cChildren have a right to a Family life\u201d. PLEASE DONT SEND MY MUM AWAY\r\n",
