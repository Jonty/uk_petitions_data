Awareness and intervention at a younger age can be what helps someones recovery become possible.\r\n\r\nI am a 17 year old in a mental health unit in the North of England. When I was in secondry school we didn't have a single lesson about mental health and I wasn't aware that the symptoms I were experiencing were part of a mental disorder. If I had known that help was available I would have got help earlier.\r\n\r\nThrough education people would feel more comfortable talking about their mental health, helping to end the stigma.\r\n\r\n",
