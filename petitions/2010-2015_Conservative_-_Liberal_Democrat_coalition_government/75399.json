        "additional_details": "Three men were arrested in Dubai on February 22nd 2015, following a trip to go plane spotting as the authorities believed they were a threat to national security.\r\n\r\nThese men are being held in poor conditions, one has a heart condition and his family are very worried about his health.\r\n\r\nThe practice of plane spotting has been confirmed as legal but not understood by the authorities in Dubai and no evidence as to any wrongdoing was found on their phones or other devices.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed they were instructed to sign a legal document which was written in Arabic which they obviously did not understand\r\n\r\nMore needs to be done to get these men back with their families.  Please provide further assistance to these men and their families - the legal costs are ridiculous and no normal person can afford these costs!  Surely the government can help with this?\r\n\r\nThanks",
