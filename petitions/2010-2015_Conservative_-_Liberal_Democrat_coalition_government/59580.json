        "additional_details": "I want to stop Scottish Power (SP) from being able to advertise on comparison websites and hit them in their pocket where they have hit so many others. Since leaving SP to go onto a better tariff I have been unable to get a final bill from them, and have been unable to access my account details. The last time I could access my account I was \u00a373 in credit and believe them to owe me money. After sending numerous e-mails and getting no reply I decided to complain on their website only to find that there are many, many others like me. I would like to stop SP from being able to advertise on comparison websites by way of punishment and hope they will want to do better in future. Take away some of their rights as they clearly think no-one else should have them.",
