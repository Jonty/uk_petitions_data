        "additional_details": "In recent years it is becoming increasingly obvious that the sentences passed down in various serious offences show an inconsistent balance.\r\n\r\nAn armed robber is known to have been sentenced to terms of 10-15 years imprisonment.\r\n\r\nConvicted fraudsters have been known to have received very lengthy sentences.\r\n\r\nHowever, the stance the government takes in proving that sentencing is just and at all times used as a deterrent is contradicted in several recent murder cases.\r\n\r\nThere have been a number of cases in which a convicted murderer only received 3-6 years.\r\n\r\nHow does the government purports to justify that monetary and property damage far outweighs in gravitas than the taking of an innocent life or severely impacting a persons health otherwise?\r\n\r\nThe British justice system must show that harsh sentences are at ALL times applied in ALL serious cases to truly act as a deterrent.",
