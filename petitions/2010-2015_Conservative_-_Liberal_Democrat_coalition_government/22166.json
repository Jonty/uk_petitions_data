        "additional_details": "I have to work regularly at different sites for my company. Looking at what the vehicle mileage allowances for essential company travel it is impossible to use a motorcycle without being out of pocket.\r\nCar allowance is \u00a30.45 per mile, Motorcycle is \u00a30.24 per mile.\r\nCalculating the cost per mile, without depreciation, of my non special motorcycle to be \u00a30.315 per mile. This includes the cost of tyres, insurance, road fund, MOT, standard servicing, and fuel. What I should also add is the helmet replacement every 2 years, and maybe protective riding gear.\r\nThe allowance for cars has been raised, why not the allowance for motorcycles? For a single person travelling  on essential company work motorcycles are a better option for congestion reasons, but the allowance levels are encouraging me to buy a car.\r\nPlease can the allowance rate be discussed and the level of motorcycles changed to match the actual cost, of the current level justified.\r\n",
