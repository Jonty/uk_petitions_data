When a National team from any sport are playing then broadcasting rights should only be bid for from terrestrial channels. As it's a National team playing then it can be seen by the Nation and would gain maximum coverage for the sport and the sponsers. All domestic competitions can be bid for by any broadcaster so the sport can be shared out. In relation to golf, the Majors and the Ryder Cup could be classed as National competetions.",
