        "additional_details": "Have a dedicated basket to work out real inflation for those vunerable to fuel poverty i.e Food, clothing, domestic fuel, housing costs. These are the absolute basics. The other goods in the basket to work out CPI or RPI serve to bring down the average costs..People in fuel poverty are not buying 50\" tv sets or white goods on a daily basis and most of the other things in the wider basket of goods. By using  the basic items to work out the true rate of inflation for the elderly and needy and. applying this figure to pensions/benefits we might be able to live a little more comfortably that we presently do.",
