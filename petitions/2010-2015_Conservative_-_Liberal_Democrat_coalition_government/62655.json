        "additional_details": "The driving age should be lowered from 17 to 16. This is what happens in the United States and it should happen in the UK. All students are now forced to be in education until the age of 18 however bus passes are removed from them at 16, making it ever more difficult for students  to attend school or college. Due to the drinking age remaining at 18 and the underestimated maturity of 16 year old, this change does not necessarily mean more annual traffic collisions.also people at the age of 16 are old enough to live on their own, get married and have children but not drive. These laws does cohere with each other.",
