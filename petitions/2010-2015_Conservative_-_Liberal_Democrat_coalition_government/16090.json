        "additional_details": "The United States embargo against Cuba is a commercial, economic, and financial embargo partially imposed on Cuba in October 1960.\r\n\r\nOn September 2, 2010, President Barack Obama extended the embargo through September 14, 2011, determining that the embargo \"is in the national interest of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe United Nations General Assembly has condemned the embargo as a violation of international law every year since 1992.\r\n\r\nThis embargo is an archaic seige on a sovereign nation's right to self-govern. This is a hangover from the cold war and perpetuated by right wing scare mongering regarding communism.\r\n\r\nThe UK government via the UN have the power to force an end to this illegal action, this petition requests the UK government to take a greater stance on this matter, to show the USA that they can't bully others to do things the way they say.",
