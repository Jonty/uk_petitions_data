        "action": "Introduce Legislation To Regulate In App Purchases/Micro-Transactions on Smart Phones and Tablets",
        "additional_details": "There are many apps and games available for smart phones and tablets that are advertised as free, but in reality are far from it. These games are free to download, but then charge excessive amounts for in app purchases or micro transactions. They create an addiction akin to gambling, leading to potentially large amounts of money being spent in a short space of time, which is extremely irresponsible when a large proportion of such games are aimed at children.\r\n\r\nI propose the following:\r\nAny game that is free to download, but requires excessive in app purchases should automatically be given an 18 rating.\r\nAny device that has access to such apps should have an opt-in policy at system level rather than the current opt-out policy.\r\nA limit on the maximum amount that can be spent in any one app.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you agree. Thanks.",
