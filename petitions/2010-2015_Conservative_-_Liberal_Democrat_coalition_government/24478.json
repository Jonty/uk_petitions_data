        "additional_details": "The UK science councils does a good job job but much of it work is spent on departments which are not needed such as the  Economic and Social Research Council. It would be better if the budget was cut or halved and spent in the areas which will help the economy such as the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, Science and Technology Facilities Council  or the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Councils. This will help rebalance the economy as they  are in the important Science, Maths, Engineering and Technology sectors rather then Sociology. ",
