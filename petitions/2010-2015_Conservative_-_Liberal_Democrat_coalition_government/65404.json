        "additional_details": "Every school child should be allowed five days holiday per school year with one less week of summer holidays and the block should not be taken at times of SATS or important key times as announced by individual schools.\r\n   This action would stop the mayhem of overpriced holidays as almost all families have to choose the same weeks and most of us would prefer not to share our holiday with every other school child in Britain. The tourist industry would cope far better with a general flow rather than a six week onslaught. Education is important but so is living your life and having fun, the new regime of no holidays in school is ridiculous; working parents can't all book the same weeks off work these are the busiest weeks of the year as ALL the children are on holiday at the same time.",
