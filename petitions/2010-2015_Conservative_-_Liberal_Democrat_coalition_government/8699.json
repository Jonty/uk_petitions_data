        "additional_details": "We call on the UK government to introduce boot camps for teenagers, combining hard physical work and military discipline. Prison does not work: it only makes them worse criminals. Community service and ASBOs are not tough enough. We want to see sentencing that teenagers will fear at the same time as teach them the discipline and respect they lack. Community service and learning useful professional skills should only be an option for those that first show respect.",
