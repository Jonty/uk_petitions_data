        "additional_details": "Secondary School is one of the most important stages in a child's education, as it prepares them for more exams, and gives them work which will push them.\r\n\r\nHowever, I notice, as a school pupil, is that Year 6 teachers don't help their pupils get used to what it may be like in Year 7, therefore, during the transition, the child finds Year 7 a big shock.\r\n\r\nIf teachers are instructed to push the child at the end of Year 6, and keep their homework levels like secondary school near the end of the year, rather than treating them, we can keep Britain's kids bright, clever and make us one of the brainiest countries among the world.\r\n\r\nI want the government to make sure that kids are ready for secondary school, otherwise we can't complain that our kids are dumb, because the Year 6 teacher would not help them. Secondary school is a big jump from Year 6, but we can make sure the next generation are built up to the biggest educational leap of their young lives.\r\n\r\nI call for better teaching ",
