        "additional_details": "The government should hold to account officials in the Inland Revenue for having failed to close loopholes in the tax system that allow high earners to not pay their fair share of tax. Having reduced the higher rate of tax it is only right that the department that collects the taxes should focus on why it has failed in its duty. It is not good enough to blame previous governments. Action is required to justify the rest of us paying as we do when required.",
