Worse, still, as the  2012 competition demonstrates, the UK isn't gaining votes because our neighbours aren't  sufficiently scared of our entrants!  This can easily be remedied if the Secretary of Culture, Media and Sport orders the Director General of the BBC to ensure that Motorhead are given whatever they demand to represent the UK at the 2013 competition in Sweden.",
