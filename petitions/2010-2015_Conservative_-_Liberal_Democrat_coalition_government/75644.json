I find this outrageous he is closer to Bristol free school then any other in the Bristol area yet the council are expecting him to travel 2 and a half miles . He is working at level 6 and never been in trouble I feel like Bristol free school are discriminating  against children in southmead he has the right surely to attend the school closest to him and I know looking at other statements from parents I'm not the only one who feels this way we live in the bs10 postcode so why can't our children attend a BS10 school I like to ask the council to reconsider the catchment area  ",
