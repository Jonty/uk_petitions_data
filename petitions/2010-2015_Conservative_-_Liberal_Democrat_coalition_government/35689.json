This so-called Higgs mechanism, which had several inventors besides Higgs at about the same time, predicts the existence of a new particle, the Higgs boson (often described as \"the most sought-after particle in modern physics\"). The Higgs mechanism is generally accepted as an important ingredient in the Standard Model of particle physics, without which particles would have no mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
