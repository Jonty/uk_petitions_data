        "additional_details": "Alex Ferguson and the BBC fell out in 2007 after the beeb made accusations about him and his son, resulting in Fergie refusing any further interviews with for any BBC programmes.\r\n\r\nI dont know if it is Fergie or the BBC who is in the wrong; but what is wrong is that the license fee paying public who are left to deal with the consequences. (No offense to Mike Phelan; but its just not the same).\r\n\r\nI also think that in the wake of the phone hacking scandal people have lost faith in the media and in particular their news providers; by building bridges between these two, the government would not just make football fans happy, but also further establish the BBC's position as the luminary body in news and sport broadcasting.\r\n\r\nIts time to bury the hatchet and get Fergie back on MOTD.\r\n",
