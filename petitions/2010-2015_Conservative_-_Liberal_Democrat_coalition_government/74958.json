We therefore call on the Government to convene all party talks before the General Election to discuss the option, requested by the Silver Voices senior citizens organisation, of an integrated national health and care service, free at the point of delivery.\r\n\r\nThere is no logical reason why cancer treatment should be free but dementia treatment subject to high charges.
