        "additional_details": "STOP POLICE PRIVATISATION. Policing should be about protecting people, places and property and fostering good relationships, not private profit. We the undersigned oppose the privatisation of police forces and call upon the government to stop it especially in investigation, intelligence, and on street policing. Our many concerns include the potential threat to civil rights, democracy, accountability, confidentiality and public cooperation with the police to prevent, solve and prosecute crimes. Engaging with the public and building trusting relationships with police officers is vital for the wellbeing of our communities. We also call on the government to stop further reducing the numbers of trained police officers which would put communities at greater risk.",
