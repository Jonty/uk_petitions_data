Having visited The Menin Gate in Ypres last year, I was somewhat appalled and dismayed that this is not also done in London to honour our fallen hero\u2019s like they do in Ypres. All things considered, Belgium is a foreign country and has honoured our fallen every evening since the end of the First World War, apart from the four years from 1939 to 1945, when the ceremony was moved to London because of Belgium occupation by the German armed forces; to be continued until the end of the war; then returned to Ypres, where it continues to this day. I think it is the least our government could do to honour what our armed forces have done and are still doing for our country.\r\n\r\nMr S Jordan. Secretary, The Royal British Legion, Sittingbourne & Milton Regis Branch.",
