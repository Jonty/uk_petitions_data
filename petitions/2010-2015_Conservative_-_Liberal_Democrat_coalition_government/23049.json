        "additional_details": "We call on Parliament to give the Mayor of London responsibility for all parking in the city. The Mayor could then ensure that parking is adequate, fair and affordable, meeting the needs of residents and local businesses, and keeps the London economy moving. It will also prevent authorities such as Westminster City Council from using parking charges to increase their income at the expense of hard working Londoners. ",
