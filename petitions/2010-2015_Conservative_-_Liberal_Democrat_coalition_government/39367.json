        "additional_details": "The current legislation for the CSA dosen't allow for living losts of the non resident parent. I've argued this point many times over the phone with the CSA who are not interested in the devastating consequences this can have for the children or as in most cases, the father as a result of this shockingly awful government agency.\r\n\r\nThis agency needs a serious overhaul and needs to put children first. That means a fair assement of the non-resident parents income to include living costs.\r\nAt the very least I would expect the government to make special allowances for low income earners, to include specifically ignoring any overtime worked, as in most cases overtime is needed to make ends meet anyway.\r\nAnd the goverment needs to involve and get the ideas of non-resident parents in this overhaul, as they are the ones suffering with the way things are currently done.\r\n",
