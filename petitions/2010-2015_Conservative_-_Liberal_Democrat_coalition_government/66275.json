        "additional_details": "A commercial van with a maximum laden weight of 3.5 tons is reduced to 10 mph below the national speed limit on single and duel carriage ways, while a camper van with an unladen weight of 3.05 tons can drive at the maximum national speed limit. Why?\r\n\r\nThis is a draconian law and needs updating, my van handles just as well with goods in as it does with a bed, sink and toilet, probably better as I drive it a lot more.  The country, like it or not, is dependant on goods being moved across it.  Most of these go by road, most commercial vans do not stick to these reduced speed limit.  Most of us drive with care, we drive to the conditions and are responsible, a 15% speed reduction equals 15% less productivity! I could go on,\r\n\r\nPlease pass this on to any commercial van drivers as I think they may agree.",
