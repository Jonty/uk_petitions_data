        "additional_details": "Due to the fact that in Britain, statistics show that Obesity and the number of people that stop participation in Physical education after the age of 16 are on the rise. I would like the government to overview this and change it so that the age to compulsively do P.E in schools is raised to 18 years of age. I think it would be extremely beneficial not just to the sporting world but also to the health of the British public. ",
