We need to bring them back to planet earth and the ONLY way that will be achieved is to put a cap on what they may charge, per hour, to that which is earned by the normal people of this land.  It is most appropriate to put this limit on them when it is considered that any lawyer practising now got his/her qualification totally free of charge, paid for by the people they are now ripping off, BIG TIME, through their taxes before university fees were introduced in this country.",
