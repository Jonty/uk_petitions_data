The extent of some blast injuries can remove any chance of a male fathering children or enjoying sexual relations again.\r\n\r\nWe request the government consider the following:\r\n\r\n-\tThe right for a soldier to donate sperm pre deployment, funded by the MOD and for this service to be publicised to soldiers prior to deployment.\r\n\r\n-\tIssue groin protectors as standard kit. The US soldiers have had them for some time.\r\n\r\n-\tChange the Armed Forces Compensation scheme;-\r\n\r\na) Remove the current cap on awards of \u00a3570,000;\r\nb) Remove the sliding, discounted scale for additional injuries;\r\nc) Remove the word \"compensation\" from the title. This is financial aid for rehabilitation, not compensation.\r\n",
