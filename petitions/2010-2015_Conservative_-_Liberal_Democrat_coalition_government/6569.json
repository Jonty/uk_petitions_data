        "additional_details": "The smoking ban in the UK was built on a tissue of lies about SHS (Second Hand Smoke) to appease the EU and the domestic Tobacco Control movement prevalent in our \u2018big society\u2019. This socially divisive ban should be amended to allow businesses their property rights and be allowed to say whether they allow smoking in their privately owned establishments or not.\r\nThere is a movement afoot in this country that apes the puritans of old that want to inflict laws on the people of the UK that forbid them personal choices and freedoms. That failed then and it will fail now as our freedoms and choices will not be bartered.\r\nI therefore ask this government to give businesses the freedom to choose whether they go smoking or non smoking.\r\nThe smoking ban was never about health but about social control.\r\nPlease sign this petition for the sake of freedom and democracy.\r\nI am a founder member of Freedom2Choose dot info.\r\n",
