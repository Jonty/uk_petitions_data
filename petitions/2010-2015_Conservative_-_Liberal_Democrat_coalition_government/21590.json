        "additional_details": "Andrea Rossi claims to have invented a revolutionary source of energy.  He has demonstrated his invention numerous times to different (invited) audiences.  During each of these demonstrations, excess energy production has been observed.  To date, however, no definitive test has been carried out.  I ask, therefore, that a device be purchased and properly tested (run for 72 hours continuous at least) to either confirm or refute the validity of this invention: while the downside risk is small (purchase + test costs), the upside risks are huge (so huge, in fact, that it is impossible to give a figure to them - they include: rapid and massive carbon footprint reduction, reduction in energy costs, elimination of energy security risks, preservation of oil for medicines, fertilizers, plastics, hi-tech materials to name but a few).
