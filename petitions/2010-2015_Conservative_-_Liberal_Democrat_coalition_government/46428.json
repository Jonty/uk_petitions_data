BAN these types of loans\r\n2. If not banned, the APR's should be capped in line with bank loan rates.  (e.g. 10% APR)\r\n3. Tighter controls over who can get a loan. (No more than 1 from any company concurrently).\r\n4. Make it illegal to target vulnerable people, either by phone or email (especially the 'your one click away from getting a loan' type emails).\r\n5. A total ban on TV advertising.\r\n",
