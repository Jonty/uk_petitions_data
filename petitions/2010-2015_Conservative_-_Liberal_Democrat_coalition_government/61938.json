        "additional_details": "This petition calls for urgent investment in new transport infrastructure to ease congestion along the between Witney and Oxford.\r\n\r\nThe time taken to travel along the A40 from Witney to Oxford is growing year on year, often taking over an hour to travel less than 10 miles. The population of West Oxfordshire has grown 23,000 in the last 30 years (+28%) with 10,000 coming in the last 10yrs. Witney itself is only 27,000. That\u2019s nearly another Witney in a generation. The number of cars in West Oxfordshire has therefore more than doubled since 1981. The road infrastructure has not kept pace.\r\n\r\nProposed solutions include resurrecting the old railway line, making the road dual carriageway, better connecting the A40 and A34 at Wolvercote, and building a tram system. This will have massive economic benefits, reduce pollution and improve lives of residents towns and villages currently being used as a rat run (Cassington, Yarnton, Eynsham, Farmoor, Long Hanborough, Bladon etc).\r\n",
