It is simply not acceptable not to pick up dog foul ... our children want to play in public recreation grounds without having to worry about dog muck. Increase the fine ... increase the worth in the deterrent. There are plenty of bins ... no excuse. Not only is dog foul disgusting and dirty but it can have serious health risks. Act now ... sign the petition. ",
