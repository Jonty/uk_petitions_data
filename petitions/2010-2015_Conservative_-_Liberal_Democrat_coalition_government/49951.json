        "additional_details": "Mr Altaf Hussain, a British citizen and a mafia style leader of a linguistic group MQM , on 12 May 2013, from his London headquarters,  gave a long hate speech over the phone to thousands of supporters of his party in Pakistan, once again violated the British \u2018Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994\u2019 and the \u2018Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006\u2019 by inciting hatred and encouraging bloodshed in Pakistan.\r\n\r\nMr Hussain\u2019s speech was also broadcast on all Pakistani TV channels and media. Here are the links of his speech: http://bit.ly/13dDaDx; http://dai.ly/17X2CBO; http://bit.ly/165fEjf. Under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 his actions are arrestable offences in Britain.\r\n\r\nPeople in Pakistan believe that, the British government shares some responsibility for violence in Karachi as wanted criminals use their UK bases to incite hate and violence in Pakistan and must take appropriate action.",
