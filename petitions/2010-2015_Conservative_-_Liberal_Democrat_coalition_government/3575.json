She wasn't very\r\nimpressed with the idea. She then destroyed her own argument by saying with the capital punishment\r\nmatter, she voted for it the first time, whereas the second time she voted against. She said that people\r\nlike me rather then sending my thoughts and running them passed your good selves. I should go\r\nand see my MP and He or She would tell me how  they would vote. (((((((((   NO  ))))))))))\r\nIn some circumstances the United Kingdom Citizens should take ownership for hard decisions\r\ni.e.;  Capital punishment , Europe, Abortion, Immigration etc. Once the vote has been carried\r\nout and the decision has been made, all the country should act as a whole and make that decision work.\r\n\r\n\r\n( Captain Common Sense )\r\n",
