        "additional_details": "New Council Tax Reduction scheme - starting 1 April 2013 TO BE ABOLISHED\r\nBasically I am asking you to sign and agree here if you think the new council tax scheme should be abolished.\r\nThe new council tax reduction scheme is aimed at people on a low income and those on benefits have to pay 8.5% of the bill. Are you a one parent family? Are you on benefits? Do you normally get 100% council tax relief? Do you work and get some council tax relief? If you have answered yes to any of these questions, can you afford to contribute 8.5% towards your council tax bill? If you cannot afford this you should sign and agree with this petition.  ",
