        "additional_details": "The current Points Based System only addresses permanent employment. USA and other non-EU trainers and consultants, experts in their field, are not permitted to deliver one or two week courses in the UK, even when sponsored by a UK business that pays UK taxes and hires UK Hotel/Conference facilities. The Current system forces UK citizens to have to fly to other countries (including European countries) in order to get training that is unavailable in the UK. This is both environmentally damaging as well damaging UK Tourist and Hotel trade. It leaves the UK isolated and lacking in developing home grown expertise. This sort of visitor is limited to only 6 months stay, and NOT seeking full employment or residency in the UK. They support UK tourist industry, as other EU citizens would come to the UK to the various training courses. A change in the UKBA policy would be beneficial to the UK economy and the UK as the \u201cCentre of Excellence\u201d.",
