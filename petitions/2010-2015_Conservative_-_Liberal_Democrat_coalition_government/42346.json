        "additional_details": "Nick Clegg is doing an absolutely rubbish job of helping David Cameron run this country. Mr Cameron would better be able to run the country without a deputy or with one that actually knows what he/she is doing - sadly not true of Mr Clegg. This man has had almost no positive impact on the country - even his own party agree with me on that one. It is time for him to go before he causes even more serious damage than he has already done to the United Kingdom. ",
