        "additional_details": "Despite the excellent work of campaign groups and the introduction of the Equality Act 2010, structural inequalities continue to have an adverse effect on many women\u2019s lives. Women remain concentrated in lower-paid and part-time work and, for the first time in five years, the gender pay gap has increased. Retired women are also \u00a36,700 a year worse off than men.\r\n\r\nWith funding of support services reducing, women have also been left to carry much of the load of caring for children and the elderly.\r\n\r\nWe call for a debate on how women can be given the skills and training to progress through their careers; how the Government can help parents to become educational role models for their children; and how they can help women gain the confidence to return to work and reach their full potential.",
