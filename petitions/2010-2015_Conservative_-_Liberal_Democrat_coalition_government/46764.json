        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, acknowledge that recent polling indicates a majority of the British public would like to see the Green Party represented in the general election television debates.  We therefore feel it is right and in keeping with the democratic principles this country upholds that a representative of the Green Party be invited to take part, broadening the debate and presenting the electorate with a greater political spectrum with which to engage.\r\n\r\nThe Green Party polled third in the London mayoral elections, has an MP, MEPs and 141councillors.  It is a viable party to which many people are looking for a fresh approach to politics.  We therefore ask that the Green Party be represented in the general election television debates.\r\n\r\n",
