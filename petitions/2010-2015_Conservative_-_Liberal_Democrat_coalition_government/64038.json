        "additional_details": "Labels are immensely important for communication. A label with multiple meanings spreads unnecessary confusion.\r\n\r\nThe UK government's \"Independent Police Complaints Commission\" is commonly abbreviated to 'IPCC'.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations' \"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\" is, naturally, also referred to as the 'IPCC'.\r\n\r\nThe UN's IPCC was created in 1988 [1] ; the UK's IPCC was established by the Police Reform Act 2002 [2] - fourteen years later!\r\n\r\nIn a sane world, such potential naming conflicts would be checked in advance by those responsible. But it's not too late to correct this mistake.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned demand that the name of the  Independent Police Complaints Commission be changed to avoid confusion with 'the other IPCC' - the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\r\n\r\n[1] http://www.ipcc.ch/organization/organization_history.shtml\r\n[2] http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/page/history",
