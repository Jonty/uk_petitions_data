        "additional_details": "Change the law such that the annual uplift in state benefits is the lower of CPI, RPI and the increase in average earnings for the year to September each year. This approach will ensure that benefits never increase by more than the increase in average earnings in a given year.\r\n\r\nAdditionally for the next 3 years benefits should be increased by the lower of CPI, RPI and the increase in average earning minus two percentage points. This will ensure that those on benefits are making a contribution to reducing the national debt as well as those people in work who are not eligible for benefits.\r\n\r\nIf necessary state pensions can be excluded from this process.\r\n",
