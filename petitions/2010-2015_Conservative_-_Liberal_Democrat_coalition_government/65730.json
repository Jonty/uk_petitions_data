        "additional_details": "Crohn`s is a inflammatory bowel disease which is very debilitating resulting in a wide variety of symptoms. It primarily causes abdominal pain, diarrhoea , vomiting, or weight loss, but may also cause complications outside the gastrointestinal tract such as anaemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, tiredness, and lack of concentration.\r\nUnless you suffer with this condition you will not realize how difficult it can be to do simple things throughout the day yet we have to suffer in silence as on the outside we can look like any other fit and healthy person.                    I feel its time that this disease is recognised as a disability so we can help make our lives just a little more bearable ",
