To date, show 1 example of a successful intervention? Not 1 country is working to a excellent standard yet billions have been spent and many hundreds/thousands of lives lost. Stop spending money we need to pay the deficit or money we need to improve the education system or health services. There are thousands of good causes and services that need this money! NO MILITARY INTERVENTION IN SYRIA!!!",
