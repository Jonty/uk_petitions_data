People should not be paid by the taxpayer to have children if they cannot afford to house, clothe and feed them on their existing income.\r\nMost hard working people only decide to have children once their incomes have increased to cover the extra cost of each child.  People who are not working should not expect the taxpayer to support more than two children.",
