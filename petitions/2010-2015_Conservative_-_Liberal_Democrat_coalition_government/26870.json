        "additional_details": "It is possible to purchase a kit for around \u00a340 from British companies on the internet, which will convert standard Halogen headlight bulbs to the latest HID technology.  The companies selling these kits clarify the sale saying it is the purchasers responsibility to check local laws on car lighting before fitting these kits, and they are only sold with the intention for \"off road\" use only.\r\n   Drivers are fitting these kits to their vehicles for driving on the road.  I would ask the department of transport to clarify if these kits are in fact legal, and if not legal to fit for road use, then ban them at point of sale.  The current laws are not stopping drivers from dazzling other road users, and I believe they are a great risk to safety on our roads.",
