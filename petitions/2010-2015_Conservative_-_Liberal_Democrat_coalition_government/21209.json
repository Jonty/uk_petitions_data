        "additional_details": "Israel has been illegally building settlements on Palestinian territory for decades. This is against international law. When other countries around the world behave in this manner the UK always stands up for justice and imposes sanctions or even takes military action to stop this behaviour.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the case of Israel the UK repeatedly ignores the situation or simply waggles its finger. This is most likely due to our ties with America and their increasingly ridiculous pro Israel stance.\r\n\r\nIsrael is its own nation and has every right to be but that does not give them the right to occupy the land of another people and repeatedly try and block any form of recognition for Palestine as a nation.\r\n\r\nI want the UK to impose trade sanctions against Israel until Israel stops and reverses the building of illegal settlements.\r\n\r\nIt is time the UK took action against this blatant illegal activity.",
