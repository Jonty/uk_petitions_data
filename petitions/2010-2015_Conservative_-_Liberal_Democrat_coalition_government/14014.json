Katie has been studying japanese since she was 11 and only wishes to do this, so she applied for a university in the hopes of getting in to study Japanese. If anyone could help support her, she would be eternally grateful. Even if Katie still isn't accepted, getting noticed would mean the world to her. You don't know how much she wants this.\r\n\r\n",
