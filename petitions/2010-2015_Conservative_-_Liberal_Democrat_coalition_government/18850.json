        "additional_details": "I think that if the government gives us rewards for saving electricity then the whole country will be encouraged to do so. The government has committed to cutting the carbon budget to 50% by 2025. If this happens then it will help the government to meet this target.\r\n\r\nIf you have used less electricity than you used the year before then you should be rewarded. This could be through the government or the electricity companies. This reward could be given as a credit on your energy bill or as cash back.\r\n\r\nPlease sign my petition if you think that this is a good thing for the government to explore.",
