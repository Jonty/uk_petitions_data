This is something that has been talked about but little action has been taken. Pressure groups like Surfers Against Sewage have been battling for many years against dangerous waste and sewage being dumped close to our shores. This is something that should be taken more seriously and needs review.\r\n\r\nKeep are beaches clean\r\n\r\nTom Straughan ",
