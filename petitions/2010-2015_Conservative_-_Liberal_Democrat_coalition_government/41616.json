        "additional_details": "The BBC has so much of our hard earned and tax paid money - that it saw fit to pay \u00a3450,000.00 to a disgraced employee who messed up so badly in his 56 days in the job, that he had to resign.\r\n\r\nThey also allowed two further seniors to step aside on full pay, paying other's to step into their posts - to aid an investigation.  Whilst wishing \"to make it absolutely clear\" that neither Ms Boaden nor Mr Mitchell had anything to do with the failed investigation into Lord McAlpine and they expect to return to their positions after the Pollard report.\r\n\r\nThere is a campaign now to restore faith - well, we have none.  Why do we pay \u00a3145.50 for them to throw this money to reward failure.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to stop public funding of a business so out of touch with reality, and to allow it to stand on it's own two feet in terms of revenue's generated and profits / losses made.\r\n\r\nPerhaps then it would not have been so careless with it's bottom line.",
