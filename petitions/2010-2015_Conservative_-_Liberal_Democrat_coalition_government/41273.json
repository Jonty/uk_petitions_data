        "additional_details": "A 'living wage' is the term used to describe how much someone needs to earn per hour to afford the basic essentials in life, not luxuries, essentials. The campaign for a living wage is growing in strength with\r\nLabour now throwing its support behind the idea and London mayor Boris Johnson saying it has his wholehearted support.\r\nThe recommended living wage was recently set at \u00a38.55 an hour in London and \u00a37.45 an hour for\r\nthe rest of the UK. The minimum wage is \u00a36.19. Please sign the petition in favour of raising the national minimum wage to match the living wage needed for people to be able to support themselves.\r\n",
