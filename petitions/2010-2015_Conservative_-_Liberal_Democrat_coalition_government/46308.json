        "action": "Government austerity to be stopped",
        "additional_details": "The UK is facing a triple dip recession, with taxes high and debt and borrowing increasing sharply. The UK recorded negative growth last year and growth is predicted to be at 1%. I predict no more than 0.6% growth for 2013. As a result of the Government's austerity, the UK has had its credit rating lowered to AA1 from AAA. Surely the Government will realise that it must do more to boost the economy create jobs and stop austerity measures hurting the UK's tepid recovery. Please sign this petition if you agree with me that austerity is biting into our pay packets leaving us with less to spend. Please sign if you agree that austerity measures should be stopped immediately.",
