        "additional_details": "Having just done a drivers cpc and discovered that on the most part everyone on the course had a different interpretation of the drivers Tachograph rules and have all been running illegally at some point. I suggest a simplification of those rule so that all drivers can understand them and work within their boundaries properly.\r\n\r\nGiven that we can all be pulled and jailed or fined for what are sometimes small unintended infringements we knew nothing about and that VOSA is target driven to fund itself I think the current system creates the situation where this could happen rather than facilitate safer driving and create competition.\r\n\r\nCommon sense shows that if drivers don't understand it properly and are leaving the trade because of it when we already have a shortage and the average age is already around 51 with few young people getting qualified there will soon be a problem that we cannot easily tackle anyway.",
