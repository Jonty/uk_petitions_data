        "action": "Maintain national public pay rates",
        "additional_details": "We petition the Chancellor George Osborne to maintain national rates of pay for the public sector. Differential rates of pay across regions is unfair to public sector workers and to taxpayers as it will drive the talented professionals we rely upon, such as teachers and nurses, away from poorer regions towards more economically and socially wealthy areas.\r\n\r\nThe private sector sets national rates of pay in chains of shops, pubs, supermarkets and so on. To refuse public sector workers the right to receive a set level of pay for a job which requires the same qualifications, skills and experience is blatantly unfair and should not be considered in this years budget.",
