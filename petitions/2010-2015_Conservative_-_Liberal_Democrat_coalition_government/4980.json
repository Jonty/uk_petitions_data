For the state to decide which information the citizens of this country are allowed access to may seem sensible today, but nobody can be sure of what may happen tomorrow. Perhaps it will not be possible to criticise the government, or organise protests.\r\n\r\nWe may not like what some people look at, but we have no right to deny them it when we claim ourselves to be at liberty.\r\n\r\nIt should be anathema for the government to get involved in this most Orwellian of activities.\r\n\r\nOpen the internet and keep it free so our mother of parliaments can continue as a beacon of hope to the rest of the world.",
