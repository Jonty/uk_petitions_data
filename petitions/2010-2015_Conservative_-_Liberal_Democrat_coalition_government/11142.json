This will involve a period if time training in a military environment followed by either a continued military post or a public service. This could involve environmental roles such as tree planting, gardening, litter picking, filling potholes, bin collecting. All those who serve will receive literacy training and will leave with a trade.\r\n\r\nThis national service will instill discipline, self esteem and provide role models. The young person will leave with a literacy qualification and a basic trade depending on their specific role.",
