        "additional_details": "We are campaigning for the lowering & capping of university fees.\r\n Following changes in 2012 universities in England can now charge up to \u00a39,000 a year for undergraduate courses; almost triple the previous amount of \u00a33,375 in 2011/12.\r\nSome countries e.g. Germany have already scrapped university fees and many other countries are already well on the way to doing so \u2013 so why are we being left behind?\r\nThis is an urgent call for action. In the lead up to the 2015 general election tuition fees are sure to be a highly debated topic and it is time that a change is made. We are calling for university fees to be scrapped \u2013 or at least lowered from \u00a39,000 to a maximum of \u00a34,500 and for more financial aid e.g. loans with lower interest rates & longer repayment times to be given to all British citizens studying at universities in England.\r\nWe need your help so please sign and join our cause.\r\n",
