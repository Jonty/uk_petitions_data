        "additional_details": "I would like changes to the tax laws to encourage new companies to move to Britain, ensuring that they and their employees are provided with a stable place to work and do business. In return I believe that they should contribute to British society as a whole.\r\n\r\n1. Each individual compaby should agree to join the scheme for a minimum of 20 years.\r\n\r\n2. Corporation tax is set at zero.\r\n\r\n3. Income tax for each member company's, employees is set at 20%.\r\n\r\n4. In return for the lack of red tape and a stable place in which to do busines the British people (via UK Financial Investments) is allocated a fixed percentage of issue share capital. Approximately 1-2%\r\n\r\n5. All tax loopholes are closed and tax evasion is seriously punished. But not with a financial penalty in the case of the company because that may harm our shareholding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
