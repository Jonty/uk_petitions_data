Planning currently blights lives, from a simple process of asking to make more space, to creating jobs through development. Most towns and cities were created without the planning laws we have today. If the same regime was in place in our early history, we would not have listed buildings, they just would not have been built, trying to squash development into brownfiled sites, depressed areas are created, greater burdens are placed on the population and services, lets have some new villages, where new communities can thrive, lets not have new towns, but new villages, with shops and places to work, and advancing the use of technology, good schools, lets create a britain for the year 3000. support the govement initative.",
