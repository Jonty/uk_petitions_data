        "additional_details": "Our front line ambulance crews face the prospect of dealing with more calls.They face danger on a regular basis from violent and abusive patients, and as we become more obese as a society, larger people to lift and carry,  all until the ripe old age of 67 . This is just ridiculous. They work Christmas day, many weekends and unsociable hours and probably are called out more in one day that their colleges in the fire service are called out all week.  The public is under the misconception that they are treated the same as our other emergency services  but they are not.Sending a 67 year old to carry a 20 stone 70 year old is just not right.\r\nGive our 999 ambulance staff the same options to retire like our police and fire service .If money is an issue make it just frontline staff in all services or make the police fire and ambulance services get the same even if some services have to work longer to pay for the changes.They work just as hard in a just as demanding enviroment.",
