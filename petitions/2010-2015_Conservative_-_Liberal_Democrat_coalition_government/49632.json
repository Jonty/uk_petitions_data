        "additional_details": "The Borough of Harrow Swimming Club will be denied access to use the John Lyon Sports Complex, Harrow-on-the-Hill from June 30th 2013 onwards due to parking issues raised by the public & Harrow Council stating that the original intended purpose of the build in the late 1990s was for school use only.\r\nSwimmers in the club have county, regional, national & international aspirations.  These will be jeopardised without access to a pool.  Moreover, being part of the Swimming Club promotes healthy living amongst the swimmers and encourages a community spirit.  These things must not be ignored in the 21st century.  We want the Department for Culture, Media & Sport to mediate to ensure The Borough of Harrow Swimming Club has access to the pool at John Lyon.\r\n\r\n",
