        "additional_details": "Action must be taken to keep sensible road users, their passengers and pedestrians safe from irresponsible drivers. The government has to enforce something to stop people from using their phones while driving as the threat of points on the licence of the offender does not appear to be enough. Perhaps having their licence taken from them will work, at least then they cannot continue to put others in danger. Nothing so urgently requires to be discussed on the phone that the driver cannot take the time to stop and use their phone safely. People have already lost their lives in road traffic accidents involving drivers distracted by mobile phones. These drivers do not have any respect for the law or the other road users who are at risk because of them. It must stop now.",
