At the moment they are treated as separate issues meaning a large number of people are falling between the cracks in the system and not getting the help they need/ deserve.The mental health act states that if you are a danger to yourself or others you should be sectioned but if you use drugs/ alcohol this blurs the system and your just an addict. Do people use because they want to or because they have mental health issues and there is little/ no help for them?",
