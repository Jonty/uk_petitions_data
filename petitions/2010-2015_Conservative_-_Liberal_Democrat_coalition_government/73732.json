        "additional_details": "Re-opening Coventry Airport would be beneficial for business and tourism in the South Midlands and Warwickshire and also will lower flight prices from nearby airports because of increased availability and choice of flights from Coventry Airport. When Coventry Airport opened in 2004 by TUI Group, I expanded rapidly until it closed in 2008 due to planning permission for the passenger terminal building. This shows that the demand is there and it would provide more choice and cheaper prices for the citizens who live in close proximity to the airport and its surrounding counties. ",
