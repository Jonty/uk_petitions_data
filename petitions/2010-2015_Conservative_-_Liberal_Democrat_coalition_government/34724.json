We have watched him grow up and grown with him. We have become fanatical at the mention of a tour and become obsessed at getting tickets. We have screamed til we can scream no more at Take That concerts. Every project he gets involved with is sure to be a spectacular event. For his dedication to helping charitys such as Help The Heroes, Comic Relief, The Princes Trust and Children In Need. For organising and producing one of the best live concerts ever to celebrate The Queens Jubilee. What better way to acknowledge all his hard work 'Sir Gary Barlow'",
