        "additional_details": "I work in a nursing home and every month hundreds of pounds worth of medication is thrown away.  This is because the current law states that unused medication cannot be returned to the pharmacy or used for any other person.  There are thousands of nursing and care homes in the UK and the cost of wasted medication must run into millions.  I want to see a change in the law so that unused medication in the original packaging and in date can be re-used, or if this is rejected, donated to charities for use in impoverished countries.  It is a scandal to simply throw perfectly usable and often expensive medicaton away when people are dying for a lack of basic medicines.  We are paying for this out of our taxes and it is unacceptable that so much of our money is simply wasted due to the current regulations.  As taxpayers we deserve better.",
