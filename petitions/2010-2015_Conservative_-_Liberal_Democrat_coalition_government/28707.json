        "additional_details": "Women have to pay for sanitary products every month, yet contraception where people have a choice is free. In this current time the tax on items is going through the roof, the tax is getting higher on these products that we cannot live without.For example my mother had four daughters for the cheapest sanitary products it's around \u00a32.50 for a box of tampons x 2 as most girls/women need 2 boxes,x 4 (daughters) x 12 (yearly) works out at \u00a3240. Buying my own at the age of 17 a box of tampons is \u00a32.79x 2 is \u00a35.58 x 12=  \u00a366.96 a year if the tax stays the same x this on average over the cause of my life to when i would have my menopause which on average is age 45= \u00a31,874.88 x this by the amount of women in the united kingdom say 15 million =\u00a328,123,200,000.pa\r\nNow looking at this i really don't think this is fair.\r\nIf they are not made free they should at least not have tax on them and have a set price for life.\r\n\r\n",
