        "additional_details": "This petiton is to get the government to charge a set \u00a310.00 fee for a 7 day road tax use at the port of Entry for all international vehicles entering Britain incl any British Reg vehicle with expired Road tax. . All international vehicles exiting Britain with expired ticket shall pay the weekly stayed difference at any port of exit . Vehicles entering are entered on one main computer, parking tickets are  registered and payable at the port of exit.  British citizens pay vehicle tax for the use of British roads then abroad they pay peage/toll fees for maintenance and repair. Not one country pays to use British roads!  Multiply each port of entry by \u00a310.00 per vehicle and you have approx million pound a week in revenue  to help Britains schools, roads, hospitals, and reduce university charges. Olympics 2012 will damage our roads, why should we pay for all the repair.",
