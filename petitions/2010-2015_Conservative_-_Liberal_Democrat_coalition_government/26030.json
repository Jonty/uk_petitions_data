        "additional_details": "St Georges NHS Trust have developed  proposals entitled \" Improving Neurorehabilitation Services in southwest London\"\r\n\r\nThese proposals include the reduction of amputee reserved beds by 1/3, from 12 plus 2 swing beds to just 8 beds with no swing beds available.\r\n\r\nThis will inevitable lead to longer waiting times for the most complex of amputee patients, reduced outcomes, and even deaths.\r\n\r\nWith more and more patients be treated as day patients, leading to a strain on Ambulance transport which new amputees depend upon, resulting in very long journeys and reduced time available for rehabilitation staff, due to this dependence.\r\n\r\nThe entire consultation process is we believe in breach of the Codes of Practice as Published in 2008.\r\n\r\nWe would seek to halt this consultation and recommence with a full consultation process of 12 weeks as opposed to the 4 weeks being undertaken by the Trust.\r\n\r\nThereby the whole amputee community may be consulted.",
