        "additional_details": "After the recent attack of 4 police officers in north London last weekend the debate regarding taser and it's use has reared it's head on social networking groups like twitter. The use of taser is still a political hot potato for some reason. With police force command teams refusing to embrace its use. Many officers feel that this piece of personal protective equipment should be standard issue to all operational front line officers.\r\nTaser is classified at the same level in the use of force guidelines as CS which is below baton and empty hand skills.\r\nIf this is the case why isn't it used and why isn't it personal issue. I am aware of the financial implications but with reduced officer numbers and the streamlining of procedure a large government backed order from the 43 forces buying as one then it is achievable with buying power.
