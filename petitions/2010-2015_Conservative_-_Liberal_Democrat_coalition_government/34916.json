It is easy to overlook this procedure and in doing so possibly harm the child's developing feet. Good footwear is essential to the healthy development of growing feet.\r\n\r\nWe are all aware that a good quality pair of shoes are not cheap.  The alternative being to buy a cheap pair of shoes that will wear in weeks.\r\n\r\nI propose that the Department for Education instructs school governors to relax their school uniform policies to include black trainers or canvas shoes.",
