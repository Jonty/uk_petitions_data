        "additional_details": "Please sign this e-petition to stop the government plan to privatise the 46 Fire and Rescue Services in England.\r\n\r\nIt will put lives at risk as \u00ademergency services are run on a whim as private companies and their need for profit will come first.\r\n\r\nFire and Rescue is an essential public service which we all depend on for our safety, and our lives.\r\n\r\nFirefighting is a no-go area for privatisation. The first and last concern of our fire services must be public protection not company profit.\r\n\r\nLabour last night hit out at the proposal. MP John Healey said: \u201cThis is a privatisation too far.\r\n\r\nPrivatisation of the Fire and Rescue Service will cost more to the public in the future.\r\n\r\n",
