        "additional_details": "During the Summer, children don't want to be stuck in the classroom they want to be outside enjoying the weather. In the Winter the weather is terrible and temperatures go below freezing, making the roads very dangerous. This risks the lives of every family that attempt to commute to school every day during the dreadful weather. I want the Government to move the six week school holiday to the winter so that deaths caused by the terrible weather can be avoided and children can be in the safety of their home.\r\n",
