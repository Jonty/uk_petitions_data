I propose restricting how often often vehicles restricted to 60mph can overtake.\r\n\r\nAny vehicles restricted to 60mph on a motorway or less (eg. lorries, caravans, coaches etc.) are only allowed to overtake for 15 minutes each hour.\r\n\r\nThe 15 minutes is from the hour to 15 minutes past the hour (eg. 12:00 to 12:15).  This would allow the motorway to run smoothly for the remaining 45 minutes.",
