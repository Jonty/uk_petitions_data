They exist because of the cold war which is now part of history. To retain these weapons makes the world a more dangerous place\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nIf we spent as much time and energy on creating peace as we do war, then the world could be a much better place for us and our children.\r\n\r\nThis is no fantasy. It just needs commitment.",
