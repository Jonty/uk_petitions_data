The money raised should then be used to contribute to Police, Fire Brigade, Ambulance and A&E activities.\r\n\r\nBy making calls premium rated it would help reduce the number of hoax 999 calls of which there are several thousand a day.  Money raised would also be used to help guarantee funding for local Police, Fire Brigade and Ambulance services, and in the case of A&E departments the money raised could be used to help improve security for all members of staff working in A&E.",
