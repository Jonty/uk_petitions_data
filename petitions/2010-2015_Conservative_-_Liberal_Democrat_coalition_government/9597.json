Theirs will be a very unpleasant short stay (less than three months, maybe, unless their looting was 'aggravated' etc) with foul food, hard beds, no TV, no i-this or i-that, no computers, no mobile phones etc etc.They should be bored out of their minds, and lonely. They should come out after their stay, never wanting to go back to prison again.",
