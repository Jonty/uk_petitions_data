        "additional_details": "Lord Mandelson has admitted that the previous Labour government has sent out search parties abroad to seek out immigrants to bring them to the UK. This has resulted in issues such as:\r\n\r\n1) British citizens unable to find work.\r\n\r\n2) Schools, housing, and the NHS unable to cope with the strain of new arrivals.\r\n\r\n3) England is suffering from overpopulation.\r\n\r\n4) Immigrants that are unwilling to contribute to British society, and fail to speak English.\r\n\r\n5) Increased tensions across the country with British citizens feeling like they are being ignored.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, urge the government to hold an inquiry into the motives of the Labour party's open door immigration policy, specifically why they sent out search parties to find new immigrants.",
