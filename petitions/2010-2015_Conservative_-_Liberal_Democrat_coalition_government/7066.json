In this country we have housing shortages reaching crisis point, major employment problems, financially the country is broke, education systems failing, health services at breaking point and these issues are only going to get worse. Projections for food provision are also alarming.\r\nAmongst a number of measures we need financial disincentives to having larger families and possibly financial  incentives for couples either not having children or keeping families smaller. Childless couples often contribute more financially to the taxation, welfare and education systems and take back less.",
