We allow individuals and their cultures the freedom to express their views and beliefs while doing so discriminates its own people.\r\nLocal councils ban our St Georges flag because it offends some people.\r\nAbu Qatada remains in this country spewing out evil hatred, yet under human right laws we cannot deport him from our own Country. The fact is, we are too scared.\r\nThis latest sickening incident of a British soldier serving to protect the nation is let down by its own government and must stop.\r\nYou as our government and we as the people that elected you must say enough is enough.\r\nStop this mass immigration onto our shores, invoke laws to crush websites that attempt to radicalize hatred.",
