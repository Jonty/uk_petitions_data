        "additional_details": "In secondary schools at KS4 there is not enough information on smoking or the effects caused by cigarettes. This causes teenagers to start smoking at a very young age (even though it is illegal) because they are not aware of the outcomes. This also affects others because, tobacco not only affects you but also the people around you.  Currently there is no requirement from QCA to include smoking on the science GCSE and as so, many exam boards do not cover the subject.",
