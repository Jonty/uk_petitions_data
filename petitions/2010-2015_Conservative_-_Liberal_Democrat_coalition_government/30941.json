        "additional_details": "KONY has been abducting children in Uganda and forcing them to commit murder, become victims of rape and has gone over 20 years without any international intervention. Until now, the US have sent military advisors to assist in the capture of Kony and disband his army. However, the UK should also be seen to help. Already trending worldwide on Twitter and 1000's of hits in the short film, it's clear this is what the people want.
