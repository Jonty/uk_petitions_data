        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call on the government to remove Section 58 from The Animal Welfare Act (2006) and make all animal testing a criminal offense.\r\n\r\nAnimal testing is unrevealing and often slows down medical research.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of animals in this manner would be a criminal offence if it were not being carried out under the name of medical research.\r\n\r\nUnnecessary suffering and mutilation are just 2 points raised in The Animal Welfare Act (2006) as an offence.\r\n\r\nAs alternative methods are available (which provide more accurate results) the continuation of animal testing is inexcusable.\r\n\r\nAnimal testing not only harms the defenceless animals, it also harms the people who go on to take these improperly tested medicines.\r\n\r\nMore than 10,000 people die each year in the UK due to adverse reactions and side-effects to prescription drugs. That figure is 100,000 in the US.\r\n\r\nAnimal testing should be made a criminal offense by law and not an exception to The Animal Welfare Act (2006).",
