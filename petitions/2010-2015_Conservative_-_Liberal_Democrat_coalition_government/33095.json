Following Sky's purchase of the UK broadcast rights, the vast majority of the British public will be unable to enjoy the timeless double-entendres, raised eyebrows, and shameless product placement.\r\n\r\nAs the 50th anniversary of the first Bond film approaches, we believe that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport should set up an independent advisory panel (ideally chaired by Sir Sean Connery) to consider granting Bond films with the Free-to-Air status currently accorded to many sporting events, and providing these films the 'National Treasure' status they so richly deserve. What\u2019s more, we believe nobody should have to pay to see Moonraker.",
