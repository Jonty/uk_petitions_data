        "additional_details": "Although restricted drivers speed limit should be lower, the limit of 45mph on a motorway is a driving hazard!  I propose to increase the speed limit for Restricted drivers to 60mph on Motorways only.\r\nBy driving at 45mph this is what mainly causes lorries to move into the overtaking lane, causing conjestion and increasing the risk of a crash!  By increasing the speed limit to 60moh for restricted drivers, we are minimilising this risk and also helping to prevent the number of Restricted drivers who remove their R plates to avoid suspician on the motorway, as many feel the need to do so as they feel unsafe driving at 45mph!",
