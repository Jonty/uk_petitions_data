        "action": "The Petition to Change the Theme of Christmas Every Year",
        "additional_details": "This petition puts forward the idea that Christmas should not be Christmas themed every year as it has been for the last 2012 years, it has become stale. I know the current theme is rooted deeply in tradition as we remember the characters present at the birth of our lord Jesus; the snowman, the reindeer and that jolly bearded Scandinavian Santa Claus. However to make the festive season more exciting I am proposing that the current government set up a Christmas cabinet that settles on a new theme every year. Suggested themes are as follows: Pirates, Moulin Rouge, cowboys etc.\r\nSeasonal decorations set up by local councils must also be themed accordingly and everybody is encouraged to wear full costume for the holiday season.\r\nThis will boost the moral of Britain in these time of economic depression and increase community spirit as neighbors pull together in order to cobble together a pirate costume before the big day.",
