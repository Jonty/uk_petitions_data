        "additional_details": "Establish a National Grid for water, owned and managed by a single entity, comprising existing watercourses and linking pipework, to ensure  continuity and security of supplies to all areas of the country at all times, especially in drought conditions. Provide every consumer with a metered supply, and reorganise water suppliers on the lines of the energy industry, so that consumers have a choice of competing suppliers for their water. This will deliver best value for the consumer and avoid the need to control demand by price, which would bear most heavily on poorer households. ",
