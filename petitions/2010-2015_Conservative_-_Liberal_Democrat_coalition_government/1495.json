        "additional_details": "This petition calls for a debate on Cannabis legislation. The war on drugs simply isn\u2019t working, cannabis use is on the rise and as many scientific reports have concluded, its criminalisation is doing more harm than good. While there is evidence to suggest long-term cannabis use may lead to mental health problems, there is no evidence that occasional recreational use causes any ill effects. I call for cannabis to be regulated in the same way as alcohol, a far more dangerous yet legal drug known to kill many users and endanger innocent others. The benefits of such legislation include 1. Safer drugs 2. Increase tourism 3. Increase jobs 4. Free up police resources and money 5. Increase government revenue 6. Avoid users coming into contact with dealers who also supply more dangerous drugs. Criminalising such a safe drug sends out the message that current drug laws are out of touch with the real world and weakens the validity of the argument concerning harder drugs that are known to harm.",
