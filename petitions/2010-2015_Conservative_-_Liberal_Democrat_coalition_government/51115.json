        "additional_details": "Owing to the fact we have free bus passes, the bus companies can no longer afford to keep the buses on some of the local routes.  We, the older users, who need the transport even more as we grow older, have no alternative way of getting to the shops or the doctor.\r\nIn Southampton, our local company \"Velvet\" is being discontinued , which is unfortunate, because some new retirement homes are being built on the route which was a major factor in locating these new houses.\r\nI would like the government to rethink their policy on free bus passes and increase the subsidy paid to bus companies so that they can maintain these local services..",
