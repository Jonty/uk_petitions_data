        "additional_details": "Around 800 dartmoor ponies are slaughtered for the zoo meat scheme each year.  Farmers who own them report that they can't get more than \u00a31 at auction.  Finding one of these ponies for \u00a31 seems impossible, they are worth more for meat.\r\nIf these beautiful ponies only have a fate of zoo meat then their breeding should be controlled.  None are truly wild, they are owned by farmers who make more money on a sale for zoo meat than elsewhere and turned out onto the moor for cheap upkeep.\r\nPlease sign my petition to stop these ponies being sold for zoo meat and put a proper and acceptable breeding programme in place.",
