        "additional_details": "Stereotyping us all as scroungers flies in the face of the notion that we are all in this together. Should we pigeonhole widowed parents bringing up two children on a part-time wage supplemented by benefits, as scroungers? Or carers looking after relatives, or a profoundly disabled child, saving taxpayers thousands? We are a nation of people proud of helping neighbours in their time of need. The majority of claimants are productive members of society, and of those who are on 100% benefits, a vast majority return back to work within six months. The Welfare Reform Act (WRA) proposes that we kick our fallen neighbours and relatives instead. The Coalition Govt. is capitalising on the misinformed hatred of the few, fuelled by a stereotyped \u201cscrounger\u201d, to drive forward their divisive, ideological attack on the vulnerable, to cleans the \u201cunwashed\u201d from their midst, banished forever to the ghettos of the outer fringes of our great cities. We oppose the WRA and demand it is scrapped forthwith.",
