        "additional_details": "The Former Prime Minister 'Tony Blair' allegedly deceived the Parliament, lied to the voters and conspired primarily with USA, and without declaring war engaged in a military invasion of Iraq on or after 20 March 2003, on the pretence that it was in possession of 'Weapons of Mass Destruction' and 'Cruise Missiles.'\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Chilcot Enquiry announced by Prime Minister Gordon Brown on 15 June 2009, to consider Britain's involvement in Iraq between mid-2001 and July 2009 has failed without giving valid reasons to release its report by 2014.\r\n\r\nI aver that the incumbent Coalition Government should either release the participants from the enquiry indefinitely, and/or give reasons as to the delay in the release of the report, and confirm whether there is any likelihood of the contents of this report being released, before the next General Election on Thursday 7 May 2015, as set down in Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (c 14).",
