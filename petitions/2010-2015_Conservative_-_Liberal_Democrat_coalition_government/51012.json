The recent medal survey conducted by Sir John Holmes was in favour of the medal award to all past and present British Military and yet the Government have failed to act. They have acknowledged and issued medals to  Bomber Command and the North Atlantic veterans. Where is the British justice that does not recognise those past and present military personnel that wore the Kings/Queens uniform with pride and were prepare to die for our freedoms. I ask the Government to act NOW and treat the British exactly the same as the Australians and New Zealanders by awarding the National Defence Medal to the British Military past and present",
