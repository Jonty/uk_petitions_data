        "additional_details": "A petition against the sharp price rise of the new AHA arriva bus card - Aberystwyth University. The cost of the pass has increased significantly from \u00a340 last year to \u00a3180 this year and doesn't represent value for money any longer. It offers five free routes which in comparison to other universities is extremely expensive. Nottingham's is \u00a3260, but that covers the whole of Nottingham, trams, and a proper night bus system. The \u00a3140 increase is just not justified and will leave many students unable to purchase it.",
