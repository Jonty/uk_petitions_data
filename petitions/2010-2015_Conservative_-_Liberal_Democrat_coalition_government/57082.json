        "additional_details": "The UK Government has generously agreed that in addition to its initial provision of emergency relief it will also match public donations to the Disasters Emergency Committee's Philippines Typhoon appeal up to the value of \u00a35 million.  However, such is the empathy of the British public for the plight of the Philippines disaster victims that the public appeal has raised \u00a313 million in the first 24 hours.  This petition asks the Government to reconsider the cap on its matching of donations and match all public donations to the DEC appeal.",
