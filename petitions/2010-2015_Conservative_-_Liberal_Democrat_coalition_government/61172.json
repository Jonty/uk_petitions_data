These guns make living in rural areas a misery as they are now operating 12 months of the year and 7 days a week. They are affecting the use and enjoyment of our homes. We cannot sit outside in the summer, instead we have to remain indoors with the windows closed but even that doesn't drown out the bangs which often start at 4 or 5 in the morning and go on dusk which in the summer months can be 10pm The government needs to ban or closely regulate the use of these devices as current NFU guidelines are unacceptable and ignored and we're written by farmers!
