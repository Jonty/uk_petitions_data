The EU is proving ineffective. Enough has happened to draw a line in the sand, don't wait for someone to die or be injured at sea or in the inhumane border crossing conditions. It is time that a stand is made against Spain and to stop the mis-information, inhumane and illegal actions that the country employs on a daily basis. Please take action, in the international courts, in the UN or EU and if necessary deploy assets to Gibraltar to police the waters. Stop the harassment please and let us all get on with our lives peacefully and in the manner expected as a member of the EU.",
