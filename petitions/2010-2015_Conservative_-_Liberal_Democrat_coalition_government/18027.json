        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, believe that Basildon Council has been totally inept and unfit for purpose in it's dealings with Dale Farm.  We believe the eviction order to be shambolic, based on facts at the time that have now been described as misleading.  Over a decade, hundreds of people working on this case failed to get the basics right and  thousands upon thousands of pounds of tax payers money has been spent on a process that was never fit for purpose.  Basildon Council has shown itself to be sadly lacking in many other areas of local government too and it is time that they were investigated publicly and held to account in relation to Dale Farm,",
