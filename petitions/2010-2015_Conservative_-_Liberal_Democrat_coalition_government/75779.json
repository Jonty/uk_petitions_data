        "additional_details": "Personally I think that this program is making a mockery of our royal family. I believe that the great British Nation and other countries within the Commonwealth are silently offended by how the monarchy is going to be portrayed in an American style drama. If this program is going to be shown on American TV reflect on how it should be represented tastefully by the example of \"The Queen\" staring Dame Helen Mirren. With the Duke and Duchess of York due to visit the USA, is this the right time if any to screen such a program? Question: How would the American people feel if a program with a similar nature was filmed here about the White House?",
