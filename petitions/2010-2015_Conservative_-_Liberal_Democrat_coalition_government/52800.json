        "additional_details": "After completing a survey in our local area, we found that most people didn't know of any support groups to do with Depression. In addition to this, even more people wanted to see it taught about in the Education system, as a means to both raise awareness for it and on the different ways to help handle it.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, we believe it should be taught within schools, in order to help people suffering from it and those that know of people suffering from depression.",
