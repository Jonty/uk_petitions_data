        "additional_details": "If fuel was dropped by 5p a litre. It would help the nation get moving again. The farmer that is plowing his fields with his tractor, could produce his crop cheaper. The haulage firm that collects the produce, could deliver it cheaper. The supermarket that sells the product can then sell it cheaper. It is one big circle, by cutting fuel cost by 5p a litre it would help everybody meaning everything would come down in price, energy prices, food prices and so on. So sign this today and let's kick start the uk again.",
