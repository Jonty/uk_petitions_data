        "additional_details": "The wall separating the Palestinians and the Israelis is illegal and should be knocked down! It separates people from their friends, families, heath care, work and education. The wall was first built by the Israeli government to \"protect the Israelis from the Palestinians\" but is it really? or is it just trapping them in a situation that neither feel safe in, their once peaceful home has now been turned into a prison. But the wall isn't only affecting the Palestinians it has also affected the Israelis way of life. We would like the government to take action and persuade the Israeli government to take down the wall.\r\n\r\nSo sign our petition and show that you too care about the people whose rights have been taken away and together we can try to make Parliament see justice and get them their rights back!\r\n",
