The government will be remiss or at least negligent to overlook this opportunity to be a world leader in creating this vision for the future of the UK in the science arena. For the government to accept the highest bidder and pocket a reported \u00a3500 million to augment the Treasury coffers in stringent and difficult times is surely short-sightedness.\r\n\r\nSupport The Wellcome Trust Olympic Bid 2012",
