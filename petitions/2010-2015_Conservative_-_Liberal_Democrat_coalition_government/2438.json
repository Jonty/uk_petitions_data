        "additional_details": "A bill providing tax breaks to the booming videogame industry was scrapped by the current government. In response several UK videogame developers have closed or relocated based on the current costs of running business in the UK combined with multinational publishers, the sheer cost of producing the current crop of videogames (which will increase in the next generation) and tax breaks offered by countries such as Canada. We produce some of most successful and innovative videogames in the world: Grand Theft Auto, Fable and Batman Arkham Asylum to name a few, so it would be tragic if these studios were allowed to closed or relocated.",
