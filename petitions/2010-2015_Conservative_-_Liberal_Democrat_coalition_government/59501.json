        "additional_details": "The house of lords is a disgrace to democracy, many of it's members gain seats after they have been voted out of office, others have been given the position as a reward for donating money to political parties, this is clearly open to corruption and further degrades public trust in the political system.\r\n We propose that the house of lords be replaced with a house of citizens, the current job of the lords should be done by people selected at random in a similar system to that of the jury service, these people could be invited in and replaced after one year. This will serve to lower the chances of corruption by making it impossible for a lord to be \"bought\" on a long term basis, bringing the public in should also serve to increase interest in politics as eventually everyone will know someone that has been a \"lord\", the current system is dangerously unfair and only serves to push people away from politics.\r\n",
