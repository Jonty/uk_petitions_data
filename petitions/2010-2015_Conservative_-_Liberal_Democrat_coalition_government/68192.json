        "additional_details": "David Weir, a modest but extraordinarily determined and talented man from my home town of Wallington in Surrey has fought lifelong adversity to become the greatest wheelchair racer the world has ever known.\r\n\r\nUnable to use his legs due to a congenital spinal cord transection, his spirit is indomitable yet a thoroughly deserved knighthood in keeping with his Olympian peers is the one honour which eludes him.\r\n\r\n10 Paralympic medals including 6 gold, 4 of which at the London Paralympics could not have presented a greater diversity of challenge: 800m, 1500m, 5000m and marathon distances. 6 World Championship gold medals. 2 Paralympic World Cup golds. 6 London Marathons. Swiss and New York Marathon titles. 5 times Great North Run winner. 5 times Great Manchester Run winner.\r\n\r\nNow not just Britain's greatest wheelchair racer but, I repeat, the greatest wheelchair racer of all time.\r\n\r\nI urge the Cabinet Office to support this petition and to ennoble David Weir.",
