        "additional_details": "Although all birds are protected by legislation, Seagulls are posing a threat to public health. Their faeces are dropped all over pavements and people,they are stealing food from people's hands and they are building nests on buildings both listed and non listed. Buildings are not their natural habitat for nest building and should be humanely removed. The costs to local councils  for cleaning issues are substancial and will only increase through time. Can we please have some new legislation to reduce the Seagull population to safeguard our buildings and health and tax payer's money. Please suport a change in legislation. Thank you.",
