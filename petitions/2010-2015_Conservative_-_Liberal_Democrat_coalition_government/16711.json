Not only does it seem sensible to have two broadly left and right wing parties represented, but it also seems that UKIP's outlook is becoming more mainstream.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2004_(United_Kingdom)\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2009_(United_Kingdom)\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010#Results\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley_Central_by-election,_2011\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14835080\r\n\r\nhttp://today.yougov.co.uk/politics/eu-referendum\r\n",
