People are not being responsible with their benefits that are in place to support them and all they need to do is move the child to another setting leaving a trail of debt an impacting negatively on their children emotional wellbeing,\r\n\r\nThis element of tax credits MUST be paid directly to providers and not the parent/carer of the child.",
