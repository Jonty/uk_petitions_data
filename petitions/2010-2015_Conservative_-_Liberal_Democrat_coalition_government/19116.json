Evidence of a true relationship is acceptable but the knowledge test should be abolished for spouses and partners.\r\n\r\nThe average UK citizen scores below 50% so why should a foreigner moving to the UK to be with their partner need to score 75% on a test full of facts that will not help them add to society in any way.\r\n\r\nPlea sign to help abolish this UK knowledge test for spouses and partners.",
