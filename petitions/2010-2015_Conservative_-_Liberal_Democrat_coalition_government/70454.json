        "additional_details": "\r\nWe have all heard about the abuses suffered by the most vulnerable people in our society and The Health and Social Care Act 2012 requires local authorities to establish local Healthwatch organisations to act as consumer champions for health and social care.\r\nHealthwatch is funded by the government and funds are paid to local authorities for this important work. The local authority distributes the fund to the local Healthwatch and in many cases, withholds and uses the the funds for other purposes, leaving the Healthwatch without essential funds to deliver an effective service.\r\nMany volunteers, across the country, are freely giving of their time and expertise, to improve health services for us all. Using this fund for other purposes, is taking advantage of the people\u2019s goodwill.\r\nSo please, Ringfence the funds, for which is intended. We need 500,000 e-signatures to have this request heard in parliament. ",
