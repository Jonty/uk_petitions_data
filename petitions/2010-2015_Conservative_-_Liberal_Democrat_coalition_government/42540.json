        "additional_details": "UKBA charges extremely high fees and they can take 6 months + to process an application. This is highly stressful for both the applicant and their British partner. During the application both parties have their passports taken away so they cannot travel. We are like prisoners in our own country.Typical costs for a gay couple where 1 person is British is \u00a31,018 PCP visa, \u00a3580 FLR (m) visa and \u00a31,000 ILR. That is nearly \u00a32,600 just to have the opportunity to live together. This should be considered a breach of human rights where only the rich are allowed to be partnered with foreign people. The banks were criticised for unnecessarily high fees so why should the UKBA be treated any differently. The UKBA is a disgrace and they should explain the ill treatment of UK citizens involved in this mess.",
