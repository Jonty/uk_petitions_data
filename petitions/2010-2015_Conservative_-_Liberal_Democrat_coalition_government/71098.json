However, the Green Party's leader Natalie Bennett has not been invited to join the debates.\r\n\r\nUKIP has recently just gained its first MP but the Greens have had an MP (Caroline Lucas) for the last 4 years.\r\n\r\nThe Green Party beat the Liberal Democrats in the 2014 European Elections and is currently polling neck-and-neck with them in General Election opinion polls. More than 1.2 million people voted Green in May 2014, which is over 150,000 more votes than the Liberal Democrats received, and Nick Clegg is to be included in these debates.\r\n\r\nIt is in the interest of fairness and the spirit of a well-rounded debate that Natalie Bennett is included in these TV debates, to reflect the current political climate and the opinions of the British people.",
