        "additional_details": "It is a mathematical fact that with immigration, and the higher birth rate of the Muslim community, during this century the majority in the UK will be Muslims.\r\n\r\nAt that point, it is a fair assumption that the majority of MP's will be Muslim, as will be Cabinet Ministers and the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nWe could be governed by Shia law.  Our defence forces will be controlled by Muslim's, as will our nuclear weapons.\r\n\r\nAs it is inconceivable that the USA will tolerate that situation, we should cancel the new nuclear submarines and get rid of all nuclear weapons before it is too late.
