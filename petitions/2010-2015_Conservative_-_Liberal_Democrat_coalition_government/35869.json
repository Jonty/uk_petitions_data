        "additional_details": "I would like parliament to abolish the letter Q from the English language as it is redundant. The letter Q can be replaced in all conceivable cases by the perfectly serviceable letter K. This amendment will vastly simplify written English, to the benefit of all those who wish to learn it as well as those with learning difficulties relating to phonetic spelling.\r\n\r\nFinancial savings could be made as a result of the abolition of a letter from the language as the short-term cost of re-issuing all computer and telephone keyboards could be recouped in long-term materials costs. The abolition of the letter Q will allow us to get rid of the kwaint but frankly ridiculous QWERTY keyboard conventions and also create new jobs in the economy. ",
