London 2012 has brought the nation together unlike any other recent sporting event. Rather than England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland battling against each other, the country has united to support one UK-wide team who have taken on the world and won.\r\n\r\nHowever surely it would make sense if this UK-wide team we have all been supporting was actually called \u201cTeam UK\u201d instead of \u201cTeam GB\u201d. The team includes not only athletes from Great Britain (England, Wales & Scotland) but also many from Northern Ireland. It\u2019s unlikely that the other Crown Dependencies & Overseas Territories represented would oppose the change, while \u201cTeam UK\u201d would end the confusion that the current name causes in the UK and overseas.\r\n\r\nWe request that the Department of Culture, Media and Sport lobby the BOA to change the UK team\u2019s name to \u201cTeam UK\u201d for the next Olympics.\r\n",

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has recognised the British team as \u2018GBR\u2019 since its inception, before the addition of Northern Ireland and the creation of the United Kingdom. Consequently, the BOA is proud that GBR is one of only five nations that has competed at every Olympic Games in the modern era.\r\n\r\nThe BOA state that a team name was created which they believe is marketable across all the territories in the BOA\u2019s jurisdiction. The BOA also took into account that some Olympic sports compete on an all Ireland basis at the Olympic Games which makes it difficult to use \u2018United Kingdom\u2019 to describe the Team."
