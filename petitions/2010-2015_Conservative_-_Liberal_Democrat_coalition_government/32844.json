        "additional_details": "We would like to see the criteria for blue badges extended to include people who are prescribed a wheelchair by their local wheelchair service. It seems insane that someone who needs a wheelchair can be denied a blue badge just because they can walk across the carpark even though they can't then get around the shop. In Scotland people already qualify if they have received a wheelchair from their local wheelchair service and I'd like to see this extended to England. ",
