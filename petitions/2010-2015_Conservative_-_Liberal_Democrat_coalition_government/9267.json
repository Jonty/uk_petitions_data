Homeless and hungry people are surely *more* likely to commit crime.\r\n\r\nThis petition is a direct response against the petition \u201cConvicted London rioters should loose all benefits.\u201d (http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/7337), which has already had over 100,000 signatures and is therefore eligible for debate in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThat petition was mentioned in Parliament by several MPs today (11th August 2011) during discussions about the riots, so some of them are taking it seriously. Let\u2019s show them that most of realise that this is a complex issue and that removing convicted rioters\u2019 benefits will not help.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s get more signatures for this petition and make that \u201cdebate\u201d in the House of Commons a short or unnecessary one, and avoid wasting everyone\u2019s time.",
