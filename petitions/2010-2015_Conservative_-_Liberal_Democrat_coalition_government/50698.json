        "additional_details": "The government should pass a law requiring that anyone who promotes hatred or preaches violence and advocates civil disobedience on the grounds of ANY religion should be prosecuted immediately, AND be subject to the threat of their British citizenship withdrawn. All rights to benefits, housing, use of the NHS or protection of any other state body be withdrawn with immediate effect. In short if you promote or support in any way violence or the threat of violence against British subjects then you lose all rights, benefits and protection of being a British subject. This will include (if born outside the UK) immediate deportation to your country of origin.",
