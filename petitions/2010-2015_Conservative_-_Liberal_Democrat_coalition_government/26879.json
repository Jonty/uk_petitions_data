        "additional_details": "The Housing Act should be amended to make a fraudulent application under a Right to buy a council home, a specific criminal offence, without a time limit. For example, where a married person with a jointly owned property of their own fraudulently claims that they are a partner of the Council tenant, purchases the property from the local authority with a joint mortgage, then 3/10 years later sells the property for a profit. This is taxpayers money being wasted, and a loss of Council housing for those in need of affordable housing.",
