        "additional_details": "For many years we have been fighting to save our villages and many times development has been denied between the two villages, the council have now decided to include the site in the local plan.  The site proposed is bigger than Elsenham is now and more than doubles the size of the village, it would create a new town, merging it with neighbouring Henham  we are desperate to save country life in this area.  In addition the local roads will not stand up to the traffic that would result.  The recent consultation showed the overwhelming local objection to the development of this site, yet the council are completely ignoring our wishes making a mockery of the democratic process.  We wish for our wishes, the council tax payers, local voters wishes to be respected rather than ignored and our precious villages and country way of life to be preserved.  http://www.saveourvillage.co.uk/",
