        "additional_details": "I would like to propose a compulsory subject called 'Good Morals' that will be a lesson (as is Maths, English, R.E. and P.E.) that will run throughout the entire lifetime of a pupil (ie 5year old to 16 year old). This lesson should have a proper graduating sylabus where a recognised qualification is available at the end (ie. GCSE). It should consist of:-\r\n-:Good Manners\r\n-:Good Social Skills\r\n-:Presentation Skills\r\n-:Learning from the Great Leaders/ Books\r\n-:How to be a superstar student\r\n-:A good place in society\r\n-:How they can contribute to the 'Big Society'\r\n-:How they can help others in their community\r\n-:Table Manners and Etiquette.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there is much more that can be added as these lessons (to be given daily in my view if at all to be effective) will span over an eleven year period and instill goodness into the children - ensuring a generation of kids who will be positive, motivated and directional.",
