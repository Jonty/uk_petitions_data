This would reduce the need to execute multiple wills according to differing national laws about the form of execution.\r\n\r\nAlthough Parliament has enacted the legislation needed to bring the UK into compliance with the Washington Convention, this legislation is yet to be brought into force. Many other signatories to the Washington Convention have implemented the necessary legislation so as to make the Convention part of their domestic law. It is time for the UK to do the same.",
