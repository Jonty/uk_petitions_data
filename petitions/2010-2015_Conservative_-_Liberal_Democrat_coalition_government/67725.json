        "additional_details": "Stop the removal of the Royal Crest on British Birth Certificates NOW! The British Monarchist Society wants the Government to keep the Royal Crest on all British Birth Certificates, which has been stamped on British Birth Certificates since records have been kept. We want the Government to stand up for British People, the British Crown and British identity. We want the Government to stop further erosion of British Identity by blocking EU moves to remove the Royal Crest from British Passports. This blatant disrespect for British identity, and sovereignty through the Crown has gone too far. We want the Government to keep the powers of the Crown and Her Majesty as the sovereign identifying factor of the British People. NO to the EU flag replacing the Royal Crest!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
