This Parliament would sit in Westminster and would be populated by MPs from the Etonian elite.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity here is to introduce regional/city region assemblies so that local people can elect other local people to be their voice on issues that affect them directly.\r\n\r\nLet's do devolution properly, let's make sure everyone in England is heard now and always!",
