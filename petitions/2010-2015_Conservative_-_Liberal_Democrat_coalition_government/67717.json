        "additional_details": "As a democracy, the British have been afforded the option to vote on a referendum only 11 times since the first in 1973.\r\n\r\nOutside of referendums, the British people are given their democratic 'choice' in general elections. If two parties have exactly the same standpoint on an issue, there is no option available to opposition, regardless of the number of people opposing it.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss government allows 2 types of popular referendum, which occur following petitions:\r\n\r\nOptional referendum - a vote on a law passed by the government.\r\nFederal Popular Initiative - vote on a modification of any law/to create a new law.\r\n\r\nThese referendums need 50,000 and 100,000 signatures on a petition respectively to force a national referendum.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned propose that these initiative are introduced in the UK, but with a proportional increase in the number of signatures (for example 750,000 and 1.5 million).\r\n\r\nThis would offer a true democratic option to the UK population.",
