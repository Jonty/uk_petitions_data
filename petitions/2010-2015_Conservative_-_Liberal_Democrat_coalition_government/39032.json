        "additional_details": "The most popular contraceptive used by 16-25 year old women is the contreceptive pill and mirena coil which both have been known to help reduce symptoms of Endometriosis.\r\nWhilst helping reduce symptoms it could also mask the problem in early stages.\r\nWe want the protocols changing so that questions are asked about possible symptoms of Endometriosis before given the contreceptive pill or mirena coil so that treatment can be started.\r\nThe current symptom to diagnosis is 7.5 years and 1 in 10 women have it. The changes in the protocol means that we may be able to reduce diagnosis times by half! ",
