        "additional_details": "My petition last year was all about how the restrictive 1997 and 1988 Firearms Acts stop law abiding people from target shooting and hunting.\r\n\r\nThis year I see that Nigel Farage of UKIP supports a relaxation of the Handgun Ban to allow law abiding people that have been vetted to allow them to posess a handgun for target shooting or hunting. I agree with this proposal and I wish to get fellow people whether pro-gun, anti-gun or on the fence to join with me to call for this sensible measure which will ensure that shooting sports men and women in Britain are not discriminated against anymore.",
