        "additional_details": "Why should newly qualified dentists be allowed to immediately work solely with \"private\" patients without any kind of physical payback to the society that subsidised their training. Doctors have to spend a compulsory time working within the NHS before they can become GP's. During this time they are giving something back to the society that subsidised their training before the can leave and earn large sums as a NHS GP or private practice. This measure would have an immediate effect on the availability of general NHS dental treatment. Existing dental practices who deal solely who private, non NHS patients should be \"encouraged \" by suitable means to enlist newly qualified dentists to their practices and therefore accessibility to NHS patients ",
