        "additional_details": "In the Czech Republic, supermarkets routinely label their fresh food (deli meats, cheeses, etc) with a small flag to indicate its country of origin. This, I believe, encourages consumers to eat locally, reducing food miles and lowering carbon emissions related to food.\r\n\r\nMany supermarkets in the UK already advertise their products of British origin, however I feel that this should be extended to include all food sold in their stores. There is a massive gap of information with regards to food production, as consumers are routinely kept in the dark about where our food comes from. There are a number of benefits to this proposal:\r\n\r\n1 - Increased consumer awareness\r\n2 - Promotion of British produce\r\n3 - Reduction of food miles\r\n4 - Increased awareness of the 'seasonality' of food production\r\n\r\nI am therefore requesting that the government enacts legislation to ensure that all food sold in the United Kingdom is clearly labelled with a country of origin.
