New discoveries show the disease can cause changes in the brain a decade or more before symptoms appear (Thomas, 4/19)\r\n\r\nThe drive to diagnose Alzheimer's before it has progressed is reflected in a bill introduced in US Congress, April 2011, to create specific cost codes for Alzheimer's diagnosis & support.",
