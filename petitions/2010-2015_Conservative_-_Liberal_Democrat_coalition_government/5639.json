        "additional_details": "I find it completely sexist that females can use a Freephone number when it comes to the use of services such as dating and things, yet males have to use a Premium Rate number to use exactly the same service. I thought that males and females were supposed to be equal in society, but how wrong I was.  I think the Equal Opportunities Commission should have power to do something about this.\r\n\r\nI am a 33 year old man with Asperger Syndrome. I have never had a sexual relationship in my life and I live in an inner-city area where I cannot get on with people, which makes me socially isolated, and telephone services like these are sometimes my own way to even attempt to communicate with someone. I find it completely annoying that I am being repeatedly penalised because of my gender. The sooner that Premium Rate telephone services are abolished in the United Kingdom, the better.        ",
