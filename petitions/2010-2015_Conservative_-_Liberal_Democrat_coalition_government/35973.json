        "additional_details": "Absent parents who avoid paying maintenance through CSA by repeatedly working for a short period of time, severing employment once contact by CSA has been made and then reclaiming JSA to begin the cycle again to avoid responsibility.\r\nThese parents should be forcefully targeted by both the JSA and the CSA without the need for the custodial parent initiating contact with the departments concerned in order for them to realize this is happening.\r\n We need a more advanced recognition system to alert government departments to developing patterns of individuals who are misusing the benefit system. Fast and appropriate action needs be taken against these parents.\r\ne.g.\r\n-back payment compulsory whilst on JSA.\r\n-JSA stopped when behaviour pattern is established\r\n-court fines\r\n-if court fines go unpaid then jail time\r\n-compulsory attachment of earnings without consent from absent parent.\r\n-develop a system that can red flag and monitor those that abuse the system.\r\n",
