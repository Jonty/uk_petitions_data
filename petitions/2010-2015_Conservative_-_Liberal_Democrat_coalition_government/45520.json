        "additional_details": "There is much debate about what should be the national anthem, and much disagreement. The only area of concurrence is that it should no longer be God Save the Queen. There are objections to:\r\n\r\n- The importance of God\r\n- The importance of the Queen\r\n- That there is no mention of the many virtues of the nation\r\n- That it is musically dull\r\n\r\nWe believe that there should be a referendum added to a future election choosing a new national anthem.\r\n\r\nA popular list of options would be:\r\n- Keep God Save the Queen\r\n- Land of Hope and Glory\r\n- Jerusalem\r\n- I Vow To Thee My Country\r\n- Rule Brittania\r\n\r\nAnother point would be to have separate anthems for England and Britain, as they are different nations and so should be represented by different anthems.",
