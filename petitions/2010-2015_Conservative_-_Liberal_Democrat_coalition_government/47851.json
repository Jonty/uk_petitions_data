When a patient is well and happy shows a task has been completed.\r\n\r\nTargets are important however being financially penalized in turn allows for less staff which only makes targets more unrealistic and effects patient care.\r\nSurely a patients health dictates performance.\r\n\r\nFor the NHS to not be run like a business and more like a non-profit organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
