However, it is not in the public interest to do this at present, especially in times of austerity when his attention could be paid to issues affecting the whole country, not just a small percentage of the people of Glasgow. If we, as normal citizens owed tax we would be forced to pay it on our businesses, football clubs shoudl not be immune from this.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this if you agree.",
