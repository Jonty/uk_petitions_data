        "additional_details": "Due to government cuts, the Play service in Newcastle will cease to exist from 31st March 2013. We strongly oppose this as the service promotes values and self confidence with the children. The staff give the children a voice but by removing this service it will greatly affect what the children understand and know about rights they have.\r\nIt also provides a safe enviroment in which they can test and extend personal boundries. As well as socialise with other children from all background, promoting equality. More money is needed to work with vulnerable children and families yet by closing these provisions, more children will become vulnerable as they are left to roam the streets, with no one to listen to their worries.",
