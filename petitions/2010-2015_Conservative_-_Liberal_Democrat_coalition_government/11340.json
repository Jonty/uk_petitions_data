National Service will rehabilitate offenders with team work and disiplin being instilled. Surley this is a better plan than the current system of young offenders going to prison and mixing with other disgusting individuals whilst they play PlayStaing and go to the gym.... wonder why that does not work? They are not worried about the concequences! ",
