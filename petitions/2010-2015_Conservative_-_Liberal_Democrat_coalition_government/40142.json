        "additional_details": "I prepose that homework at high school and primary school is replaced by extra school hours. This would mean that work would be done to a better standard and done with less destractions. School could start slightly earlier and end later to accommodate this. Haveing extra school hours means that students can have the extra help they need to complete the work, which means that they would more likely to learn more rather than just struggling at home. Having no homework would also reduce the stress of school, meaning the stress of school stops once you get home. Being less stressed means that students can relax at home meaning they are in a better mood and are more likely learn at school the next day. ",
