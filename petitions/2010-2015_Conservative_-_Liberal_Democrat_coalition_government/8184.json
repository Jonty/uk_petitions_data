        "additional_details": "Deploy the Army to take control of the riots that are happening throughout several cities in England. As a result of a peaceful protest after the death of a man shot by police in Tottenham, riots have broken out throughout various areas in London and have continued to break out in other cities around England. The violence has continued to spread with the looting of businesses, the damage to property and the violence aimed towards innocent people. The livelihoods of innocent people are being ruined and lives are in danger. Police have been sent to control this disruption, however, they are in need of support from our Armed Forces. WE ARE IN URGENT NEED OF HELP. Please sign this petition if you agree.",
