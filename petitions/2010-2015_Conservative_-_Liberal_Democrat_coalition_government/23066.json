        "additional_details": "This petition requests that the Ministry Of Defence honour its commitments to the Nuclear Test Veterans many of whom have suffered serious ill health and who have been denied a active life because of the radiation that they were exposed to during the Nuclear Bomb Tests of the 1950s. There are fewer Test Veterans as the years progress and its time that the UK Government fulfilled its commitment and end this travesty of justice.",
