        "additional_details": "In 1993, the publicly-owned British Broadcasting corporation made a brave decision. Visionary composer Simon May and a band of maverick jazz virtuosi were commissioned to refresh the stale, cold original theme tune, and the resulting arrangement was epoch defining. Sadly it also proved ahead of its time. May's magnus opus was too advanced, too life-changing for our primitive ears. It swiftly disappeared from our television screens after a public backlash.\r\n\r\nI move that the jazzy theme be restored, and Simon May be considered for knighthood for services to jazz.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSimon May's 1993 theme can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkyNZXUp_c4&feature=youtu.be&t=2m15s",
