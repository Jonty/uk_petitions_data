        "additional_details": "My son, Robert was a real whizz at science before he recieved his results, now he is a nervous wreck.The science paper he took which was set by AQA was too tough and should have had lower grade boundaries to reflect the toughness.\r\n\r\nMany pupils at the school he goes to got much lower results than they were predicted because of how hard the paper was. It is not fair on them that they are getting lower grades than they should just because the exam boards want as few people as possible to get top grades to make it look like they are tackling grade inflation.\r\n\r\nI am asking that AQA collects all Physics, Chemistry and Biology papers sat by students and regrades them to reflect how tough they were.",
