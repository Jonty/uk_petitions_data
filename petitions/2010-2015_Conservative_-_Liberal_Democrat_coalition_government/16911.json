Surely, when ur judging a horse you should be looking at the conformation of the horse and the overall physique of muscle tone in the correct places, not just if they have four white socks and have been fed up to the eye balls with conditioning mix and stabled for weeks in preperation with barely any or no exercise. I think that it is disgusting and irresponsible of the cob society. It encourages obesity and laminitis in these horses - and we are not seeing true Welsh Cobs.\r\nI want the goverment to review the way these horses are treated and the judging rules to change within the show ring. It is cruel and time for a change of mentality within the Welsh Cob Society.",
