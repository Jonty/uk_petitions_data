        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, firmly believe:\r\n1. That the cuts to police numbers are draconian, ruthless and utterly wrong.\r\n2. That police numbers should be increased, to deal with situations such as the recent riots.\r\n3. That more support should be given to the police by government.\r\n4. That a commision should be set up to investigate the funding that should be given to police numbers and how any cuts will affect vital community work undertaken by the police.\r\n5. That the government should be more supportive of police powers and also empowering police to use those powers in extreme situations without fear of abandonment from the Home Office and Senior Police Officials.",
