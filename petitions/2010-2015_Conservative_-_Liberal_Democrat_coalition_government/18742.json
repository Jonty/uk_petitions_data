        "additional_details": "The British Public have no faith in the present Coalition's Economic Policies and require a debate to replace the present Chancellor of the Exchequer with Mr Jon Redwood.  Mr Redwood's website, visited regularly by hundreds of educated, experienced voters, is a \"Breath of Fresh Air\" after so much Economic Spin from the Government.  Mr Redwood puts his money where his mouth is.  He has been right about forecasting a huge Financial Crisis across Europe, particularly Greece and deserves our votes.  He is the right man, experienced,  to run our Economy and see us through this crisis,",
