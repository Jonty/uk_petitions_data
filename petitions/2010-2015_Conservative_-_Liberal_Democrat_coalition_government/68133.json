Intellectuals in this country are being reprimanded for their honest views about the real truth that is being hidden from the general public. All the media which are promoting these foul, unsavoury and distasteful images with phoney headlines should be reprimanded accordingly! It almost makes the media as bad as the terrorists themselves!! This has to stop! It's not about picking sides it's about being able to hear the truth!!!",
