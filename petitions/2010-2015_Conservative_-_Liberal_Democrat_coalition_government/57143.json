        "additional_details": "After two and a half hours congested on the M25 and M1 my car was wrecked in the commuter dispersal melee north of Luton by a sleepy tandem  German juggernaut. These monsters choke  the air and roads and bottlenecks squander millions of fuel and man hours. H.G.V.s should be induced to transship using rail capacity vacated by passanger traffic transferred to the national monorail system. Elevated pulsed traction makes these safe, light and thrifty, using a motorway lane they split to displace town trams. Finance from pension bonds and haulage funds genuine infrastructure, steel, engineering jobs, new industry and a national asset  not a profligate gravy train.",
