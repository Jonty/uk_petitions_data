        "additional_details": "The rights of individuals choice to provide food and beverage that suits their personal nutritional and allergy requirements are being infringed by adopting search and control techniques at the point of entry at all public events. The imposing of overpriced and poor quality food and beverage services at public events is excessive exploitation of customers who have already paid for the provision of that service. A comparison by forcing customers to pay for premium service telephone services for contact with other service providers such as insurance, banking and others provides a precedent to follow. Government should stop this practice during the planning process and licensing of the event activities despite ownership of any sporting premises and organisation bodies   ",
