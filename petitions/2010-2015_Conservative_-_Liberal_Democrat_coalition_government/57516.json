        "additional_details": "Care Agencies are regulated by CQC and a high level of training, management and audit is necessary and costly. Carers provide an essential service, allowing many elderly, vulnerable and disabled people to remain independant at home, thus saving the government millions of pounds in residential and hospital costs. Local authorities are slashing the hourly rates at which they award contracts for care. Caring is a professional career, and it should be recognised. Agencies can only afford to pay low rates of pay because of the rates they are paid. Some local authorities even stipulate the living wage for carers whilst at the same time stipulating the rate they will pay, We want the government to demand a reasonable rate is paid to care agencies if they meet the minimum standards. This will allow a living wage to be paid to carers and for agencies to continue to meet the high standards expected of them and give respect to the carers providing this essential service.",
