        "additional_details": "In less than 24 hours, 100000 signatures were collected calling for Iain Duncan Smith to follow through with his claim that he could live on \u00a353 per week if he had to.\r\n\r\nWe therefore repeat this request through official channels: that Iain Duncan Smith live on \u00a353 per week for a year, to give a senior member of Government experience of what is deemed an acceptable standard of living. In addition, he should start with an empty property and no credit rating to create a more realistic experience.",
