No credible, incontrovertible evidence exists to prove that homosexuality is inborn, and is unchangeable in all cases. Married men, who wish to stay in their married relationships with a woman, should not be denied the opportunity to reduce homosexual feelings, if that is their desire. Professionals should not be penalised for assisting them, when this is the genuine desire of their client and a reasonable personal goal.  ",
