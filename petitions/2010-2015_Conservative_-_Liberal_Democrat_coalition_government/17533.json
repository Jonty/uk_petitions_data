        "additional_details": "If an MP receives a prison sentence longer than a certain period, they are disqualified from being an MP.  If a peer receives a similar sentence, there is no provision to remove their peerage and they are free to return to the Lords and influence legislation.  I note from the Naseem Hamed case that people who receive lower awards such as OBEs and MBEs can be stripped of it if they commit an offence; it is therefore equitable that this should also apply to peers with relevant criminal records and the Government is asked to pass legislation to enable this.",
