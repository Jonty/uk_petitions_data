While changes are no doubt needed to improve efficiency and reduce wastage of resources, I fail to see how this major reorganisation aiming to encourage competition with the private sector has quality of services and equality at its core.\r\nThe Government should abandon the current Bill\r\nand instead listen to those professionals dedicated to delivering health care to the UK population for guidance on how to proceed with reform.\r\n ",
