        "additional_details": "We wish the government to re-nationalise some or all of the energy companies who now no longer provide competition and behave like a cartel. Energy companies have given every excuse in the book such as climate change, linked to oil prices, forward bulk purchase, china, EU competition law, infact just about any excuse is enough to raise the price especially in winter to rip off vulnerable customers and have raised prices to such an unafordable level it is leaving millions in fuel poverty. If the government wants the people to spend money and re-invigorate the economy, then forget tax cuts, re-nationalise the gas and electric suppliers and reduce the price of living and give people more money to lift the economy out of recession",
