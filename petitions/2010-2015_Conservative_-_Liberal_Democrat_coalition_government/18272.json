However the faces and identities of jurors and the audience in court should not be televised on TV. The faces of witnesses, including the defendant, also need not be shown on TV if they objected to it. However in order to avoid the possibility of being influenced by public opinions of TV watchers, in some cases the jurors may not be able to return home in televised cases till the conclusion of the case.",
