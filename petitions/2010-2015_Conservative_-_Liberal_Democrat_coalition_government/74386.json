Make all those seeking treatment who are not British citizens, or have not been contributors to the exchequer for say 2 years, pay in advance for any treatment they receive.\r\n\r\n2. Make an additional 1% surcharge on NI contributions\r\n\r\n3. Make all those in care pay an amount equal to the basic state pension from their own resources.\r\n\r\n4. Re-instate prescription charges to all residents of the UK under retirement age, apart from those with life-threatening or terminal illness, and parking charges, refundable to those undergoing treatment.\r\n\r\n",
