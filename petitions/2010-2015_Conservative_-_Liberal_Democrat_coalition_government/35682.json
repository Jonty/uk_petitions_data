        "action": "Exclude SME's from ATVOD regulations",
        "additional_details": "I want the government to look at the remit of ATVOD. ATVOD is killing small businesses with their draconian rules. They are applying the same rules to tiny sole traders with less than \u00a330,000 turnover as they do to huge global media corporations. They are not even applying the AVMS European dictat in a fair an equal manner. This petition is to exclude all businesses with turnover less than the VAT registration threshold from ANY ATVOD regulation.",
