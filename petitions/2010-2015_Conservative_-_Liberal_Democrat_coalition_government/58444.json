DLA is not giving children entitlement with this considering the impact it has on their mobility and development as well as needing 24 hour care from parents, which stops them from returning to work for a considerable period of time.\r\nThere is not enough knowledge within the NHS regarding hip dysplasia and believe a campaign and extra training for staff should be encouraged due to prolonged misdiagnosis of this condition.",
