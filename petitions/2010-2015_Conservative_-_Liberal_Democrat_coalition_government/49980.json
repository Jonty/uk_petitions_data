        "additional_details": "Having become increasingly concerned that many of our arrogant self-serving politicians have never had a proper job outside politics including, leading MP\u2019s like Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg.  Statistics show one in seven MP\u2019s have never worked outside politics.\r\nThey have little understanding of what the mass of people have to put up with, thanks to their policies when in Government. We also note working class MP\u2019s are an endangered species in the UK, whilst wealthy ex public school boys are truly born to rule over us and make a Eton mess of our once great country.\r\nTherefore we the undersigned demand that no one can stand for MP without having had a job outside politics for at least ten years and to encourage political parties to adopt working class people to stand as MP\u2019s, to improve for the better the UK Governments knowledge understanding and empathy for the people and the Country they attempt to Govern.\r\n",
