        "action": "Allow electricians to lawfully remove distributors fuses.",
        "additional_details": "Currently there is no requirement for an electricity distributor to provide means of isolating the incoming electrical supply to a property.\r\n\r\nIn most areas, the only way to legally isolate the electricity supply to a property is to book a visit by a technician from the electricity distributor, who then has to return to reconnect.  This is inconvenient and costly.\r\n\r\nSome electricity distributors permit the connection/disconnection to be carried out by a registered electrician (member of NICEIC, ELECSA or equivalent) by way of cutting the distributors seals and removing the main cut-out fuse.  However this is not the norm.\r\n\r\nThe signatories of this petition demand that:\r\n\r\n- Registered electricians be lawfully allowed to remove  and refit the distributors fuse when necessary for maintenance/safety\r\n\r\n- Isolation switches be fitted, free of charge and in good time upon request, or upon replacement of the distributors components (eg: installing a smart meter)",
