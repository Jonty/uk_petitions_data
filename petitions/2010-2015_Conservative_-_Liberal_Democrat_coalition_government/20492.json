This currently leads many families into hardship contributes towards there debt. We need another system that works, and is more transparent to the public, where our records can be viewed on a daily basis either online or another data base system. The current system is costly on a 0845 number, where there can be several people dealing with one case. proven by statistics that this causes mix ups with paperwork and decision making outcomes. we would like the HMRC reviewed for a better system.\r\nWe would like our goverment to review the HMRC tax credits system according to the above points.
