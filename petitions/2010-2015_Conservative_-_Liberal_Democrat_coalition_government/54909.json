        "additional_details": "The government has announced that from around 2015 everyone requesting plastic carrier bags from Supermarkets and large stores will have to pay a five pence charge.\r\n\r\nThe charge is to encourage less use of plastic bags, some when disposed of take up to 1,000 years to decompose.\r\n\r\nHowever, the new charge will not be a tax and nor will supermarkets and other companies be forced to use these additional revenues to improve the environment. The money will be used simply to increase supermarket profits.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we ask the government when introducing this new legislation that they compel all supermarkets and large stores to use the revenues collected from the use of plastic carrier bags for philanthropy, in particularly, local and environmental good causes, as an acknowledgement from supermarkets that their business does have an adverse effect on our planet.",
