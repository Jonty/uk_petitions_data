It appears none of them nor the political parties are interested in the fact that the UK is being condemned by Amnesty International for breaches of human rights, it is time for this nation to voice  concern and make the elected members think and reflect of the direction this nation is going down to respect the concern of Amnesty and adapt key measures to prevent such incidents on UK soil.",
