My experience of this disease last year at the age of 53 (after being immunised as a child) was a struggle to get diagnosed, and only after insistence for a second opinion and a blood test was it finally confirmed.\r\n\r\nThis is still a \"Notifiable Disease\" which requires quarantine to safeguard the vulnerable in our communities (babies, elderly & those suffering respiratory problems), and I do not feel sufficient notice or attention is paid to those with lingering coughs.\r\n\r\nPlease, sign this petition, and make our Health Care Professionals sit up and take notice - thank you!",
