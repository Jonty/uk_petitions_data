        "additional_details": "The Reasoning:\r\nIn light of further devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament during its referendum campaign, we wish to petition HM Government and Parliament itself to introduce a federal structure of power in line to those present in the Welsh Assembly and/or the Scottish Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Want:\r\nThese will take the form of an equal structure and power structure to the already devolved legislatures. We do not believe in a single English Parliament that may dilute sovereignty from that of the UK-wide Parliament at Westminster. This could see some form of regional federal powers that take into account economical and political realities (e.g. the North or Northern cities/the South-West).\r\n\r\nThe Ask:\r\nGovernment to introduce and conduct consultation on the matter of a UK federal structure including that of regional English devolution simultaneous to further powers being given to the Scottish Parliament.",
