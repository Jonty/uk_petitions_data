        "additional_details": "Benefits conferred to other states should always have a get-out cause and review date to ensure that any rights conferred to others are not for perpetuity. It is No Brainer that rights conferred to another state (like EU), if not renewed/negotiated from time to time by a sovereign state may be taken for granted to be permanent by stealthy \u2018prescription\u2019 (a Land Law concept). All EU agreements should not be assumed permanent & renewed/renegotiated every (say) decade. Grants of rights under EU treaties give the impression that they are for perpetuity. Under Land Law, the right of private way (easements) over another's land may arise from prescription by twenty years of use of a land by implied easement. What rights is given away by a sovereign state may be returned back to the state, unless it is by military conquest as in 1066 by William the Conquer.",
