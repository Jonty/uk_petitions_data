        "additional_details": "Currently there is NO independent inspection of decisions about people made by Adult Social Care departments. We ask the government to charge Ofsted with inspecting all Social Care decisions made by Local Authorities.\r\n\r\nTHE NEED FOR INSPECTION:  LA staff both assess need and make funding, care and placement decisions without ANY independent inspection regime.   This is a conflict of interest  \u2013  pressure is on social workers,  their managers and Directors of Services to meet budgetary targets.\r\n\r\nPeople with disabilities and their families and carers are:\r\nat risk of abuse - not getting the support they need - existing rather than living - or worse.\r\n\r\nLA Directors are free to put their budgets first and people second\r\n\r\nINSPECTING would improve the situation massively.   In monetary terms it would cost a little and save a lot.  In human terms it would save suffering, support the most vulnerable in our society and change many lives for the better.",
