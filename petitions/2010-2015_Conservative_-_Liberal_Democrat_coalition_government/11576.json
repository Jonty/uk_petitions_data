Money granted to \u201cgood causes\u201d is therefore (taxed) public money.\r\nWe the people have the right to suggest they what the lottery system does or does not grant funds to.\r\nLotto grants do support human charities, but they also fund the UK Film Council and in a more bizarre act they recently funded a study on the \u201cHistory of Strawberry Growing\u201d to the sum of \u00a315K.\r\n\r\nAs a Nation of pet owners and those who directly fund the money which goes into Camelot; WE call upon the Government to change lottery legislation to encompass the granting of funds to; Animal Charities including those charities providing free veterinary care for people who cannot afford it. It is in the Public Interest that the lottery funds causes in which the public have an interest in, such as NWESSR, Blue Cross, RSPCA, WSPA etc.\r\nPaul Duncan, Chairman NWESSR\r\n",
