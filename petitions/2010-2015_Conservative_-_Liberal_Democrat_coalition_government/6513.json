        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call upon HM Government to end the entrenched privledge in the British education system by closing all private and public schools. In order to promote fairness, equality and the end of the class system all children should be educated at state comprehensive schools with no fee paying education options being available. The private schools like Eton, Harrow etc are a disgracefull way of passing privledge from parent to child and reinforcing the class system. All public schools should be closed and the buildings should be demolished and the land redevoloped as social housing and community facilities to erase all trace of these vile bastions of privledge.
