Britain lost her most valuable overseas' territories (which we helped found) in the 13 colonies & has subsequently lost significant trade & the wealth that it brings in the last 230 years. What we must propose is the following:\r\n\r\nAmerica cede her claim to the 13 colonies taken from Britain in revolution, with Britain reclaiming the territories. Additionally, the government of the 'United States' (through their treachery) of America should make reparation payments of \u00a32tn to compensate Britain for her loss of trade and opportunity within ten years of decision, accounting for inflation.\r\n\r\nIf declined, the matter shall either be dealt with via the UN or by the considerable means the British government has at her disposal.",
