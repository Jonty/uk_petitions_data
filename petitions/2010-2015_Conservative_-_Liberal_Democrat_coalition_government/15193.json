        "additional_details": "God Save the Queen, however lovely the song is should not be our national anthem. This is because it does not reflect the British people. It only reflects the current Monarch. Now this us wrong because there are other people in Britain besides the Monarch. I therefore propose that the National Anthem should be 'Rule Britania' or 'Land of Hope and Glory'. These songs reflect our country and it's people as opposed to one person (The monarch). It symbolises freedom and resistance of oppression. This I believe sends out a message to other nations showing how great Britain is.",
