The TV licence is an draconian piece of legislation that needs to be brought into line with modern day consumerism. How do the rest of the broadcasting houses survive? Let the BBC have a go at advertising, subsciptions, premium channels etc. The quality of its programming does not warrant the fee it 'expects'.",
