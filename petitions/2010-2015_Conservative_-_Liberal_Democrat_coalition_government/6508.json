        "additional_details": "We need to reduce numbers of members of the House of Lords, local government councillors, MEP's, members of Devolved Assembly of Scotland, Wales and Ireland, as well as numbers of MPs in Westminster. It is good that each MP will have roughly the same number of constituents under the current proposed reforms in voting. The numbers of Peers, MEPs, members of the devotional governments of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales Assembly also should be reduced (to perhaps at around 200,000 constituents per elected representative). MPs must be verified do an identified job in parliament, as well as putting acceptable number of attendances for identified committee meetings, debates in parliament and parliamentary related work. Perhaps MPs must be working full-time and not doing another job, apart from some occasional paid work that supports their work as MPs.",
