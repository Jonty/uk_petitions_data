It has been proved that most of these soldiers were suffering from post traumatic stress disorder which at the time had no treatment, and don't forget most of these so called deserters were shot at dawn, orders given my General's who had never even seen the front line or suffered the trauma of fighting on the front line. And the most important thing to remember they volunteered and died for THIER country and for US. Please sign this petition and ask all your friends to do the same, it's your ancestors right's your fighting for now. ",
