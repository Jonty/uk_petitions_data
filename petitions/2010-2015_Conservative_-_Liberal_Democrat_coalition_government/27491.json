        "additional_details": "I was recently horrified to find out that nowhere on a childs passport (either in print OR on the chip) are there any details of the childs family/legal guardians.There is NO reason for not including either the parent/gaurdian names/photographs/passport number/contact number on the childs passport. In essence ANYONE with your child's passport could take your child and  be free to leave the country! A \"visa\" type system could be implemented should the parent/guardian wish for their child to travel without them, OR the OPTION to have your child on your passport should be reinstated.\r\nWith so many high profile child abductions, split famililies across the globe, and the ever prominant child traficking issue, it seems madness to me that such a huge gap exists in our border security.\r\nLets protect our children by at least including the information that the IPS asks for anyway, eg (birth cert/adoption details/guradians' passport details) on the chip or in print!\r\n",
