        "additional_details": "When the best off in our society are (it has been claimed) more than 330 times better off than the worst off among us, the events of the last week are, I would say, not just likely but inevitable. Base that on the minimum wage being about \u00a36p/h.That means that the lucky ones are getting almost \u00a32000p/h!!! The prime minister says that society is sick. He is right and my diagnosis is, that, that sickness is greed. It is not the poor who are sick however, but the rich. People are unfortunately naturally greedy and you cant stop that, but you can legislate against it. That is the governments job. I propose that the the minimum wage be replaced by a living wage and by that I mean \u00a310p/hour (net of tax.) Too expensive some would say, but if the rich were only allowed to earn a maximum of \u00a3200p/h (still 20x the minimum = \u00a38,000 a week! or \u00a3416,000!) this could surely be paid for, and I personally would claim that anyone who wants more than that are not only greedy but chronically sick.
