We are wanting you to revoke the new EU style certificate and keep our certificates unchanged and to make this absolute so as it can not be changed or phased in slowly as suggested by Eric Pickles, or become compulsory by the EU.\r\n'We want you to say no to the EU certificates in all shape and form and keep our Births, Deaths and Marriage certificates unchanged'",
