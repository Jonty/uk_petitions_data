        "additional_details": "Regardless of any arguments to the contrary, basic morality dictates than an individual's ability to love whomever they choose without suffering at the hands of persecution and prejudice is a right, not a privilege. Within the last 12 months, David Cameron has taken important steps to ensuring the equality of LGBT individuals here in the UK. This petition asks him and his  government to demonstrate further commitment to this cause by putting pressure on President Putin in Russia, demanding social and legal reform for the LGBT community in Russia who can not openly express their sexuality without fear of significant violence and persecution from both the public and the authorities. We call upon Cameron and his government to act diplomatically on behalf of Russia's LGBT community for they cannot gain concessions without international pressure ",
