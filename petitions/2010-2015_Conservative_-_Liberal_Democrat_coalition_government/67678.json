There have been at least 5 known stabbings in the last couple of weeks alone! This has got to stop!\r\n\r\nKnives are not cool. If you're carrying a knife and are caught, this should be an instant jail term, no questions asked. If caught using a knife, this should be a minimum of ten years. Something has to be done to prevent any more crimes in this area! ",
