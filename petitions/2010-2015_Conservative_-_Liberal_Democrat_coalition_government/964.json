Question is who is at risk - EVERYONE as equipment is in offices, public places(libraries, shops), education establishments and applies worldwide. Safety data sheets also clearly state to wear PPE. Check with Ford, GM, Toyota who will give example of a safety data sheet such as HP 51644M. This knowledge should be shared worldwide.",
