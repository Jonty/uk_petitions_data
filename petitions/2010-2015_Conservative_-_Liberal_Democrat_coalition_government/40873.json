        "additional_details": "The Russian Government wish to award the Ushakov medal for bravery to British seamen who served on Arctic convoys during WW2 between 1941 and 1945. Medals have already been awarded to seamen from Australia, Canada and the United States without issue but the UK Government has repeatedly refused to allow this honour to its citizens because of mean-spirited rules that makes no sense to any fair minded person.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned petition H.M. Government to waive the rules and reverse this heartless and insulting decision so that the Russian Government can award the Ushakov medal to these brave men who are decreasing in number as the years go by.\r\n\r\nI am raising this petition on behalf of many members of the Merchant Navy Association.\r\n\r\n(Note to Moderators: It is noted that a similar partition was started but it refers to 'artic convoys' rather than 'arctic convoys' so is difficult to locate; it is also not specific about what action is required).",
