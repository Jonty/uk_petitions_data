        "additional_details": "Coventry City Council have had signs placed in the War Memorial Park stating that in the \"Formal Zone\" and \"Recreation Zone\" dogs must be kept on leads. This is understandable near the children's play area and Cafe but is not necessary away from these areas. Most dogs owners use the park every day of the year whilst: keeping their dogs under control and out the way, picking up their poo and picking up rubbish in the park. The Council should remove these signs and ensure the park remains a dog friendly zone.",
