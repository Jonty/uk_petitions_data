        "additional_details": "We believe credit brokers intentionally misleading people into believing they are payday lending companies online. In some instances a person will be filling in a loan application when they are re-directed to a page asking them to confirm their details for the loan.\r\nWhat they do not realise is that they have actually been re-directed to a broker. The brokers' page they are re-directed to is intentionally misleading them into thinking they are going to receive a loan. Once the money is taken there is often no confirmation or notification.\r\n\r\nA simple Internet search about this will show forums and discussions where many many people have lost money as a result.\r\n\r\nThere should be regulation in place to ensure these brokers clearly indicate they are in fact brokers and not pay-day loan companies. The brokers should obtain further permission from the individual (via phone or in writing) before taking money from their account.\r\n",
