Its not thier fault. They didnt live through what we did so they dont know. But they should be told- so that they know and never forget\"\r\n\r\nIf not for the bravery of this person and the thousands that never returned, then we would not be enjoying the freedom that we take for granted this day.\r\nIn time to come generations will ask, what was D-Day,\r\nWhat a way to show future generations what this day meant to so many by making it a Bank Holiday\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
