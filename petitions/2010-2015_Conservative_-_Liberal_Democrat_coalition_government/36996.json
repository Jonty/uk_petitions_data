        "additional_details": "As a student, I know how much Cannabis is used in the 15-25 age group. Personally, I believe that the laws regarding personal use are far too strict. I agree that mass production, possession with obvious intent to supply is socially and morally wrong, but I disagree that that law should be passed onto small time growers and users. I think that growing a few plants for personal use is not a problem, and should not be labelled as a crime.\r\nYes, marijuana has psychological and physical effects on the person, but those effects are not any more serious than the effects of cigarettes and alcohol. If anything, there are positive effects on top of the negative ones (hence the legalisation of medical marijuana in parts of the US).\r\n\r\nI think it is time for the UK to get with modern times. If Alcohol and Cigarettes were invented today, they would be criminalised as class A due to the number of deaths per year.",
