Four youths have been arrested on suspicion of arson.\r\n\r\nThe local and wider community is devastated as 1000s of people loved and used this centre as it is the home for school children, families and budding tennis stars.\r\n\r\nWe want the facility to be rebuilt without delay to restore public indoor tennis provision in the district and for the LTA, government and local council to put an action plan to this effect with clear timescales and immediate action.\r\n\r\n ",
