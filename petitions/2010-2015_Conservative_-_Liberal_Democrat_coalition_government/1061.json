        "additional_details": "Please support the work of International Cruise Victims with our endeavours to introduce new UK and EU laws to protect passengers and crew on cruise vessels. This important legislation will follow on from the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act 2009 recently passed into law by President Obama. This important legislation will ensure the security and safety of passengers and crew on cruise ships but it is now time for us to progress this further, by offering the same level of protection for those boarding cruise ships outside U.S. waters.\r\n\r\nCurrently no protection is afforded to those boarding cruise vessels in the United Kingdom or Europe and this needs to change. The Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act 2010 [EU] sets out numerous requirements to ioverall safety overall, including the implementation of technology to detect when someone falls overboard.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to better regulate cruise operators to adopt a more proactive stance in protecting all on board.",
