        "additional_details": "The isles wind farm development in County Durham calls for turbines exceeding 250 metres high. Eon, the developer has deliberatley  knowingly and fraudulently sought to influence public opinion by excluding large areas of the local population from a questionnaire in which local people would have a say in this development. Wind farms are innefficient, Eon a German company is hoping to obtain over \u00a3200 million in grants from our government. Therefore, we would have a German company manufacturing turbines in Germany with no UK benefit for the UK. We want the Government to debate grants to foreign companies and stop the misuse of public funds building these innefficient expensive wind farms.",
