        "additional_details": "Prevention is better than cure. NHS ministerial guidelines & funding should allow patients (especially over 50s) to have preventative scans, like preventative brain scanning for the presence of life threatening conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s disease, brain tumour, aneurysm; as well as utilising CT (Computed Tomography) & ultrasound abdominal scans for conditions like cancer, organ atrophy & damage/malfunction. Utilising effective neuroimaging techniques; like using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are scans that can effectively study the structure, function and activities of brains. MRI uses magnetic field interacting with radio waves to form computer images and do not expose the body to ionising radiation (unlike CT scans which uses a series of x-rays to build up computer images) and have better resolution for soft tissues (like brains).",
