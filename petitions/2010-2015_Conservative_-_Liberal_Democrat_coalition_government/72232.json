        "additional_details": "A cable car system was installed up Highgate Hill, North London, in 1884. It was the first such in Europe, its cable 1.5 miles long and powered by two steam engines housed on the east side of Highgate High Street. This petition asks that a modern day counterpart be installed. It would be ecologically benign and bring great economic benefits to the Archway area",
