        "additional_details": "\r\n\r\nI passed my driving test in 1999, so didn't automatically have the C or C1 categories like those who passed their practical tests a few years earlier. However, in 2002 I passed my PCV (bus) driving tests (practical and theory), and then proceeded to drive buses for two years.\r\n\r\nHere's the problem -  I am allowed to drive a 13 ton double decker bus with over a hundred people on board (adding a further 6 or 7 tonnes), but I'm not allowed to drive a van that weighs more than 3 and a half tonnes and carries nothing but furniture. This is inconvenient to say the least because it means that I have to either take an unnecessary test, get someone else to drive (which is a pain because I love driving)\r\n\r\nThis problem is caused by conflicting regulations or guidance.\r\n\r\nProposed solution:\r\nEither people like myself who pass a PCV test automatically get the C and C1 categories put on their license, or we can apply for special dispensation to drive ",
