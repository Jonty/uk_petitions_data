Bullying in all its forms is completely unacceptable and particularly deplorable when aimed at a someone with a serious illness! Our system of support is shameful, as it \"talks the talk\" but remains inadequate in protecting victims of bullying - in school and at work! We petition the government to create new legislation making bullying a criminal offence, giving our legal system the authority to sentence/fine people found guilty of bullying and used as a warning that bullying will not be tolerated.",
