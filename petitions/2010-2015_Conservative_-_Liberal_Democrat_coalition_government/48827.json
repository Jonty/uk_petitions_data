For too long Governments forget this treat us as second rate citizens only worth stealing from to line the pockets of the rich (usually friends and donors to their cause.)\r\n.\r\nDemocracy requires everyone to be accountable. The people are SUFFERING. We cannot leave this Dictatorship in power until the next General Election. Stand together and rid ourselves of this Government - STOP THE SUFFERING OF THE PEOPLE. Our Country is on it's knees,MP's are not feeling the pain,we will soon be a THIRD WORLD COUNTRY BEGGING FOR HELP TO FEED US. Cameron makes sweeping cuts to save money,then spends these savings on ATOS just one,look at the railway (virgin contract) that's costing the taxpayer millions. Get This Lot Out NOW!\r\n\r\n",
