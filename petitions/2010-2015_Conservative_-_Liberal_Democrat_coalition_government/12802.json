        "additional_details": "Housing benefit is the most abused benefit.Find a way to incorporate/unite housing benefit with other benefit payments so that recepient receives one 'fixed' payment from which they must pay for their own housing costs etc..thus forcing the benefit recipient to budget their own finances and locate and pay for their own housing needs from their own pocket.This ought to stop the attitude of 'entitlement' that infests housing benefit recipients and eliminate abuses as benefit receipient will gravitate to housing/accommodation they can afford rather than expect to be housed at council cost in large expensive properties.i.e only by making benefit recipients accountable to the funds at their disposal will benefit claimants return to the 'real' world of financial reality and cease from viewing what they receive from government as being without financial cost.",
