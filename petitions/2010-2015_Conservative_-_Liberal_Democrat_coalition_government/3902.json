The public should decide on whether the death penalty should be restored and this should be done by way of a legally binding referendum, so that the conscience of MPs can be relieved.  With the advent of DNA in conjuction with other evidence, it is now possible to be 100% certain of the guilt and the death penalty would ensure that killers are no longer released back into the community to kill again.\r\n\r\nPlease ignore those that try emotional blackmail with comparisons to middle east and far east countries.  This is the United Kingdom and we should be voting for ourselves, not for what another country does or does not do.",
