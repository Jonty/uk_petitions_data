        "action": "Revoke The Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999",
        "additional_details": "In 1999 The Labour Government invoked an order dictating that over 6000 square miles of sea and seabed of the cost of Scotland formally be designated UK waters. This removed the rights of the Scottish government to fight EU legislation on fishery quotas and the activity of \"discarding\" fish, wasting precious resources and threatening the fishing industry. It also put under threat any future claim an independent Scotland may have over oil revenues. This petition asks that the government opens a debate into the revokation of the The Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999 initiating a full and transparent investigation into the actions that led to its passing in the first instance.",
