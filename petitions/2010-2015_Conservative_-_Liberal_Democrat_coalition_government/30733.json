        "additional_details": "I need human rights truly afforded to me and my right to a tribunal hearing without the courts standing on the side of the firm to have a preliminary hearing. My court date awarded is now cancelled that was set in april and a preliminary hearing in may. I've already suffered since june now over this firm not paying me. HELP PLEASE.This is not right. The matters should be brought immediately to court not to keep things under wrap. This firm did not even give me an employment contract. Many of human rights should be breached on grounds of that alone the firm should not have the right to call a preliminary hearing. I have been used and abused. I wish for compensation. please also see my petition\r\nhttp://www.ipetitions.com/petition/unfairtreatment/",
