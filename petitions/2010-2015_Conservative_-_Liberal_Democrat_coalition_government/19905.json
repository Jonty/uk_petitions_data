        "additional_details": "To enable a boost to the economy and the well-being of the British people I propose to change the standard working week. It is well documented that many organisations are, due to the economic downturn, having to reduce attendance of staff for the working week. My proposal would put this on an official footing and create a number of new business opportunities. The current five day working week should be altered to a four day working week by moving Tuesday to between Saturday and Sunday, which would make it part of the an extended weekend. (Sun, Mon, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat, Tues) This would create a number of business opportunities to boost the economy, namely the changes required to calendars, computer software, leisure industry spending and the wedding industry to name just a few. This would also have the effect of increasing productivity at work by affecting positively the attendance of staff due to the anticipated reduction in sick absence.The Government should support this change.",
