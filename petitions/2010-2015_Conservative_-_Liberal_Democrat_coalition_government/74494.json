They have done nothing to change or drop China which is non-democratic, non free-press & non freedom of religion. As such that makes the whole council wilfully responsible to the Tibetan holocaust and other world problems by collaboration. The council has run the world purely for their self-benefit and a new 5- members are needed.",
