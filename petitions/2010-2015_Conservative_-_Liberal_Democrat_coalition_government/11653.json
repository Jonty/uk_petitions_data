For example, the e-petition 'Convicted London rioters should loose all benefits.' should spark a debate around whether the convicted London rioters should be used to set benefits free from the constraints currently placed upon them. In preparation for this debate, perhaps the creator could articulate what it is he feels these benefits need to be loosed from, and why he suggests the rioters would be best-placed to loose them.",
