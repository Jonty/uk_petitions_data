Promises made and broken THIS WEEK prove that politicians simply cannot be trusted to be honest or deal with the matter in an honourable fashion because it could have an effect upon them - they can only be relied upon to act in their own best interests in any matter which comes before them.  The people of this country are the ONLY people to be adversely affected by politicians' failure to deal with the West Lothian Question so every person in the UK should be allowed to voice an opinion through an e-petition.",
