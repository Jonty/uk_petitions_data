        "additional_details": "The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) brings together the chief police officers from England, Wales and Northern Ireland to share ideas.  As of March 2010 there were 349 members of ACPO.   The membership elects a full time President, who holds the office of Chief Constable under the Police Reform Act 2002.\r\nThe ACPO is a private limited company, funded by grants from the Home Office, membership fees from Police Forces and from selling services to the public and to other government departments.   As a private company it is not answerable to any Minister of State nor to Parliament and is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act.\r\nI call upon the Home Secretary to submit legislation to abolish the ACPO which is no longer needed and is a financial drain both to the public purse and to private customers for its services and to remove the position of Chief Constable at this private company.\r\n",
