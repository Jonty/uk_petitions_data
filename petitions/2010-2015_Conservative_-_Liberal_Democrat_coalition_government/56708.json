The current network is poorly managed and resourced, with often indifferent attitudes to customers , very poorly trained and resourced. The figures presented on unemployment and benefits are often false and very mislaeading. job opportunites do not exist and the universal job matching system is failry poor and not working. The Government needs to set up a new service, which is more efficient and responsive to the 21st century, not a throw back to the work house with little real meaning",
