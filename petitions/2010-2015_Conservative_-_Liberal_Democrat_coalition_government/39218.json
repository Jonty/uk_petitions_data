Polish are coming into our country for pregnancy care, as we make it so easily available. They often decide to stay and whilst here can claim benefits to support any children still living in Poland. I am not a racist, but our country as become too much of a soft touch at the tax payers expense. We want our Britain  back!!!\r\n",
