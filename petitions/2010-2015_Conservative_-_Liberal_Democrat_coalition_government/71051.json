        "additional_details": "On April 18th Kiesha was violently attacked and beaten by her partner after 2 years of sexual and physical abuse. The case was dropped because of lack of evidence to sustain a long enough sentence. He continued to stalk her for months and her lack of faith in the law nearly lead to her death.\r\n\r\nLonger sentences need to be introduced for offenders, the process in which victims can seek help by the law also needs improving. I would like the police to stay on top of reports of domestic violence and make sure that even after the incident if the offender was set free that the victim is not in any way scared or being put in harmful situations by the offender.\r\n\r\nIf the police do give bail to the offender I would like to introduce a new way of them keeping track of them to ensure they don't go and find the victim to do more damage and to really prevent that make prison sentences longer with closer attention to detail of the case even with little photographic evidence.\r\n\r\n",
