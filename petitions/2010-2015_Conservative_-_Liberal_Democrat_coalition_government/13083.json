Sign this petition to call for: 1) Limit volunteering to 4 hours per individual per week, 2) Creation of an independent body (NOT Volunteering England) to audit the volunteering roles offered by charities and other organisations to ensure that they are not replacing paid jobs, 3) Commission a report to analyse the cost to the economy of volunteering both through loss of earnings and through the creation of voluntary sector projects which should more properly be commercial enterprises.",
