Youth Crime costs the government \u00a3190 Million per year increasing to \u00a31.2 Billion for 16-24 year olds.\r\n*Leisure activities become affordable to low earners\r\n*NHS costs reduce as public health increases through regular exercise. Obesity alone costs the NHS \u00a34 billion per year, this cost is rising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
