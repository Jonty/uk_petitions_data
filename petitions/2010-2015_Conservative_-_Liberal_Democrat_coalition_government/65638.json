        "action": "Removal of Michael Gove from Office as Education Secretary",
        "additional_details": "This petition is calling for the removal of Michael Gove, as his actions as Education Secretary have not acted positively in the interests of all associated with education and have damaged the education system. Teachers and students alike have been hit extremely hard by his reforms and they pose no benefit in the short or long term to the country and more importantly to the people of the country subject to the changes. Reforms made to A-levels and GCSEs will cause more stress and pressure for students and are fundamentally unfair. For a country already with a large proportion of depressed people, due to stress how will heaping more stress on the youth help? Quality of teaching has also drastically fallen and changes to the curriculum do not benefit students or teachers like they did previously. This man is single handedly ruining our education system and our nation's future, changes must be made to the position of Education Secretary, rather than the Education System. ",
