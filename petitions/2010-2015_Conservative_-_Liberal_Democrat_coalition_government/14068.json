Instead of paying a weekly sum of \u00a356 to simply look for a job, why not enforce the recipients to partake in community service - or incentivise it? This could follow on from schemes such as Orange RockCorps, which sees participants rewarded for their time and effort.\r\n\r\nBy modifying the system, not only would you be giving the applicants experience, you'd also be improving the communities within which they live; potentially improving the much maligned community spirit.
