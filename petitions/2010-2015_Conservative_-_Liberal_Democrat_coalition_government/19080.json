        "additional_details": "The long and the short of this petition is not to debate who is to blame for the state of the countries finances, or to help with the world economy. This petition is soley to help our own economy and to build our country back up, and after the recession is over create jobs for our GREAT country. My opinion is for us as a country look at position we are in, and lay the situatuion on the table and give the people of the United Kingdom the figures of how much we could wipe off the debt by giving as little as \u00a310 each. Not only could we save ourselves alot of money in the long run & secure our way of life and not find ourselves in a run down country where the worst off families cannot afford to feed themselves. SUPPORT & CHANGE THE FUTURE FOR THE BETTER! ",
