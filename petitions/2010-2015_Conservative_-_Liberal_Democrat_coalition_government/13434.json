        "additional_details": "There is an annual ritual slaughter of Pilot Whales (Dolphins) by the Faroe Islanders each year. This slaughter is pointless, unnecessary and cruel. The Pilot Whales suffer great pain and cruelty as they are killed using hooks and other brutal devices.\r\n\r\nScientists now advise against the eating of Pilot Whale meat and blubber as it is heavily conraminated with mercury toxins. This slaughter is thus totally pointless and cruel.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to exert its influence both through world organisations, agencies and directly to stop this slaughter of Pilot Whales.\r\n\r\nWe also call on the government to exert pressure for the worlwide cessation of all ritualised torture of animals for entertainment purposes, eg bull fighting, bull runs and all other such events.",
