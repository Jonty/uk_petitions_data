            "details": "As this e-petition has received more than 10 000 signatures, the relevant Government department have provided the following response:\r\n\r\nWe have one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world and spend more than \u00a31billion of taxpayer\u2019s money on criminal legal aid each year. We must ensure we get the very best value for every penny spent.\r\n\r\nWe are tackling areas which are eroding public confidence \u2013 such as wealthy defendants who can afford to pay their own costs routinely receiving legal aid; prisoners being given legal aid for issues better dealt with by via the prisoner complaints system; a small amount of high cost cases swallowing up many millions in pubic money; and those who do not have a strong connection to this country qualifying for legal aid.\r\n\r\nUnder the proposals for reform of the criminal legal aid scheme that we are consulting on until 4 June, quality assured duty solicitors and lawyers would still be available \u2013 just as they are now. All providers would be required to satisfy specified quality standards when they submit their tenders and subsequently through contractual requirements. They would therefore all be capable and competent of delivering criminal legal aid services to any client.\r\n\r\nThe consultation proposals aim to deliver a more credible and efficient system which will save \u00a3220million from the legal aid bill by 2018/19.\r\n\r\nThe consultation is open until 4 June and the department welcomes submissions on its proposals via the following link: https://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/transforming-legal-aid\r\n\r\nThis e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.",
