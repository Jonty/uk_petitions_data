        "additional_details": "Glen Johnson should be formally recognised for the art of the tackle.  His tackle on Joleon Lescott in the 1st leg of the carling cup semi final has given hope to footballers across the nation that the art of the tackle is still very much alive.  Glen was able to prove this because he has the heart, desire and bravery of a top footballer to commit himself to the last ditch tackle and win the ball firmly but fairly.  That is what we all want to see; tough but fair tackling.",
