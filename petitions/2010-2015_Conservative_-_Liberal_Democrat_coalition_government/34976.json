A recent BBC News report states that it would be more beneficial, both economically and for criminal intelligence purposes for GCHQ to intercept, collate and monitor this data.\r\nWe the undersigned suggest that the Government be able to access real time and historic data of UK Internet usage through the best value for taxpayers money offered by the GCHQ solution and that any action on the Internet that may constitute criminal activity be monitored and any evidence gathered be used in a UK court for the purpose of prosecution of any such offender(s).\r\nA caveat to the above is that such information is protectively marked at a level of no less than RESTRICTED and only used for the purposes of investigation and prosecution of criminal matters.
