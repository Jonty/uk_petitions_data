There have been falls in the proportions of both men and women who drink heavily since 2005. The estimates for men fell from 9 per cent to 6 per cent and for women fell from 5 per cent to 3 per cent from 2005 to 2010.\r\n\r\nTherefore this petition calls upon the government to:\r\n\r\n1.Acknowledge alcohol consumption is falling not rising and base decisions on this fact\r\n\r\n2. Not to implement a minimum pricing policy for alcohol.\r\n",
