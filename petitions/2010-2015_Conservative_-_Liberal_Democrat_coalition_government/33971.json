        "additional_details": "Private Pension schemes based on deferred salary, commonly become SIPPs with a monthly income 'draw down ' amount subject to personal income tax. Many of these schemes were created in the seventies/eighties when returns on investment were relatively high; certainly  much higher than these days. At age 70, GAD rules come into play, designed, no doubt , to protect the remaining fund at that time.\r\nHowever, the rules can reduce the income by a huge amount, even to just over 40% gross, certainly affecting hard won lifestyle. The government loses a sizeable tax take and the individual loses spending power into the economy.\r\nThe situation urgently requires review, with some mitigation of the rules in mind.",
