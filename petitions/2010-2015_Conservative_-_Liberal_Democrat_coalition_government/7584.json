We want the Government to do this by making it clear to the police force that they can use as much force as required to prevent the destruction which is being caused during the recent London riots. We want the Government to assure the police force that they do not need to worry about repercussions when the force they use is reasonable and necessary. We want the Government to ensure that the harshest penalties are handed down to all offenders who are found guilty. We want the government to show that Britain will not stand for this kind of behaviour.",
