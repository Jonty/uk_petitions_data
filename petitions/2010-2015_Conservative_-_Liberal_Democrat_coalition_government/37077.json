        "additional_details": "An amazing Olympics, easily one of the most impressive events to have occurred in the UK in our lifetime.\r\n\r\nNow, the real challenge begins, as crazy as it seems, we may not host the games again in our lifetimes. With this in prospect, we need to make the most of right now. We have the buzz that's required, the PM yesterday announced a guarantee to fund UK sport and our athletes - Good news.\r\n\r\nThe funding is guaranteed for four years. Great. How do we guarantee the buzz for four years and beyond?\r\n\r\nA great opportunity to aid this would be for a state/BBC sports channel. No football, no cricket, no big budget sports where broadcast rights are grossly expensive - just Olympic minority sports & women's sports which lag behind their male equivalent. This will engage the public and entice participation. This can be financially viable without squeezing the license fee, with the correct strategy using lottery money and revenue raised by BBC Worldwide.",
