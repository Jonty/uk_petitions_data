That this money is reinvested into charities, school, health, disaster or overseas aid.\r\n\r\nWith London, England setting a precedent, the rest of the United Kingdon should follow and hopefully the world. With world leaders seeing the amount of money wasted on these events. The amount of change that could be brought about through these changes it would be silly not to. Better value for money. More economically viable.",
