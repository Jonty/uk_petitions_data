        "additional_details": "Mobile phones now have largely standardised on the micro usb socket.  This means that phones are cheaper, as a charger need not be included, and that shipping is cheaper since the boxes can be made smaller.  It also reduces waste in the environment.\r\n\r\nI would like to see laptop manufacturers also standardise their power sockets, so that I can easily obtain a replacement if mine should be damaged.\r\n\r\nEqually, batteries for laptops are very expensive and only last 2-3 years.  I cannot see a reason why the manufacturers could not come up with a small, medium and large battery size and fitment that would fit any machine.\r\n\r\nIf these two items were standardised life would be easier all round.",
