I get \u00a399.15 per week and can not afford to rent privately due to benefit cuts. I am homeless and sofa surfing with friends and family (not doing my back any favours which means keeping me out of employment longer)\r\n\r\n3 years ago I went to the council I ask for help and was told by a manager 'we have no obligation to help you' her EXACT words. Unfortunately I am not foreign nor have I popped out a sprog or 12 therefore I am not priority. DISGUSTING!!!",
