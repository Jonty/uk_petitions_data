        "additional_details": "George Osborne to stop giving money to banks to give to small and medium businesses instead he should set up a government sponsored run organisation that will lend money to small and medium businesses. Why does he continue to give money to the banks?  This makes no sense but it is a very clever way of propping up banks by stealth by pretending the money is for loans to businesses. He can then pretend to be upset with them when they don\u2019t give out loans. The people are not stupid George they know what you are up to.",
