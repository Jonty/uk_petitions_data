What is the fee for?\r\n\r\nIf the seller pays the fee, as via the standard process, the fee is normally 1% + VAT or less however when done via Sale by Tender the fee is doubled to 2% + VAT \u2013 why is it double?\r\n\r\nOften the seller is not aware of the pit falls of such a scheme and is simply sold on the \u2018Sell your home for \u00a3195 + VAT\u2019 headline. The seller should be made aware of the potential issues and pitfalls of such a scheme.\r\n",
