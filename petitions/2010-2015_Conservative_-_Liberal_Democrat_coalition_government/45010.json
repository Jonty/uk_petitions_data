        "additional_details": "DoT states that speed cameras should be there as a deterrent to exceed the speed limit, not as a punitive measure.\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\nTo install flashing signs before every speed camera or on the speed camera itself that informs the driver of their current speed before they go through the camera sensor.\r\n\r\nThis will achieve the following:\r\n1. Awareness of the speed enabling the driver to slow down.\r\n2. Reduction of the sudden braking that causes accidents when drivers are unaware of the speed limit, yet panic when they see the speed camera.\r\n3. Will cause effective awareness before the punitive measures.\r\n4, Reduce the public hatred and unfairness of speed cameras.",
