        "additional_details": "The Aldershot and District Military Byelaws 1976 states that activities such as cycling and horse riding are illegal on the military owned land as laid out in the byelaws.  The byelaws were written at time before popular activities such mountain biking even existed and as such is out of touch with several modern recreation activities that take place on the land.  The byelaws are up for review, but when is unclear. It is also unclear whether interest groups will be involved in the review process.  This petition asks for all relevant interest groups such as the British Horse Society and the Trail Action Group be allowed to actively participate in the review process so that the groups and the MOD can come to a mutually beneficial solution with continued safe access for all parties.",
