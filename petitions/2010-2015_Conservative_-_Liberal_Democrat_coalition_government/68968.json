        "additional_details": "The events in the Rotherham abuse scandal make it very clear that there should be introduced the concept of \"moral turpitude\" which has been described as an \"act of baseness, vileness, or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellowmen, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man.\" Surely this should apply to all those involved in this scandal. This petition demands that UK Government correct the ridiculous status that allows \"elected\" officers to remain in office without being subject to the same disciplinary  proceedings that would be applied to employees.
