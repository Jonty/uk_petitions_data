        "additional_details": "There are millions of 16-25 year olds unemployed. The reason they're unemployed is because of the over 60s *taking* all the jobs.\r\n\r\nIf the government allowed retirement at 60, people who worked all of their life, contributed to society, and paid their taxes have earned the right to enjoy their pensioned retirement.\r\n\r\nThis opens up jobs for the 16-25s who are crying out for work, and who are desperate to get off the dole. The money is then being spent on pensions, and not the dole.\r\n\r\nThe nation is resentful of people on the dole because they believe their taxes are paying for people to sit on their backside. Nobody would resent their taxes paying for financial support and security for when you're no longer as fit and able.\r\n\r\nEvery year, people drop off one end, and everyone moves up the ladder. Increased experience means increased productivity, which means that the output per worker increases, more output means more success, and the worker is rewarded with a pay rise.",
