But I think it would be better\r\nfor everyone if jobcentres were open 7 days a week\r\n52 weeks a year 8am til 8pm.\r\nSo I am starting this petition for jobcentres to open\r\nto suit jobseekers so there is always someone available 7 days a week all year round to help and\r\ngive advice whenever a jobseeker needs it this would\r\nbe a much fairer system for everyone.\r\n",
