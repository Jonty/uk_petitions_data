A significant part of any internship role must be dedicated to personal development and learning for the intern.\r\n\r\nIf an intern adds value to the company, s/he should be considered an employee and given the same rights. Employers must be made to understand that they cannot use internships to perform roles vital to their business.\r\n\r\nInterns must be paid at least a cost of living wage. If they are have responsibilities that are valued higher in the market, this must be reflected.\r\n\r\nEmployers must specify if an internship will lead to permanent employment and when this can be expected. It is not acceptable to keep valuable members of staff without paying them, on the promise of a job at some arbitrary future point.\r\n",
