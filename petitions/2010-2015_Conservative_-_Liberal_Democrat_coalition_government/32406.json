        "additional_details": "The Government is reportedly planning to reintroduce a plan first proposed by the last Labour government. This plan would make companies store details of who we talk to by phone, text and email, how long for and how often. It would also make them record which websites we visit. In addition to being an attack on our civil liberties and treating innocent people like criminals, this would violate the right to privacy and increase hardware costs for companies. We the undersigned call upon Her Majesty's Government to drop this discredited plan.",
