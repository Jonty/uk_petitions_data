        "additional_details": "The Petitioner and his co-signatories believe that the proposed one per cent Benefit Freeze is unfair and unjust;\r\n\r\nIt is extremely likely to cause very serious hardship to many thousands of families and individuals. Over three years, this could reduce incomes by fifteen per cent to as much as one third.\r\n\r\nThe Petitioner suggests a revision to one per cent below the Rate of Inflation, over three years, with a Parliamentary Review thereafter.",
