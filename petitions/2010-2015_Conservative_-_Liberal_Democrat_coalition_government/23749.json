Breaking  the Enigma codes, saved this nation from possible starvation and defeat. His radical and original ideas began the computing revolution and changed all our lives forever in ways we all take for granted. Yet he was to be discarded and hounded to his death by the society he saved. His achievements for the survival of this nation can be compared to that of Nelson's so he should have a place along side him. A national hero because of his mind. ",
