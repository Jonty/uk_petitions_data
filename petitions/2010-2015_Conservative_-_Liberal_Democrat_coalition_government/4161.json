In old age they have no family to look after them whilst those they have been subsidising enjoy all the benefits of the families that childless people have been paying  for.\r\n\r\nEqually those who breed children are adding to the global population crisis, which has grown from 2.5 billion in 1950 to 6.7 billion in 2006 and is still climbing.\r\n\r\nBy giving substantial tax rebates on retirement to those who have not had children the government would assist childless people to have a more fulfilling old age, redress some of the unfair, over generous distribution of tax incomes towards child breeders and start to incentivize people not to breed so rampantly and thus help to protect the planet. .\r\n",
