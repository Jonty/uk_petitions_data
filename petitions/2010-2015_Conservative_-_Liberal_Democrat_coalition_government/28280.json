        "additional_details": "British Prime Minister, David Cameron has announced that the British government intends to use military force on yet another country, this time Somalia.  As a democratic country we as a British nation are demanding the UK government to listen to the people and stop any plans of the intervention in Somalia.\r\nThe results of Afghanistan, Iraq and recent Libya were deplorable to witness innocent civilians killed incessantly. We do not want this happening again. This is another farce of western democracy being imposed on nations by our government, and the \u2018attempts\u2019 to fight against terrorism. If we really live in a democratic country like we are told on a daily basis why are never consulted on issues as big and serious as this, why are we never asked our opinion?\r\n\r\nWe need to speak out as nation, and pressurise the government\u2019s attempts to attack and destruct another soveriegn nation.\r\n",
