        "additional_details": "Being underweight is just as serious as being overweight. In fact, being underweight has the same health complications as being overweight.  I, myself, am underweight and I'm growing increasingly worried about the reduction in calories yearly. We need more attention put towards those who are underweight at the same time focusing on those who are overweight. Simply put, there is no help for those who are seeking to gain weight for their own health sake, and it is increasingly becoming more of a challenge. We find it just as hard to eat more as it is for those to eat less.\r\n\r\nWe need more health options available to encourage those who need to gain weight. We need more calorie dense foods, which are no longer in sight. We need not to forget those who are suffering just as much as those who are overweight.",
