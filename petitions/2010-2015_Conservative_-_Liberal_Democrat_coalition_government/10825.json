        "additional_details": "I have begun this petition to have the VAT which is currently based at 20% removed from the entry prices at Theme Parks and all forms of Childrens entertianment.\r\nThis includes Cinema tickets, Bowling, Football Matches and many other activities that they enjoy.\r\n\r\nAt the moment it costs families a small fortune to take children out for the day, add in the price of petrol and travel the cost spirals out of proportion.\r\n\r\nCurrently it costs between \u00a320 to \u00a340 to enter most good Theme Parks, within this is around \u00a34 to \u00a38 tax per child, this adds up when you have take in additional children.\r\n\r\nI think the levy should be withdrawn from the price of all childrens entertainment, it is crassly unfair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
