        "additional_details": "Ordinary working and middle class people due to retire after April 2013, who have been wise and thrifty enough to save in a pension scheme, have just had the value of their pension income reduced by around \u00a3480 p.a. by the budget.  This is at the same time as million-pound-bonus bankers have their tax liability reduced by \u00a350,000, company directors giving themselves 30-40-50% pay rises are similarly rewarded and other millionaires, including those in the cabinet, enjoy similar massive tax breaks.\r\n\r\nIt is the \u2018ordinary\u2019 pensioner who struggles most with rising living costs.  To take from the relatively poor, perhaps forcing many on to benefits, whilst giving money back to the already super-rich is cruel and uncaring.\r\n\r\nThis petition asks government to reverse its decision to tax the elderly more heavily than ever before, and to restore the age related tax allowances.\r\n",
