        "additional_details": "After recently getting 'stung' by a private Parking Fine's company I have found how badly regulated,if at all, the industry is.The British Parking Association is literally there for advice only and these companies are getting away with charging exhorbitant price's with very little means of appeal or comeback for the general member of the public.The Government should put tighter controls on these companies ensuring they are there for enforcement and not just a money making scam.Clearer signs,more concise rights to appeal and smaller fee's will stop these cowboys ripping everyone off.These companies can do what they want, charge what they want and totally ignore any right of appeal - and that's simply wrong.",
