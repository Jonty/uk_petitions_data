You will no longer have more rights than your victims. \u00a0\r\nWith the recent riots \u00a0more about greed & looting rather than a political grievance it is time that this country charged criminals for their punishment. Students now pay for their higher education, so should criminals be charged for their cost to society.\u00a0\r\nWe beseech the political parties to amend The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to provide for a charge to be levied against all criminals found guilty. The clawback should be tougher than that set for students. The criminals assets even if legally acquired should be included.",
