It would also improve there skills, which may help them in their education.\r\n\r\nAs well as benefiting teenagers, a minimum wage would also help local businesses, by providing them with competitive labour in a tough financial climate.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to implement a minimum wage for people age 14 - 15 inclusive, between \u00a32.00 and \u00a32.70.",
