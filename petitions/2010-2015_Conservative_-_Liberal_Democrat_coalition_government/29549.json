        "additional_details": "Liverpool fans have been extremely outraged with regards to how Luis Suarez has been treated over the course of the last few months with regards to the racism charge brought by the FA. However they have failed to protect this player with regards to the FA rules. In fact in the FA response to the  Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee\r\nInquiry into Football Governance, 26 January 2011 the FA state that 'The FA acknowledges its responsibility to ensure that the rules governing English football, both\r\non and off the field are fit for purpose in terms of their protection of supporters, players, the\r\nclubs and the competitions in which they play. ' It is time to stop this treatment and ensure protection and ensure the rivalry between Liverpool and Manchester United Football Clubs is not strengthened with hatred this in turn could lead to jeopardising safety at matches between fans. In turn it violates the rule in two ways.",
