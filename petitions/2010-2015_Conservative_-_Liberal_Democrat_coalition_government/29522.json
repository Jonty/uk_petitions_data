        "additional_details": "\r\nThe year on year inflation figures are unrealistic as they do not reflect how prices have gone up since an arbitrary benchmark.  The office for national statistics should be creating a benchmark point and show how prices have changed from this.  The current system does not show overall how inflation is impacting on our society eg when vat rise drops out, the fact is we are still paying it! the same with fuel duty increases etc.   I also think the figures should reflect realistically the cost of essential items in the household budget, items like food, clothes, housing costs, insurance to live and not items like alcohol, cigarettes etc.\r\n\r\nI call upon the government to change the system to make it more transparent / representative / realistic and easier to understand.\r\n\r\nPlease support this petition for a fairer society.\r\n",
