        "additional_details": "There is an Economic divide between the North and the South. How is this to be changed? A centralised, strong party whip government will protect its economic interests as it is. A local MP has conflicting interests. We therefore see failing towns and cities across the UK. Two Bicameral chambers, a House of Commons for the Executive and MP's, to make decisions in the interest of country (as it only does today- which is the problem), and a reformed House of Lords, that is of elected members for again, each Constituency. It will be their role directly to protect the interests of their constituents; having no conflicting interests with the executive nor 'the country's interests'. An elected Lord could argue and apply for funding as it sees necessary, not the partisan chamber looking for political points, that doesn't regard the best interests of each constituent.",
