It cost  \u00a32.5 for oyster single fare, It's twice more expensive than Paris metro, and 10 times less efficient than any other country's subway.\r\nWe want a new system, noise free train that carries more passengers, allows passengers to use their mobile and surf internet on the train, air conditioning during summer time.\r\nRight now It is draining your energy by just taking London public transportations and enduring all those noise everyday! No wonder so many Londoners are suffering anxiety and depression.",
