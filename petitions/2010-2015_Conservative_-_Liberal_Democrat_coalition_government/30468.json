The Kennel Club is not doing enough to eradicate inbreeding and genetic deformities and diseases. When such issues are brought up, they ignore or even punish the source because it may tarnish the breed, or affect the income of purely pedigree breeders earning top price for puppies produced by show winners bred with massive defects intentionally for cosmetic purposes.\r\nThese changes should in turn change the rules of their shows where effected dogs are rewarded for their defects and are bred from to produce future \u2018show winners\u2019.\r\nAnyone who cares about animals and hates to see animals suffering needs to help us and join this campain to save thousands of dogs from agony and suffering.",
