During these operations 55,573 were killed.\r\n\r\nThe dead included Britons, Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders, Poles, Free French, Americans (attached to Bomber Command) Norwegians and Indians.\r\n91 members of the Women's Auxillary Air Force also died while on duty with Bomber Command.\r\n\r\nWe ask the government to create and award a special Campaign Medal to the members of Bomber Command, to recognise their service to the freedom of this country.\r\n\r\nWe should do this urgently before the remaining members are no longer alive to receive it.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
