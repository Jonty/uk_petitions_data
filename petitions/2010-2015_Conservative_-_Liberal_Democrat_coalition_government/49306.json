        "additional_details": "I propose the Government make the Chickenpox (varicella) vaccine part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule, as it already is in USA, Japan, Canada and Australia.\r\n\r\nVaricella (chickenpox) is a highly contagious disease that is very uncomfortable and sometimes serious, leading to hospitalisation and death, particularly in adults.\r\n\r\nThe objective is to put an end to an easily avoidable illness, which can result in suffering in children and adults, scarring of the skin, flu-like symptoms resulting in many hospitalisations every year and avoiding parents taking weeks off work caring for sick children who are forbidden going to nurseries or schools, due to the risk of infecting others.\r\n\r\nPlease support our campaign to get the vaccine introduced quickly.",
