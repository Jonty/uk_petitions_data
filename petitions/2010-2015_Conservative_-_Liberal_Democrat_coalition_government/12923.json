        "additional_details": "Considering the strain that omnivores have on the environment - due to the costs of transporting animals and feed - various environmental health groups have called for people to have one vegetarian day a week. Perhaps MPs should help this initiative by becoming full-time vegetarians?\r\n\r\nWe all look up to MPs as role models, as trailblazers for our own habits and behaviour patterns. If they were to lead the way with this, the British public would be inspired to become a nation of vegetarians. The corollary of this would be a major reduction in our carbon emissions.",
