The Government must veto this idea to prevent it from happening!\r\n\r\nPlease read the proposals:  http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/news/animal-testing\r\n\r\nIf this goes ahead, it will encourage the development of even more puppy farms at a time when we should be looking to close them down.\r\n\r\nIs that what we should be doing here in the UK, just because Europe wants everything standardised?\r\n\r\nMy dog was rescued by the RSPCA, having spent years breeding puppies, and she is a physical mess as a result. It would be terrible to think that so many more dogs will find themselves breeding litter after litter, but they will if this imposition from the EU is carried.\r\n",
