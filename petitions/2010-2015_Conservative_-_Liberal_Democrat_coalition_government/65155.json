(Those not trained, will have their licences revoked) and will not be able to work or earn a living.\r\n\r\nDrivers may also be required to pay themselves ! This is Not Fair on Drivers, the Industry, or the Tax Payer.\r\n\r\nA drivers competence is assessed when a driver passes his/her driving test.\r\n\r\nDue to the variation of work involved particularly within HGV Road Haulage Industry, further competence training should be left to the responsibility of the employer, for the role that the driver is undertaking.\r\n\r\nIt is requested that the CPC Legislation be Abolished/Scrapped, before September 2014.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/scrapdrivercpc",
