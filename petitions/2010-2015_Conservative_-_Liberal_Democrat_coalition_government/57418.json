        "additional_details": "5000 People have died in custody since 1969,no convictions have been brought to the Police.These deaths have been shown on CCTV and proven but still no accountabilty on behalf of those who are meant to Protect and Serve..The IPCC investigate these crimes and time and time again,no fault is found with the police.Since Leon died on the 4/11/2013,a further 3 deaths have occurred and are given the same script/speech from the IPCC with only a change in name and age.There has been a 210% increase since 1998 in detaining the public under the Mental Health Act,the police are then only investigated for minor offences such as the Health & Safety at Work Act,please sign this petition to keep current and future generations safe,and demand reform!",
