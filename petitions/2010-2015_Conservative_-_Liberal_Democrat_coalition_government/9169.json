        "additional_details": "We the undersigned wish to highlight the findings of the Equality Trust that societies with smaller income differences between rich and poor have fewer health and social problems, such as teenage births, violence, social disorder, mental illness and drug abuse; further further note that such societies have higher levels of trust between citizens and more social mobility. With the unprecedented social instability and rioting we have seen sweep the country, now more than ever, we need action. We therefore call on the Government to make the reduction of income inequality the major focus of it's legislative program.",
