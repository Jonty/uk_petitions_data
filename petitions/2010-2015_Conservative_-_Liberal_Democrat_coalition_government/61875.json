        "additional_details": "The parents of Tranmere Park Primary School and residents of the surrounding area petition Leeds City Council to improve the safety of the roads on the streets around and approaching the school. We request the following measures be taken:\r\nA) Signage erected around the school warning cars to slow down, indicating that children are crossing, and that vehicles are warned that they are approaching a school\r\nB) A new 20mph limit be implemented on the Tranmere Park estate with particular reference to Ridgeway and Ridgeway Close\r\nC) Pavements be constructed along Ridgeway, Ridgeway Close, The Oval, and Southway to remove all pedestrians from the path of traffic\r\nD) A new 30mph zone be created from the entrance/exit of Park Road, along Bradford Road to the roundabout at the White Cross linking to the A65 (this would also enhance pupil safety at Guiseley High School and the Leeds North West SILC at Green Meadows)\r\n\r\n",
