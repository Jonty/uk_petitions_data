        "additional_details": "The government should mark the 200th Anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo in 2015 with nation-wide celebrations. It was an important event for not only Britain, but the whole of Europe. Waterloo was an example of European co-operation with British, Dutch and German forces  fighting against a dictator. It was the culmination of a war also involving Russia, Austria and Portugal as well as many others and is something therefore to celebrate as it is an example of European unity. We should also celebrate Britain's leading role in the conflict which kept Europe free from tyranny. Marking the 200th Anniversary would be a fitting way to remember the  bravery of the 75,000 casualties of the battle. Remembering and celebrating the event will  also increase interest in the period, and will help reverse the growing historical apathy of schoolchildren.",
