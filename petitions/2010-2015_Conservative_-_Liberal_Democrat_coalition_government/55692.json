        "action": "To reinstate BCG vaccine to school age children in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "TB rates in the UK have stabilised at a high level in recent years, and the UK now has one of the highest incidence rates of any Western European country. Within the UK, TB is very unequally distributed, with certain sub-groups, such as new migrants, ethnic minority groups, and those with social risk factors disproportionally affected. Action is required to ensure that best practice in prevention, control and treatment is delivered to all communities across the country.  We want our children to have reinstated what was taken away from the UK population in 2005.  With our open border policy in place we have no control over people bringing in this life threatening condition from various countries.  Prevention is better than cure and with a vaccine which has been used safely for 90 years and is relatively cheap then why put our nation's children in danger.  ",
