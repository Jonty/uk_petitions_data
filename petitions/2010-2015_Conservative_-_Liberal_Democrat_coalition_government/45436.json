However, if the goal is integration of the immigrant  workforce, then it is right that there is a completely level playing field. For example, it is common for casual jobs  advertised in shop windows or websites to be written exclusively in polish. This implies discrimination against the indiginous workforce which is illegal and creates the circumstances in which young British jobseekers are unable to compete with eastern europeans.\r\n\r\nThe proper response is for there to be a legal requirement that all jobs, of whatever nature  and security must be advertised in english with the corollary that adverts not advertised in english are illegal and the recruiters are liable for fines.",
