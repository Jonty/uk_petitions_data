Walton Hall Park is a place of peace and tranquility for many residents in North Liverpool and is a much needed green space considering Liverpool City Council's policy of giving away green space for development. We strongly object to any development on any treasured green space in this city and therefore strongly oppose this plan and urge Liverpool City Council and Everton FC to seek an alternative site for a new stadium.",
