        "additional_details": "Tax rates are being dropped for average to mid salary earners....yet dropped for role earning over \u00a3120,000.\r\n\r\nIn what state does this make sense? Stop the rich getting richer and slow down the destruction of our nation.\r\n\r\nProposals:\r\n- increase 10% tax threshold to \u00a312,500; use this to reduce some benefits, encouraging people to work.\r\n- increase 40% tax to \u00a350,000; encourage UK workers to chase careers and better themselves.\r\n- bring in a 45% tax rate at \u00a375,000; to recoup some of lower earner changes\r\n- 50% start at \u00a3100,000\r\n- maintain VAT at 20%\r\n\r\nThese changes would reward people wanting to work and climb ladders. Giving the nation more cash, importantly more disposable cash. With maintaining VAT some tax would be retained through higher spending.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to show the Government that changes in Income Tax.\r\n",
