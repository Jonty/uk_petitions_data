However, an independent Scotland would damage ALL the UK (not just Scotland), and so surely ALL the citizens of the UK should have the right to vote on any referendum. Denying the rest of the UK the chance to vote is un-democratic, therefore the government should allow ALL UK citizens the right to vote.",
