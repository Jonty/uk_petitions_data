Each entry should identify the owner with full contact details including address, normal rate phone number and email. Also include the name of the organisation that issued the number and first point for complaints relating to this number, and the charged rate for the number.\r\nVarious organisations hide behind 'a number' and use it as a way to take money from people whilst making it difficult to complain or even expose exactly who they are. This measure would help to encourage companies to think carefully about how they use these numbers knowing that they can be easly be identified and complaints lodged.\r\nIt would also remove the frustration of having a missed call from a premium rate number and not daring to call it back as you don't know who it is or what you will be changed.",
