There have been no incidents where a couple practicing Bondage has become life threatening, such incidents occur when someone attempts such acts alone.\r\nWith the advanced knowledge and  advanced stronger sex toys available today to continue to classify Female Ejaculation as offensive makes no sense. How can a woman's orgasm be deemed an offence.\r\nIn short these rules are too outdated to be allowed to govern the Adult Entertainment Industry",
