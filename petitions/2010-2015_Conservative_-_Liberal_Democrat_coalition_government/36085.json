Foreign office should be diplomatic, never threaten sanctions or military action.\r\nWe need to reverse current policy, sell weapons only to legitimate governments, cease supplying or supporting anti government organisations throughout the world. Through current policy we have become the most hated nation in the third world next to the US, foreign trade has collapsed, terrorist threat has increased, our economy is in tatters. We cannot afford current UK/USpolicy.\r\n",
