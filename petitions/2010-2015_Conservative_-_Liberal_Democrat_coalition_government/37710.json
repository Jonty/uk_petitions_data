        "additional_details": "There is a need to educate all teaching staff to understand FASD\r\nToo many Teachers are struggling to teach children in our schools, who have disabilities, such as ADHD, Autism, Asperger\u2019s, these syndromes fall under the FASD umbrella .It is apparent  teachers have very little  knowledge or no understanding of FASD.  It is vital to educate and train all Teachers/LSA and SEN in School throughout England about FASD By them knowing and understanding this will stop young people with FASD diagnosis falling through the cracks.\r\nIf our children do not achieve the appropriate education this impacts on their future.  These children often due to their not in your face disability are left to flounder.\r\nFASD as my son says is like living as a square peg in a round hole.\r\nFeedback from support groups highlight the need for more help and support for all children/youth affected by this totally preventable syndrome.\r\n",
