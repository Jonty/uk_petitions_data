They have transformed the rolling stock with the ultra-safe, tilting Pendolinos and are the only company left in the UK that does proper catering on its trains.\r\n\r\nVote for Virgin to carry on delivering the service which we can all be proud of. I use them every day and am proud to support their bid over any other. Join me.",
