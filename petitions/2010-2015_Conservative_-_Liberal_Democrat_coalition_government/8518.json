Having so many local authorities in London is wasteful, inefficient and illogical.  We would like the government to reform local government in London by:\r\n1)\tscrapping the 33 boroughs and set up smaller \u2018neighbourhood councils\u2019, with similar powers to parish councils elsewhere in the country;\r\n2)\tgive the Greater London Authority all borough powers and assets; and\r\n3)\texpanding the London Assembly to 65 members and give it greater powers to hold the Mayor to account.\r\n",
