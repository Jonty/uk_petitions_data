        "additional_details": "Several councils one being \"Bath\" are looking at banning SatNav devices being used in all private hire and Hackney carriage vehicles. Saying they are putting passenger safety at risk due to a SatNav being a distraction while driving. If this ban comes into place many hard working drivers will be at risk of losing work and worse their livelihood. How does this make the roads safer? What about all the other road users who use satnavs? Satnavs are used by all company's across the UK this does not just affect Taxi drivers. Please show your support to stop this ridiculous proposal! If you use a Satnav in your own car this may affect you a few years down the line so please show your support. ",
