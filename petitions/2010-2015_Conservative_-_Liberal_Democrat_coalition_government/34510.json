        "additional_details": "I will start this by saying I agree that council tax should be paid, but for those who have struggled paying and missed payments, have generally been passed on to Rossendales.\r\nRossendales is a very unproffessional debt recovery company who are not interested in  leniency and who send bullying thug bailiffs to those who miss a single payment. Many (including elderly and single mothers) have been subject to intimidation, bullying and in some case violence from these bailiffs.\r\nI would like to propose that our councils give advice and help to those who cant always afford to pay their council tax on time, rather than passing on our details to Rossendales. Please sign if you agree, as this has gone on for too long. I have provided a link with some peoples experiences with this company. Thanks\r\nhttp://www.consumeractiongroup.co.uk/forum/showthread.php?29352-Rossendales-CB/page2",
