        "additional_details": "I am proposing a change to the system of government in the UK. I believe that the people of the UK should have the power to elect who runs each department. No more single government, I am proposing a tripartite system where we the people elect the political party most capable of running each department. No more single party government. For example if the Conservatives are most capable of running defense let them, and if the Lib Dems are most capable of running education let them. We should decide which party runs which aspect of the government.",
