        "additional_details": "We call for the government to review the number of years for penalty point to stay on driving licenses.\r\nDue to confusing speed restriction sign many people end up receiving point for driving 2-3 miles over the speed limit and we believe that this is very minor offence and they should not be penalised for 4 year for this offence. Insurance companies are cashing in on these cases and due to the current economical circumstances people are seeing 60-70% rise in their insurance premium for committing a very minor offence which in most cases is unintentional.\r\nWe believe the period for every 3 points on your driving license for a minor offence should be reduced from 4 years to 1 year.\r\n",
