Genuine fans are being forced to choose between missing out on gigs or paying 4 or 5 times face value for tickets.\r\nAs well as the touts we have con artists posing as touts on sites like Gumtree who will take cash via Bank Transfer but send no tickets.\r\nThen we have official vendor Ticketmaster who refer ticketless fans to its own touting website GetMeIn.\r\nWith todays technology it must be easy to print concert goers name on ticket. Many people would rather show ID to get in to a gig than pay hundreds of pounds",
