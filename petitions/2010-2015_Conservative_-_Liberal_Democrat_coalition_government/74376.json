        "additional_details": "We petition that BTEC and the Department for Education change the BTEC rules back to allow students to succeed again. Last year, BTEC changed the rules, so that if a student were to fail an assignment, they would get one resubmission - however the teachers are NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE FEEDBACK. This means students cannot be told where they have gone wrong - preventing them from learning from their mistakes and correcting them. This makes the BTEC courses incredibly hard and stressful for students, preventing them from developing social skills and having fun in their life.",
