        "action": "Restrict MP's from Employing family members",
        "additional_details": "Currently it is allowable for MP's to employ family members in paid positions without being open to any scrutiny. This practice may in many cases may provide best value for money to the tax payer , however it is open to systematic abuse (as we have seen) and it gives the wrong impression to the tax paying public. For this reason I believe the government should reverse this policy , and restrict MP's from employing family members at the taxpayers expense. I have no objection to MP's using family members at their own expense or in a voluntary (unpaid) role",
