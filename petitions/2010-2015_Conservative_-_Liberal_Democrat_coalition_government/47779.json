        "additional_details": "The UK needs to develop a more coherent industrial policy that would foster growth in the industrial sector by adopting more proactive policies. Britain has suffered immeasurably from industrial decline resulting from a number of factors, important strategic areas have been decimated from ship building, cars, electronics, machine tools amongst other critical industrial sectors. The trade deficit provides the evidence of how bad this situation has got and this despite almost being self sufficient in respects to oil production.\r\n\r\nThis could be achieved by providing loan guarantees, subsidies, seed capital, research and development, preferential procurement and in extraordinary cases temporarily taking over and restructuring companies.
