        "additional_details": "In 1950 the UK Government stopped recognising the Republic of China (Taiwan and several smaller islands) as an independent state so that relations with the People's Republic of China could develop.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of China is prevented from joining ASEAN or the United Nations by the PRC and democratic countries worldwide are letting this happen.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of China is world famous for its' free press, excellent healthcare, successful education system, and great system of welfare... whereas the PRC is the complete opposite.\r\n\r\nWe could set a new precedent for all other democracies around the world, that we do recognise democratic countries who deserve the right to be free from PRC oppression and threats of military violence if they declare independence.\r\n\r\nWe need to come together as one voice to make a stand for democracy in the Chinese Peninsula by recognising and opening renewed relations with the Republic of China.",
