        "additional_details": "IT literacy is at an all-time low with standards varying wildly across the country. Many schools have chronically underfunded IT infrastructure and the GCSE & A Level IT qualifications very rarely teach relevant industry skills. This petition calls on the government to review its current IT strategy in the state school system. This review should also consider the benefits of compulsory teaching of IT skills in our nation's schools, how school IT infrastructure can be sustainably funded and the benefits industry consultation on the curriculum behind the current A Level & GCSE IT qualifications would bring to the wider economy and overall IT literacy.",
