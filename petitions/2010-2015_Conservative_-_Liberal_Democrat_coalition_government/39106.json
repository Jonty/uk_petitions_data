        "additional_details": "This petition is to request that the Environment Agency fees for registration for WEEE production be removed from non-manufacturers.\r\n\r\nRegistration through an authorised provider of WEEE compliance as required by the EU is mandatory and as such places unnecessary and unreasonable costs on small businesses, cost that may otherwise be used in wealth creation expenditure.\r\n\r\nUnder present regulations a UK company distributing product that is manufactured elsewhere within the EU BOTH the manufacturer AND the distributor have to pay compliance registration fees for the SAME product This adds cost to the product and duplicates registration and enforcement resources.",
