        "additional_details": "MP Stewart Jackson called members of the general population \"unemployable dross\" and then \"social misfit bottom feeding dregs\" on his Twitter on 9th April 2013.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned believe that Mr Jackson's Twitter comments are a wholly inappropriate and shocking way for an M.P. to refer to the part of the population that do not share his personal views.\r\n\r\nThese generalisations are insulting and derogatory to the general public and Mr Jackson has no evidence of the employment status of any if the individuals he is referring to.\r\n\r\nWe call on Mr Jackson to resign as MP for Peterborough and a member of the Public Accounts Committee as he is unsuitable for holding a position as an elected representative of the General Population.\r\n",
