        "additional_details": "In order to be released early prisoners should be electronically tagged so the police are aware of their location at all times until they have proven they are no longer a danger to society.\r\n\r\nThis would enable the police to know where those convicted of burglary are, and if a burglary is reported we can check if they were in the same location at that time.\r\n\r\nIt would enable them to see if convicted paedophiles are in the vicinity of a school.\r\n\r\nThe tag would be a similar form to the current electric tag, but would track released prisoners when they are outside and the police would be able to pinpoint their location at all times.",
