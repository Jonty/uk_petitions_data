        "additional_details": "New UK law makes it almost impossible for any Type 1 Diabetics to retain there driving licences, It now states that if a diabetic has an 'indecent' even when asleep they have to surrender there driving licence.\r\n\r\nThis new directive shows a total and utter lack of understanding and a purposefully discriminatory and illegal attempt to create a blanket ban on virtually all Diabetics,\r\n\r\nThis has also been passed through Diabetes hospitals and patients like myself are arriving for medical appointments and without knowledge or consent having to answer questions that will be passed to the DVLA if they are answered 'incorrectly'\r\n\r\nThis is a Class-A example of discrimination, it equates to removing the entire responsible drinking populations driving licence if one person drink-drives, this madness needs to be stopped. And now. ",
