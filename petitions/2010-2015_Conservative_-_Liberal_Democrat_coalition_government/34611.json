        "additional_details": "Britain should join with France, Turkey and NATO in establishing neutral corridors in Syria's borders areas.\r\n\r\nRefugees can be given humanitarian aid in these areas and armed forces from either side kept out. Syria is likely to concede small areas rather than fight a hopeless battle against NATO. If it does attack, NATO can still push Syrian forces back from the zones without having to take over the whole country.\r\n\r\nA plan of this kind has already been endorsed by 'the Times' and 'the Economist'. France and Turkey have already voiced support. Only British support is now needed for at least a European force to be assembled. The United States may follow if Europeans 'take the lead' as in Libya.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, support this petition for humanitarian aid corridors in Syria, now!",
