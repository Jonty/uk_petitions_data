However, it should also be recognised that any benefit of such right is provided to those who reciprocate it. Call it Responsibility that comes with having such a right.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that terrorists, rapists, child abusers are a clear example of the sort of people who, through their crimes, severly affect their victims human rights to dignified life and hence should not be able to claim same right for themselves which they deny others.\r\n\r\n",
