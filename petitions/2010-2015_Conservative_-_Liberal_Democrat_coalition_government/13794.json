        "additional_details": "All across the country, farms are being sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals very near to houses, schools, hospitals, etc. Currently farmers are not required to tell residents that this spraying is happening. (http://www.pesticides.gov.uk/safe_use.asp?id=493) Many pesticides which were once considered 'safe' have since been proven harmful to humans, wildlife, and the environment. Many others lack the research to support their continued usage. I think we should require farmers to report in a central, online database what they have sprayed where and when, and to make this database accessible to the public. They should also be required to advise local residents when spraying will happen with a time requirement, so for instance, it must be posted one week or one month prior to spraying. This should apply to all chemical usage, as it can all drift onto gardens where children play.",
