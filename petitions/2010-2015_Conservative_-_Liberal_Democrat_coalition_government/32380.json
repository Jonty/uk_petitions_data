This was introduced under the false premise of protecting citizens to deceive.\r\n\r\nWe condemn regimes that curtail civil liberties yet we do not stand up for your own. Every person has a right to a private life and it is not for anyone, let alone the government to take.\r\n\r\nIn a time when people are struggling to earn a living, it is unjust to add insult to injury by curtailing human rights.",
