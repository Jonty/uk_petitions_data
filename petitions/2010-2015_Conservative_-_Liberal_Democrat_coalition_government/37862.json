        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the removal of Justine Greening as Transport Secretary, following her decision to ignore the 152,190 signatures (at the creation of this petition) of the 'Reconsider West Coast Mainline franchise decision' e-petition. Her defiant judgement to ignore the concerns of the people she serves is a bad day for democratic participation in this country. There is nothing to be lost in postponing the decision to sign-off the deal with First Group until such time that parliament is able to discuss the issue, as requested by the 152,190 signatories, and her unwillingness to do so makes Justine Greening's tenancy in the House untenable.
