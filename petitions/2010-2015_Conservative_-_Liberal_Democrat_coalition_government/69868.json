        "additional_details": "Disabled people in receipt of lifetime or indefinate DLA awards are due to start being called for \"assessments\" next year 2015.\r\nThese people have already lived with the worry, stress and uncertainty which this has created. The start date has altered over time, due to the ongoing, chaotic introduction of PIP.\r\nThis group of people by definition have serious disabilities / health problems. They are year on year fewer in number.\r\nLeave these people in peace. Let them keep their DLA awards in the same way as over 65s.\r\nPIP will still be introduced but in a smoother, less traumatising way.\r\nThe cost of this measure would be negligible, as most of them would receive at least the same amount in PIP following assessment.\r\nPlease do the right thing. These people have enough problems. Thank you.\r\n",
