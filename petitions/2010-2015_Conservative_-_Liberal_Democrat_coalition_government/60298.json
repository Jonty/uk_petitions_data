        "additional_details": "This is a request to the UK Government to bring in a tax on New Player Registrations whenever a transfer fee is paid for a professional player in any UK sport.\r\nGrassroots football and other amateur sports are suffering from a severe lack of funds, with cutbacks now badly impacting upon the expected benefit from the Olympic legacy. A New Player Transfer tax, properly applied, would transform our nation's health, sport and recreational amenities. As an example, in the last 5 years, \u00a33.25 Billion has been spent by the present 20 English Premiership teams on transfers. A quasi \"tax\" is already levied on transfers because sums, amounting to 10% or more, are paid as a \"commission on transfer fees\". These monies are paid to agents and associates and the majority of these commissions end up in tax havens.\r\nWith the vast sums of TV and sponsorship money flooding into professional sport, the UK Government should now obtain its fair share for society.
