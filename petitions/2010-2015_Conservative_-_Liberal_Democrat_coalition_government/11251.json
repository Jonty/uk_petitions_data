The UK will have a population of 70 million people by the year 2029,the equivalent of gaining a city the size of Bristol every year for the next two decades. There just isn't the room, nor the resources.\r\n\r\nWe propose:\r\nFinancial incentives for parents with only one child, twins and triplets should not be exempt if they are the first born.\r\nAn increase in funding for contraceptive awareness and a direct movement against groups who oppose it.\r\nAn increase in payments to less developed countries to prevent the need for immigration which currently accounts for around half of our population growth.\r\n",
