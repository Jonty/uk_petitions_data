        "action": "Legalise use of Firearms (handguns and rifles) and means of self defence",
        "additional_details": "Currently in the UK there is almost no legal way of self defence against criminals.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the law means the only people who hold and use handguns are criminals and criminals love strict gun laws and weapon laws because it means they KNOW they are unopposed when they choose to rob, mug, burgle, rape or murder.\r\n\r\nIn the US, where the home-owner is likely to be armed, only one burglary in eight happens when there is someone at home. And in some states, burglary is virtually unknown.\r\nThis petition is to revoke the Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997 and to implement a licensing system similar to the USA, allowing private citizens to own hand and fire hand guns.\r\nThis will bring a whole new revenue stream and market to the UK and help the economy with the firearms industry being worth $32 billion a year in the US, thats a huge cash injection to the UK economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
