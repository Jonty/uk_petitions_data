        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the Government and ATOS to stop making people who have genuine disabilities and illnesses feel like they are criminals for being ill.  Claimants have enough to worry about with their illnesses and disabilities without the added pressure of being made to feel like they are being persecuted and criminalized for not being well.  After all, we are supposed to live in a First World country and not a third world country.  Animals get better treatment.\r\n\r\nThe Government and ATOS should show more compassion.",
