A large majority of the population do not vote in council elections as they do not have time to attend in person or organise a postal vote. If you want to get people involved in our government, please make it easier to partipate. This is particularly important for younger voters who conduct the vast majority of there activities and transactions over the internet. Local councils make a lot of decisions with the local budget and are not representative or democratic at the moment.",
