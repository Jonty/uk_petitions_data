Ever been stuck behind a milk or Sainsbury's wagon doing a legal max of 40 (don't know who dreamt that one up)? Not everyone commutes by motorway. I live on the Wirral and all the  decent roads have already been reduced to 50 or 40 for no good reason. Speed cameras (councils) are the only beneficiaries",
