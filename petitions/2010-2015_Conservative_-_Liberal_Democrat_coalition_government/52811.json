        "additional_details": "Calling for Gifted & Talented to be included as an SEN & therefore receive the same level of funding & support as other SEN children. Having spoken to a wide range of families, it is apparent that these children are not receiving the quality of education that should be available to them. They are under-stimulated, unchallenged & undervalued. They often have sensory disorders, are emotional & become easily disengaged. At present, there is no obligation by schools to cater specifically for these children so schools are not carrying out their duty to 'meet the needs of their pupils'. Many schools have scrapped their G&T Register, due to government cuts & as a result parents are opting to home educate - Putting strain on the family & their finances.\r\n\r\nAt best, these children have the cure for cancer, they are the future Prime Minister, they will achieve great things. At worst, they end up in prison. Bored & underachieving, isolated & misunderstood. So PLEASE help!",
