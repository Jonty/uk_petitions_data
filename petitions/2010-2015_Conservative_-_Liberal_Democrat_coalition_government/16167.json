        "additional_details": "That the greater and more inclusive definition of Britishness is the definition that any Government calling itself a British Government should adopt, and abide by.  This is the geographical definition that by virtue of there being principally two islands of that name forces Britishness equally and unavoidably on English, Irish, Scots, Welsh and assorted others alike.  The lesser and more divisive definition that presently is in use should be abandoned.  It is the creation of Politicians and Clerics amongst others and is the legacy of History and the Imperial Ambitions of the English.  It is the definition that at its most divisive and most offensive equates and confuses Englishness with Britishness. ",
