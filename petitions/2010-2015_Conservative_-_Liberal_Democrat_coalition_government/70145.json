        "additional_details": "Members of the House of Commons,\r\n\r\nWe urge the UK Government, a party to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, to press the Chinese Government to honour its promise of democratic elections to Hong Kong citizens.\r\n\r\nBeijing\u2019s recent decision ruled out a democratic election of the HK Chief Executive, which has made large-scale peaceful protests in Hong Kong inevitable. Police have responded with excessive violence to peaceful, unarmed students and citizens and we fear a second Tiananmen Massacre will happen in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the UK Government has the responsibility to prevent such bloody tragedies from happening. We hereby strongly appeal to the UK Government to make it clear to the Beijing authorities that any effort to crack down on peaceful demonstrations is against human rights and the spirit of the Sino-British Joint Declaration.",
