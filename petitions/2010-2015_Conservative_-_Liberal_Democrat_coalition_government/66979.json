        "additional_details": "The old Greyfriars bus station was closed in March 2014 and was replaced with Northgate bus station where our old fish market used to be. Since its opened there has been two major grid locks in Northampton town centre, causing chaos on public transport & visitors in the town.\r\n This proves that Northgate bus station doesn't work for Northampton & never will.\r\n\r\nThe old Greyfriars bus station despite its criticism of it being dark , ugly & smelly e.t.c. Was the perfect location and we never had any problems with congestion in the town and it done its purpose.\r\n\r\n Action we like the government to take is  we have a brand new bus station which is rebuilt on the old grey friars bus station site. Which was the perfect location for a bus station in town & its connection to the Grosvenor shopping centre. Close Northgate bus station in the process & bring back our old bus station",
