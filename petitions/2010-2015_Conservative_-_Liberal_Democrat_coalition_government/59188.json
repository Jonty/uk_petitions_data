        "additional_details": "When you make purchases online with most companies as soon as you press confirm the money is taken out of your account however a recent big company has stated that the contract we as consumers enter into with companies doesn't start when the money is taken but when the item is dispatched. This is not right. Government should review online consumer\r\n law protecting us the buyer. Either the contract should start as soon as they take our money or they should not take our money until the item is dispatched. Too many online company's are taking money then cancelling orders and not refunding the money back for several days and this needs to stop. We, as the consumer, need to be more protected.",
