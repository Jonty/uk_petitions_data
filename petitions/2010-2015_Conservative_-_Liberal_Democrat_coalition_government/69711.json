        "additional_details": "The immigration policy in the UK is a joke. Again we learn of a foreign immigrant with a murder conviction being freely allowed into our country. This man is now prime suspect in the disappearance of a British girl and was previously a suspect in a sexual assault. Why do we allow people with criminal convictions in to our countr?. This petition calls for the tightening of immigration controls to stop this and the immediate deportation of all foreign criminals.",
