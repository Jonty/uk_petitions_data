        "additional_details": "If we want to stay as an influential country with some power in the world we cant keep cutting our defence budget. The USA will stop working with us and that \"special relationship\" will disappear. With the recent acts of Russia and ISIL we still cut the budget and put our serving men and women under massive pressure and stretch them way too much.\r\n\r\nWith the new cuts that came in 2015, we now have a tank arsenal of just over 200 around 25,000 infantry troops, and 82,000 men in the army. Russia has over 1,000,000 ISIL has 35,000 in Syria and Iraq. If we where to be attacked by ISIL and go into an emergency state we wont be able to control the streets with the army, BECAUSE THERE WONT BE ONE! the government wants Britain to be a safe country, then increase spending on the military!\r\n\r\nWhat i want is to at least have the guarantee that there wont be any more cuts. better yet have an increase in spending in real terms next year.",
