        "additional_details": "Parliament needs to urgently reform the current Family Law. Fathers and Children are discriminated against in the Family Courts at present with the current legislation facilitating the practise of the Mother assuming Residency until the matter is dealt with by the courts. Mothers frequently frustrate the court process and as a result the case can take years to be resolved resulting in Parental Alienation. Shared Care must therefore be automatically introduced from the outset, resulting in a balanced approach to Family Proceedings.",
