        "additional_details": "Pembroke dock is SERIOUSLY lacking the facilities for little ones to play. We have NO play area/park unlike mosts towns & villages in Pembrokeshire. There are 4 swings, 1 slide and a 'new' skate park in  the Memorial garden and i think a childrens activity play area could only benifit the beautiful and safe surroundings. The children from Pembroke Dock Community School use this area as on of their 'off site' visits and it is a shame there is nothing for them to enjoy.\r\n",
