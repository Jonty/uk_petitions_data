        "additional_details": "On the 5th of December 2013 the Rural Market Town of Boston Lincolnshire was affected by tidal surge floods making many houses in the town inhabitable. Local council have stated victims who own properties stated 'All flood victims whose homes are now not habitable will qualify for one month\u2019s exemption from paying council tax on that property. Boston Borough Council continues to pursue central Government for an extension to that initial period. The one-month exemption period begins from the time that flooding made the property uninhabitable. Those moving to temporary accommodation will have to pay council tax for that property. It is the purpose of this considering the current situation that victims of flooded properties should be given a 100% reduction in council tax until such time as they are able to return to their homes.
