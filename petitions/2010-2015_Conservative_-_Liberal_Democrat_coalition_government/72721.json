        "additional_details": "I was diagnosed with the disease Vasculitis in 2011.  Vasculitis is an inflammation of blood vessels causing them to become blocked and end organs to fail or be damaged as a result.\r\n\r\nIt is a lifelong condition which can affect any part of the body, in my case Kidney failure, which has left me with Chronic Kidney Disease.\r\n\r\nPeople with this disease have been affected in different ways.  It has changed my life, and the lives of others with Vasculitis, including leaving many with disabilities and some completely disabled.\r\n\r\nVasculitis requires various medications to keep the disease 'quiet', helps keep us alive and functioning as normal as is possible.\r\n\r\nI would like Vasculitis to be recognised as a serious long term condition and those who have this disease to have free prescriptions.\r\n",
