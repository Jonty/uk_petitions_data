        "additional_details": "Facebook is charging small businesses like my self for every post, photo or share on my facebook business page.\r\n\r\nThis is happeneing to many businesses around the country and is having a major impact on our income forcing many small businesses to close down and ending up without any sorce of income. Even when a payment is made to facebook their are no returns on the investment. I think this is something that needs to be looked at. For instance we paid facebook \u00a330 for 1200 out of 6500 of our fans to see the post with no return.\r\n\r\nI think if facebook want to charge small businesses it should be a small monthly payment rather then for every post.
