LCC want the Coconutters to perform their traditional dances on the pavement and not on the road as it has been performed for 110 years.\r\nOnce again health and safety is the reasons given for preventing a local well loved and historic event taking place. Surely some form of temporary roadside signs, as happens with organised runs informing motorists of the possible hazzard would be suitable solution as the event is already policed as they close the highway for the dances  to take place.\r\n\r\n",
