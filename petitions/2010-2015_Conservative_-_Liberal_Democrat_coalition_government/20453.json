        "action": "Develop UK infrastructure to 'transport' excess water (rainfall) from wet north & west to dry south & east.",
        "additional_details": "The government has proposed major infrastructure projects (e.g HST, 3rd London Airport) to boost UK economic growth.  Weather patterns offer another  major infrastructure investment opportunity the transfer of water from regions with excess rainfall (North & West) to dry areas (East and South).   A 'win-win' project for many reasons including:\r\n\r\n1. Investment is in regions where economic stimulus is needed\r\n2. 'Wet' regions could charge a tariff for water supplied to 'dry' regions\r\n3.  Areas with greatest density of population benefit from secure access to water resources.\r\n4. Agricultural production would benefit, mitigating food inflation and increasing security of food supply.\r\n\r\nImplementation would involve reservoirs, pipelines, in-line pumps and possibly the existing canal-river network (subject to environmental considerations). The government must institute a feasibility study to examine an infrastructure project that should be the subject of wide political and public debate.",
