        "action": "To allow people with diabetes type 1 to join the armed forces",
        "additional_details": "The Armed Forces is the last institution in the UK to have a complete blanket ban on Diabetics joining. Understandably Front line combat situations are unsuitable for people with Diabetes however there are many jobs in the armed forces which are not Front line roles and  could be done by people with Diabetes. The government should remove the blanket ban and assess candidates with diabetes on an individual basis. In the 21st century Diabetic people are more than capable to hold roles such as Intelligence officers in the RAF or Army and on naval vessels where there are medical facilities available. Candidates could sign a waiver acknowledging the risks involved. As I said this is the 21st century and medical technology is getting better and better diabetics are able to handle their self's allot better and after all this is an act of discrimination.",
