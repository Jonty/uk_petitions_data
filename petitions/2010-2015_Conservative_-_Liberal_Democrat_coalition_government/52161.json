        "additional_details": "We  welcome the Government\u2019s efforts to tackle irresponsible dog owners and petition for a continued focus on preventing dogs from attacking both people and other dogs.\r\n\r\nIn recent years there have been several high-profile attacks, including children, the elderly and other dogs. Attacks are often the result of irresponsible owners failing to keep control of their animal which as a result can become a danger to the public.\r\n\r\nThe Government must therefore continue to look at ways the law can be tightened and further dog attacks prevented, including training for dogs and owners.",
