        "additional_details": "Despite original recommendations on the 'Healthy Start' website, the Department of Health has now made it impossible for working mothers that are exclusively breastfeeding to purchase Healthy Start Vitamin Drops for their babies. Now chemists and health visitors will only accept vouchers and not sell the drops. Over the counter vitamins are larger in volume (for the correct dose), are horrible to taste and much more expensive. Current Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health guidelines recommend supplementation. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommend these from birth. We petition that these vitamin drops be made available to purchase for all babies and children.",
