However, many of the papers included questions that were far more difficult than those experienced in previous years. Including questions in the C3 exam (6665) that were not detailed in the specification.\r\n\r\nEither a resit should be provided with a fairer paper, or dramatically reduce the grade boundaries for the exam! University places depend on it!",
