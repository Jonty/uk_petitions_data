        "additional_details": "Cancel the proposed cut in the 50p income tax rate and use the money to restore funding to all those charities which have had funds stopped or cut. The proposed cut in the 50p income tax rate to 45p/40p will only provide an income boost to those who are already very wealthy. Many charities provide essential services to many people and do so very cheaply and efficiently through using unpaid volunteers. If you cut the funding to the charity the volunteers are also lost. Charities will use the money immediately in the UK economy rather than investing it abroad or buying luxury foreign goods as many wealthy people might decide to use this extra money for. ",
