        "additional_details": "The Government should seriously reconsider the granting of an extra day's public holiday at the time of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in light of the UK's dire economic situation. The event could be more appropriately celebrated at the weekend or during the other Bank Holiday at that time. Bearing in mind the outcome for growth of 2011's extra public holiday for the Royal Wedding, it would be economically prudent to forego an extra day's holiday in 2012. This extra day will have the same effect as a one day national strike and will adversely affect both  private and public enterprises as well as individual citizens directly.",
