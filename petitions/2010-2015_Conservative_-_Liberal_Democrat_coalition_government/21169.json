        "additional_details": "Up to a million people are now at risk of starving to death in Somalia.  Aid agencies are finding it almost impossible to get the required aid into the country due to the Shabab militia banning Western aid and often stealing for themselves any aid that does get into the country.\r\n\r\nIf intervention in Libya was justified to protect civilians then why not in this case?  It is well within the power of this country and others to stop these gangsters profiting from the starvation of others, and to allow aid to reach those who need it.\r\n\r\nThere is surely no greater reason for intervention than the prevention of mass starvation of children.  Yet far less was required to convince the UN to sanction intervention in Libya.  It is well within our power to do this, it just needs the political will.\r\n\r\nThe UK should lead a co-ordinated international response to the famine in Somalia now and take the lead in protecting the innocents who require help today.\r\n",
