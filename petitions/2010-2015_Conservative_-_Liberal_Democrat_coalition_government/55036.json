I feel our government has been very laid back with with these people who kill innocents and I feel very strongly that we are bending to the will of the European courts with regard to how we deal with our criminals.\r\nMy proposal would be that if you have been convicted of a capital crime, and sentenced to the Death Penalty the criminal would have 5 years to mount an appeal (this has to be completed within that 5 year period). If unsuccessful then 5 years AND 1 DAY the death penalty is actioned.\r\nIf you feel the same as I do then please sign my petition and ask your friends if they would be happy to sign this as well.\r\nThanks",
