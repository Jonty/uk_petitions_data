        "additional_details": "Our tax chief had secret lunches with Vodafone and Goldman Sachs and then handed them billions in tax breaks \u2013 while keeping Parliament in the dark!\r\n\r\nMPs are outraged, claiming we are owed over 25 billion pounds in back taxes from these and similar dodgy deals. But the tax agency has blocked an inquiry into the scandal and refuses to release any documents to shed light on why these tax breaks were ordered in the first place.\r\n\r\nBy acting together now we can ensure full transparency on the Goldman Sachs and Vodafone deals, and get them to pay the tax they owe. Let\u2019s turn up the heat -- sign this tax justice petition to David Cameron\r\n",
