        "additional_details": "Town centre businesses are under fierce competition from out-of-town shopping areas that provide shoppers with free parking. If town centres are to survive they need to positively encourage shoppers and that also means cars. Parking costs and enforcement is often high priced and off-putting. Sign this petition to have central government lay down fair and sensible rules to local authorities in order to promote a sensible and fair attitude to enforcement of parking offenses and to set appropriate parking charges in our towns. Lower charges and lower fines with warnings and not fines for minor offenses. Fair Play on Parking!",
