        "additional_details": "We call upon the Westminster Parliament to bring forward legislation to enable Her Majesty The Queen to grant a Royal Pardon to Sir William Wallace who was given a show trial at  the pleasure of King Edward 1 of England the Hammer of the Scots. William Wallace was no Traitor as he held no allegiance to England.   He was involved in a war to protect the citizens of Scotland against the murdering king of England Edward 1. We call upon you to put right this wrong and accept William Wallace as a true son of Scotland who fought and died to protect his people.",
