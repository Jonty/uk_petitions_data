        "additional_details": "Stoke-on-Trent City Council is consulting on whether to reduce free nursery class provision from 30 hours a week to the statutory minimum of 15 hours.\r\n  It would affect three and four-year-olds taught in either Stoke-on-Trent's 67 primary schools or six council-run nursery schools.\r\n  From September, parents who want full-time places could be forced to pay for the extra 15 hours themselves.\r\n  The move could help save the authority \u00a31.7 million-a-year from its \u00a311.5 million children's services budget\r\n  But this isn't a big enough saving to justify the impact this will have not only on working families but the children that are raised at home and are in need of education and interacting with other children.\r\n  Help raise as much awareness as possible and take control of our children's futures that nobody can put a price on. Saving \u00a31.7 million could easily be made in other areas with less impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
