Apply the scheme nationally in order to ensure consistency and to protect Jobs and key local services.\r\n\r\nIt is entirely unreasonable to impose reductions on key Council services when the Banks are making Billion pound profits and the underlying cause can be directly attributed to their actions.\r\n\r\nImposing cuts in key services affects people's lives directly from the ordinary workers to the elderly and the most vulnerable members of society. Imposing a local charge on the Banks makes a small dent in their Billion pound profit sheets without the massive negative social impact.",
