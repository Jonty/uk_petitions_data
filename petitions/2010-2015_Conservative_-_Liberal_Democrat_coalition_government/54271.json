        "additional_details": "The upcoming Transparency of Lobbying Bill, Non-Party Campaigning, and Trade Union Administration Bill is dangerous attack on democratic rights and freedoms.\r\n\r\nThis Bill as it stands will not curb excessive lobbying by corporations, and the second part of this bill would impose severe third party spending limits that would make holding the TUC Congress impossible in the run-up to the next general election, and make it extremely difficult for grassroots campaigns, charities and NGOs to criticise government policy and raise effective awareness of important issues such as rising child poverty rates and environmental damage.\r\n\r\nThus, we ask, for the sake of our human rights, that this upcoming Bill be dropped without delay.",
