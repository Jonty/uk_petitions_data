        "action": "Storage of Nuclear Waste in Plymouth",
        "additional_details": "I have just read in horror that the threat of nuclear waste being stored in the Devonport area of Plymouth is still a possibility.\r\n\r\nPlymouth is a densely populated area and a major tourist attraction.  The proposed storage of such highly dangerous material in such close proximity to a major city is beyond belief.  If Plymouth became a \"Nuclear City\" this would not only have a devastating effect on the local economy and prosperity it would also have major health implications for the residents.  Just recall the health issues caused by leaking radiation after nuclear accidents that we have witnessed around the world.   Just because we can't see radiation does not mean it is not there and as we all know it is certainly not safe.\r\n\r\nPlease sing this petition before it is too late.",
