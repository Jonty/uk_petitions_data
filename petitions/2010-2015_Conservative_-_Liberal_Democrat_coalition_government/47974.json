Yes / No\r\n\r\nHe would be required to leave his home and get emergency housing (for a single person) from the council.\r\nApply at the Job Centre for a benefit and survive until they decided if he qualifies.\r\nApply for housing benefit and council tax benefit.\r\nHe must not receive help from family and friends and must live on the \u00a353 for a minimum of 12 weeks, while looking for work.",
