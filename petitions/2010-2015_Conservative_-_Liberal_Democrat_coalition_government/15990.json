        "additional_details": "Why is it that in this Country the democratic decision making stops at the end of an Election.\r\n\r\nIt is becoming harder and harder to trust the Government due to a constant trail of faux pas, and upper class corruption.\r\n\r\nTo prevent this, I propose that from now on, if anything is seen to be controversial then it is democratically voted on before passing. There are numbers of reports showing that Britain would not be at war if the people were balloted on the decision. This is also true in other ares such as benefits, selling contracts to foreign companies and cutting spending for essential services.\r\n\r\nWe live in an age where balloting the people could be simplified by technology, why not embrace this progression and start giving the people their power back!\r\n",
