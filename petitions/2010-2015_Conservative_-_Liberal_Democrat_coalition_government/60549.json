        "additional_details": "In the light of the total failure of the flood protection provision  across the country, there needs to be an early commissioning of a full Public Inquiry into what should have been done in the months after the 2012/13 floods that would have reduced the impact of the 2013/14 floods. Key areas of concern are building control, management of the sea defences, mangement of the waterways and drainage systems. Also could national defence forces such as the Royal Engineers been brought in earlier to work alongside the Environmental Agency and other national agencies and Local Government Departments.",
