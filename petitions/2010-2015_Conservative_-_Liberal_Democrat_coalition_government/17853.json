        "additional_details": "I Propose that people claiming certain benefits should be givern a compulsory drugs test. Its an effective measure to ensure that a person on benefits is infact a productive member of society and not using benefit money to buy illegal drugs. If a person has nothing to hide and is claiming for legitimate reasons then they should have nothing to fear. Benefit money is not there to be used to buy illegal drugs which has been directly linked to funding terrorism, therefore the government should ensure the money they distribute to the less fortunate is not being used to damage the country. This would also assist the police to crack down on the sale of drugs on Britains streets.",
