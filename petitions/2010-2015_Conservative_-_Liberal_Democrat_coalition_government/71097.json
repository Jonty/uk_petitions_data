        "additional_details": "BRODICK is on the Isle of Arran, in the 1970's and 80's much of the sand was removed from the beach for commercial use. The beach has all but disappeared due to coastal erosion, North Ayrshire Council, apart from doing studies on the beach, appear to be doing nothing. Arran Estates who own the beach are also doing nothing, we need action now. We are already in danger of losing 'The Fisherman's Walk' a popular walk along BRODICK, what next, the putting green, golf course? ",
