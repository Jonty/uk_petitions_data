        "additional_details": "FIFA awarded Qatar the right to host the 2022 World Cup, but labourers in Qatar building stadiums needed for the tournament are being exploited in dangerous conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is unacceptable that FIFA continues to turn a blind eye to the plight of thousands of workers. 400 Nepalese workers have died in these conditions.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the government to debate an alternative: for the UK to stage a Non-FIFA alternative World Cup, inviting national teams to the UK in 2022.\r\nBy offering an alternative competition, concerned countries can boycott the Qatar games and send a message to FIFA that nothing justifies abuse.\r\n\r\nOf course, the UK already has the stadiums and infrastructure needed, and experience in hosting international competition.",
