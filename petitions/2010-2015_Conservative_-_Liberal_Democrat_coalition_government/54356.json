        "additional_details": "Currently in the UK Vehicle Tax and Insurance are two separate payments to separate entities, but BOTH are legally required.  The current bizarre systemic disconnection between Tax and Insurance can and has lead to repeated situations whereby one may be Taxed but not Insured or vice-versa.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for a thorough and complete overhaul of the Vehicle Tax System and appropriate legislation, in order to merge both Tax and Insurance into a single payment directly to Financial Institutions.  Thusly, as opposed to the status-quo HM Government would NOT directly collect Vehicle Tax from responsible entities (i.e vehicle owners) but rather from Financial Institutions, who in turn would 'build-in' the Tax charge into the insurance charge (and who would thereby further remunerate HM Government accordingly).\r\n\r\nThis system would offer benefits to all stakeholders, simplify the Tax system, and reduce the risk of having any untaxed or insured vehicles on the road.",
