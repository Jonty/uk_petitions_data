        "additional_details": "When the EU further relaxes the labour market  rules, in particular the UK.. More jobless immigrants will be able to claim benefits under the disguise of being self employed...For example, being big issue magazine sellers.\r\n\r\nThis is an abuse of a legitimate venture to help homeless and struggling to get on their feet. What has happened now is immigrants use this scheme and similar ventures to get access to  tax payers benefits without directly contributing. As their earnings are so low, immigrants are unlikely to contibute to the tax system ever with no intention to move up into better paid work.\r\n\r\nThe rules for such schemes should be changed to allow naturalised citizens of the same EU country to be able to be self employed. Immigrants can be self employed only after a period of 4 or 5 years consistant employment as a tax paying employee..",
