Some of these teachers have worked at their school for over 20 years and never expected to be treated like this.\r\nThe Free School Trustees, the Government, and the local authority must not be allowed to treat loyal employees of Sefton in this manner!\r\nPlease show your support by signing this petition and encouraging others to do so too.\r\n\r\n",
