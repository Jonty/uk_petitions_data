        "additional_details": "In the case of R v Percy 2001, the defendant was convicted under Section 5 Public Order Act 1986 (threatening, abusive, insulting words/behaviour within the hearing/sight of a person likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress) for defacing and standing on an American flag outside a US Air Force Base on UK soil. The defendant appealed against her conviction, which was upheld because the conviction was deemed to be incompatible with Article 10 of the Human Rights Act - Freedom of expression.\r\n\r\nDesecration of a national flag in pursuit of political protest should not be allowed and is an attack on a country's national identity.\r\n\r\nIf you agree, please sign this petition.",
