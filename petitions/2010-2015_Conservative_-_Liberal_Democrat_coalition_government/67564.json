        "additional_details": "Arriva's night bus service currently runs between the hours of 00:25-16:25, providing a safe and cheaper alternative for those getting home from a night out in the city centre, and also those coming home from work in the early hours. But after the Saturday 26th July, individuals will be forced to pay the rising taxi fares to get back the Wirral, some of which will leave them waiting for hours! Arriva are blaming the fact it has now become too costly as less people use the service, though with charging a standard fare of \u00a34 to use the night buses, why not reduce the amount of buses they currently use instead of withdrawing them completely? Please sign and share this petition to encourage Arriva to rethink withdrawing the night buses, and to instead look into alternative solutions to continue ensuring the safety of those coming home from Liverpool in the early hours!
