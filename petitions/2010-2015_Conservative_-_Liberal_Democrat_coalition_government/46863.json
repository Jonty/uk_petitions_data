        "action": "Return free television to hospital patients",
        "additional_details": "At the moment, patients in hospitals that want to watch television at their bedside are having to pay \u00a37.50 a day. Many people cannot afford this.\r\n\r\nPlus as many patients are either too ill and/or drugged up to read a book, magazine or newspaper and the tv is the ideal solution.\r\n\r\nPatients get depressed whilst in hospitals as they spend hours in bed unable to do things. I believe that bringing back free television will reduce time in the hospital and therefore cut waiting lists.\r\n\r\nWhat I am angry about is prisoners get to watch tv for free!\r\n\r\nSo if there is something wrong with your body, you pay and if you did something wrong with the law, you don't!
