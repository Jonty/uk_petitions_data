I myself had scoliosis and my mother found it just because it was so bad. If I was screened growing up then it could of been found sooner and in stead of my two operations I could of had a back brace or physiotherapy.\r\nScreening children means young children may not have to go through major operations when it gets too late to have a brace or to have physiotherapy.
