        "additional_details": "As the episode in history called 'The Highland Clearances' is still like an open wound for many in the UK and abroad, I would hope the government would consider issueing an apology for its part in it.\r\nFor instance the 1746 Act of Proscription, prohibited the traditional wearing of clan tartans and kilts.\r\nThe Tenures Abolition Act 1660 ended the feudal bond of military service by crofters to their chiefs, and the Heritable Jurisdictions Act removed the virtually sovereign power which the chiefs held over their clans. The government's enforcement of the prohibitions varied and often related to the degree of a clan's support during the 1745 Jacobite rebellion. Overall these actions led to the destruction of the traditional clan system and of the supportive social structures of small agricultural townships.Your support and endorsement of this would be appreciated!",
