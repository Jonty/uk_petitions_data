COA gives the Non-EU spouse of EU-National permission to work in the UK, It takes ages to get it and on top of that you can't track the application progress. While the other members of European Union (For example Ireland) issues it within  in 2 weeks and allow you to work while your application is in process. It puts the family on financial risk, where they aren't allowed to work but force to go on public funds. We demand that the EEA2 applications should be processed on no more than 6 months time and COA should be Issued within the 2 weeks on the arrival of application in H.O.    ",
