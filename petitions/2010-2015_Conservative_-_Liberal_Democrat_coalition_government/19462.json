We have to pay to maintain excess conventional power station capacity to bridge the gap when the wind is not blowing.\r\n\r\n3.   Wind is unreliable.\r\n\r\n4. We need cheap reliable energy to enable our industry to compete.\r\n\r\n5. The relaxation in planning regulations will cover our country with wind farms that produce some of the most expensive electricity on the planet.\r\n\r\n6. We will all end up paying through the nose for wind power through higher bills.",
