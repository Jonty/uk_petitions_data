        "additional_details": "A petition to allow students to receive free prescriptions. Currently young people up until the age of 16, or 18 if in full time education are eligible to receive free prescriptions. As well as people over the age of 60 or people on income support. However it seems unfair that a student, who is not earning, would therefore have to pay for prescriptions once they reach the age of 19. The government should therefore consider allowing students and anyone in higher education to receive free prescriptions.",
