        "additional_details": "After working for 6 hours at school, students should be able to get a chance to relax, not have to work late into the night with homework. Homework is completely unnecessary stress that is so easily avoided. Also, teenagers are told over and over that they need exercise but they simply can not fit it in when they are up to their necks in homework. Also, homework isn't very effective anyway because most teens rush their homework to get it all done so they don't take the information in. Homework also leads to less revision time resulting in them not doing their best in exams. As if this is not bad enough, setting homework in the holidays is even worse. Holidays are meant to be a time for rest and relaxation, but how is this possible when they are set lots of homework to do for after the holiday.",
