        "additional_details": "Mammograms are an extremely humiliating, painful and inaccurate way to detect breast tumours.  There are too many false positives and false negatives with the former outnumbering the latter.  Mammography should be replaced with ultrasound or thermography.  Even then women should not be invited and the responsibility place on them to contact their GP's for a referral for an appointment at the nearest hospital or clinic not a mobile unit.",
