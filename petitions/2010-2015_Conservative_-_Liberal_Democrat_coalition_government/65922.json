        "additional_details": "When the new student loans were introduced, it was explained clearly that you would not be discriminated against as they would not be taken into account when applying for mortgages. It appears that once again the young people of this country trying to enhance their education and employment prospects have yet again been let down by the government of this country. It now appears that having a student loan can affect a mortgage application, the government should stick to their promise and not betray these students that have been clobbered with 9k per year charges by money grabbing universities. Legislation should not allow student loans to be taken into account when applying for a mortgage.",
