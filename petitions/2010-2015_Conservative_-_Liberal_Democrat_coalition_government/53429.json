        "additional_details": "Despite DWP regulations, vacancies are often posted offering work of a sexual nature, (for example table top dancing or phone chat) without any age restrictions, and often misleading about the nature of work.\r\n\r\nAt a time where use of Universal Jobmatch is Mandatory there is a high risk people could be forced to apply for these vacancies under threat of benefits being cut.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to re-asses the regulations and training in place within Universal Jobmatch service and do the following:\r\n\r\n1- Add extra regulations and/or monitoring staff to ensure no sex work advertisements are overlooked.\r\n\r\n2- Introduce training for staff approving adverts within the service and frontline staff in centres, to ensure they are equipped to spot sex work vacancies and take necessary action.\r\n\r\n3- Create a \"Red Flag System\" within Universal Jobmatch, so staff and system users can report unsafe adverts for removal.\r\n\r\n",
