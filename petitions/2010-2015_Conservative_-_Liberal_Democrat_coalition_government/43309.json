        "additional_details": "Lee Dagnan, 26 a former Royal Marine, chose to join the Maritime industry working for MAST UK as an armed security guard. On board a vessel in the Indian Ocean Lee contracted Malaria. Lee had been ill for a week on board showing clear symptoms of malaria after 5 days MAST finally made the decision to get medical assistance, at this stage they did not know that Lee had Malaria, this should have been detected as soon as Lee showed flu like symptoms. Lee had several mosquito bites, no one made the connection and the vessel had no form of Malaria screening or  medical equipment, Lee was finally taken to a hospital but was in organ failure and died the following afternoon. These former Royal Marines put their lives on the line to protect these ships but have NO medical support. Every year our country raises millions for Malaria charities. All it takes is a simple prick test. The government must step in and regulate the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
