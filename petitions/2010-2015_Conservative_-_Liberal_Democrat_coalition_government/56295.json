        "additional_details": "The price rises announced by the big-six energy companies are unwarranted and will affect students particularly harshly\r\n\r\nStudents have to be extremely careful with our limited budgets, especially because we want a degree of financial independence and don\u2019t want to be relying on the 'Bank of Mum and Dad\u2019\r\n\r\nEconomically, some students are worse off than pensioners, and the number in fuel poverty will only increase if energy companies are allowed to put up their prices exponentially\r\n\r\nWith tuition fees reaching \u00a39,000 a year, and with energy costs spiralling out of control, the student loan is not covering as much as it used to\r\n\r\nIf students can be exempted from council tax, is a subsidy impossible?\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, request that the Government legislates to:\r\n\r\na) provide students with a subsidy to make gas and electricity affordable commodities on a student budget;\r\nb) exempt students from further price increases which are out of line with inflation\r\n",
