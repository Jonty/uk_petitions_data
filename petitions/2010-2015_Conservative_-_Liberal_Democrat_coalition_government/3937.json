        "additional_details": "We, the British people, call on the Government to not only lower, but cap the ridiculous amount people are paying in energy bills across the country. Gas and energy companies are profiteering in the billions from unfairly and disingenuously soaring prices. As we require energy and gas, especially during the winter months, the Government will leave the British people with no other option but to turn off their heating which will result in more people needing medical assistance (more people will also die). There is absolutely no justification in rising gas and electricty prices when your profits are in the billions, even if the price of gas is rising - it's just greedy, selfless and it's ripping off the British people.",
