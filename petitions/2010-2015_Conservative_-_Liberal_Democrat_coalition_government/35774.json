Tenants and Homeowners are fed up to the back teeth of these Companies bombarding your home with calls at least 5-10 times a day, it is very distressing for a lot of people especially for the  vunerable and the elderly, It is annoying and can be despressing which  should not be allowed in this day and age. We have loads of technology if people want to enquire about these services. We need to STOP them NOW.",
