        "additional_details": "According to published figures there are around 12 million people classed as \"Obese\" in the UK add that to the millions who abuse alcohol and those not eating enough and a huge chunk of the UK are abusing food or drink in some way.\r\n\r\nEven taking this aspect out of the equation everyone in the UK consumes food or drink to some extent and even if someone is not abusing food or drink a better education on what they are putting into their bodies can vastly improve their health both for the present and the future.\r\n\r\nIf those reasons are not enough then think of the follow on benefits to the Hospitals and emergency services.\r\n\r\nFor those reasons it seems a sensible option to me that food and drink education should be much more extensive in our schools to ensure everyone has a basic understanding of what they are consuming.",
