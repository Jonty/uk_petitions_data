        "additional_details": "We believe that the Government must do more to improve access to quality treatment for OCD.\r\n\r\nPeople with OCD will soon have a much greater choice in who they want to provide their care. This can ultimately lead to better treatment. But it is not possible to make a reasonable choice without knowing how successful a treatment centre is.  We believe that;\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe Government should compel all local and secondary care services providers to measure their success in treating people with OCD.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe Government should require the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) to collect and publish OCD treatment outcome data.\r\n\r\nGovernment guidelines on how to treat OCD are not being followed. People with OCD are not being referred onto specialist treatment when local treatment, which is often below standard, has failed. We believe that;\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe Government should compel all Mental Health Trusts to develop and publish a clear OCD treatment pathway.\r\n",
