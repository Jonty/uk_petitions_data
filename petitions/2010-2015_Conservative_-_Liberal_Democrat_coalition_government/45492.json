        "additional_details": "Ian Paisley made the statement during the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill that since same-sex marriage was introduced in Portugal and Spain, the number of heterosexual marriages had declined.\r\n\r\nHe insinuated that this was a causal relationship, blaming same-sex marriage to be the cause of the decline in heterosexual marriages.\r\n\r\nHe was laughed at where the majority of people understand that marriages have been declining over the decades, regardless of same-sex marriage and that there is no evidence of a causal relationship.\r\n\r\nAs someone with the power to represent a large proportion of people, we the undersigned wish for Ian Paisley to educate himself on how causality works by partaking in a suitable educational course. In this way, he can better himself as an able-minded invididual and make more informed statements in the future to prevent such twistings of the truth.",
