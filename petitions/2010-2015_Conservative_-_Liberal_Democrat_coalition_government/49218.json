The ONLY reason they wish to retain Sterlling in any independent Scotland is that it will give them access to the UK taxpayer take when it all goes wrong in the new Scotland.  OUR GOVERNMENT MUST NOT AGREE TO ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING APPROVAL FROM THE PEOPLE WHO WILL HAVE MOST TO LOSE IF IT GOES WRONG, THE UK TAXPAYER, THROUGH A LEGALLY BINDING REFERENDUM.",
