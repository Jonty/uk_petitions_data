        "action": "PAUL'S PETITION, covering an urgent review and enquiry into self-regulation of solicitors",
        "additional_details": "I want the government to urgently review the self-regulation of Solicitors. In 2009 I made a complaint against a solicitor regarding my later father's estate through the Law Society's recognised system. The LCS advised me before I made my complaint that I would not be liable for any costs. My losses are now in excess of \u00a3129,000. We are being forced into selling our house to meet the solicitor's costs. The system of self-regulation has not been fit for purpose for a long time. There are flaws in UK law and the code of conduct. Certain activities are not properly regulated. Consumers are not adequately protected by the SRA. The court did not even consider whether my complaint was justified or not in reaching its decision. The Law Society's record in handling complaints about its members is abysmal. I ask you to support my local MP, the Hon Simon Danczuk MP, in this matter. I want my case thoroughly investigated and remedial action taken to ensure that solicitors are properly regulated.",
