I do appreciate the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)which UK government subscribe to and implemented equally, I gave you credit for that.\r\nThe UK government need to be very strict in order to achieve a robust result in dealing with this terrorist. These terrorist are very stubborn and adamant with their evil heart. Therefore UK government need a draconian law to reduce or halt terrorist in the UK.\r\nMany of these evil agent intentionally committed this severe crime, because they knew UK law is very lenient, they can go away with it. We don't know the mission of these evil agent because they act indiscriminately nowadays globally.That is why I suggested that the there should be \"No benefits for their widows may be this may help to stop or reduce terrorist in the UK.\" ",
