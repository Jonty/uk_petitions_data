        "additional_details": "Food portions are excessive.  At the cinema a regular popcorn & drink may cost \u00a36.60 but \"go large for 55p\" & \"go XL\" offers exist.  The value-for-money appeal of food bulk buy offers contributes to obesity & waste.\r\n\r\nFood portions at all outlets should be calorie, sugar & fat counted and the counts displayed prominently & on menus.  Then the consumer can choose an item, knowing its beneficial, harmful or excessive content.  All relevant food outlets should offer a main course portion of less than 400 calories & a starter (inc. snacks) or dessert (inc. ice cream / sweets) of less than 200 calories.\r\n\r\nFood portions, incl. fast food, meal deals, 2 for 1, BOGOF & BOGOHP should be regulated.  The same applies to bulk buys of alcohol \u2013 ban them altogether because they encourage binge drinking.\r\n\r\nEnd discrimination by value-for-money of portion sizes.  Allow proportional prices only.\r\nDEFRA to provide suitable regulation legislation & enforcement.",
