        "additional_details": "There is a need to revisit the age old debate regarding school holidays and take swift action to distribute them more evenly throughout the year. Thirteen weeks holiday from school is beneficial for children and young people as many need the break at the end of each term - I do not propose reducing them. Distributing them more evenly throughout the year will ensure regular breaks for the children and reducing the lengthy 'summer holiday'. At the end of such a long break from school, many children are anxious about returning - particularly the younger children or those changing schools. Shorter breaks between terms would reduce the level of anxiety for many children and reduce the amount of regression in level of ability at the start of a new academic year. Please reconsider changing the distribution and length to shorter, more frequent holidays throughout the year. ",
