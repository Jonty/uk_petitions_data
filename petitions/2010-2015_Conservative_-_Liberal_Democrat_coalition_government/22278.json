Because of this people often find themselves without vital drugs that could potentionally help them. This is morally wrong as why should certain counties be provided with the medication and others not?\r\nWhy can't drugs that are proven to work be available everywhere?\r\n\r\nYes, the cost can seem expensive, however in the long term, with successful drugs available to all, hospital admissions could be lowered, saving the Goverment money in the long term.",
