No one could have predicted the social impact  of these Olympics but we must  urgently seize the opportunity to safeguard this national asset of pride and well being. This is not just the Park, but the memories of success and motivation that it has delivered, uniquely providing potentially a real, tangible and valuable change to our society for the future and safeguarding the park itself, will maintain those memories for generations. Its a do it or loose it moment.\r\n",
