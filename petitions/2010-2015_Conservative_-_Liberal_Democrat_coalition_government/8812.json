Currently, the allowance is below the minimum wage, but in many cases people are doing the equivalent of full-time hours or more.\r\n\r\nMany carers believe that they do not get enough money to live on, even when you consider any additional benefits.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the Carers Allowance should equal the minimum wage and the review should look at all ways to make this possible.",
