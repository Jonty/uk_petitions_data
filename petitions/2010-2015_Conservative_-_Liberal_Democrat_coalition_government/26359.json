        "additional_details": "We urge the government to reform the current requirement for a HMO licence when renting a property in Scotland.\r\n\r\nSince the law was introduced in the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, house and rental prices have greatly increased meaning more young people, students, etc opt for flat-sharing with friends with whom they aren't related.\r\n\r\nDue to the requirement of the licences and the costly sum to obtain one, many landlords do not bother which means choices are limited when a group of friends are house hunting.\r\n\r\nWhilst we acknowledge that the law is in place for public safety we believe it needs to be reformed to allow greater choice and competition in the rental market.\r\n",
