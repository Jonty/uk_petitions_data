        "additional_details": "The government is currently concerned about council house tenants living in houses that they feel are too big for their needs.  At the same time the public is concerned about the money being paid to MPs for their second homes.  Obviously MPs with constituencies outside London do need help with accommodation in London so why not provide them with accommodation in council households, within a reasonable distance of Westminster, that have been identified as having spare rooms. Providing that the tenant and MP are willing to share?\r\n\r\nThe benefits would be a saving for the tax payer, free accommodation in London for the MP and the tenant gets to stay in a community where they have built up family and social ties (this government recognises the importance of family and community ties) and at the same time MPs may develop more empathy and understanding for the more disadvantaged communities in this country.\r\n",
