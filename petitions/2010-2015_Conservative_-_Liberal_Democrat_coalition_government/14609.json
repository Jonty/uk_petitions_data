After school clubs etc paper over the cracks in a poor system - if schools opened 8:30 - 17:30 there should be a positive effect on the economy. I'd combine this with shorter terms and shorter summer holiday to stop parents being ripped off by travel firms. The only obstacle I can see is the industrial muscle of teachers - but real advantages for parents and family life.",
