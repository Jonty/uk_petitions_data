        "additional_details": "On Friday 11th May 2012, six children were killed in a house fire in Derby, which was deliberately started when an accelerant (petrol) was poured through the letter box of their house.\r\n\r\nThis is not the first time that innocents, mostly children, have died from letter box arson.\r\n\r\nThe retrofitting of a secure letter box, which can rule out introduction of liquid accelerants through a letterplate without disrupting mail delivery, should be considered compulsory. This would provide a cost-efficient and practical solution to the problem.\r\n\r\nDespite the current presumption by the Department for Communities and Local Government that letterplate security is optional, the majority in the UK need to adequately address this problem and government regulation is required.",
