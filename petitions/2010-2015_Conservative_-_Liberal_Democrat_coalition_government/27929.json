        "additional_details": "In the current economy the new Housing Benefit rates are unrealistic, unjust and will leave many people in serious debt and/or facing homelessness.\r\n\r\nThis is not about \"lazy bums who can't be bothered to work\" this is about the effect these changes are having on Disabled people who CANNOT work, families on low incomes and the everyday working class person who has just been made redundant or had to take a pay cut in order to keep their job.\r\n\r\nCutting Housing Benefit WILL NOT push down the cost of private rents it will just push people further into hardship and in this current economy is, frankly, ridiculous.\r\n\r\nOnly 30% of all privately rented homes are \"affordable\" to those on Housing Benefit and under the new rules people will be forced to move into unsuitable accommodation just to pay the rent.\r\n\r\nThe Government should tackle their concerns about unaffordable rent by capping private rents not capping Housing Benefit.\r\n\r\nWe should not be made to suffer for the Bankers\u2019 failings!\r\n",
