        "additional_details": "It is looking increasingly likely that e-liquid sales will be banned in the forthcoming EU Tobacco Directive rewrite.\r\nSuch a ban is entirely corruption-based since it is directly opposed to the best interests of public health: it removes consumers\u2019 rights to safer tobacco-like consumption modes that are proven successful. The only alternatives will be pharma products that are expensive and proven unsuccessful (they have a 95% failure rate when averaged out). Therefore it can be seen that a ban on e-cigarettes (or a core component such as the refill liquid) must have been obtained by bribery. This comes as no surprise as we have recently seen the financial motives that EU health committee members are driven by.",
