The BBC reported gridlock, large numbers of accidents, some involving pedestrians, and road closures (from http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-21022971). Anecdotally, car journeys were taking about 6 times as long as usual.\r\n\r\nNorthern Europe does not seem to suffer these same indignities. Over there it's a legal requirement to fit winter tyres during the colder months.\r\n\r\nThe government could help this situation by mimicking what works elsewhere, and do at least one or more of the following:\r\n\r\n- Require winter tyres fitted to all vehicles driving on snow or ice.\r\n\r\n- Make it an offence to drive on snow or ice without suitable tyres.\r\n\r\n- Legally void insurance when the vehicle in an accident was driven on snow or ice without suitable tyres.\r\n\r\n- Create incentives for the use of winter tyres, e.g. negotiating lower insurance premiums, or offering grants or tax breaks to help people buy winter tyres and rims.\r\n",
