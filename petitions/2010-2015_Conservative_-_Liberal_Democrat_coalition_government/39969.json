No longer should we as a decent law abiding citizens have to tolerate the acts of these individuals, if you take a life then you forfeit your own. The victims of these crimes can no longer speak for themselves; it is our duty to make sure that the perpetrators of these heinous crimes receive a right and just punishment; so that we can all rest assured that these perpetrators cannot return to commit further abominable acts on our society.\r\n",
