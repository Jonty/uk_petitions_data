A Fine? The death of a child?\r\n\r\nThe UK government needs to get TOUGHER on these people, this is no longer acceptable, and we the people 'DEMAND IMMEDIATE CHANGE'.\r\n\r\nWe the people ask the UK government to;\r\n1) Change in policy to improve signage outside all schools in the UK.\r\n2) NEW revised TOUGHER penalties for offenders.\r\n3) Installing of CCTV outside schools that can facilitate in the prosecution of offenders.\r\n4) Increased fines and points on their licence\r\n5) Offenders to attend a NEW, Community Road Safety Session (CRSS) - where the offenders attend a minimum of hours, and learn why it is ILLEGAL.\r\n\r\nWe the people DEMAND immediate change.\r\nWe the people trust that our government WILL protect our children from death.",
