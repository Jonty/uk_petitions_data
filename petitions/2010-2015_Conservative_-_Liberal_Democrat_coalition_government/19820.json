Releasing such criminals into the society after only a few years is counter-productive and does grave injustice to the victims. The European Convention on Human Rights forgets that the protection of prisoners' human rights should only reach out to criminals who do not commit such crimes against humanity, such as rape, sex trafficking, murder and paedophilia. Along with terrorism these crimes should also be dealt with seriously. If the government is concerned about the safety and dignity of the women, children and the general public of Britain, then the government must cease to abide by the European Convention on Human Rights.",
