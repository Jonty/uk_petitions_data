It has been brought in that NHS bosses can now be prosecuted for bad decisions especially with bad outcomes - this should be the same for the people setting parole, as they JUST might think twice. How many people are re-offending when let out on parole, when they are still clearly a danger.\r\nWhy should the public have to suffer the consequences, when they don't have to be held responsible for their decisions.",
