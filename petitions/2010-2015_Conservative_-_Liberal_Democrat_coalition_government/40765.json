        "additional_details": "The Government must URGENTLY set aside a 'pot' of lottery funding and allow NHS departments required to bid for contracts in order to operate under the 'new' system, to draw on it in order to repay their portion of their PCT's debt. They will therefore be able to submit bids on a level playing field with their private sector competitors. If bidders are being awarded contracts solely on price, with no consideration of excellence and expertise built up over time being taken into account, private sector providers, some with no experience and some from abroad, but with no debt, will win, The British taxpayer will then be increasing the incomes of more Chief Executives and shareholders, some from abroad.\r\nHelping the NHS departments to win bids will help reduce the fragmentation of the health service and prevent expertise, knowledge and networks of good practice being lost.",
