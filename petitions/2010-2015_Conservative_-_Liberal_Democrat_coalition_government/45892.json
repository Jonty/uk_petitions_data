        "additional_details": "PETITION TO REMOVE THE CURRENT LAW ON DOUBLE JEOPARDY.\r\nAfter many years the law relating to double jeopardy was repealed and replaced with a rewrite, allowing a person previously acquitted of a serious crime to be retried, on finding new evidence.\r\nThis change was campaigned for by families who had lost loved ones.\r\nSadly the new legislation is vastly unworkable, hense very few will be retried.\r\nWe are asking for a review and rewrite of certain parts of the Act to make it more usable and fair.\r\nAt the time a Home Office spokesman said: \"It is important the public should have full confidence in the ability of the criminal justice system to deliver justice.\r\n\"This can be undermined if it is not possible to convict offenders for very serious crimes where there is strong and viable evidence of their guilt.\"\r\nPlease sign this petition.",
