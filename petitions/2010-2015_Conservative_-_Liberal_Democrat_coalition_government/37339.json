This way of voting would (if secure) engage with the public be much cheaper that having MP's and costly voting days.\r\n\r\nThis way of voting could be used to knit whole groups of decision together and so give a better understanding of what the public WANT and not governments own interpetation - which usually is way of the mark.\r\n\r\nThe BBC did a web page last year asking what departments spend could be so as to balance the books - nice if implemented too.",
