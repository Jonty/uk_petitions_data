        "additional_details": "This petition is submitted in order to introduce a 'none of the above' option on ballot papers in all local and parliamentary elections. In a true democracy the people's views and opinions must be expressed as accurately as possible. In recent years we the people have become increasingly disillusioned in current party politics, and don't feel we are being represented properly. Including a 'none of the above' option on the ballot paper would force MP's to really work hard and engage their constituents, and allow people to show if they are unhappy with the limited choices that have been offered to them. If MPs truly feel they have the support of their constituents then there is no reason why they wouldn't want to see a 'none of the above' option on the ballot paper.",
