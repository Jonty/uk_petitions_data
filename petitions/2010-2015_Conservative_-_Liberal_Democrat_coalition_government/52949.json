        "additional_details": "Due to the government extending school leaving age, the freedom bus pass stops at year, so parents have to pay \u00a3520 a year rather then \u00a3100. Even if you are on benefits, the minimum you pay is \u00a3260 and this is in a lump sum. I propose an extension until pupils are legal allowed to leave school or compulsory training.",
