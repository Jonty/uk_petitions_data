Stop inequalities such as Free Tuiton fees for Scottish only students and free prescription charges for the Irish, Welsh and Scots only. All fees /charges should be the same in all UK countries. No one nation should subside another to the detriment of that nation. England is currently subsiding the Irish, Welsh and Scots.\r\n\r\nThe Barnett formula is a mechanism used by The Treasury in the United Kingdom to adjust the amounts of public expenditure allocated to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales automatically to reflect changes in spending levels allocated to public services in England, England and Wales or Great Britain, as appropriate.\r\n\r\nBarnett himself has called for a review of its long term viability\r\n",
