        "additional_details": "Religious schools can continue to include R.E. in the curriculum. However, R.e. should no longer be compulsory in secular schools, and a more practical, targeted, thorough and realistic way of teaching people what is expected of them is needed. A basic grounding in what is expected of someone as a member of society should be covered in more specific detail in schools. The basic way the law works, some of the common rights and duties of a person should be covered, so that people grown up better knowing what is generally accepted as right and wrong according to law. This will reduce the number of offences that take place out of ignorance and lack of education. Respect for others and an understanding of belief, spirituality/ religion and multiculturalism should also be taught. In ethics, both Platonic virtue and deontological ethics (such as the golden rule) can be debated in schools.",
