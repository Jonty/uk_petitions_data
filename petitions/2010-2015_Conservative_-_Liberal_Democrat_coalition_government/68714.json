        "additional_details": "The lightning process is an alternative treatment for conditions such as Depression, anxiety, OCD, ME, MS, and low self esteem. The program has 81% of its patients feeling it helped them to get over their condition. In one clinic, it costs \u00a3650 per patient for the full 3 day course. Compared to the cost of anti-depressants or counselling it is a cost effective option. We believe it should be funded by the NHS.",
