        "action": "UK to give up its seat at the UN Security Council because the Government is not prepared to allocate sufficient resources to its Armed Forces",
        "additional_details": "The continuing cuts in our Armed Forces and 13 years of Labour Government under funding of our forces to properly carry out the tasks asked of them, in contrast to the large increases in funding to other Goverment Departments. Again our Government is quite prepared to keep commiting our forces to overseas adventures but not prepared to maintain sufficient size Army,Navy or Air Force to carry out what is asked of them.  If we cannot afford to fund our Armed Forces or do not want too, than we should give up our seat on the security council to another nation who is prepared to do so.  Main reason we have for being on the Security Council is our willingness to deploy our forces around the world, that is assuming we have the size and equipement to keep doing this, certainly it is not our  economic might.",
