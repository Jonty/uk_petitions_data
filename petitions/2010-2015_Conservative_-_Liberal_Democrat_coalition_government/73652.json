        "additional_details": "I am a mother to an 11 month old baby boy. I have had to book a handful of Drs appointment over the past 2 months due to him being very poorly with ear, chest and throat infections.\r\n\r\nI feel that the systems in place for booking appointments is unfair to young children. The sit and wait surgeries is not the environment for a sick baby and possibly having to wait hours to see a Dr ??? If you ring then all the appointments are taken? Having a call back from the Dr is not always sufficient enough as I find it hard for an illness to be diagnosed over the phone.\r\n\r\nAs a mother who is with their child 247 you know when they are not well and when calpol won't cure it.\r\n\r\nI feel that better systems need to be reviewed and put into place and exceptions made when it involves very young babies who are unable to communicate their needs and need medical attention. I feel having to wait 7 1/2 hours to see a Dr with a very distressed baby is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",
