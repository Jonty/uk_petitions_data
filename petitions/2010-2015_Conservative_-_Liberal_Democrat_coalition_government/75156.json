Something must be done.\r\n\r\nThis petition has one aim \u2013 to reduce that death toll by training young people to understand road safety and hazard perception at a younger age.  This life-saving training should begin at school as a part of every child\u2019s curriculum.\r\n\r\nResearch shows that road safety messages are better absorbed by children in their early teens. Pilot studies in Europe show a 40% reduction in accidents for those who train at school. In the UK, independent research on pre-17 driving lessons shows that pupils have 50% less accidents.\r\n\r\nThe Government should support this overwhelming body of evidence and by signing this petition you can help force a House of Commons debate. We don\u2019t want to change the driving age \u2013 only the age we start teaching children how to drive safely.\r\n\r\n100,000 signatures could help save 400 precious lives each year.\r\n",
