        "additional_details": "As of July 2015 Hectors house nursery in east kilbride will be closin,  the nursery is baser on the hmrcouch building.  I am asking people to think about children's future,  there Education and friendships that the children already there have built.  The nursery is an amazing place for the kids and their development I myself have a son there who has come along way since staring the nursery. Not only will the girls at the nursery be out a job but the little ones will have nowhere to go which for most full time working parents isn't ideal,  this petition is more for the kids though.  all I am asking is that you take a few minutes out your day to sign the petition and make sure these kids still have this amazing place where they can learn and socialise",
