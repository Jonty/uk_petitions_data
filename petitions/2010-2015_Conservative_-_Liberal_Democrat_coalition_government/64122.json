        "additional_details": "It is currently illegal in the UK to allow the use of a Segway on the road or on the pavement.\r\n\r\nThis is because it is classed as a powered vehicle, plus isn't deemed safe for use on roads.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, why are mobility scooters allowed? Accidents occur due to the use of mobility scooters, so inevitably accidents will occur if a Segway is used.\r\n\r\nHow is a mobility scooter allowed if a Segway is not?\r\n\r\nEither ban one, or allow the other!",
