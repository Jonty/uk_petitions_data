In my view United Kingdom voters deserve as much information as possible on each of the political parties in order to be better informed when making there vote in the general election this year. The TV debates now form an inportant part of modern electioneering, they open up the traditional westminster parties to the people they represent whilst shining a light on all the alternative parties adding more information and choice thus enhancing our democracy.
