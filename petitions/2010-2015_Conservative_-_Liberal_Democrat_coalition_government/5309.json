        "additional_details": "I would like to see the NHS service have policy dictated to it by a cross party committee. No longer should tax payers money be wasted by constantly changing policies. If we want the NHS to be run effiecently then there needs to be some consitency in its management. No other organisation can have its direction and ideals changed every 4-8 years. The amount of money wasted on new white elephant policies which achieve little, simply so Labour and the Conservatives can play one upmanship on each other and use the NHS solely as an election manisfeto winner is disgusting. This money should be going on effective frontline services. This is peoples lives that the politicians are putting at jeopardy simply to try and come up with a new way to win an election.",
