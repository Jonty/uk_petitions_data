        "additional_details": "politics in the UK is accessable to a select few, those with private wealth in small circles and those with connections to the premier schools and universities. I propose an enormous constitutional reform, a seperate executive from the legislature in a further seperation of powers. Each would have checks and balances on the other. The executive would come in the form of a singally elected president which would propose legislation to parliament. It will give the electorate the choice to elect someone who represents them as running will actually return a person individual power, rather than a party run process where the whips run parliament and people vote on a basis of \"anyone but tory \". Of course this would require the introduction of a codified constitution but that is an entirely new argument. ",
