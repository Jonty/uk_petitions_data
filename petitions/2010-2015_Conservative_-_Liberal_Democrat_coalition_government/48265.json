        "additional_details": "Free health tourism to the world, costing us the tax payer, billions. Why are we subsidising the rest of the world with their health problems, when we cannot even look after our own people properly. We are borrowing billions, to which some of this money goes to pay for the treatment of health tourists, which will have to be paid back! With interest. How difficult is it to say, no guarantee of payment before treatment, no treatment. Mr Cameron why are you continuing to let this fraud go on. You are trying to save money, so why not start with stopping this generosity. Perhaps if you really understood just how much the rest of the world is Laughing at us and Your Government you would stamp it out now. Start thinking about what more you can do to put this country (yours too!) back on its feet, than your own importance abroad! Try getting free health care anywhere else in the World, especially in America.",
