        "additional_details": "Appleby Horse Fair has been held since 1750, It's a gathering of Gypsies, celbrating their interest music, business, history and buying/selling horses\r\n\r\nHorses are displayed in an un-organised fashion often leading to severe injuries\r\n\r\nThe Appleby Horse Fair website claims they traditionally wash horses in the river Eden but this is not the case. They brutally submerge horses against their will under water. This is distressing to horses, physically cruel, and mentally traumatising. Riders are inconsiderate to horse welfare, and use their full body weight to push the horse deep into the water. In 2007 a horse drowned.\r\n\r\nThe Appleby Horse Fair's cruel actions are protected A Royal Charter granted in 1685. It is out of date as animal welfare laws have been majorly updated in this century\r\n\r\nThe Royal Charter needs to be amended. The UK cannot justify ignoring the situation whilst enforcing better animal welfare on other issues with modern laws\r\n\r\n",
