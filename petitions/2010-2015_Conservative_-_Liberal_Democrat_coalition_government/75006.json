        "additional_details": "Every British Citizen should have the right to a vote, but I do not believe that everyone should be allowed to vote.\r\nI am referring to Ignorant voters.  These are those who vote with no real knowledge of who or what they are actually voting for. For instance - 'All my family vote xxx so I will to', 'I don't know who my local candidate is, but I am voting xxx', or similar.  If you are just voting out of habit or with ignorance then that is wrong.\r\nI am for a voting system whereby in order to be allowed to vote you MUST first understand who you are voting for, and what each candidate is proposing.  My ideas is that a number of meetings should be held in the community prior to voting day, in which each candidate can make a presentation on their policies, with a Q&A session after. Any one wishing to vote should have to attend at least one of these meetings.\r\nThis system will also help to reduce the influence of media coverage and monetary factors in politics.",
