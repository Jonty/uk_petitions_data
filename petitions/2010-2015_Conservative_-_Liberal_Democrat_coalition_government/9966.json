So for decades of our working lives, ( I was born in 1956) we were expecting  something and now we are told women will be getting their pensions later and so will men. Surely that would make sense if you told them that at the start of their working lives, at 16 or 18 or 21 or whatever, not nearing 50. It seems unjust to tell us all so late.",
