        "additional_details": "I believe it is high time our archaic parliamentary whip system came under scrutiny. This whip system has for far too long blighted British politics and created a democratic deficit that needs addressing.\r\n\r\nOur MPs are elected by the people and should therefore serve their constituents first and foremost and not their career plans. This is of course not their fault, there are limited by the interest of their political party and are often required to blindly toe the party line in order to ensure selection in the next general election. Your job or a vote, who would like that decision? A  review of the parliamentary whip system and a serious informed debate over abolishing the system, could stop disillusionment both within Westminster and in the wider public realm and also enhance the democratic accountability of our nation, while also allowing British politics to become more transparent and accountable to the general public.
