        "additional_details": "If a person thinks that they need to go to hospital for something that isnt a 999 call, then they should ring NHS direct first. If NHS believe that the symptoms are worthy of a hospital visit, then you are given a code that is logged at NHS direct which you tell to the hospital along with your details to stop you having to pay. If they believe you should go to your G.P then you can either go to the G.P having taken their advice, OR go to hospital anyway against their advice and pay charges like other countries have to. This will not only save our country a LOT of money but also create more jobs at NHS direct to take the demand of the calls, and people who are genuinly ill will get more time spent looking after them. WE CAN SAVE MILLIONS DOING IT THIS WAY, AND THOSE PEOPLE YOU SEE IN HOSPITAL WASTING DOCTORS TIME WITH A SLIGHTLY ITCHY TOE WILL THINK TWICE ABOUT BEING THERE, AS THEY WONT WANT TO PAY!\r\n\r\n",
