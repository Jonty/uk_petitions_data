        "additional_details": "We call on the government to immediately ban the use of electric shock collars on dogs and other animals across the UK. A ban has already been introduced in Wales, with pet owners facing a fine of up to \u00a320,000 or six months in prison if they are caught using the devices, so why is the rest of the UK lagging behind?\r\n\r\nThese collars are inhumane and cruel and have no place in modern animal training.",
