It is our primary source for communicating and sharing information with friends, family and colleagues around the world.\r\n\r\nWe feel that if you shut down Facebook on March 15th, it will irreparably impact our lives. We can't imagine life without Facebook!\r\n\r\nWe know it is a stressful time for you, providing a service for over 500 million users in over 70 languages, but you have built something beautiful something bigger than all of us.\r\n\r\nWe believe that Facebook is the embodiment of freedom of expression and democratic principles; it is a giant leap for mankind.\r\n\r\nWe join together in this petition to let you know that we are grateful for all you have done and to demonstrate the support that exists for Facebook.\r\n\r\nWe are certain that you can find a way to continue the service - you must, and we will be there to support you.\r\n\r\n",
