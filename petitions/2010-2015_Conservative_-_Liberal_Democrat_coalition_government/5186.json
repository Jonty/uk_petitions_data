On most stretches (Like dual carriages) HGV's/LGV's should be made to stay in the inside lane.  This would cut the number of near/accidents where most HGV's/LGV's indicate and pull out at the same time making faster moving traffic behind to slowing quickly and therefor causing either near misses/accidents or delays by shock wave traffic jams.  The Uk needs to adopt the european sensible approach to HGV's/LGV's on the road network ",
