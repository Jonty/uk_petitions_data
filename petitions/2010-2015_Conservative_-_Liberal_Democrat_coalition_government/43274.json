I travel to work on their trains off peak yet they are always overcrowded. I get on at East Croydon and very rarely get a seat until London Bridge!!! They run short 4 carriage trains when they really need 8 or even 12 carriage trains.\r\n\r\nThe trains themselves are dirty, old and decrepit, the seats are falling apart, the toilets are disgusting and there is no adequate storage space for bicycles they have to be lent up against seats which is just not acceptable in 2012!
