Sentencing for such offences does little to deter the mistreatment of animals.\r\nIf we are a humane society the sentencing for deliberate cruelty and death of wild and domestic animals needs to be increased. It is proposed that such sentencing should reflect the sentencing for similar offences caused  to humans.\r\nThis is not intended to threaten legitimate control and pursuits as recognised in law, but recognised illegal and depraved acts.",
