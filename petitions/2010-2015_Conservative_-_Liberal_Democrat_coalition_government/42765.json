Listeners will no longer enjoy Duncan Warren and Joy, fun, great music, the Hall of Fame, charity event news, interviews and phone ins, both local and from around the world, and vital updated travel and weather news\r\nCutting costs should be found elsewhere and the very ethos of what is good for our community should not be destroyed by the BBC with more national broadcasting from Leeds.\r\nReview and change this misguided decision. Sign this petition and show 'why 20,000 Cornishman know the reason why'. We can march by signing now!",
