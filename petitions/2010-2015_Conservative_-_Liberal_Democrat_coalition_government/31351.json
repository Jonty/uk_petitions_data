Cancer patients are denied treatment as it's to expensive! A sex change or breast enlargement to name but a few are all elective! You could argue mental health but if that is the case then people having to pay prescription charges can claim undue mental strain due to said charge! What I'm aiming for is FREE prescriptions to those requiring medication for a life long illness and for sex changes etc to be paid for by the person wanting it! no more funding for these, the NHS can no longer afford it.
