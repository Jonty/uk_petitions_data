The OBR currently predicts growth of 0.8% this year, and 2% in 2013.\"\r\n\r\nWe must slow down the pace of the cut backs, and increase the amount of investment, so we can get more people into employment, then putting them on the dole queue!\r\n\r\nI urge this Government to Take immediate action, to slow down the pace of cuts, and increase investment\r\n\r\n",
