People must be able to access healthcare equally. Therefore I want to make it compulsory for all health care outlets (doctors, dentists, hospitals, NHS branches) to accept appointments via email. This would increase the access that deaf and hard of hearing people have to health care services.\r\n\r\nI want to government to make this a mandatory rule for any health care service that requires an appointment. I want everybody to be able to access health care equally. I want the government to employ/train staff to be able to check emails regularly  and to respond accordingly. I want appointments to be made via email for people who cannot access the telephone with reason.",
