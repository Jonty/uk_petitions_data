        "additional_details": "It has been announced that journalists and media representatives will have exclusive salons, bars, shops and other luxurious trappings during the London Olympics.  This is  something which was not expressed in the the plans seen by the public.\r\nWhy should journalists have access to luxurious facilities - whilst those actually paying for tickets will be herded around like cattle.  I propose that exclusivity be removed and that these facilities be made available to all ticket holders - and only the actual reporting/media positions be exclusive - and not the salons, bars, pubs, clubs, shops and restaurants.\r\nTicket payers should not finance pampering for journalists and media people.  It is not right.",
