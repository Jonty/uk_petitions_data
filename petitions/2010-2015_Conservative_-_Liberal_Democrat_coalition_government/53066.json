        "additional_details": "While acknowledging the achievements of Winston Churchill I believe that using Churchill's image on the next \u00a35 note sets a dangerous precedent. Churchill was not elected unanimously, neither was he universally loved. Like all politicians he was paid to do a job and did that to the best of his ability, but like all politicians his leadership attracted divided opinion. Britain has a long heritage of brilliant scientists, artists, musicians, entertainers, writers, explorers and social reformers, all of whom would be universally welcomed on to our national currency.",
