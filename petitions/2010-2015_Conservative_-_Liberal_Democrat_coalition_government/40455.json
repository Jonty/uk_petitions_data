        "additional_details": " It is really stupid and idiotic for a government like you to allow Scotland people to have such a referendum.\r\n\r\nCan you see how Hong Kong people are living? Hong Kong people are so longing for British colonial rule. To them, it is a prestige and glory to be able to be ruled by the Majesty Queen Elizabeth. After the 1997 collapse of Hong Kong to the most evil, heinous and illegal China, Hong Kong has been on the decline and human rights are violated. Even Hong Kong people would like to return back the Britain. Now, you allow Scotland to get independence? You must be joking! Remember that in the last century how the British colonized so many places on Earth? Remember the glorious state of ruling so many lands? Where is the British Empire which used to be so great, so admirable, so marvelous and so prestigious?\r\n\r\nIt is urgent and necessary that you ban the so-called \u201creferendum\u201d on Scottish independence, which must be ceased at all costs!!!
