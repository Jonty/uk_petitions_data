        "additional_details": "Air travel safety standards for infants (under 2 yrs.) are lower than for adults.  The UK Government should ensure infants always travel in their own seat secured in an appropriate restraint, e.g. car seat.\r\n\r\nThe EU's European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) study (http://easa.europa.eu/rulemaking/docs/research/Final%20Report%20EASA%202007.C.28.pdf) shows safety standards are unacceptable, the evidence exists and recommendations on the changes required are already made.\r\n\r\nCurrently infants are \u201crestrained\u201d with the loop belt and parents are told their baby safe . In a crash the adult folds onto the infant, both are thrown forwards. The adult pushes the infant, pushing the loop belt into the infant\u2019s stomach until it stops at the infants spine. The infant acts like an air bag for the adult, with no safety provided for the infant.\r\n\r\nThe law requires all children traveling in cars to use the correct child restraint, why should an aircraft be any different? Please support this change.",
