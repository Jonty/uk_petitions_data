Some Schools do not teach the right things, meaning majority of students get E/U's in exams. Particuarly retakes. I revise VERY hard for exams, having been taught the wrong things meant i failed. I've never failed exams till now! Ofsted inspections should run randomly as many Schools go to extreme efforts to \"glam\" up. Some so desperate they even prepare lessons JUST for the inspection day. The amount of effort in preparing these lessonsSHOULDbe the amount of effort put into preparing our normal lessons!\r\nConcerned atlack of support for University aspirations..attitudes & ethics mean I\u2019m unable to achieve goals... Im condemed for wanting to study!\r\nPlease sign this, helping the future of Students unheard voices. Thank you! ",
