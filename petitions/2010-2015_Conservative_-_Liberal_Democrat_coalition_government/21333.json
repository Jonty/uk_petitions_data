        "additional_details": "The issue of legalising assited suicide is important because people who help their terminally ill relatives to die can currently be charged with murder. We believe that this is unfair as if a person wants to end their suffering but are unable to end their lives themselves, they may want to ask someone to help them. However at the moment, this is against the law which means many terminally ill people continue their suffering. Some terminally ill patients travel to other countries where there are special clinics which will help them to end their lives. This can cause additional distress and means that the patient must die alone in a foreign country.\r\nTherefore, we belive that those who want to end their life should be able to make their wishes known. Futhermore they should be able to choose to ask a relative to help them end their lives without worrying about what consequence this may have for their relative after their death. ",
