        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, petition the UK government to repeal all laws that prohibit the sale, possession and carrying of non-lethal weapons in the United Kingdom. Crime is rising and law-abiding people have no means of defence against armed and violent aggressors. This is unacceptable and needs to be changed immediately. We believe that self-defence sprays such as CS gas and pepper spray should be legally available so that citizens can carry them in public for personal protection, along with electronic stun devices such as tasers and stun guns. The recent cut in police officer numbers makes this all the more essential as the police's response to 999 calls is going to be much slower now than it ever was before. Almost all EU countries allow their citizens to have an effective means of self-defence and the UK should change its laws with immediate effect.",
