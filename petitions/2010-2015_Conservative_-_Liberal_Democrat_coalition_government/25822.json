In a majority of cases there is no issue with the road itself, the issue arises when a third party comes along and excavates the highway to work on their services, but when it comes to reinstate the highway they are not reinstating to the appropriate standard, despite the rates they charge for installing their services.\r\nI would propose that any company who work in the public highway should have to warrant the work, under a contract signed as a deed.\r\nWith this in place the local authority would drastically reduce the amount they had to spend on maintenance and fixing pot holes.",
