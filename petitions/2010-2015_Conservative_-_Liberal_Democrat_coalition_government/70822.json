We have started this petition because we feel they need to bring back EMA in England, the govenment want us to stay in education but if you are a young one like myself and your mum/dad is signing on or getting some sort of benifit from the govenment you feel the need not to stay in education because you dont get EMA anymore and you want to help your parents with the bills and I know for a fact that my mum only gets \u00a3100/\u00a3120 every two weeks for 2 of us and thats to feed us pay bills etc etc and we are struggling so no matter who you are if thats a teacher, parent, employer, a teenanger please sign this petition to bring back EMA. THIS IS FOR TODAY AND THE FUTURE.\r\n",
