        "action": "The Misuse Of Drugs Act should be repealed and replaced with legislation that regulates the sale of harmful substances in a risk-based approach.",
        "additional_details": "The UK policy on harmful substances is a failure. After billions of tax payer cash being spent it has failed to restrict drug use, educate about drug use or provide effective treatment for users. If drug markets were regulated the estimated saving to taxpayers would be in the region of \u00a34.6bn-\u00a313.9bn\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, ask the House of Commons to repeal the Misuse of Drugs Act and pass legislation  which regulates the sale of all harmful substances (including alcohol and tobacco) in a sensible, pragmatic and risk-based approach.",
