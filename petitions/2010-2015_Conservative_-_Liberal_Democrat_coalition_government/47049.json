        "additional_details": "Care home fee increases for private residents are at a record high this year as councils neogotiate low rates due to austerity measures. My mum who has alheimers is having to pay an extra \u00a360 per week which is a 12% rise to subside council rates. The government must force care homes to keep their rises in line with the rate of inflation. Some money from the recent social reforms must be put to one side for this purpose now, not in 4 years time.",
