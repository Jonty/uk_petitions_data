        "additional_details": "Disabled passengers are being discriminated against on a daily basis on UK public transport.\r\n\r\nThe Disability Discrimination Act forced public transport companies to improve accessibility to trains, buses and trams. But, despite these physical adjustments, disabled passengers are still being prevented from equal access to public transport.  Disabled passengers are often ignored or forgotten about.  Wheelchair ramps are not made available.  Verbal abuse is common.  Support and help is often withheld.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this has to change.\r\n\r\nWe are asking for a Regulator, funded by the industry, to:\r\n1) ensure ongoing training to all customer-facing public transport staff;\r\n2) regulate a minimum standard of compulsory training, and refreshers;\r\n3) maintain a centralised register of complaints as an essential part of the process of awarding, regulating and renewing franchises.\r\n\r\nWe feel these changes will improve the quality of service for all who use public transport.",
