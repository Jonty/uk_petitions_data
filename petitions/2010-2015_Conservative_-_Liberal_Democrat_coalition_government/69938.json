They note complaints are increasing year on year in volume and seriousness. They make recommendations on change which appear not to be implemented, or are otherwise ineffective at dealing with the problems.\r\n\r\nThe current system is not properly holding the SLC to account.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the Government to re-examine the way the Student Loans Company operates with a view to driving change for the good of your young people, and future prosperity of the country as a whole.
