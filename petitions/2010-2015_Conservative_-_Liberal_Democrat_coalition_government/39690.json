        "additional_details": "Responsible department: Department for Business, Innovation and Skills\r\n\r\nMany cats, dogs and wild animals die a horrible slow death each year from antifreeze poisoning - deliberate or otherwise. Acts of deliberate poisoning are criminal, but difficult to prove and prosecute.\r\n\r\nAnimals find the taste of antifreeze sweet and palatable and thus they will often ingest the substance if it is made available, especially by mixing it with food. The results are catastrophic and often fatal.\r\n\r\nA bittering agent introduced into commercially available antifreeze will greatly reduce the number of such poisonings. There is currently no UK legislation forcing manufacturers to routinely add a bitterant to antifreeze.\r\n\r\nThe UK government should draft, vote upon and enact legislation preventing the sale of any antifreeze products without a bitterant additive.
