        "additional_details": "The House of Commons is no longer fit for purpose. Whilst it may be rich in historical and cultural references, the needs of government have changed. The parallel benches were designed for a two party system; a design that now encourages conflict and inhibits consensus. With insufficient seating, a time consuming voting system, the ritual braying of debates and the theatrical jousting of PMQs; small wonder that voting numbers in parliamentary elections have fallen and respect for the law and the lawmakers faded.\r\nBuildings shape the way we live, work and behave. The complexity of modern society requires a level of efficiency and effectiveness that the current accommodation is unable to provide. It is time to engage the country in reasoned debate about the location and form of a new seat of government for the twenty-first century and beyond, and to hand over this creaking structure to Madam Tussauds and the leisure industry.\r\n",
