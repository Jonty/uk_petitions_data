        "additional_details": "The complexities of lending in the UK are apparent to most anybody who attempts some kind of borrowing, the United States operates a simple and easy to understand Universal Credit Scoring System (FICO) in which every potential borrower is made aware of their unique score and is also made aware of the lenders \"pass score\" before applying, this allows consumers the opportunity to be sure their individual credit rating is suitable for the product they are applying for. The Government should enact a system in the UK for the simple and easy understanding for all consumers to know exactly where their credit record stands and what products are available to them before applying. I propose the government makes preparations to implement this Universal Scoring System as soon as possible.",
