        "additional_details": "Currently the possibilities of volunteering for those under 16 is minute. There are almost no opportunities for those in this age range and I, as a 14 year old, find this appalling. We need to prepare ourselves to save our world from the mess that has been made of it and by being allowed to sit there doing nothing is not going to make any difference. Let us have the opportunity to do something good, instead of others complaining we don't do anything. I  have. been looking for months for somewhere it is possible for me to help, I want to make a difference.Something needs to be done and it needs to be realised that it is not young people stopping us from reaching our full potential, it is those that set rules that do not allow us to do this. I need help to solve this, I don't know what to do and need support. I want to shape my future, as well as helping  others- but currently my ways of doing this are limited.",
