        "additional_details": "Despite being UK citizens and taxpayers NI women  do not have the same access to a legal, safe abortion.\r\n\r\nUnlike the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland does not have an Abortion Act. Instead an 1861 law makes it a criminal offence to procure a miscarriage.\r\n\r\nIn 1945 an exception was added that abortion could be permitted to preserve the life of the mother.\r\n\r\nAs a result they can be still refused an abortion even if:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tthey've been raped\r\n\u2022\tthey've suffered incest\r\n\u2022\tthey've been given a diagnosis of fetal abnormality.\r\n\r\nTherefore the government needs to INCLUDE Northern Ireland in the 1967 Abortion Act and future acts to diminish the emotional and financial difficulties faced by those who are having to consider this option.\r\n\r\n",
