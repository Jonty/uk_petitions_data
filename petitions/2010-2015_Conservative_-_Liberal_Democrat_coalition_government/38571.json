        "additional_details": "The report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel published on 12th September 2012, and the subsequent apology by the PM, places on public record the role of senior police officers and notably Sir Cyril Irvine Patnick at the heart of a cover up and coordinated smear campaign, unprecedented in our country. It is the role of publicly elected representatives to hold state funded bodies such as the police to account; not to protect them. When the lives of 96 people have been lost, and those of so many more devastated, this crime is multiplied. It is a discredit to our democracy, that such an individual can be a knight of the realm.",
