        "additional_details": "Dear Britons\r\n\r\nI will turn 17 on the eve of the independence referendum and I urge the Secretary of State for Scotland to prevent the enfranchising of 16 and 17 year olds in the name of election equality.\r\nThis move by the SNP government is only to move the goalposts due to the once held view that rebellious teens would revolt against their government.\r\nEven now with the polls different, the SNP fight on to try to show themselves as youth liberators-this has to stop.Citizens, I urge you to sign this petitions to prevent the mind wash of untainted minds,the electoral inequality and the waste of important votes.\r\nThis age group is too young-we may here the old \"get married,have sex,join the forces\" saying but teens are too inexperienced with politics and too busy focusing on their major educational plans.\r\nIn the name of our generation and in the democracy that we hold dear;please sign this petitions,thank you.",
