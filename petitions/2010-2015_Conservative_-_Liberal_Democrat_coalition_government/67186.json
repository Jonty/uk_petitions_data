        "additional_details": "We need traffic calming measures put on Wilverton Road to protect our kids from the cars and buses that drive way too fast on this road! We have already had one fatal accident of a five year old, and a couple of accidents which resulted in broken limbs. We need chicane's put on this road as I see it's the only way to slow down the traffic. Many thanks for your signatures ",
