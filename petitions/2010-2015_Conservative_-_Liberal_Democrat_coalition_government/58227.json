        "additional_details": "Due to the drastic government cuts in council's budgets CAB is having to close bureaux and make staff redundant all around the country.\r\n\r\nIt has been the place where people could go to receive assistance for whatever problem they had since the war.\r\n\r\nThe service will be greatly reduced over the country due to drastic reduction in finances.  Some may say this is happening to many charitable organisation and is no different from other charities, and they would be right,  The difference with CAB is that in nearly every decision letter, or leaflet sent to a client  by government department, Inland Revenue or creditor  they say 'you can seek independent advice from your nearest Citizens Advice Bureau'.  Clients will not be able to access a loca CAB soon.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to make government think about the impact their decisions are making on the general public and what is happening in your community.",
