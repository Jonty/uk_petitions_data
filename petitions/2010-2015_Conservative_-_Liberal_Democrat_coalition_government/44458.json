Lord Keith said in the judgment: \u201cIt is of the highest public importance that a democratically elected governmental body, or indeed any governmental body, should be open to uninhibited public criticism\u201d.This protection is called \"the Derbyshire Principle\".\r\n\r\nThe BBC has reported that Rutland Council could be the first local authority to sue for defamation. Lawyers claim the council\u2019s reputation had been damaged and suggested they could sue using the powers the Council now has under the Localism Act 2011.",
