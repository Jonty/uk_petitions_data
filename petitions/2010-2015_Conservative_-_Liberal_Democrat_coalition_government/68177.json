        "additional_details": "The latest draft of the infrastructure bill will reclassify many native species which have become extinct and then re-introduced as non-native. This is not just species becoming extinct in the wild in Britain now but species included in Schedule 9.\r\n\r\nThis means they will seek to remove or control these species, threatening their survival.\r\nThis includes but is not limited to the red kite, the white-tailed eagle, the barn owl, the corncrake, the European Beaver, wolf and elk.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, want the Government to recognise the importance of our native species, by removing the clause regarding considering extinct/ reintroduced species as non-native. These creatures are a part of our heritage and we wish to protect them.\r\nAlso, we wish clauses 21 and 22 to be reconsidered, to protect our forests from being sold. They are an important habitat and are native species themselves.",
