        "additional_details": "It is ridiculous that people who have no real adult life experience are allowed to enter into the world of assessing situations and making decisions about the general public when they have not lived a civilian life themselves.  All they know in the present situation is to leave school, college etc, and immediately be allowed to walk the streets with the protection of their job in their mind, which with the arrogance of youth is a dangerous combination.  A minimum age of 30, would mean people would have probably had children by that age, been stopped for a traffic offence, made calls to the police over events with no action taken etc - in other words BEEN ON THE OTHER SIDE FIRST, IN ORDER TO BE BETTER THAN THE BAD EXPERIENCES THEY HAVE SUFFERED.  If no bad experience has been gained, there is still no loss, as those joining will still be more life experienced.  Recruiting right in the first place might well ensure less reasons for reflection when it goes wrong!!!!!",
