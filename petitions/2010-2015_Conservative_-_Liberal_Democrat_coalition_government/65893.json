        "additional_details": "Please allow the UK use of alepsia oil, it is non psychoactive and will help epilepsy sufferers in UK redicing 90% of seizures and allow these people to see a better quality of life. This is currently available in the US but not available here in the UK because government will not see its benefits such as helping millions with epilepsy.  There are cases where babies too are born with a rare form of epilepsy not treatable via surgery, this medicine will help see them with a higher life expectancy. Eliminating the current lof expectancy of 7 years, thats hard to accept that a baby will only live till the age of 7, knowing that another country accross the Pacific will offer the medicine shows our lack of understanding.  Please dont accept a poor quality of life for someone. And do something please!!",
