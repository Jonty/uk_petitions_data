        "additional_details": "The current definition for rape in the UK is given by the 2003 Sexual Offences Act and is as follows:\r\n\r\n1-(1) A person (A) commits an offence if\u2014\r\n\r\n    (a) he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis,\r\n    (b) B does not consent to the penetration, and\r\n    (c) A does not reasonably believe that B consents.\r\n\r\nThis definition only includes the forced sexual conduct of a man on a man/woman, according to the law it is impossible for a woman to rape a man.\r\n\r\nWe therefore feel that it is appropriate for the definition of rape be redefined to also include a man/woman being forced to penetrate to make the law gender neutral.",
