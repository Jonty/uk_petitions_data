It is available for many titles on Netflix but is not provided on many other services, such as Amazon instant video.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of video on demand, it seems right that the same criteria should be placed on those providers as are placed on broadcast TV providers.\r\n\r\nSo, a minimum quota of subtitled content should be enforced on video streaming services. As with broadcast TV, this quote could begin low and focused on the most popular content, then increase on a yearly basis.\r\n\r\nThis would provide a more equal viewing experience for deaf people.",
