        "additional_details": "With more and more reports of overseas aid being misappropriated by recepients, the UK government should immediately change the form of aid to vouchers that can only be spent on goods and services provided from within the UK. Thus all monies given by the UK tax payer would go to stimulate our economy whilst ensuring overseas aid continues to help those it was intended to. By having such a system the UK government can ensure that miappropriation of UK taxpayer money is eliminated whilst improving the employment prospects of those in this country. I believe this approach would ensure that overseas aid was seen in a positive light by a majority of the electorate.",
