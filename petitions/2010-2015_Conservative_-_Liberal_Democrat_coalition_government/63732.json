        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the Prime Minister to ban the practise of Halal and Kosher slaughtering of livestock in Great Britain and to ban the import of meat slaughtered in this way.\r\nThe majority of slaughter houses use an electric shock to render the animal unconscious before being killed, thus eliminating any unnecessary suffering. Halal and Kosher slaughter routines do not use an electric shock, and instead slit the animal\u2019s throat whilst fully conscious, leaving it to bleed to death.\r\nWe maintain that this is a shocking and unjustifiable level of animal cruelty.\r\nAny deliberate cruelty to an animal is unjustifiable, and we believe the Prime Minister has a moral obligation to stop this practise in Great Britain.",
