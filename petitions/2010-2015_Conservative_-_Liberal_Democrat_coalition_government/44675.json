        "additional_details": "Women reaching 59 and 60 this year have had to contend with 2 changes to their state pension age leaving little time, if any, to make further financial arrangements. Now a large proportion of these women will miss out on the increased basic pension, starting April 2017. Our increase in working years is also taking jobs from the young who are becoming demotivated. We seek a review of the plans for this group of women who seem to be missing out all round and are having to work an additional 4/5 years without the prospect of even the increased basic pension at the end of their working life.",
