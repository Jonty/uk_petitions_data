        "additional_details": "The CRB disclosure system oversteps its original purpose and undermines rehabilitation of offenders.\r\n\r\nDesigned to protect children and vulnerable people from sex offenders, it now bars employment opportunities to people who have committed trivial and minor offences years ago.\r\n\r\nCategorise offences and relate them to the industries that should have access to CRB checks. A bank need not know you have a 10 year old caution for criminal damage but they may need to know you have a 2 year old caution for fraud. Likewise, a hospital must know if you have committed a sexual offence, abused the vulnerable and so on but do they need to know you have a caution for a public order offence?\r\n\r\nCategorise offences, expire very minor offences after a statutory period and let people GET on if they have MOVED on.\r\n",
