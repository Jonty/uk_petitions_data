        "additional_details": "Currently the outcomes of an inspection depends more on which inspector carries out the inspection rather than the evidence seen as the guide lines are open to interpretation. Often Inspections are between 3 and 5 years apart when they should be every 3 years.\r\n\r\nWe propose\r\n* Continuity of Inspections.\r\n* Strict guidelines for inspectors to follow along with training.\r\n* Separate inspection teams for childminder's, nursery's and school's with inspector's who understand the area of provision that they are inspecting.\r\n* For satisfactory to remain satisfactory rather than changing to needs Improvement.\r\n* Fair Inspections where inspectors do not pre judge (some only giving satisfactory to new childminders for example).\r\n* Less negative wording on inspection reports.\r\n\r\n100,000 votes needed for this to be lobbied.\r\n",
