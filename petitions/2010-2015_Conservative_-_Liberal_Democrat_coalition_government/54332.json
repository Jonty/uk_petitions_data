        "additional_details": "The coalition government is driving this nation to poverty. It has cut budgets to the armed forces. Now it wants to send the armed forces into a chemical war that has nothing to do with this nation. This will increase taxes on our almost financially crippled nation and increase the chances of another terrorist attack quite possibly a chemical attack on our own people. We the undersigned demand with immediate effect that the current coalition be dissolved and a new election take place. ",
