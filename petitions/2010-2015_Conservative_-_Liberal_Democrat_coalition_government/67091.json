        "additional_details": "Please  reconsider providing total freedom of access to pension funds, to all those aged over 55 and amend the proposal to require everyone to secure a minimum level of guaranteed income (eg from their state pension, final salary (defined benefit) pension or guaranteed lifetime annuity) of \u00a312kpa before being able to make unlimited withdrawals.\r\n\r\nThis change is necessary for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Ordinary people with small pension funds will be at risk of exhausting their retirement savings, in a very short period or sit on their cash and be afraid to spend it\r\n\u2022It is unfair to transfer the risk of retirement income provision from an insurance contract (this is what a guaranteed lifetime annuity is) to an individual who cannot predict how long they will live.\r\n\u2022The proposals for guidance at retirement are well intentioned but very unlikely to deliver the depth of information required for those retiring to make informed decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
