        "additional_details": "This petition is to request that rioters should not face the loss of any benefits. It's foolish to think that this action is required. Think of it like this. Somebody commits a regular theft, they would be prosecuted, but still be able to acquire benefits. I agree that the rioters should be punished, but some are being punished too severely. For example, Esa Harding, 25, was sentenced to twenty months in prison for stealing a single T-Shirt. So, as opposed to prison, removing benefits and other such things, why not a community service scheme? Make the people who ruined a community rebuild it as opposed to other people doing it while they're comfortable in a prison cell.",
