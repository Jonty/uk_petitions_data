        "additional_details": "Audio ads add an unacceptable dimension to web advertising.\r\n\r\nOften the sound is deliberately annoying to draw attention, and muting audio ads is difficult, with mute often difficult to find, or clicks needed - forcing advertising upon us. Also, people use their PCs for a number of things, many of which require audio and the ads intefere with the ability to do so.\r\n\r\nAudio ads also lower PC performance as they use more RAM and bandwidth. For many internet users, bandwidth units cost money - thus these ads are unfairly costing money.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the ads are a major hindrance to the visually impaired who are unable to see them; and because they require the volume to work for correct use of their PCs, they cannot simply turn the sound off. This goes beyond annoying - it's totally unacceptable.\r\n\r\nObviously the UK can't regulate content on foreign domains. However, I propose a ban on audio and audio/video ads on .co.uk or .ac.uk or other UK-based domains on the internet.",
