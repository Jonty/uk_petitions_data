        "additional_details": "The proposed High Speed 2 will only stop at London and Birmingham. The government is missing out on a large market in towns such as Aylesbury (population 60,000), Banbury (40,000) and Warwick (25,000). Southeastern trains have recently implemented a commuter service on high speed one which is very popular. It is not fair that the rural communities which are being torn apart by the construction of this railway should have to travel long distances in order to use it. Furthermore, the towns mentioned will attract more residents lessening the effect of urban sprawl by creating a corridor, much like the M1 corridor. Economically, this is beneficial too, as more people will use the service",
