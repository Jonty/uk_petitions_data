Likewise, to allow adult motorbike drivers/passengers to travel without wearing a helmet if they so choose. Travelling without a seatbelt/helmet would put noone at risk but the traveller themselves - the ability to drive with due care and attention is neither increased nor decreased by wearing a seatbelt/helmet. If it is deemed necessary, a reasonable charge could be levied upon travellers who choose not to wear a seatbelt/helmet and who require NHS medical treatment as a result of this decision.",
