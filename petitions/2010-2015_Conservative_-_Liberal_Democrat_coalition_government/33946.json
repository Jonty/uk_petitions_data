        "additional_details": "Its medically understandable that the government don't want to promote bottle feeding, however this should not come at the expense of people who want to breast feed but arent able to.\r\n\r\nThe cost of breast feeding substitute is quite high for parents. Especially parents who are unable to breast feed due to mental or physical difficulties, and parents who have been medically recommended to bottle feed.\r\n\r\nAccording to posts on Moneysavingexperts Forum, some parents can spend around \u00a380 a month, just on formula.\r\n\r\nThis epetition is to ask the govenement to help and contribute towards the cost of formula when the mother has been advised by their GP or midwife to quit breast feeding.",
