The centrepiece of their revamp was the kitchen.\r\nNo 10 has confirmed that the full \u00a330,000 grant for upkeep of the living accommodation, which is available to prime ministers annually, was used for the refit of 11 Downing Street, after the Guardian discovered the payment in the official spending records.",
