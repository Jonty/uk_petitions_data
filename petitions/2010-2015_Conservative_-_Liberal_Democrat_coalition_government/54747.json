        "additional_details": "I have started this petition because I am sick of logging into my Facebook account everyday and facebook has been targeting only loyalist photos and Protestant pictures good friends and people all over are being banned for having these in their photos or on their own newsfeed ! Facebook have even targeted the Northern Ireland flag .... This is no different and has every right to be in people's pages as a Scotland,England or Wales flag . The fact that the British flag even offends Facebook disappoints me surely if this is the case all flags and religions should all be getting banned and not just out culture and our beliefs being targeted something has to be done as theirs are inappropriate pages in Facebook surly they should be sorting this out NOW ! And leaving people's personal pages alone that are not doing any harm !",
