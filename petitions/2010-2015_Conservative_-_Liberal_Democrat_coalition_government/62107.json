Which leads to the council shortfall of 10%.\r\nOldham council are disproportionately charging council tax benefit recipients.\r\nBand A = \u00a31000 @ 25% tax = \u00a3250 year.\r\nBand B = \u00a31400 @ 44% tax = \u00a3616 year.\r\nAlso the loss suffered by the council is only 10%, so why are they charging more than the 10% loss.\r\n\r\nOldham council received 90% which is \u00a31260, so the charge one would expect to be billed is 10% or \u00a3140, the true loss, I believe that this is unlawful.\r\n\r\nMisappropriation of funds.
