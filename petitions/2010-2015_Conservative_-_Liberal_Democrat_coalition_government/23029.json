Is it constitutional that a member of parliament should be so restricted in his thoughts and subsequently, is his loyalty to the crown and people compromised? Should the house urgently debate whether a member of our parliament should be thus constrained in his freedom of thought and that if such constraint is found to exist, whether this is compatible with being a loyal member of HMG?
