        "additional_details": "1: BBC Iplayer content is currently free to anyone in the UK whether they pay a licence fee or not. This means that those who do pay are paying for others to get a free service. If you had to create a User Name linked to your licence number to prove you had paid before using the service, this could save the BBC a lot of money, and maybe encourage more people to pay for a licence.\r\n2: The BBC Iplayer has currently a very limited number of episodes of programs such as Top Gear, for which they have now placed links on BBC sites to Apple's Itunes service where you must pay to watch these programs. Licence Fee Payers paid for the BBC to make these programs, which they sell all over the world to commercial stations and in DVD format, we should not have to pay to watch them.",
