        "additional_details": "Rail Privatisation is now a reality and there is no going back from that however it can be made to work more efficiently by giving rail operators control of the infrastructure on which their trains run. This will mean the end of Network Rail.\r\n\r\nEach of these new super franchises covering London, South and West,  Midlands and Wales, North and East AND Scotland will be set targets for pax numbers, punctuality and re-investment. There targets will be strictly policed by a new regulatory body with the power to end them early. Also a seperate national franchise will be created to carry freight and the networks will be legally obliged to allow their services to operate.\r\n\r\nThis will make for more efficient railways and reduce costs to the tax-payer.",
