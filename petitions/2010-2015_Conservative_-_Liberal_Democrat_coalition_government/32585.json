Being alive is not the same as living and the proposals open the way for abuse by future less benign governments. Only an independent judiciary should ever decide when my freedom should be infringed to protect my life. You will pardon me if I don't trust a politician with my freedom. NOT IN MY NAME. One step closer to a state infrastructure that a totalitarian inclined party could abuse.",
