        "additional_details": "To reduce the number of Councillors in Salford from 60 to 20 will mean massive savings of around 1 million pounds for local people, the savings can be used to protect front line services and Councillors who do nothing for their communities will be got rid off. It will end the farce where two councillors in same family get two allowances for effectively the one job. To reduce Councillors will mean better democracy, will result in working councillors instead of idle Councillors. Sack the Councillors not the Workers !",
