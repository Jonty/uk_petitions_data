        "additional_details": "The taxpayer bailed out the UK's banks and saved them from ruin, by purchasing very large stakes in the banks, for example approx 80% of RBS, and almost half of Lloyds. These banks should be made to buy back and cancel these shares BEFORE they are allowed to pay ANY dividends. As the largest single shareholder HM Government can enact this policy without the need for legislation. This would also benefit existing shareholders (including our pension funds) whose equity would be increased as a result (this would more than make up not paying dividends), as well as allowing the taxpayer to realise a return on its investment.",
