        "additional_details": "This petition is designed to gain support for an affective & robust resolve to the UK\u2019s growing issue with Illegal Immigration. This is in no-way designed to support with extremist groups or individuals. I would ask that you give due consideration to the below proposal. My proposal is that the UK Government funds a new Prison where it could house up to 2million people with separate sections for men, women & children. Each to be housed within a 7ft by 4ft cell, where nutritious food is served 3 times per day & where water is to be issued six times per day. The cell itself would house only one bed, one toilet & one wash basin. Each prisoner would be permitted out of their cell for one hour per day for exercise. Prays etc. would be performed in their cells. The occupants of this Prison would only ever be occupied by those individuals who have been found to be in the UK illegally, where they would remain until such time as the UK can arrange for them to be returned to their home country.",
