        "additional_details": "It is grossly unfair that carers of dependent adult children will be subject to the benefit caps, yet carers of dependent adult spouses/partners or dependent children will not. We were promised that no household with a family member receiving DLA would be affected - we now learn that to get round this, the government now clearly removes a family member from a 'household' because of their age - regardless of the fact their parent is still caring for them and they live together. I want this government to recognise that dependent adult children with disabilities are still part of the family household. A family unit living together is a family - regardless of how old they are. This decision to cut carers income is clearly wrong and must be prevented from happening by swift Parliamentary action.",
