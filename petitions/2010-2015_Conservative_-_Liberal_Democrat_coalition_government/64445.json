It has a distinctive and characteristic odour, taste, and colour, as well as the ability to bring tears to the eyes of grown men.\r\n\r\nAs we have outlined at http://bit.ly/1pJe93R , inferior American mustard is being disguised and marketed as English mustard - potentially spoiling Sunday dinners across the country.\r\n\r\nWe urge the government grant 'Protected Designation of Origin' to English mustard, thereby eliminating this foreign threat to our way of life.",
