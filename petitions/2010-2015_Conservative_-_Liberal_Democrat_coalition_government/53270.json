        "additional_details": "For many consumers the only way to access the best prices for electricity and gas is to switch supplier with some estimates suggesting that millions of customers could save as much as \u00a3200 a year. At the moment this process can take up to five weeks, often even longer. This means consumers paying higher prices for a greater length of time.\r\n\r\nThere is no need for it to take this long. Instead consumers should be able to switch on the same day that they apply.\r\n\r\nSign this petition to call for the Government to force the regulator and the industry to follow the telecoms and banking sectors\u2019 lead and dramatically cut the time it takes to switch and get a better deal with another supplier.\r\n",
