It is a scandal that construction companies were the first to lay off workers when the crash started - unwilling to do what most others have had to do and take lower margins.\r\n\r\nI want the MOD to release huge tracts of land (previously used as Army bases) for use by co-operatives of small builders (many of whom were laid off by the big construction companies) to create new communities.\r\n\r\nLand prices need to be low, with purchasers agreeing to the Govt taking a significant share of any gain when the property is sold.",
