        "additional_details": "Most people simply require a banking system that allows for the transfer of money. Mainly paying wages in and making payments out. The technology required for this is very simple. The government should create such a state bank so that the masses all have access to simple banking. The running costs would be minimal and could be entirely funded by a levy on the banking industry.This will leave the private banking companies to compete for our savings and if they fail to offer decent rates we can all leave our money in the state bank. Furthermore, future banking collapses would not be so systemically dangerous at that point.",
