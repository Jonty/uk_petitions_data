        "additional_details": "Pet owners receive no allowance for the animals they own. Currently if a pet owner losses their income they are simply expected to sell their animal. Websites like Preloved are swamped with advertisements placed by people who need to sell their pets because they are no longer financially able to keep them. This is simply not fair. The government would not expect people to sell their children if they were no longer able to fund them. To animal keepers their animals are often like their children.\r\nThe thought that the government expects people to sell their companions like they are material goods is abhorrent. This petition is not asking that benefits should be payed per animal, it simply asks that if an animal owner loses their job they receive help to fund the expenses of their animal companion.",
