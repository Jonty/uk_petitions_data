        "additional_details": "I have drink drive on lisence from 2009 wich is a dr10 on lisence. I was a class 1 driver but now have bin told that no one can employ me for at least 5 years if I'm lucky. It stays on your lisence for 11 years now I have finished my ban which cost me livelyhood. I have paid the fine imposed by courts but still can't get employment doing the job I have done for over 20 years. So the fine really is costing 25000 a year until I can get employment I think it should come off lisence a lot sooner. I made the mistake off driving the next day after family party which is the only time I'll have a drink but I'm still paying for it. I think the punishment is ongoing and unfair. I am not a drinker never have been. I no there are drivers out there that know what I am going through and would like to have the rule changed so we can get back to work doing what we love. ",
