        "action": "Ban the giving of live Goldfish as prizes",
        "additional_details": "For all other vertebrate species, it is illegal to give them away as prizes, so why is it considered morally and ethically right for Goldfish and similar species?\r\n\r\nIt is legal to give Goldfish as prizes, even to children, as long as someone of 18yrs+ allows it. They are sold unfiltered plastic bowls, a fraction of the size actually required to provide good welfare for these animals. Goldfish are pond fish, requiring a pond or aquarium of 5ft as a minimum to be provided with what's needed to survive the entirety of it's 25yrs+ lifespan.\r\n\r\nThousands of these animals will meet an early death each year due to being given to winners with no knowledge of fishkeeping, the species or care requirements. If the death is not instant from being dropped or binned, it is prolonged due to poor welfare and unnecessary suffering and/or cruelty.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for a change in legislation, disallowing the use of Goldfish, and any other fish species, to be given as prizes.
