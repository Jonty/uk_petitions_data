        "additional_details": "The chemical asulam has recently been banned by the EU. Because of this, farmers, particularly in Scotland and Wales, will be unable to control the spread of bracken on their land, which is an incredibly invasive weed. I therefore propose that the government stand up for UK interests and tell the EU that if this ban is not overturned immediately we will defy it anyway.",
