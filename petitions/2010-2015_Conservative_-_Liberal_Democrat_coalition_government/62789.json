        "additional_details": "St Luke's Church, Liverpool, is a former Anglican parish church, which is now a ruin. It stands on the corner of Berry Street and Leece Street, looking down the length of Bold Street, Liverpool, Merseyside, England. The church was built between 1811 and 1832. In addition to being a parish church, it was also intended to be used as a venue for ceremonial worship by the Corporation, and as a concert hall. It was badly damaged during the Liverpool Blitz in 1941, and remains as a roofless shell. It now stands as a memorial to those who were lost in the war, and is also a venue for exhibitions and events. The church, and the surrounding walls, gates and railings are protected as Grade II* listed buildings.\r\nPlease sign the petition if you would like to see the bombed out church stand tall for generations to see and not to be redeveloped into something that will not benefit the city as much as this iconic building dose.\r\n",
