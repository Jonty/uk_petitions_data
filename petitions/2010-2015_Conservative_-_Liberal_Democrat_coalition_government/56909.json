Coeliac disease is a common condition that affects approximately 1 in every 100 people in the UK. Food that is Gluten Free from shops can cost up to 5 times more than the version with gluten in. People with Coeliac can get staple items such as bread, pasta etc on prescription but have to pay for these as well as any other medications they may need. Other medical conditions don't have to pay so why should they?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcosts/Pages/Prescriptioncosts.aspx\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Coeliac-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx",
