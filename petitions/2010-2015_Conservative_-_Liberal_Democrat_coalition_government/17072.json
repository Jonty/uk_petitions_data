        "additional_details": "This petition aims to provide a focal point for all who are concerned at the increasing number of extra excavations which are taking place under existing buildings in our cities. Most of these are by normal criteria simply ways of indulging private whims such as cinemas, gyms, and pools.  We oppose them because of a fear that they represent a threat to the structural integrity of nearby buildings and the likelihood that they interfere with the water table and can cause flooding.  If the traditional channel for water is blocked it has to find another way. Most Councils have policies and guidelines intended to discourage these excavations but in practice they are nearly always passed on appeal to an Inspector who sitting alone overrules the decision of their elected representatives on the Council.\r\nThe government should pass new legislation placing more rigorous restrictions on new excavations in built up areas\r\n\r\n\r\n",
