        "additional_details": "Many young people today feel obliged to go to a university after their A levels. However there are a lot of alternative options to a university education such as apprenticeships which give young people specific training in the field they wish to progress with in life. I am 17 and my ambition is to get involved with the media post A levels so I can eventually get a job in presenting.\r\n\r\nJennifer Aniston, actress. Never attended university.\r\n\r\nRussell Brand, comedian and actor. After school, he attended two drama schools in London but got kicked out of both of them.\r\n\r\nSeth Rogan, actor, comedian, and screenwriter. Dropped out of high school.\r\n\r\nThey did not attend university but became successful nevertheless.\r\n\r\nMost people with ambition know what they want in life therefore they will fight for it. For most people university is the best option but for a lot of people it is what they think they have to do.",
