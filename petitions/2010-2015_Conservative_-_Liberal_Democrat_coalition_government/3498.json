        "additional_details": "The government seems to have a real problem in dealing with the rising likelihood of high percentages of the population falling into obesity. The solution should be fairly straightforward; the cost of a healthy diet in the UK is high whilst buying fattier mass produced foods is relatively cheap. Obesity does and will continue to add further strain on the NHS. In order to counteract this, a tax on unhealthy foods could be used to increase revenue and to subsidise the price of good quality produce.",
