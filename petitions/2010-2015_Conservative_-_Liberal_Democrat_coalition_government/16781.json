        "additional_details": "The Concorde has been a symbol of British ingenuity for over 30 years, it was retired prematurely and the decission to retire her was motivated by profit rather than progress, it is not surprising however that a privately owned BA would put such priorities first. The government should nationalise the ownership of one Concorde and keep her in worthy flying condition for heritage purposes and national events. Concorde is an excellent reminder of what we can achieve and a crucial part of our heritage, if spitfires and lancasters of world war two can be preserved in flying condition then surely the same can be said of the concorde",
