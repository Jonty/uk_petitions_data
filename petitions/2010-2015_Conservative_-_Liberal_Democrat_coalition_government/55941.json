        "additional_details": "Listen to the radio **EVERY** morning and evening and the M6  between Wolverhampton and Birmingham is forever at gridlock.  Yes 'managed motorways' are being introduced but a Western Orbital route but sticking a plaster over this will not resolve the issue....there is simply too much traffic for the motoway to take.  A westerly bypass from the M6 toll/M54 area to the M5/M42 junction completely bypassing the westerly edge of the Greater Birmingham area will not only relive the large amount of congestion on all the traffic coming up the M5 and continuing the North West as well as the traffic coming north on the M6, but also give Birmingham the orbital motorway it so needs (m6 toll + M42 + this bypass).  For so many years the M25 and M60 have given London and Manchester this relief, but the West Midlands has forever fallen behind.  Think of the wasted work hours spent in traffic, think of the excessive fumes poisoning the Black Country area due to stationary traffic...",
