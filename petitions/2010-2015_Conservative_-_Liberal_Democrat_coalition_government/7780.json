All we need is sufficient expenditure to support UN peacekeeping forces. The resulting savings will be both financial \u2013 over \u00a330 billion a year \u2013 and human \u2013 no more unnecessary  war deaths and injuries. The money saved will help social and economic development and the retention of our shrinking public services.\r\n",
