        "additional_details": "Please add your voice to the 2,912 people who supported the ORIGINAL petition to tell the government to drop proposals to reduce the frequency of MoT tests. Currently vehicles are tested at the third anniversary of registration, and are then tested annually (so called 3-1-1). The DfT has proposed a change to first test at four years and then retest every other year (4-2-2) to  \"reduce the burden on the motorist\". What is this burden? The maximum fee for a test is \u00a354.85 and many test stations charge a great deal less. The test is a vital part of keeping the UK's cars safe, road-worthy and environmentally compliant. Any reduction in testing would lead to increased road casualties (deaths and serious injuries), increased pollution, and have employment consequences. All of which has been supported by reliable research. The system was reviewed in 2008 and seen to be appropriate and any relaxation in testing seen as unrealistic. Let's drop this ill-considered proposal! www.iaaf.co.uk",
