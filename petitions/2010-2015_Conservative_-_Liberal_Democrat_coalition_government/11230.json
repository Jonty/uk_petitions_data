Additionally many wars, if not all recent wars that our soldiers have participated in have been somewhat controversial and hold hypocrisies not undue to a widely held opinion that governments including that of the UK government create unrest and war for personal gain.\r\n\r\nIt is everyone\u2019s right within a supposed democratic country to choose not to participate (through the contribution of money or otherwise) in something that they believe is wrong (with wrong theoretically meaning immoral).\r\n\r\nAction that the Government should take in affect of this petition receiving enough public support should be in the form of an opt out system, or alternatively a separate military for the use of defence of own territory (within the confines of the UK), but not attack (insurgencies).\r\n",
