        "additional_details": "Lloyds Banking Group have been proven time and again to be engaging in immoral, illegal and corrupt practises. Given the state of the Banking, Media, Political and Policing scandals in recent times as well as the Social frenzy of crime that occurred in England, it is apparent that the soul of the country needs renewed. Why not force Lloyds to go the same route as NoW? The taxpayer has paid for Lloyds  and Lloyds has made the taxpayer pay for doing so.\r\n\r\nOn your way to instilling real values back into society, I vote that you consider whether Lloyds has the moral fibre to maintain its prominent place in our society, or whether you may take the courageous decision to remove this parasitic organisation from the body of Britain, so that she may recover and regain her full strength.",
