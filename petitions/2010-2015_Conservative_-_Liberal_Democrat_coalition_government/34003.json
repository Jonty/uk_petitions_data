        "additional_details": "Owners and users of Wheelchair Accessible Vehicles (WAVs) are entitled to travel in a vehicle that has been thoroughly safety tested. Converting a car into a WAV involves major structural changes, such as cutting out and removing the floor, which affect the structural integrity of the car if the work is not carried out by experts. Worryingly, many WAVs are not subjected to the highest level of safety testing which means that the passenger travelling in a wheelchair may not be safe. Sled testing is not compulsory for converted vehicles. However, it is the only test that actively checks that the WAV can keep the passenger travelling in a wheelchair secure in a real-life accident and that the car is as safe as it can be for the driver and other passengers. Please support this petition to make sled testing compulsory for all converted vehicles and improve the safety of WAV users. This campaign is being run by charity Disabled Motoring UK.
