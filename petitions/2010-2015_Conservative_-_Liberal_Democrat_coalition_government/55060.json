        "additional_details": "Here at MyCarGossip we believe that the Government should make it a legal requirement for all private hire cab drivers to have telematics box fitted to the inside of their car. Our reasoning behind this is from extensive research which has shown that many passengers who book a private cab have ended up feeling that their lives have been at risk due to bad driving. Not only should it reduce their own insurance costs if they are driving well, but their passengers will feel a lot safer knowing that they will always be driving according to UK laws.\r\nThere are many brilliant taxi drivers out there and if they are driving consistently well, they should be rewarded for their good driving by getting repeat business. However, when you order a taxi from a private hire company it is rare that you will receive the same driver; you could end up with a driver who is speeding, making dangerous turns into roads and accelerating/braking harshly throughout the journey.",
