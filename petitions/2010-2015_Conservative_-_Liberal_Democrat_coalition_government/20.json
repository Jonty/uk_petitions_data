        "additional_details": "Reforms to Higher Education are damaging, regressive and strike at the heart of our society.\r\n\r\nInvestment in education bolsters the economy, with a return of almost \u00a33 for every \u00a31 spent. According to a study by Universities UK, the HE Sector alone has generated over \u00a345bn in UK output, whilst providing 2.5% of the jobs in the workforce [1].\r\n\r\nThe damage to social mobility will be staggering. Tuition fees disproportionally discourage those from poorer backgrounds, as well as female and disabled students, from entering Higher Education [2]. We must widen access, not restrict it.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, call upon the Government to scrap the reforms to Higher Education; to reinstate public funding to HEIs to a level comparable to pre-2011; and to abolish tuition fees.\r\n\r\n[1] http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/Publications/Documents/economicimpact3.pdf\r\n[2] http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmsctech/writev/618/sr07.htm",
