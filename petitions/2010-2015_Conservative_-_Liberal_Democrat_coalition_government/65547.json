        "additional_details": "In a report by the BBC today (25/05/2014), it was announced that after education reforms by Michael Gove, To Kill a Mockingbird has been dropped by the OCR exam board. Given the nature of the book, the lessons it teaches, issues it addresses and the quality of writing, it is an absolute disgrace that it has been dropped. I would like the Department of Education to reconsider this decision and allow students to study the works of both British and non-British writers alike, experiencing other cultures and appreciating the distinct differences between a then and now society.",
