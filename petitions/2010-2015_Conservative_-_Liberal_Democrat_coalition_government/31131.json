        "additional_details": "We are creating a petition for our campaign against the lack of respect on buses between drivers, public and students. We want better education for students as to what is appropriate and inappropriate behaviour on public transport. We also need the public to understand that students must also be respected, as students respect them.\r\nWe also would want for drivers to understand their job description. Driving an empty bus past a bus stop that does not only contain students, but also members of the public, is unacceptable and disgraceful.\r\nPlease take the time to sign our petition.",
