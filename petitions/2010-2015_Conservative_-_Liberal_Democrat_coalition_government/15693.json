        "additional_details": "For a family with an gross income of \u00a342500 to lose their child benefit is completely absurd when a familly next door earning \u00a382000 (2  individuals at \u00a341000) will still qualify. In simple terms, a single eldest child will recieve \u00a31055 per annum. To even cover this drop, when taking into account a 40% taxation and NI, you would need to earn in excess of \u00a32000 extra per year!!\r\n\r\nThe excuse from the government of saving money is very short sighted. Like many individuals I could earn \u00a33-5K more per year but choose not to for fear of loosing my allowance. What is the point? I'd rather spend the time at home with my familly. The Goverment will loose more money from not being able to tax this potential income than they will by removing the benefit! Go figure!\r\n\r\nLet all families have the potential to earn the same gross income regardless of individual wage before penalising them. Encourage prosperity in familliy units rather than hinder it.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
