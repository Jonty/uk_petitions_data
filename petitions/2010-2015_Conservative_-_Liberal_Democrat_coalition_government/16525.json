        "action": "Stop schools charging for compulsary accessories",
        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, believe that education until the age of 18 should be completely free of charge. This means that schools should not be allowed to charge for uniforms, books, and any other accessories that they will penalise the children for not having bought. While the government should give schools extra money so that they can pay for all of the childrens' books, if schools cannot afford uniforms/compulsary school bags, then they should not require all students to own them. The current system is unfair on children from low-income families, whose parents often cannot afford basic school accessories. It also excludes children from lower-income families from some state schools, who insist that the parents buy an expensive uniform before the child even starts.\r\n\r\nChildren should not be punished because their parents won't buy things.
