        "additional_details": "The Legs4Africa campaign (http://legs4africa.org/) collects redundant prosthetic limbs from health centre's around the UK and redistributes them to those in need in Africa. This April we plan to drive 200 limbs to the Gambia but need \u00a35,500 for a van and its fuel. We have been spreading the word through social media by making short films in which people get there legs out and donate online. We think that some high profile attention would greatly benefit our cause. Boris Johnson has been LegNominated. Look - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVKpvvfTIpQ . We would love to see his legs and for him to share our cause with his numerous contacts. Please sign and donate here: http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/legittoafrica/",
