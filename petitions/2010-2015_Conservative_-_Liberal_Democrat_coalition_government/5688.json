        "additional_details": "We the undersigned appeal to the government to recognise the danger posed by the EDL. It is a group that claims to be opposed to religious extremism but in fact only criticises Islam and causes a large amount of prejudice towards non extremist Muslims. In light of the amount of contact between EDL members and Anders Breivik the Norwegian Murderer in the run up to his attacks on the Norwegian Labour Party (Influenced by his own Christian fundamentalist views) coupled with the the amount of violence often seen at their demonstrations we feel that the government needs to take steps to stop this group ruining the reputation of the country we live in.
