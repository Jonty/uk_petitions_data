        "additional_details": "I myself have self excluded from many betting sites due to betting issues however its apparent no matter how many times you self exclude from different websites there are far too many sites out there. If anyone was serious about responsible gambling all betting companies and regulators should have to clear all new customers on a central database that people who seriously struggle with gambling can choose to go on to make sure they are never accepted on any betting website. Surely having one database that self excluded people from ALL betting websites is far more sensible that self excluding on each website. Lets start helping people who have problems with gambling and show that we care !",
