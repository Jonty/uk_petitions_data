        "additional_details": "Grange Children\u2019s Centre in Harrow will be closed over the summer holidays and all future school holidays. It  offers a stimulating environment for our children offering a wide range of activities. The Centre also offers a variety of services including breastfeeding support and early years\u2019 provision.The staff team truly cares about the well being and education of our children. The Centre also provides strong community cohesion by bringing together different cultures and faiths which is valuable learning for the children as well. Keeping Grange Children\u2019s centre open during school holidays will offer continuity to our children\u2019s learning, help the children maintain their routine important for their well being and help foster their established friendships amongst their peers. Hillview and Rayners Lane Children\u2019s Centres, our other choices we have if Grange is closed are over subscribed and inadequate.\r\n\r\n ",
