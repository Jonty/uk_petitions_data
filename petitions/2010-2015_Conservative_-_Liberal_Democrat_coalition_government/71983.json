        "additional_details": "I would like the government to consider a day devoted to fund raising for animal care, health and conservation. Similar to what we already do with events like Red Nose Day, I would like the government to promote and re-enforce all kinds of animal care and raise funds to donate to all charities and campaigns that aim to save all living animals other than us human beings, from the endangered Tiger's to the mistreated domestic pets closer to home. \"Stripes & Spots\" is just a way of representing and promoting awareness of animal care, much like when people wear a red nose or even jeans on \"jeans for genes day\". All donations should proceed towards companies such as RSCPA, WWF, Dogs Trust, Zoo's and Conservation trusts, Big Cat Sanctuaries etc. So please sign and help push the government to consider backing this idea to try and help to promote conserving endangered species and animal care.",
