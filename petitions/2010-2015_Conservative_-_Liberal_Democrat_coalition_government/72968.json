        "additional_details": "For disabled people in UK it is still too difficult to secure employment. UK must reintroduce the quota systems for private and/or public enterprises or\r\ninstitutions to make sure disabled people work and stay in employment and can lead a normal life. There is still too much unfairness during interviews and too much competition for disabled people to be able to secure a job without the help of quota system.\r\n\r\n the non-integration of disabled people in the labour market causes both costs for the economy and social disadvantages for the persons concerned.\r\n\r\nDisabled people want to work but the only fair help you can give is by reintroducing the quota system.",
