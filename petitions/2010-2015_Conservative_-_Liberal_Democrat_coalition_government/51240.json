        "additional_details": "The people of this country are currently at odds with their MP\u2019s , regarding remaining in European Union membership, withdrawal from the European Union as it stands, to a complete withdrawal from the European Union. The parties of all colours appear to lack trust in the British people and refuse to offer a concrete vote on deciding where our future lies in the European Union. I would like all parties to debate this very important issue and give us the actual arguments for and against remaining in membership of the European Union and why they do not trust the people of this country to actually vote on this issue. This is a matter of trust and transparency and I hope that this petition reaches the required number of votes to trigger a debate of this in the House of Commons.",
