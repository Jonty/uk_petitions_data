Currently we have no way of indicating a valid objection to the election process in this country i.e. spoilt papers are not recognised / counted.\r\n\r\nWhilst I agree we should all vote given the previous struggles / sacrifices to obtain the vote we MUST have an opportunity where applicable to demonstrate our objections to the current system / party.   The results of all those indicating \"None of The Above\" should be publicised.\r\n\r\nBy introducing this we (the public) can then influence politician / party thinking by demonstrating non-agreement with current practices / approaches.  Currently I believe there are a large number of the electorate who believe it is pointless voting as they do NOT support any of the individuals seeking election or have lost faith with the current political process.\r\n",
