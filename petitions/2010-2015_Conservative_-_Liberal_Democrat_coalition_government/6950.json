This is the best way to sucessfully reduce ANIMAL CRUELTY through puppy farming and profiteering from the breeding of dogs.  Honest dog owners would not mind paying to have this piece of mind.\r\n\r\nAlso, the government should introduce a COMPULSORY dog course for all owners that wish to own a listed DANGEROUS BREED.\r\n\r\nAll too often we hear of dogs that have attacked children, usually a dangerous breed.  These animals have been bred quite often as 'STATUS' dogs by ignorant people.  If people want to own a Dangerous Dog... THE GOVERNMENT MUST ENFORCE THEM TO DO A COURSE AND LEARN HOW TO CONTROL THEM.
