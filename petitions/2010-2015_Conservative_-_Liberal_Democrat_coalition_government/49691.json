        "additional_details": "A lead United Nations investigator has stated that there are \"strong, concrete suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof\" that the Syrian Rebels have used Sarin gas on their opponents. The same investigator Carla del Ponte also stated that there was no evidence that the Syrian govt. had used chemical weapons.\r\n\r\nIn light of this I would called for the cessation of all British assistance to the Syrian Rebels until the veracity of such claims can be verified. Until such a time that these accusations are verified or proved false then all humanitarian aid should be funnelled through the Red Cross and not given directly to the rebels who are potentially guilty of war crimes.",
