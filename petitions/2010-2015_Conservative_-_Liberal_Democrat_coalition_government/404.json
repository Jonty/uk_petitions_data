        "additional_details": "This is a petition to restore full County Borough status to the old City of Canterbury, as existed for 526 years until midnight on 31 March 1974 when it was abolished by the implementation of the Local Government Act 1972!\r\n\r\nNotes For Editors:\r\n1).  In the year 1448, King Henry VI granted Canterbury a Royal Charter, decreeing that the City should be \"of\u00a0one Mayor and one commonalty, wholly corporate for ever\";\r\n\r\n2). Forever came at midnight on 31 March 1974 with the implementation of the Local Government Act 1972 abolishing the City and County Borough of Canterbury, Herne\u00a0Bay Urban District Council, Whitstable Urban District Council and Bridge-Blean Rural District Council, replacing them by one larger Canterbury District Council;\r\n\r\n3).  The seat of King Ethelbert's kingdom has still not yet been restored to full County Borough status for the old City of Canterbury, befitting its international place in world history and why Augustine came to Canterbury!",
