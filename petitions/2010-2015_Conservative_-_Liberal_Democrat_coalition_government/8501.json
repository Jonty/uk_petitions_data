Look around you, there are plenty of things that need doing in this country. People claiming jobseekers allowance for long periods who have insufficient or no national insurance contributions should have to earn their benefits by carrying out a minimum 40 hours per week community service such as litter picking. The country would benefit from this, and it would be an incentive to people to get a job, if people fail to attend their community service then benefits would be docked, just like not getting paid because you did not go to work.
