        "additional_details": "Segways are a cheap, easy, green and fun way to travel and they are safe. They would reduce congestion and carbon footprints. They would get more people out of cars and although they are not walking, they are leaning and standing and are in the fresh air so they are also healthier. Why are they illegal? Because they are not in compliance with some 100 year old Highway Act. They should be legalized immediately",
