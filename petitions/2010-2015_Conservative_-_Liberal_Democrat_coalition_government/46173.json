        "additional_details": "Please could you consider stripping First Capital Connect of its Franchise?\r\nYou only have to look at their Twitter feed and follow @rtfirstcc to realise that customers are unhappy.\r\nThe customer service is appalling. They claim they are investing when usually it is other people doing the investing. They often during peak times run late trains, which break down and are dirty. They employ less drivers than they did when they took other the franchise.\r\nThey also have management that either lie, cover up or that are inept in investigating things and won't do anything with staff that offer bad customer service and that lie about their colleagues.",
