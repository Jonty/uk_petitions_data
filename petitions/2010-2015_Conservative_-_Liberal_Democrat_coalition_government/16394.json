        "additional_details": "The PFI and PPP initiatives are enormously wasteful and expensive. They make huge profits for big businesses, but small businesses are not even invited to bid.\r\n\r\n\"Public versus Private\" competition (PvP) would ensure that functions are kept/brought in-house when it is cheaper to do so, and that quality of service and a public ethical stance remain on the agenda.\r\n\r\nPvP would end the nonsense of a \u00a3300 PC being bought for \u00a33000; contractors on salaries of \u00a3120,000 plus; and millions of pounds of profit going from the NHS to medical suppliers, big pharma, and middlemen.\r\n\r\nWe ask you to create a new department with the right and funding to tender for any public contract, especially those that would otherwise go to PPP or PFI. Profits from the contracts would be returned to the treasury.",
