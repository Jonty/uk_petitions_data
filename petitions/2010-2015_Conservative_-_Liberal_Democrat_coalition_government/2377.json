However, they should not be able to misinform by printing out and out lies. They have an enormous influence over public opinion and use this for their own gain. Such power has lead to the recent overstepping of the mark (the phone-tapping scandal), but there are many other examples where they deliberately mis-inform the public. I would like to petition parliament to make our newspapers accountable for what they print. They should not be able to deliberately print mis-information but must print the FACTS! A greater scrutiny is needed so that they no longer have the power over our government.",
