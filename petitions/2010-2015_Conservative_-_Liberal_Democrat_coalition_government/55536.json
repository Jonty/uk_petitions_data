In recent cases in the media there appears to have been an absence of alerts raised to help protect the children and families involved. I would like the current children's milestone health checks in place to be mandatory. If the child is not seen by a health professional as agreed, then follow-ups are triggered to support the parents and monitor the child. There should be a staged approach with support of the local authorities to ensure that the child's welfare is the top priority.",
