Safety alone is not sufficient.\r\n\r\nThey should not be introduced for political reasons by pressure groups,road safety charities or cash cows for local authorities.\r\n\r\nMore seriously, the government have declared air quality management areas where pollution seriously exceeds EU limits in London and Portsmouth 20mph zones,such as Oxford street, etc. Asthma claims over 2000 lives which is half of all road deaths. Bus services have also suffered,and 'busting myths' on the 20's plenty website is misleading and factually incorrect\r\n\r\nIf this continues without proper safeguards, then there will be huge EU fines and political fallout.",
