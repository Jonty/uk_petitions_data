        "additional_details": "The current system of motorcycle riders up to 125cc with a full car licence having to re-take a CBT every 2 years is unnecessary, degrading and a waste of money.\r\n\r\nIt is not expected of car users and not everyone wants or can afford to take the full bike test.\r\nCBT tests are useful and of course have their place for first time riders, but are completely pointless and expensive when you have ridden for 2+ years without incident.\r\n\r\n It\u2019s not a safety issue as previous years of riding proves.\r\n\r\n It\u2019s money making scheme for the government to effectively tax 125 riders and continually fund rider test centres.\r\n\r\nI want the government to scrap CBT's for bikes up to 125cc when the rider has completed an initial one, has a full driving licence (and therefore road sense/skills),  Only being obliged to take another one if they have an accident or incident, when requested by the police for example if seen riding dangerously, or if below a lower age limit.\r\n",
