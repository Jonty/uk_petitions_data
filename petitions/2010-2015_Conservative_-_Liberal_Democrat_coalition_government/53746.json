        "additional_details": "We petition the government to prevent the use of Zero hours contracts used by numerous, large employers such as Sports Direct and Amazon.\r\n\r\nZero Hour contracts typically offer no holiday pay, no sick pay and no guarantee of work from day to day. This exploits the working person and hides what can effectively be unemployment.\r\n\r\nAndy Sawford MP has said \"The zero-hours contracts are highly exploitative and suit the company because it keeps people in a fragile state where they are at the beck and call of their employers.\"\r\n\r\nPlease end this exploitative culture now.",
