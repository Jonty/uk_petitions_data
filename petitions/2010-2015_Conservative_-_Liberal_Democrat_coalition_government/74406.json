It should be a condition of office that all MPs undergo a period of one month living solely on Jobseeker's Allowance including signing on and being sanctioned if they are late for an appointment.  This period should be independently supervised and they should have no access to their normal bank accounts or to funds from other people.  A row of abandoned houses in some deprived area could be used for this purpose.  The results should be published before the MP is allowed to take office.  ",
