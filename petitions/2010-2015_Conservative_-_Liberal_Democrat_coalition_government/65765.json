        "additional_details": "The major Banks should be encouraged to contribute a minimum of \u00a3500 million or better still, \u00a31 Billion each, per annum into a scientific research fund targeted at providing cures or significant improvements in treatment for major life-threatening diseases and illnesses. e.g. Cancer, Diabetes, Dementia, AIDS, Malaria etc. I believe that this will have the effect of restoring confidence and trust in the Banks - via social responsibility and more importantly, bring about significant reductions in NHS healthcare costs and major long-term health improvements in the general population.",
