        "additional_details": "Every year countless teachers are subjected to false allegations. These allegations ruin their lives and have the potential to ruin their careers.\r\n\r\nTeachers have often been named in the media, usually local newspapers, who add these articles to their online archive.\r\n\r\nWhen the allegation is eventually proved false these internet articles are not removed. This makes it extremely difficult for teachers to re enter a career that they have worked hard at and love so much.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the government to force media outlets to remove all articles relating to teachers whose allegations did not result in conviction.",
