        "additional_details": "I strongly believe that all students sitting a particular GCSE or A level in an exam season should be answering the same questions to ensure fair testing. The paper for one board may be very difficult, while another may be a particularly pleasant one. Altering grade boundaries is not enough to make one student's A grade equal to another student's.\r\nJoining exam boards would also reduce the number of mistakes in papers. Every exam season there are mistakes made by exam boards, which is unacceptable and unhelpful to students. The existing exam boards should at least each be assigned different subjects (Eg Edexcel set Biology papers, AQA do Chemistry etc) if merging is not possible.",
