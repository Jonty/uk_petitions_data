This would generate some \u00a3500M per year (VAT exc). After 10 years, \u00a35 Billion (VAT exc).\r\n\r\nIt's not extorting people, it's just and entry fee to one of the greatest countries the world has seen. To charge \u00a330 GBP to enter Mexico when their is not much there apart from hotels and beaches, I believe we could do this without a reduction in tourism.",
