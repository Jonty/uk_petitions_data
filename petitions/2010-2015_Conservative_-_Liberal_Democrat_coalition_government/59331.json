        "additional_details": "Due To the increase of deaths and dangerous road conditions of the A92 once you are passed freuchie this is single carriage way that hosts a vast amount of vehicles per day (easily in the thousands). The road itself is just over 16 miles. Although this is a lot of work and money it would be a lot safer if it were made a dual carriageway. I urge the department of transport to move away from stupid speed cameras which don't prevent accidents and use the money wisely to help save lifes.",
