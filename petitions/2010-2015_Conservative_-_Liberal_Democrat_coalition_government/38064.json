        "additional_details": "The creation of money with interest owed on it from it's creation is a unsustainable system. We need to give our government the power to create money without interest due on it. If money is created through loans with interest due, with only the principle being brought into existence, then there will never be enough money in our financial system to repay the interest owed. This means there is always going to be an ever increasing amount of dept in the system and that defaults are going to forever increase.\r\nThis principle of money creation will always led to an ever increasing dept (both personally and by government).\r\nPlease sign this petition if you believe that the creation of our countries money supply should be within the power of the people (our representatives) and without interest due on it. If we end dept based money creation the rest of the world will follow our example and the world can tackle the world dept crisis. Thank you",
