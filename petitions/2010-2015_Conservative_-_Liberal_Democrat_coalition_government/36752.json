        "additional_details": "Lets face it, almost everyone flashes their main beams to let others know that they are giving permission to others to have the right of way. OR after being given the right of way, people flash their headlights to say thank you for giving me right of way.  As it is now, under rule 110 of the highway code, it means you are just showing other drivers you are there. I dont know statistics but if everyone uses their lights for two different purposes; one saying 'dont go im here' and the other saying 'you have my permission to go' crashes probably happen. Either drill it in harder that you shouldn't flash head lights for permission or change it to the more common accepted view of what people use them for in real life.",
