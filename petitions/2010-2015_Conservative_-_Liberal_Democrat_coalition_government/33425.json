The process is designed for people with extreme health issues which have caused them to become dangerously underweight, to aid them nutritionally. Using KEN for weight loss purposes sends out a dangerous message about health, nutrition and weight loss. It will cost the NHS in the long term as this method of extreme loss has physical and mental health side effects. it is glamourising a traumatic process that so many people have forced upon them as a means to saving their life from conditions such as anorexia.
