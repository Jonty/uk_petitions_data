        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to ensure Her Majesty's Government Inspector is given the freedom to reject the South Cambridgeshire Local Plan on the grounds of questionable soundness and unsustainability at the forthcoming Inquiry. A new settlement of 3,500 houses has been proposed for Bourn Airfield and a further 2,200 houses at West Cambourne. Over 1700 local residents have already objected to the inclusion of these sites for development during the South Cambs District Council\u2019s consultation process. These objections have, until now, been summarily ignored. These are unsustainable locations as they are sited far away from areas of employment. The local transport infrastructure is poor and would necessitate intolerable traffic congestion for existing and new residents with an additional 28,000 car journeys a day.\r\n\r\nPLEASE support our petition to ensure that South Camb's Local Plan excludes unsound and unsustainable settlements on Bourn Airfield and in West Cambourne.",
