        "additional_details": "Set up a system where all people who are in receipt of Unemployment Benefit should be made to accrue community work hours each week before being paid anything.\r\n\r\nThe system could be used to do the tens of thousands of jobs that need to be done around the community, from keeping paths open, cleaning streets of litter, planting, helping elderly and disabled.\r\n\r\nIt would provide a sense of achievement, pride, community cohesion and more over ensure everyone who can work is paying in to the system.  In addition if the army of unemployed where deployed effectively by councils etc we would see a significant reduction in council costs.\r\n\r\nNobody who is fit to work should receive benefit unless they work in some way at the recognised hourly minimum rate.\r\n\r\nI think this would solve so many problems, and ensure fairness across society.  Surely a win win for all.",
