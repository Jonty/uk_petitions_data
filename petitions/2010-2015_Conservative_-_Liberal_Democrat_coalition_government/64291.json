        "additional_details": "I am petitioning for the former Takeley Primary School in Roseacres to be reopened.\r\n\r\nTakeley has grown and grown and a new purpose built school was opened in 2012, resulting in the old school closing.  Due to high numbers of applicants for SEP 2014 at least 22 children from the catchment area have not gained a place at Takeley Primary school.  They have been offered a place nearly 5 miles away surrounding schools.\r\n\r\nRoseacres is currently used as a temporary preschool     but otherwise would be derelict. It also was a temporary home for a Braintree School victim to a fire.\r\n\r\nWould it not make more sense to reopen the school and allow other children in the village to go to a local school.  This would also potentially create local jobs for example Receptionist, Teaching assistants, cooks, cleaners and caretakers.  This would make a big impact on the village.\r\n\r\nThere are a large number of concerned parents who agree with this and would appreciate any support.",
