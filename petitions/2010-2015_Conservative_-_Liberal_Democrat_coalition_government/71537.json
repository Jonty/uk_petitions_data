In the UK alone, the number of permissions granted for civilian use of drones in congested areas increased 40-fold between 2006 and 2013.\r\n\r\nWe request urgent Legislation that will enforce a definitive position for civil drone use. It should encompass safety, data protection and privacy, while preserving an opportunity for the UK to create and derive benefits from this enormously beneficial technology.\r\n\r\nWe need 10,000 signatures to gain a formal response from the relevant Government Department and 100,000 signatures for this e-petition to be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee.\r\n",
