There is significant doubt that income from diamonds in the Marange field will contribute to sustainable economic and social development in Zimbabwe. If the allegations made by the BBC Panorama episode, and others, are true, there must be an immediate end to all diamond exports from Zimbabwe and an investigation of crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court.\r\n\r\nWe would strongly urge the UK Government and European Union to:\r\n(1)\tLobby the Kimberley Process to reverse the decision made earlier this year to allow the export of diamonds from two mines in the Marange region.\r\n(2)\tLobby the Kimberley Process to instigate an urgent, thorough and independent investigation of the allegations made.\r\n(3)\tAct decisively and rapidly on the findings of this investigation.",
