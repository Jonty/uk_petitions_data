        "additional_details": "Domestic abuse a huge problem for thousands of people in England alone. Anyone can be the victim of abuse yet in 2013 there was only 78 spaces available for male victims of domestic abuse in the U.K and 45 of those spaces could be taken up by either gender. Now compare this to the 4000 spaces available for women alone. More than 830,000 men fall victim to domestic abuse every single year, making up a third of all victims. So why are so few spaces available for these men to seek refuge? This petition will ensure that help is available for those who are in need of it.",
