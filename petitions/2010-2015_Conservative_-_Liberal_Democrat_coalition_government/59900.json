The idea is to go by the way of law and of one person\u2019s individual rights to employment and Religion, that one person's right to open a shop is the correct endorsement, what the change of law looks like in practice. The gist of the argument is contained in a letter to local MP Jamie Reed. This can be discovered on my blog. As can the Petition details.\r\n\r\nhttp://johnfbtuckersblog.blogspot.co.uk/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
