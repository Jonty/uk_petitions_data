Making a monthly check mandatory would reveal most neglect and abuse. Failure to attend would result in social workers having access.\r\n\r\nThis is the next best thing rather than allowing the state to have instant access to everyones home, as that would breach human rights and would be open to abuse.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment parents leave the hospital, until that child is starting school (and lets not forget some don't even go to school), babies and toddlers are off the radar. This is simply not good enough. If people do not have family or friends looking out for that child, who will?",
