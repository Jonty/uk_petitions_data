        "additional_details": "Introduce state schools which reward the good pupils\r\n\r\n. \u00a310/\u00a320 per week depending on the grade and effort of the pupil (Based on the American system)\r\n\r\n. In order to analyse the progress of each pupil make them sit a compulsory practise exam paper per week or introduce a structured online progress system (such as the Khan Academy website)\r\n\r\n. Allow the pupils to sit their exams when THEY feel ready. This will stop the stupid two/three weeks of cramming in all their exams and encourage self study in order to progress in life quicker. If they fail give them a chance to have one free re-sit.\r\n\r\n. STOP making school compulsory, this will put more responsibility on the shoulders of young people and make them realise that education is a priviledge. If they miss school and get low grades (below C) at the end of the month they risk being expelled from the school. This will also kick out the bullies.",
