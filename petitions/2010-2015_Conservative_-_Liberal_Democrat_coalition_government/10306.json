        "additional_details": "Many children leave primary school lacking the educational skills necessary for secondary and further education thus in which they are also likely to fail. Dysfunctional families result in children developing poor morals and inadequate communication skills, which together limit employment opportunities and a satisfying role in society. It is vital to get the basics right at an early age and not as is current practice to take remedial action at a later stage.\r\nThe government needs to consider and prioritise the \u201cAcademy\u201d model for primary education, with reduced class size, extended school hours, an enhanced curriculum to substitute for poor parenting, and a social aspect to promote citizenship.\r\n",
