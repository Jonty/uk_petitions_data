        "additional_details": "The money invested in the building and de-commissioning of nuclear power stations and in the storage of the nuclear industry's toxic, radioactive waste for centuries to come, should, instead, be invested in providing every property with systems to capture alternative sources of energy - solar, wind and ground heat.\r\n\r\nThe governments energy policy should be focusing on making every property self-sufficient for energy rather than taking its current, cavalier and short-sighted approach to the safety of out environment for future generations by committing to nuclear power and bolstering the profits of energy companies.  The long-term safety of our planet is so much more important than our commercial needs.",
