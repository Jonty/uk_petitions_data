Too often have non-smokers infringed the rights of those who quite legally and quite enjoy tobacco products. I also propose that, by legislating for this, everyone will be happier as they will be more chilled out, more taxes will be raised at a time of austerity and will more than pay for any relating health issues, there will be more job creation resulting from larger tobacco and healthcare industries and economic growth will increase as a result and the pensions crisis will be resolved as lower life expectancy will lower the number of claimants.",
