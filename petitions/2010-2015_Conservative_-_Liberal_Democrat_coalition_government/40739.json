        "additional_details": "We the undersigned ask the government to reduce immigration from the 500,000 a year intake to at most 5000 a year. The reasons are as follows:\r\n-The UK is a small Island with finite land area\r\n-We have a human population of 62million which is growing\r\n-We are one of the densist countries in the EU\r\n-Our large human population is squeezing wildlife towards extinction.  Bumble bees, honey bees and many other species are threatend by loss of habitat due to human building.\r\n-As more people enter the UK, more houses, roads, schools, shops and other construction will have to be done.  This will destory the little remaining indiginous wildlife habitat.\r\n-Since 1930, 98% of natural wildflowers that are bumble bee habitat have been lost to farming, and human construction.\r\nGrass lands, wildflower meadows, ponds, bogs, woods and more will be lost.",
