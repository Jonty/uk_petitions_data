Trevor Holden, CEO of LBC, has confirmed in writing that the Council do not receive detailed accounts.\r\n\r\nWe would like the Government to take the following action:-\r\n\r\nTo instruct LSCT and LBC to cancel the planned Wigmore, Sundon Park and mobile library closures.\r\n\r\nLBC  and LSCT to be instructed by the Dept, of Culture to continue to provide this statutory library service for the whole town.\r\n\r\nTo make LCST  accountable for the money they have received and spent and be forced to provide detailed accounts for the council and public to see.\r\n\r\n\u00b7\r\n",
