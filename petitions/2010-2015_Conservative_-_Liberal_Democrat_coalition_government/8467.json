Many cyclists are responsible for accidents that cause damage to pedestrians, other cyclists and motor vehicles. Without insurance it is impossible to force cyclists to pay for the damage they cause. At least third party insurance would enable the victims to at least repair the damage to themselves and their vehicles. I am a cyclist. ",
