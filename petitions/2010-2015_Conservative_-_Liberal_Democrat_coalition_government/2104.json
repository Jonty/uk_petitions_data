        "additional_details": "It is very easy and quick to get to and away from London if you live reasonably close. Public Transport in London is excellent as well but public transport away from London needs reform.\r\n\r\nFor example: Train from Glasgow Central to Manchester Piccadilly takes between 3hrs 10 mins to 3hrs 35 mins (not including delays) whilst a train from Manchester Piccadilly to London is 2hrs 10 mins. The difference between these 2 routes is just 10 miles.\r\n\r\nI think this is the same all over the country whether you live in Cornwall and Devon or East Anglia or Scotland or Wales, public transport is just not as good as it could be or as it is in London.",
