        "additional_details": "The BBC have decided to stall the broadcasting of Top Gear till 2013 due to \"X Factor\" being on at the same time on another Channel.  Top Gear is highly loved and watched Sunday Evening program and it's one of the BBC's most watched TV show ever worldwide!\r\n\r\nThis petition has been created to raise the issue that the BBC can change the time or day that Top Gear is broadcasted instead of stalling the show because of a stupid Reality TV show thats shown on another channel at the same time, that not everyone likes to watch.\r\n\r\nWe pay a Licence fee to watch the shows we love and they are being ruined by the BBC, just like F1 in the UK.",
