        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that people in the UK should live in warm, dry, well-lit homes, with access to hot water.\r\nWe want the government to challenge profit-making energy companies to reduce their prices. All six big suppliers have hiked their fees leaving more than 10 million people facing a daily struggle to heat their homes.\r\nThe problem is not one of a lack of competition but a ripping off of middle-income earners, the low-paid, the retired and the unemployed. This can\u2019t continue.\r\n\u2022\tEnergy companies must be challenged regarding the ever-increasing costs in search for profit.\r\nUK workers cannot face this never-ending increase in costs of energy \u2013 meaning shareholders make a profit while we are literally left out in the cold.\r\n",
