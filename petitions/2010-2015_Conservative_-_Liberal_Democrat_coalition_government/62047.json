        "additional_details": "This e-petition is calling on the Department for Culture, Media to call on the BBC Director General to reconsider his plans to axe BBC Three next year as part of the BBC's current cost cutting programme.\r\n\r\nScrapping the channel, and relegating content to the internet at a time with a slashed budget, would be a mistake.\r\n\r\nThe BBC needs to cater for all ages, and this petition is designed to give young people a voice about these cut backs.\r\n\r\nUnlike other BBC channels it takes risks. It offers live debates and documentaries.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the BBC does not do enough to cater for young adults, and scrapping BBC Three from cable, satellite, and terrestrial television would be a big mistake.\r\n\r\nAn online move would mean less money for quality programming, would restrict access for those in many rural areas, as well as those without an active broadband connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
