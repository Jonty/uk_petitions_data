        "additional_details": "HMCIC Tom Winsor attended the National Police Memorial event in Cardiff on Sunday 29th September 2013 wearing a made-up Police uniform.  Winsor has not earned the right to wear any kind of Police uniform as he has never been a Police officer, has never had to face the physical and emotional dangers of policing, and continually demonstrates an absence of empathy for Police officers' lives by his draconian and uncaring war on their pay, pension and working conditions.\r\n\r\nHe publicly dishonoured our dead fallen officers by parading himself as a Police officer, when he is not.  This is absolutely unaccaptable to both living officers - serving or retired - and to the memory of the dead ones, represented as they were in Cardiff by their survivor families and loved ones.\r\n\r\nHis wearing of this uniform is a national disgrace.  He should be barred from ever again wearing it.\r\n\r\nSupport this petition if you agree with this.",
