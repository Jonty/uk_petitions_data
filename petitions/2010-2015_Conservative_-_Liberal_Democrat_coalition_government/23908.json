        "additional_details": "Make December an income tax free month; make up the short fall through quantitative easing. Drive up peak Christmas shopping and help the economy! More effective than bank asset purchase backed quantitative easing regime based on the hope that banks will pass on the benefits. Better than VAT cuts, which make purchases cheaper, but require additional spending to be useful, something many people just can't afford right now.",
