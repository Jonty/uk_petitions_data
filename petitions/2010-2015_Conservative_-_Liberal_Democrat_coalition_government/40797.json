When relativ es are asked to donate loved ones organs' it is an extremely emotional and traumatic time.  By changing to the opt out system, this could save lives and reduce the numbers of people waiting for organs.  In addition, potentially, this could reduce the drain on the NHS for treatment of patients who are on the transplant waiting list.\r\n\r\nThis system has been used in various other countries with great success and it could be an enormous success in the UK.",
