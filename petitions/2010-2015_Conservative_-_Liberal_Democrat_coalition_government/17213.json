They provide as much as they can for our Services, other charities canvas all year round, Poppy sellers don't. We want our Poppy sellers to continue every year wherever they wish, it is disgraceful and an insult to our Warriors to think of stopping them, I am disgusted and appalled that anyone in Britain would even think this let alone try to enforce it.
