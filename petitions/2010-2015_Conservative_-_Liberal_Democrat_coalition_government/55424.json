        "additional_details": "Fox hunting is a sport which has been in Britain from the 16th century. The foxes are pests, they attack livestock and do damage to wild and valuable animals including baby rabbits and lambs which they barbarically massacre.\r\nThe countryside has a unique and ancient way of life. Don't spoil it by ruining one of our traditions that's helped the country and is not just merely a sport for fun.\r\nFox hunting is something that many people feel very passionate about and I have grown up hunting from a young age as did my parents and grandparents. Some city folk believe that it is wrong to hunt although having no knowledge on the subject. We do not want the tyranny of the minority could cause the demolition of this tremendous activity.\r\n",
