        "additional_details": "Filey Swimming Pool was built in the 1970s following money raised from local people.  It was then handed over to North Yorkshire County Council.\r\n\r\nThe community has been informed the pool will close in March due to economic factors.  Understandably pools are expensive to run and generate little revenue, but surely the value the pool gives to the community exceeds this.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this epetition so the matter of government involvement in the protection of local amenities can be discussed in the house.",
