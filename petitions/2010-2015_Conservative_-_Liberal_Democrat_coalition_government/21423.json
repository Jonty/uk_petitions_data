        "additional_details": "Some \"Road Safety Partnerships\" choose a fast dual carrigeway that is built like a motorway then install speed cameras and a 30 mph limit. (Maybrick King Way, Southampton is one example).  Motorists from out of town are ensnared.  The partnerships claim that they cannot paint \"30\" on the road or put up \"30\" repeater signs because it is illegal.  I suggest that this law (if it exists) be repealed forthwith as at present it is being used purely for entrapment and making money.  In many areas they do paint \"30\" on the roads so are the councils breaking the law?",
