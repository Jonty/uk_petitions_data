        "additional_details": "When British tourists arrive in Turkey, the Immigration Police take a crisp ten pound note from each person. This does not deter the thousands of British tourists who travel to Turkey each year.\r\n\r\nSimilarly a British tourist entering the USA must have a prepaid ESTA, and around 5.5million British citizens visit the USA each year.\r\n\r\nWe have introduced a \u00a310 nominal fee for all foreign HGV drivers entering the UK.\r\n\r\nSo I petition the Government to introduce a nominal fee for all inbound foreign passengers. Heathrow, alone, saw 72.3 million passengers in 2013. Assuming half that number is comprised of foreign nationals, \u00a310 per person would bring \u00a3360million to the country's coffers from just one of the country's many ports of entry. Savings could then benefit the vital services such as the Police, Border Force, and the NHS.\r\n\r\n",
