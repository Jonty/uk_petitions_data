Then fit cameras in all care homes now, ideally connected to wifi so that relatives can look in at any time. Obviously beds and bathrooms need to be exempt but accessible by audio.\r\nA camera with sound in every home where carers visit would also be a good idea, linked via Wi - Fi to anyone requiring access. Nothing to hide? Then nothing to worry about.\r\nAt an average of \u00a31000 a week the cameras will not event make a dent in profits.\r\nSign up now...You may be the next one to be treated badly in care.",
