        "additional_details": "Did you know that the vast majority of trees in England are not protected? For example, this means that in most cases if a neighbour or developer decides that they want more lawn or space for a house instead of a beautiful 300 year old Oak tree they can have it cut down without asking for any permission. I want to change the law so that all deciduous trees (ones that loose their leaves in Winter) are protected if they are more than 25 years old. Then anyone who wants to chop down a tree would have to apply to the council planning office (free of charge) for permission to be able to chop it down, with the public given the right to voice their objections. Our trees need to be protected.",
