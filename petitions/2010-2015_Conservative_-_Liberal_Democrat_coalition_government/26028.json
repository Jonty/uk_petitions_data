        "additional_details": "David Beckham will be 37 years old when the 2012 Olympics start. His seemingly automatic selection for the football tournament is not only an embarrassment for the country but also an insult to the other home nations and there players.\r\nThere must be over 100 under-23 players in contention yet there seems to be an automatic place for David Beckham who hasn't played club football in the country for over 8 years. Closer to ten by the time the Olympics begin. He has played in a lower level league for 5 years and hasn't shown that he can handle the pace of the game where he'll be a decade and a half older than the players around him.\r\nHis seemingly desperation to play seems selfish and in the scheme of things, greatly unfair.\r\n",
