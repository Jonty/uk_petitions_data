        "additional_details": "I recently have been astounded by recent crime activities in my local area. For example there has been countless armed robberies in 2014 alone, with about four per week on average.\r\n\r\nThis increased crime has caused major problems for: local businesses and the economy; employees and local residents feeling unsafe and intangible impacts such as post-traumatic stress for employees.\r\n\r\nMy e-petition focuses on these recent armed robberies but also my suggested solution on the matter to protect employees of local convenience stores, as no one should feel insecure in their workplace. Therefore I suggest we follow an idea in the USA, which would mean making store panic buttons (under a counter) a legal requirement in convenience stores.\r\n\r\nI believe this is a worthy option as it would allow a quicker response time from the police force, whilst providing employees a major source of assistance during a harrowing experience.",
