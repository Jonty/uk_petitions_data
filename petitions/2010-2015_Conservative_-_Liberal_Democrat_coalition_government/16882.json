        "additional_details": "The Royal Yacht Britannia was an asset to this country and I propose that it be recommissioned in time for next years diamond jubilee. It doesn't need to be used exclusively by the Royal family, once back in service it can also be used for government and diplomatic purposes, such as a mobile embassy, as well as use in emergencies, it was designed to be used as a floating hospital in the event of war and it was used to evacuate refugees from Aden in 1986. It could also be used as a training vessel as part of either the Prince's Trust or the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, thereby helping young people better themselves.",
