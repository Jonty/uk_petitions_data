Remember the older american chain gangs. Work could be anything that benefits the community, such as farming, painting, gardening for the elderly ect. Labour force gangs from the prison should be used in areas surrounding prisons, farmers could pay a small cost towards the prisons budget for example. Make these people pay for their crimes in a way that benefits the taxpayer and not burden them.",
