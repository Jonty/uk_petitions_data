        "additional_details": "This is a petition to get lights on the A38, Streethay junction near Lichfield. I lost my brother on the 21st of February 2012 due to a hit and run incident. If the junction was fully lit his chances would have been greatly increased. This is really important to me as it is a dangerous junction and a busy trade route which unfortunately has taken the life of my dear brother.\r\n\r\nWith Street lights this junction could be made a much safer one.",
