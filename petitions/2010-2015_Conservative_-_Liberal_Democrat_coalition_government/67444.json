        "additional_details": "Taylor Wimpey plan to build 357 properties on 'Green Lung' open protected farm land, contiguous with Hollin Lane and Langley Lane in Middleton, Manchester (M24).\r\n\r\nThis prely profit-driven act of environmental vandalism will destroy the only remaining belt of open protected green farm land between central Manchester and Bamford - creating one long continuous urban sprawl reaching some 12 miles.\r\n\r\nThese houses are not needed and will destroy an area of open countryside enjoyed by thousands of people and families in the adjoing neighbours.\r\n\r\nWe request that the Government deny Taylor Wimpey's request to destroy our local environment, and refuse them panning permission for this planned development.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition.\r\n\r\nThe People vs. Taylor Wimpey.\r\n",
