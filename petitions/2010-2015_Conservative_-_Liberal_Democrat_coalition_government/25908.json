        "additional_details": "The advertised call charge for local calls is 7.95p/min, but beyond that there is something in the small print called 'setup fee' which BT informed me is 23p for each call. This means a total of 30.95 for the first minute. Then 38.90 for the second, 46.85 for the third and 54.80 for the fourth. This is a scandal and a scam that someone has dreamed up to take money from an unsuspecting public. There is no setup needed, it is done automatically. I asked over one hundred people and no one knew of this practice. If a Pensioner calls the GP for a repeat prescription, or arrange an appointment, at least a 54.80 charge. This is a National Disgrace and should be investigated by the Minister for Communications",
