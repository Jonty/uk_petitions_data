The target is for 90% of the country to be upgraded to \"superfast\" boadband speeds by 2015.\r\n\r\nThis means that 10% of the population are contributing to the cost of these contracts but without receiving any benefit from it.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to find a way to pay a subsidy to ISPs who provide broadband services in the areas not being upgraded so that those 10% of customers who will not be upgraded pay lower connection fees.",
