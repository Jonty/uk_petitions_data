This fact alone should be enough to suggest to Tony Blair that he should resign from all Public Offices, and that his wife, Cherie, should do likewise.\r\nThe vast sums of money paid to Tony Blair are, therefore, not justified from the 'Governmental Purse', and should cease to be paid forthwith.\r\nFurther, to support the action requested, many instances of Tony Blair using 'economical truths' concerning the Country entering into aggression with Middle Eastern Countries, have been uncovered.\r\nPlease take note of the views of the General Public.\r\n  ",
