Those public servants who promote and protect our freedom and democracy deserve special protection. Police officers; nurses; paramedics; teachers; social workers etc are such people. Their cold blooded murder is totally unacceptable, and any truly civilised society must impose the ultimate deterent/punishment on such offenders.",
