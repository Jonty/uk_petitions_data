No parent in their right mind would let their children be taken away and placed in danger.\r\n\r\nMr Tutt says that he has not only faced an enormous struggle trying to get his children back from South Africa, having spent more than \u00a35,000 and is now heavily in debt because of the cost of legal fees and flights.\r\n\r\nTheir holiday visa runs out on March 21 2013.
