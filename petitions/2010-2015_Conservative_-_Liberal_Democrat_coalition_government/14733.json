Therefore if they are parked on private property / public land without permission for more than 24 hours, the authorities or the owner of such land has the right to have the caravans, contents and towing vehicles removed and sent to the crusher.\r\n\r\n      To facilitate this all that is required is for the order for the scrapping of such vehicles to be authorised by the police. This notice will be duplicated and place on each vehicle. 24 hours after this notice the vehicles can be removed to the crusher.\r\n\r\n    Any costs incured will be then passed on the the previous owners of the vehicles.",
