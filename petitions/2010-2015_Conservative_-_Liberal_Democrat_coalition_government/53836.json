        "additional_details": "The BBC have recently announced the fact that they would not be covering the 2013/14 NFL season on their 5-Live Sports Extra service. With 2 sold out games at Wembley this year, and the League looking to expand the appeal of this widely popular sport across the world, surely the licence payer funded national broadcaster should be covering events like this. NFL is growing massively in the UK at the moment and by cutting off our free to enjoy coverage, the BBC is not keeping to its public service remit.",
