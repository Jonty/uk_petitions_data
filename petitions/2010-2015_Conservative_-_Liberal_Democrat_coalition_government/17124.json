        "action": "Enforce the operation of constantly monitored CCTV across the Rail Network to combat criminal activity and ensure public safety.",
        "additional_details": "Network Rail have a duty of care, which seems to be sadly lacking. We feel that they should have Constantly monitored CCTV Cameras across the rail networks, also allowing emergency response, if needed to be immediate.  At the moment there are only pre recorded cameras in place and many of these are switched off.  We feel that public safety is therefore compromised on a daily basis. The installation of monitored cameras would allow people to feel more protected. Monitored Cameras would also allow British transport police response to be quick and effective, and ensure those that  risk their lives on the railway are stopped.",
