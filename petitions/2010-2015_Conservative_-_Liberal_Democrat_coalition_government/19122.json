In order to save our failing country we must now work together to prevent the further pain and destruction caused by the conservative party. we must vanquish them from power and employ a new more fair party to begin the construction of a better future for Britain. Such a party must be made up of all political parties in order to maintain fairness and equality. Let us vote upon a mixed and truly fair system in which all may feel protected and non shal feel outnumbered nor persecuted because of thier income or any other reason. ",
