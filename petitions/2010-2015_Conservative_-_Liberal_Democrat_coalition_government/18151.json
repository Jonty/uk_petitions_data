We feel that the proposed Boundary Changes will leave Batley and Spen isolated without a representative to voice issues concerning the people of the area in parliament.\r\n\r\nThis petition is fully supported by Awaaz Media. Who have seen first hand the work done by the local MP and feel that the community would be hurt badly without a dedicated MP.\r\n\r\n",
