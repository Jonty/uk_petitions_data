        "additional_details": "my son aged 13 has had constant bullying because he has red hair. recently in class the pupils had to put up their hands to talk about 'beliefs', a girl who had previously name called my son, put up her hand and said \"people believe that ginger people do not have a soul\" all the children in the class looked at my son and laughed. the teacher did nothing to help, he chose to ignore the ginger remark and just wrote the word 'soul' on the board and asked my humiliated son 'what do you think about that? my son was distraught and after years of abuse said his only way out was suicide. Ginger people should have the right, as a minority to feel safe. Some ginger children are able to laugh it off, some ginger children are very sensitive, this can be very dangerous to some personality types, some children and adults with red hair have killed themselves, they need to be protected, I want the government to make Ginger haired people protected and that any abuse is made a hate crime.",
