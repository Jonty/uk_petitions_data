        "additional_details": "That HMG regulates the standard time moves forward by 1 hour in England and Wales.  This would reduce accidents in the winter when drivers are tired at the end of the day, and proivide considerable additional daylight time in summer for leisure and other activities, reducing dependence on energy use in domestic homes. Standardising with our main trading partners in western europe would help improve communications and business. Scotland may make up its own mind",
