This stolen property which includes the Parthenon frieze was bought by Parliament for the nation from Thomas Bruce 7th Earl of Elgin for \u00a335,000.00 in 1816. I am petitioning for an apology by the Prime Minister David Cameron to Greece for the actions of the then Parliament and the return of the Parthenon Marbles to Greece.",
