I did this because the Police force concerned and IPCC were refusing to deal with it and said any further complaints would not be responded to.\r\nBut the Government just wanted me to complain to IPCC again because they did not investigate Police.\r\nWhy not? I think they should. Otherwise how will I get justice? I was cautioned for a crime I did not commit!   ",
