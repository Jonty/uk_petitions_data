        "additional_details": "We are calling to the government to change the legal age of driving from 18 to 16.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost stupid that 16 year old people are allowed to reproduce and have babies, but have no ability to drive.\r\n\r\nSixteen year old people are in fact very mature, and this law would benefit there lives, giving them the ability to access more resources, benefiting the economy. Plus, since the law states that 16 year old youths cannot drink alcohol, fewer drunk drivers will be on the road. The government will benefit from the road tax paid, and as the amount of electric cars are on the increase, pollution will not rise visibly.\r\n\r\nDriving is an almost essential life skill to have, and driving at 16 will be beneficial to making youths more independent. It will also benefit the economy.  ",
