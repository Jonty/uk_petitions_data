The same applies to Single parents, they too lose out.\r\n\r\nThis is grossly unfair and is discriminatory towards the DISABLED, their CARERS & SINGLE PARENTS and this flaw in the system must be reviewed & made more fair. Child benefit should be based on a HOUSEHOLD income level & not on earnings of one Parent.\r\n",
