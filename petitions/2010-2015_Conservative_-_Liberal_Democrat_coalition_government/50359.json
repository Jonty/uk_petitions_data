        "additional_details": "It is far to easy to view FREE streamable pornographic video's at the click of a button, a child's innocence and mental well-being is a harsh price to pay at the hands of irresponsible sites that should be kept closed off to the general browsing public until 8:30PM in the UK. At the very least, the Police and Government should shut these sites down or plague them with viruses until they have a secure Sign-In front portal / gateway.\r\nCredit Card payments should be requested by anyone viewing 18+ rated content BEFORE 8:30PM but FREE after that time.\r\nThe undersigned feel these steps would make these sites a lot less accessible by children.
