        "additional_details": "Half of a deceased spouses monthly pension should be paid to the living spouse.  My parents had always owned their own business so when my father became seriously ill there was no way he could help sustain it. My mother could not do it alone and after his death she struggled financially on only a small state pension. My father had paid a full stamp for over 50 years and his pension died when he did. It's terrible. His pension or even half of it should have been paid monthly to his wife. It's a help to a widow already coming to terms with her husbands death and it should be the the deceased persons right to leave half of their pension that they have paid in to for a loved one to continue living without the extra financial burden. Please help support this petition. It is not fair to work and pay into a pension only to die and not profit from it at all and then not even be able to leave it to your loved ones.",
