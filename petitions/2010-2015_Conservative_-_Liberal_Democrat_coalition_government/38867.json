        "additional_details": "The Hampshire and isle of wight wildlife trust (HWT) in conjunction with yately council are proposing to erect a boundary fence around the common and free graze a herd of around 60 cattle on the the land. The common is used for a wide variety of hobbies ie: dog walking, mountain biking and horse riding. We feel that the HWT have not properly consulted with the public especially the horse riders and equestrian businesses in the area that will potentially loose business and have to close. We have started a paper petition, but feel so strongly about this subject. We will loose our common if this plan goes ahead. Please help us save our common.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
