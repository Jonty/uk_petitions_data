        "action": "Petition to cut the political parties marketing expenditure",
        "additional_details": "Political parties marketing is biased and does not educate the public about politics. In fact in my experience it is usually misleading.\r\n\r\nThe spending is based on the belief that expensive marketing campaigns win votes. Otherwise why would parties spend vast amounts of money on such campaigns? It is therefore based on the premise that money can buy votes.\r\n\r\nUnder this premise the government will have to pander not only to voters but also to potential backers and/or existing backers of election campaigns (who buy votes for it).\r\n\r\nAs such it is at best a failed attempt to pervert the democratic process and at worst a successful one.\r\n\r\nSign this petition and let it be known that this is unacceptable and that there needs to be legislation introduced to greatly reduce the political parties electoral spending, This is in order to reduce the degree of leverage that money can have on the government.\r\n",
