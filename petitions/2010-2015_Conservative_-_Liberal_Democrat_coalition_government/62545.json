We were married in June 2013 and she was told in July 2013 she had cancer, we have a 7year old son.\r\nAfter going to the doctors over a period of a few years with vaginal bleeding they blamed it on her contraception and and her weight loss as she want down to 7st.\r\nWhen we found out they said it had been there for around 4 years and it had spread from the cervics to here Virginia walls and lymph nodes and pelvic area.\r\nAfter intense chemo and radiotherapy 5 days a week for 8 weeks she has been very lucky and pulled through but is still very poorly.\r\nSo please help us take the fight to the government to get the age of smear tests down to the age of 16/17.\r\nEveryone in the country needs to sign every petition going for this to get the government to stand up and take notice now!!!!",
