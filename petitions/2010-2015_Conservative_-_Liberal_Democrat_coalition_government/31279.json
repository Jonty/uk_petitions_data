        "additional_details": "The Memorial Park in Aberfan has been partially removed with no plans by the council to replace.  The park is located on the site of the old Pantglas School where 116 children lost their lives in 1966.  The park has always been central to children's lives in Aberfan, it's removal is devasting for everybody in the community as well as visitors to the area.  The community would like the park to be replaced to secure the heritage of our community and to ensure our children have a safe and happy place to play.",
