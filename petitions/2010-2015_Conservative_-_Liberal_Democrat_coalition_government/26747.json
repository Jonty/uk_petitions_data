        "additional_details": "As somebody who has worked all my life and contributed both income tax and national insurance, I feel aggrieved that there are people who appear to be quite happy to rely on Jobseekers allowance and a whole host of other benefits with little or no attempt to seek employment. In light of this, I propose that those on Jobseekers be used within their communities to keep the streets clean throughout the year, clear snow & ice from pavements to assist those vulnerable people in the community such as the elderly or infirm and carry out any other tasks to the benefit of the community. As many local authorities are feeling the effects of cost cutting, this would serve to provide vital services to local areas.",
