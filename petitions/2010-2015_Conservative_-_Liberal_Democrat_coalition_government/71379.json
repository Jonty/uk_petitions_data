        "additional_details": "Everyday there are queues over a mile long at Stonehenge due to people slowing down to have a \"look\". On order for the traffic to flow on this part of the A303 only 2 solutions appear, 1 make the road a dual carriageway (but due to the area being of English Heritage this is hard to come by), or 2 place a high fence (wooden or paneled in order to be opaque) along the A303 to stop people from dangerously driving, slowing and causing queues for other travellers.  Therefore I propose they build a fence to increase the flow of traffic and the safety of travellers. ",
