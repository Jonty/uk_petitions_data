        "additional_details": "On the 11th February 2015, Epping Forest District Council, granted planning permission, EPF/2853/14, to a riding school to demolish stables and an indoor riding school at High Beech, Loughton, Essex, and to replace these with 5 executive houses, claiming that stables are Brown field and therefore are not regulated as they would if classified as Green field. This decision will have disastrous consequences for Green Belt in Epping Forest and across the English Countryside.\r\nWe call on The Right Honourable Eric Pickles MP to review and overturn this planning approval due to\r\n\u2022\tThis conversion of use is not permitted by the NPPF.\r\n\u2022\tThe Seven Pillars of Public Life was disregarded as councillors failed to disclose their interest in knowing the applicant who was a fellow councillor.\r\n\u2022\tCllr S Stavrou was less than transparent when building a gated access road from the highway to the indoor school without planning consent.\r\n",
