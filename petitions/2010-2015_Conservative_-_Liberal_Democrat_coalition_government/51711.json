        "additional_details": "To suffer mental or physical deterioration in old age is a misfortune.  To have to negotiate a means-tested system of funding at the same time distracts from the main need - the health and care of the individual - and is causing terrible suffering for families, in particular those caring for their loved ones. Social care for the elderly should be freely available, at the time when it is needed, fully funded from taxation and national insurance -  as it is in Japan.  A compassionate society would do nothing less. ",
