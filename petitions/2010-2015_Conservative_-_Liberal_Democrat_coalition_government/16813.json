        "additional_details": "St Mary's Church, Hayling Island ,Hants are planning to build over the graves of my Dad, Nan, great Grandparents and 2 Great Uncles. The last of whom's ashes were buried in 2006 so the pain of loss is still fresh and also 6/7 other people graves, there is no plan to move bodies just build over them.\r\nThey have previously attempted this and failed, this the third try to do this building, on the site is a Yew tree under a protection order but this doesn't seem to be an issue.\r\nThe church are not willing to consider other options which we have suggested and are determined to build this extension which will include putting toilets over the graves.\r\nI believe this is so wrong as I think my family and the other families with people buried near them should left to rest in peace.\r\nI would like to the government to introduce laws to prevent building on graves of recently buried people and where there are surviving family members.\r\nPlease sign this petition and invite your friends.\r\n",
