        "additional_details": "Currently, in the UK, Abortion is legal as long as the baby is under 24 weeks. This meant that it was legal for 189,100 abortions to happen in 2009 in the UK.New statistics reveal that a total of 48 women had had 7 or more abortions, in the UK alone. This is completely unacceptable!\r\nWe call upon the government to end this murderous crime of taking away an unborn baby's life- it is as bad as ending an adult's life. Furthermore, more help and advice should be given to new mothers to ensure they are aware of the alternatives to abortion. Please Abort Abortion!",
