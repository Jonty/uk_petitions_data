When you get your confirmation e-mail, all signatures would be confirmed with a single action.\r\n\r\nIt would increase the amount of participation significantly.\r\n\r\nI also recommend that e-petitions not only have a signature \u2018FOR\u2019, but also \u2018AGAINST\u2019.  This would allow citizens the ability to vote down a motion, just like they do in the Houses of Parliament.  It would take away the need to create a separate petition that directly opposes the first.\r\n",
