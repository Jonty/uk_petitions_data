        "additional_details": "A large number of so-called 'accident claim specialists' are operating in the UK and advertise aggressively, particularly on daytime TV.\r\n\r\nThese companies have contributed to the blame and claim culture that we see in our society today and has allowed people who have been involved in extremely minor, and sometimes entirely fabricated, accidents to claim from a business or individual.  This has meant that employers have to employ overly zealous health and safety measures which increase costs and ultimately cost jobs.\r\n\r\nSuch companies should be banned from advertising - the genuine and deserving cases will know if they have a case for a claim without needing to see an advert from a greedy solicitor looking to make a gain from someone else's misfortune.",
