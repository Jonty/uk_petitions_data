        "additional_details": "Last year, my medication was ceased production so I had to change it. It took me 3 attempts to get it right, but each time, I had to pay \u00a37.65 even though the first two medications I tried I only took 1 or 2 days worth of medication when I was given 2 months worth.\r\n\r\nI find that if my body disagreed with the new medication that to having to pay again is a disgrace. Providing you bring back the remaining prescription, the chemist should be give me a new medication for free as like an exchange.",
