        "additional_details": "Our troops have been fighting a war in Afganistan for too long now. When our men and women sign up to the armed forces, they sign up  to defend their country but they are not doing that they are simply helping another country fight their war. When the riots broke out an officer at Scotland yard said they were not going to bring in the army because there was nothing more that they could do than the police and that there was little of our armed forces left so instead our police forces were left to struggle and our own country was left to struggle against these riots and peoples lives were ruined because our men and women have been sent of to fight someone else's war so if you think its time that our troops were withdrawn and brought back home then sign this pettion",
