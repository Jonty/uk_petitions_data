        "additional_details": "Over the past 5 years, Britain's recent former Prime Ministers have received over \u00a31.7 million of taxpayers money under the Public Duties Cost Allowance.\r\nThe allowance is provided to former PM's after they have left office, for performing public duties such as answering letters and making public appearances.\r\nTony Blair claimed \u00a3273000. John Major, who set up the fund, claimed \u00a3490000, and Margaret Thatcher claimed \u00a3535000.\r\nIn the current difficult financial climate, with the majority of the population suffering through inflation, pay freezes and job losses; with the government making cut backs in all aspects of public funding, affecting essential services such as health, care for the elderly, children and the vulnerable, education, community and youth services, the emergency services and armed forces; this allowance is disproportionate, unnecessary and unaffordable. This petition calls for it's removal.",
