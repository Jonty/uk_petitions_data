        "additional_details": "The community in Siebert Road and surrounding streets is of huge importance to the families who live here. We have all worked hard to build it, sharing time at events such as 'The Big Lunch' and BBQ's. However worryingly, there is a deadly issue which is effecting all of us and until now we have felt powerless to change it. What is it? Pollution! Our gardens back on to the A102 causing constant intrusive noise and a massive pollution issue. A recent environmental study has found the pollution levels in our neighbourhood are 2.5 times higher than EU limits. We urge the government to ensure noise and pollution barriers are installed along all residential areas of the A102, as well as pollution reducing trees. The health of our children is paramount and with 2 schools nearby this affects more than the families who live in the area. Together we can ensure the health and well being of our children and the environment, join our petition and make the government accountable. Thank you",
