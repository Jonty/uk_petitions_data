No party has lived up to their pre election bravado it is now time that it became law that any party not addressing or debating their election promises and manifestos be charged with the offence of breech of promise after their first term of office.\r\n\r\nThe pollutions of today are liars and cheats only in politics to serve their own interests which has been proven by recent court cases against those not as smart as their fellow comrades in deceit\r\n\r\n",
