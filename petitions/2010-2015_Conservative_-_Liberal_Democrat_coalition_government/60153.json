        "additional_details": "House Builders are able to build on Flood Plains.\r\nThis facility cause a number of issues.\r\n1. Flood Plains being built on causes extreme flooding, in the surrounding areas.\r\n2. Normally most of the water on a flood plain soaks into the ground thereby replenishing the water table. This helps to avoid a water shortage in the Summer.\r\n3. The distress and money it costs to put things right after a flood, and the loss of personal possessions. The policy the government has in place is not working and only concerns one area.\r\nWe need immediate action to address this issue and legislate to stop building on flood plains.",
