Higher rate tax needs to be increased to 75%, still substatially lower than 40 years ago! If there is real concern of threats of entrepreneurs leaving then all G20 should be encouraged to do the same, this would help reduce world government borrowing and thus ease present financial crisis. Also if there is concern about bottom end higher rate tax payers then the starting point could be increased slightly, say an additional \u00a310,000. ",
