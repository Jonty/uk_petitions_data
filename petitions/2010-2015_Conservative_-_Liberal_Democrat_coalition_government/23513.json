        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister intends to allow buyers of new homes to borrow up to 95% of their value. This is to be supported by the mortgage indemnity scheme, in which the government will underwrite part of the risk to lenders.\r\n\r\nIt is actually taxpayers who will underwrite the lenders' risks thereby providing further financial support to the banking sector which continues to prosper and pay bonuses while ordinary people are subjected to Government cuts to vital services and facilities which should be funded by tax revenue.\r\n\r\nIt is not the taxpayers' duty to support the banking sector.\r\n\r\nSign this petition to say NO to the Mortgage Indemnity Scheme.",
