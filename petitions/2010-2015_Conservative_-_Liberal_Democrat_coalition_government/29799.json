        "additional_details": "12 young people die every week from Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) in the UK, 80% of whom are asymptomatic before the event.\r\nThe current chance of surviving an SCA in the UK is only 6%, but immediate access to a defibrillator can raise this chance to 74%.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to raise the profile of the debate so that awareness of SCA can be increased and more defibrillators placed in schools to prevent the death of children.\r\nSeveral charities, including Hand on Heart, SADS UK and C-R-Y, are already raising awareness of SCA and raise money so that they can donate defibrillators to UK schools.\r\n\r\nThis petition will provide the impetus for the government to make defibrillators a compulsory piece of health and safety equipment for all UK schools and provide some funding towards their purchase.\r\nDefibrillators are not expensive items when you consider that they could prevent the death of 12 children every week.\r\n\r\nSign this petition today to ensure the safety of children in our country.\r\n",
