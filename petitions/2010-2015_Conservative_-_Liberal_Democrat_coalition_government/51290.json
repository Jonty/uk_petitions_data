        "additional_details": "The Science Museum Group has said that it may have to close one of its three northern museums, including the National Railway Museum, if a 10% cut in its Government funding goes ahead at the end of June.\r\nThe railways are one of Britain's greatest contributions to the world, and to close this globally-recognised museum would be an act of cultural vandalism. This petition from Steam Railway magazine is an appeal for this national asset to be retained for the benefit of the British public and future generations.",
