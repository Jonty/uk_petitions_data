        "additional_details": "At the age of 16 and above, a transgender person may receive hormone replacement therapy if they are treated privately with the consent of their parents/guardians. We must wait until the age of 18 to receive treatment with no parental consent. Gender Dysphoria is a terrible condition that can completely destroy your sense of self-worth. This, combined with no familial support, may lead to a person taking their own life because they feel utterly hopeless.\r\n\r\nIf we can take on the ultimate responsibility of becoming a parent at 16, why can we not make this choice without having the permission of our parents?\r\n\r\nPlease help the transgender youth of the UK by signing this petition so that the law may be reviewed and revised so that transgender people may receive full access to hormone replacement therapy once they reach the age of 16 or over without the permission of their parents.",
