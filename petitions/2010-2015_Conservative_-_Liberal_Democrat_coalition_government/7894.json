        "additional_details": "Currently, the police will not act on reports of dog on dog attacks- although they will take details, no legal action will be taken. However, it is very clear that a dog on dog incident can be an early indicator of the potential for a dog attack on a human. It should be law for details to be exchanged following any dog fight, however trivial, just like if you knocked into someones car.\r\n\r\nWe also need to look at how to enforce responsible dog ownership, to prevent dog attacks on both humans and other animals. Examples from overseas should be explored and debated by the government.",
