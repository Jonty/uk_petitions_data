        "additional_details": "A Space X-Prize of $10m produced the first private enterprise spaceship and kickstarted Virgin Galactic.\r\n\r\nAn American expert says\r\n\r\n\"the technology exists to build a reusable orbiter for under a billion dollars; probably far less than\r\n\r\nThis could be done by prizes\"\r\n\r\nThe evidence is that prizes, where they work are from 33 to 100 rimes more effective than conventional government spending.\r\n\r\nIf they don't work they are obviously infinitely more effective since a government grant that produces nothing is all spent whereas a prize that isn't won pays nothing.\r\n\r\nIt has been proposed that the \u00a3265 million we annually give to the European Space Agency, an organisation which, with half as much money as NASA has yet to achieve much, bee instead put into a UK X-Prize Trust authorised to offer prizes up to its income 4 years ahead. This enable it to offer prizes totaling \u00a31325, twice what is needed to produce a commercial British space shuttle.\r\n\r\nWhat can we lose?\r\n\r\n",
