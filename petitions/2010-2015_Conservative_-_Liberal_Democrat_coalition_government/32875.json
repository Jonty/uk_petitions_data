The continuous changes are detrimental to both motorcyclists, and the motorcycling industry on the whole.\r\n\r\nRather than continually 'punishing' the motorcyclist, trying to bring in EU type proposals regarding fluroescent clothing, and making it more difficult to obtain a licence in the first instance, the real issue should be addressed.  That issue is other drivers unawareness of motorcyclists.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this, I propose that the current CBT exam, or a close relation to it, be included in the Car Driving Test.  Car users experiencing the vunerability of the motorcyclist is THE way to actively reduce accident related injuries and death.",
