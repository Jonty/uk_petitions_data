        "additional_details": "Human Rights Watch has raised the issue of Saudi Arabia refusing to allow Saudi women to participate in the London 2012 Summer Olympic Games as part of their official team.\r\n\r\nThis is a violation of the IOC Charter, but Saudi Arabia has said it will not oppose Saudi women participating as stateless persons.\r\n\r\nThe British Government should seek assurances from the IOC that it will do one of the following;\r\n\r\n1. Allow Saudi women to compete in their own right for medals, or\r\n\r\n2. Create an Olympic Free State allowing anyone who would otherwise qualify to participate in the Olympic Games to apply for citizenship and compete outside the restrictions imposed by their own country, or\r\n\r\n3. Decline to facilitate Saudi sexual discrimination practices by allowing both Saudi men and women to compete, but stipulate that Saudi men also cannot win medals and announce this officially prior to the commencement of the Games.",
