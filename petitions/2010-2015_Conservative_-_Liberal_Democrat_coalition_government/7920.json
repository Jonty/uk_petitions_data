        "additional_details": "I believe that in light of the current rioting and disorder on our streets flogging should be reintroduced as a deterrent to anti social behaviour and public disorder. Fines, ASBO's and community service are not feared as a deterrent so in addition to these I believe that the re introducion of Flogging will strike the required amount of fear into those that at the moment laugh at the Police and the Courts.",
