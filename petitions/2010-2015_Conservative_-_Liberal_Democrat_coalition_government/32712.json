        "additional_details": "As the current law stands, once a crime (however minor) is committed, it becomes a permanent stain on the character of a person for life and stigmatizes job opportunities requiring a CRB check and the good name of a person. This becomes the case particularly in juvenile offences, a 13 year old caught stealing a packet of sweets would have to enclose this future employers should they want to work with children or vulnerable adults in their adult life, even if they have committed no criminal offence ever since. I am proposing for a \"spent\" conviction to literally mean \"spent\". This would mean any past, silly, minor mistakes irrelevant to the job in question which would by no means reflect a person's ability to perform in their chosen field should be erased entirely from a person's record without exception. This would stop wasting the time and hassle of individuals who, like so many, have made a childhood misdemeanour at some stage of their lives.\r\n",
