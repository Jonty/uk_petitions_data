Raising money for charity is great, but why do we have to tolerate aggressive, rude sulky teenagers harrasing members of the public on high streets accross the UK? Its giving charities a bad name and witnessing fellow members of the public being heckled at and shouted at in the street, quite frankly would put me off giving to charity. Also with sometimes 5 or 6 targeting one street our high streets are becoming an assult course for harrasment. BAN THIS! there must be more effective, friendlier less aggressive ways of collecting money for charities.",
