        "additional_details": "To protect themselves from future scrutiny it has become the convention that ministers in succeeding governments are barred from access to the papers of their predecessors if that predecessor was of another party.  Government is funded by the taxpayer and therefore all information produced or discussed in government is the property of the taxpayer.  It is not morally or ethically correct that an individual politician can protect himself from scrutiny by the people or the forces of law and order if he is voted out of office by the people who fund his activities.",
