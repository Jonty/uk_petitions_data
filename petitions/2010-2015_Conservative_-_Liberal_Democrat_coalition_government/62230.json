I feel that, if people want to harm themselves, then we should let them because we have no right telling adults what to do. They includes all kinds of drugs, even Class A drugs.\r\nPeople take drugs even though doing so is against the law so, If drugs remain illegal then we can't ensure what people take is a pure substance. By legalising drug use, we make it acceptable behaviour and therefore less \"cool\" for criminals and bad guys to want to do it. If the government need another reason then we can put a NHS contribution on drugs so that the NHS does not get hit so hard by any increased burden. ",
