        "additional_details": "A review of speed limits should be carried out. It seems silly that I can legally do 60mph on a single track country lane but I can only do 70mph on a motorway. Speed limits should reflect modern driving and vehicle safety standards including braking capacity compared to vehicles from the time of the original legislation, afterall a 70mph motorway speed limit was introduced when most cars could not acheive this limit. Also an increase/revision could or would ease congestion and aid traffic flow.",
