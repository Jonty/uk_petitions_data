If their spouses remain in their marital homes during the week and the service personnel lives in the barracks/mess, they are still liable for the full rate council tax.\r\n\r\nThis should be abolished and the single discount rate applied as council tax is paid for services such as:\r\n\r\n\u2022Refuse collection, street cleaning and other environmental issues\r\n\u2022Maintenance of roads and bridges\r\n\u2022Traffic management and road safety\r\n\u2022Parking services and control\r\n\u2022Leisure facilities, including swimming pools and recreation centres\r\n\r\nWhy should somebody be forced to fund services that they are not even using for the majority of their time.",
