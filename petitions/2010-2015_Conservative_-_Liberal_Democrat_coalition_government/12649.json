        "additional_details": "Given the current climate and the increasing pressures the tax payer faces daily as a result of increased VAT, Fuel Prices, Energy Prices etc etc. It is time the Government put a stop the unjust and highly inflated train fare increases.\r\n\r\nWith these set at RPI +3% many commuters will simply be unable to continue working forcing thousands to look for alternative employment. The UK already has the highest train fares in Europe and with Rail Companies posting massive profits year after year the Government should force the funds to come from these operators and not the Tax Payer.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this petition is to stop any further increases to train fares and review how the operators invest profits received from already astronomical fares.\r\n\r\nPlease show your support by signing this petition and KEEP FARES FAIR\r\n",
