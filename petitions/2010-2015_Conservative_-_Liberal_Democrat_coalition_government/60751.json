        "additional_details": "The Daily Mail is campaigning to divert foreign aid to provide flood relief in Britain. While the situation in Britain is bad, the idea of taking money desperately needed in the third world to help people in Somerset is reprehensible. We should help those most in need, regardless of national boundaries. Money should be found elsewhere. Maybe think about cancelling the \u00a325bn trident replacement programme before cutting the \u00a311bn international development budget?",
