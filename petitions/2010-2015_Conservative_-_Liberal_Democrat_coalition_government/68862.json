        "additional_details": "The only reason why alcohol and tobacco is legal is because they are traditional drugs unlike cannabis, cocaine, etc.\r\nWell khat is a traditional drug, its use started in the 6th century http://www.erowid.org/plants/khat/khat_timeline.php and is traditionally chewed by people from somalia, Yemen, etc.\r\n\r\nWhy take away their choice of drugs when people can freely walk into a shop or pub and buy alcohol, when 40,000 people a year die from it http://bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/broadband/tx/drugs/survey/.\r\n\r\nThe ACMD reviewed khat and found no evidence that it was dangerous.\r\n\r\nThis is wrong and unfair to jail people for having something that is part of their culture and traditional to them.\r\n\r\nAlcohol and tobacco are more dangerous and deadly than khat and allowing the use of them 2 but not khat, which all 3 are traditional makes no sense.\r\n",
