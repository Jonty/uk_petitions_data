        "additional_details": "Our roads are blighted with traffic jams even to the point that tailbacks are present even when 'rush hour' is finished. One major problem area is with roundabouts/islands which are not controlled by traffic lights.In the early 1900's when roundabouts first came into use, the idea worked well due to the low volume of traffic, but in the 21st century with millions of cars on our roads the basic principle of using a roundabout no longer works. People can be stuck in traffic for considerable periods of time when trying to join a roundabout which causes massive tailbacks on all the major roads within our towns and cities. I ask the government to consider installing traffic control signals on all major roundabouts, and roundabouts with known congestion issues which will allow the traffic to continue flowing (in all directions) at all times. This may also include the use of part time signals purely for the hours of maximum congestion. This will also help reduce cO2 emissions.",
