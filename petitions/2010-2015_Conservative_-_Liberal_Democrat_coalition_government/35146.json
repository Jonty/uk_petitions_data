        "additional_details": "Despite trying (for 6 months) to get Walsall council to issue licences for street entertainment, the council will not introduce a licensing procedure.  Meanwhile they are paying entertainers for outdoor events such as the Jubilee and Olympics from public funds.  We know many professional musicians who welcome the opportunity to buy a licence in order to entertain the public.  At present these musicians are treated as beggars and thieves by the local police.  We want all councils to be forced to offer licences for street entertainment.  Licencing would generate revenue for the council, revitalise the town centres and clarify the position of street entertainers in relation to the police",
