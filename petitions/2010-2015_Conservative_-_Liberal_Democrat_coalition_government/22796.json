The idea of the benefits system is a good one but the vast majority who abuse the system spend their benefits on drugs, alcohol, gambling, lcd TVs, mobile phones etc. If the recipients of benefits were paid in \"ration book style\" coupons then they could only spend them on food, heating, clothes etc - which they should be using the benefits for.",
