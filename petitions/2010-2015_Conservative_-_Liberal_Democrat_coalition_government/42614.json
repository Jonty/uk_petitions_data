        "additional_details": "It is vital that we say no to legislation of the UK press.  We have built a reputation across the world for democracy and a free press is a major part of our ability to help other nations whose human rights are ignored by corrupt governments.\r\nWe call upon the government to resist changing our democratic rights and giving politicians power over the media.  The long-term implications of such a change would be without doubt a threat to the very freedoms of our country which many people have fought and died for in two world wars.\r\nA free press is a just and essential requirement of a democratic society.   The internet age has ensured that no press legislation can be effective.  To loose our reputation for a free press will only degrade our reputation nationally and make it impossible for the Government to criticise other anti-democratic states.\r\nA knee-jerk reaction to what has been a torrid period of  invasion of privacy by the press is not the right response from Government.\r\n",
