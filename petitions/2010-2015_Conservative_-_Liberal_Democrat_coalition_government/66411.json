        "additional_details": "Tony Blair took the country to war in 2003 based on false premises, the supposed purpose of the war was to rid Iraq of WMD's and in doing so protect the British people, Parliament voted for action based on this premise, as stated by Blair. Today however, 15/06/2014 Blair in an Interview on sky news stated  that the purpose of the war was actually regime change in Iraq. I want HM Government to charge Tony Blair for lying to Parliament, taking the country to war Illegally, and under false pretences, for the deaths of every British soldier, and for the mass slaughter of innocent Iraqi civilians. After being charged in the UK, Tony Blair should be sent to The Hague. ",
