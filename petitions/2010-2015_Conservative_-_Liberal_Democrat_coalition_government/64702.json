        "additional_details": "I was born a female, I am still a Female. I have 5 biological children. When I was registered at birth, the Registrar wrote 'Boy' in the Registrars book but wrote 'Girl' on my birth certificate. I only found this out 40 years later when I was applying for a duplicate copy. A birth certificate has to be an exact copy of the official birth register, in my case my register says Boy which means my 'Girl' birth certificate is now an illegal document. I am not allowed to re-new my passport, I have been a Prisoner in the UK, for eight and a half years! The Archbishop of Canterbury sent me a letter saying that he does not recognize my marriage of 22 years. If I die, my death certificate has to say \u2018Male\u2019 on it.\r\nIt is my right to be registered as a girl. I want the Prime Minister to change permanently the record in the Registrars book in a way that the word 'Boy' be completely removed and the word 'Girl' be inserted.\r\n",
