If we leave when planned the security forces will not be ready; We'll be leaving the Afghans in the hands of the Taliban.\r\n\r\nSoldiers die, and it is sad, but we can't let it be done in vein; They die standing up to tyranny and evil.\r\n\r\nSo keep the soldiers there for as long as they're needed",
