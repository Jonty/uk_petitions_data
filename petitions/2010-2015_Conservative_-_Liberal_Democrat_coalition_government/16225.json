        "action": "STOP granting ESA to people who are depressed",
        "additional_details": "More and more people are claiming ESA based on being depressed however depression is often a state of mind made worse by not working. More people are claiming ESA because they simply do not want to work. The government needs to stop granting ESA to people who simply convince their GP they are depressed, after all this is too easy. Claimants should be visited at their homes to make sure that they are unable to work; this would deter dishonest people from claiming. If they feel they can\u2019t take on a full time job then maybe they should be encouraged to work part time or do voluntary work.",
