        "additional_details": "Father's rights campaigners and neutral court systems are not properly protecting women and children who are victims of abuse from the father.  The law needs to be looked at to change the assumption that paternal contact is always beneficial.  The courts are not addressing genuine concerns and  mothers are subjected to months even years of proceedings.  New rules needs to stop this and prevent legal aid being given to persistent abusive fathers.  Agencies are used in the name of protecting children which repeat assessments and over scrutinise families providing no real benefit.  A contradictory system pressurises women to show they are protecting their children from abusive fathers whilst the judicial system forces them to allow contact against their better judgement.  Urgent action needs to rectify these contradictions in the system to support vulnerable women and children.",
