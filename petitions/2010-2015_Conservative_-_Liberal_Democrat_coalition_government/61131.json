        "additional_details": "There is a set of access roads between the M42 and Coleshill Heath Road, which are currently for motorway maintenance vehicles only. It would be far more logical to turn these into a proper motorway junction. This is because, if you are travelling from the M6 Toll to Marston Green, you either have to come off at junction T2 on the M6 Toll, where you are forced to take the pitiful A446 through several roundabouts and sets of traffic lights (which is often jammed up beyond belief), or  continue on to the M42 and come off at M42 J7, which adds unnecessary time and mileage to your journey. Whereas, if the access road to Coleshill Heath Road was a proper junction which motorists could use, then you would exit the M42 at the ideal place for driving on to Marston Green, which would save an awful lot of time, unnecessary mileage, and unnecessary CO2 emissions. As the access roads are already there, the costs to do this would be trivial too.",
