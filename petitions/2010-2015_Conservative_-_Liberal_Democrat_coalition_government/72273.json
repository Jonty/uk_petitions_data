No. The price on some of them are unbelievable! Lets look at the maths\r\nYour average product (if not on offer) is \u00a32\r\nNow lets say you have your period for a week so you'll need 2 packets.\r\n\u00a32 X 2= \u00a34\r\n12 (months) X \u00a34= \u00a348\r\n50 (years of buying product) X \u00a348= \u00a32400.\r\nBUT nobody just uses one type, you also have to buy different shape tampons, panty liners and other such things such as Fenimax.\r\nIs it fair that I as a women should have to pay for such expensive things for the rest of my life. I know that the NHS is not rolling around in money but you can get free contraception. I would like it if the government made these products cheaper if not free. It's simply not fair. ",
