        "additional_details": "Since the introduction of the 40mph speed limit for trucks on single carriage ways; technology, roads and training for all on the roads has increased.\r\n\r\nIt is now causing more road safety issues by keeping trucks limited to 40mph when 50 mph is a safe speed for trucks to travel on these A roads.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to raise the speed limit.\r\n\r\nThis would reduce accidents from cars and motorcyclists trying to past trucks going 40mph when they are allowed to travel at 60mph. This action is unlikely to raise trucking accidents as drivers are taught not to exceed their own truck limits regardless of the speed limit in place.",
