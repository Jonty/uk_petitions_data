        "additional_details": "We petition the government to urge it to stick to the concept of one nation under one law. There are currently many Sharia courts (85 is the figure I am aware of) operating through mosques throughout Britain. These courts deal with family and financial disputes according to religious principles. Civitas claims that the decisions of these courts are likely to be unfair to women and backed up by intimidation. The government should take steps to impose a ban on this law system that is completely incompatible with western style, liberal democracy, and is contributing to the further division and ghettoisation of British society.",
