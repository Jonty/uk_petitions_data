        "additional_details": "With the BBC deceasing services and quality programming, such as giving rights away for popular sports such as \u201cFormula 1\u201d.  It is evident that the licensing fee is not adequate to support programming that people want.  The service has already been reduced and although cost cutting measures have been implemented, it is now affecting programming and the fee needs revising to an appropriate rate.\r\n\r\nWith the BBC reducing programming, people are looking more and more towards services from providers such as Sky.  With this added expense on households people are now paying exponential rates to get programming that would and should be provided by the BBC.\r\n\r\nThe freeze on the Licensing Fee is therefore favoring richer households as there costs are reduced because they already have services from providers such as Sky.  Pooler households who don\u2019t have Sky are therefore losing quality programming or are forced to purchase services from these providers.",
