        "additional_details": "I suggest that young men who finish education without employment or entering into further education should attend a form of national community service. Work should be done 7-5 everyday with wednesday for sport/vocational training and weekends at home. The men shall live in quarters where they will feed and look after themselves with the assistance of former police/military men. There will be pay and awards for good work and a form of discipline training for poor work. This scheme will produce responsible capable men who are fit for employment and wil benefit the country. I would like the government to carry out a feasability study into this scheme with a view to reduce crime and unemployment inspire our future population.",
