Namely that their salaries have been low relative to the private sector, to pay for job security and final salary pensions.\r\n\r\nIt is the fault of successive governments that they have not been putting aside money saved on salaries to fund future pensions.\r\n\r\nPublic sector workers should not be penalised for the failure of government machinery.",
