Black Tuesday, Black Wednesday, Black Thursday, Black Friday, and etc.\r\n\r\n\"Black\" is derogatory to people of African origin and in my opinion, it is the root of all forms of racism.\r\n\r\nAfrican British is more acceptable as it represent a true description of our origin. Just as one could not call his or her child Catastrophe Britain should stop calling her citizens Black. ",
