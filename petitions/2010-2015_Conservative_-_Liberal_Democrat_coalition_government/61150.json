The Industry needs cleaning up with the immediate removal of scammers who are preying on vulnerable people. I speak particularly of Companies/Individuals who offer jobs on short films and features with the promise of offering National Minimum Wage rates but end up not paying the crew and artists what is owed. They then liquidate their production company only to resurface under a new name later. (Names of some offenders can be provided on request).",
