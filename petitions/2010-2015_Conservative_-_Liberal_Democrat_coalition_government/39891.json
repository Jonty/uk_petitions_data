        "additional_details": "We wish for the UK to reconsider the opt-out of the Schengen Area. The fact that a separate visa is required to visit the UK prevents many tourists, particularly those from China, from touring this country. France currently hosts 30% more tourists than the UK, with roughly 700,000 Chinese tourists compared to our 140,000.\r\n\r\nThis move, we feel, would help boost our economy in a time of recession, as well as allowing UK nationals a more streamlined process when travelling.",
