        "additional_details": "The current practical driving test allows examiner bias to determine your result. The current method of examination is outdated and there is more reliable, unbiased and credible methods we could use. I know far to many people who pass their test and are reckless drivers, the current system just sees how you drive for 45 minutes and does not see the whole picture. By reforming the test it could lead to a reduction in road traffic collisions and other serious offences.\r\nReform is needed!  ",
