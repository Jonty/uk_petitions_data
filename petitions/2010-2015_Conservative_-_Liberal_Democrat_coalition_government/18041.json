        "additional_details": "It cost the NHS in England 150million pounds in unnecessary wastage of prescription drugs in 2010. In these times of austerity this is something we simplify can't afford. The royal College of nursing conference siad it was 'heartbreaking to see piles and piles of waste'. Part of the problem could be solved by recycling medicine, as much of it is unopened and in pristine condition. The cost of setting up such a scheme would be far less than what it would save. Cut the waste. Not the NHS.",
