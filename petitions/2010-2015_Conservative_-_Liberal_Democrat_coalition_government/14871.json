        "additional_details": "All leisure items such as TV's, snooker and pool tables, gym equipment, games, libraries and such should be removed from HM Prisons. This will greatly reduce Justice Ministry budgets, and make prison a place to be feared, thereby reducing reoffending overnight. This how it used to be, and it worked very effectively as a deterent to crime. Prisons should be a place of punishment, not a 5 star hotel. Community Service is a waste of time.",
