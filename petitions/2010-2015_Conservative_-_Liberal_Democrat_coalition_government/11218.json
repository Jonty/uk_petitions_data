As a lifelong shooter, I often find myself in the untenable position of attempting to explain my sport to these individuals. What is the reason people shoot guns they ask? It starts with the fact that most people do not like violence, whether it is related to war, crime or perhaps even hunting wild game.\r\n\r\nSport shooting is not about feeling power or a simulation of violent activity. Sport shooting is an exercise in self-control. It is a setting for a meditation. It has the components that some people recognize in other meditative activities in self-control, and then some. That's why I and many others enjoy it.\r\n\r\nSport shooting also helps to educate youth and give them a hobby that does not bore them, such as stamp collecting or rioting.",
