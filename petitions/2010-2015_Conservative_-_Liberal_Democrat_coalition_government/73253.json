        "additional_details": "Under the Protection of Children Act 1978, there is a prohibition on the production, circulation and possession with a view to distribution of any indecent photograph, or pseudo-photograph of a child under 18. This Act fails to properly address written material.\r\n\r\nThis petition proposes the Government introduces new legislation to criminalise the production, distribution or possession of material produced for entertainment, information, education or religious purposes that endorses, promotes, instructs or justifies any paedophile activity, past, present or future.\r\n\r\nThe offence will be subject to a 5 year maximum prison sentence for UK citizens, the deportation of non UK citizens and the cancellation of the UK passport for dual passport holders followed by deportation.\r\n\r\nThere will be a defence of legitimate reason for the possession of the material, which could include, for example, the police and the prosecuting authorities and those dealing with complaints.",
