I would like the Government to BAN the use of ALL such numbers by ALL public bodies, including HMRC, local and central Government, etc.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why either geographic (01 or 02) numbers cannot be used or, alternatively, the non-geographic 03xx numbers - which must be included in all calling packages and which, according to the Ofcom numbering team, can be used to route calls in the same way as 084x or 087x numbers.\r\n",
