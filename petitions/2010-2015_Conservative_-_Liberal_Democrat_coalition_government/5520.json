        "action": "Devolve NHS Services to Local Government",
        "additional_details": "We call on Parliament at the earliest opportunity to legislate to abolish the various NHS quangos overseeing services, such as strategic health authorities, social care trusts, hospitals trusts and primary care trusts, and to devolve these functions to democratically elected local authorities in England.  Hospitals, clinics and GP surgeries could continue to run their own affairs but with strategic overview and regulation by the local authority which would be responsible for them and provide planning, budgeting, support and back office functions on their behalf. This would put the UK on a similar footing to the rest of the EU where mostly health services are overseen by local government.",
