In my current company, if i continue to pay 7% of salary over the next 20 years, i will only end up with an estimated pension of 1/40th of my salary ... not the 1/3 or 1/4 if i was in a teachers (1/60th scheme) or nurses (1/80th scheme).\r\n\r\nWhy should people in the private sector have to fund these generous public sector schemes ?? End them and put public sector workeres in money purchase schemes like the rest of us.",
