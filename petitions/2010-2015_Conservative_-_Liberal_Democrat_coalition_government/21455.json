I reckon this would mean 8-10 MPs for Spain & 4-5 for France, being the two countries I know personally. Many expats would like to vote but are no longer represented by a constituency the uesd to live in or like myself over 15 yrs out of UK, uneligible.\r\n\r\nFrance is proposing just such a rule its citizens living overseas, & US citizens all get a postal vote.",
