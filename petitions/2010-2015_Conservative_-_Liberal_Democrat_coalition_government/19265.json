        "additional_details": "We are deeply disturbed to learn that teaching about the oceans is not included in the national curriculum in secondary schools. It is crucial that young people are given the opportunity to learn about the importance of the oceans; how natural and human activities and processes are affecting the seas and what can be done to safeguard their future.\r\n\r\nWithout knowledge of the environmental, social and economic impacts on the oceans, future generations will not have the understanding to make the important decisions needed in finding solutions to the potential ocean crisis.\r\n\r\n72% of the planet is covered by the sea. The ocean generates over half of the air that we breathe and 98% of the world\u2019s fresh water supply. The oceans are suffering from issues such as ocean acidification, overfishing and pollution. The health of future generations is dependent on a healthy ocean.\r\n\r\nWe urge you to give the oceans their rightful place in the curriculum through the current curriculum review process.",
