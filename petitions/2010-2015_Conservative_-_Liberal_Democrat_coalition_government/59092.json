        "additional_details": "I petition the Education Secretary to seriously investigate and take action of the disappearance of children from classroom who victims of Forced Marriage.\r\n\r\nNobody should be allowed to simply go missing. It is a known fact from that there are empty seats in classrooms because children are being forced to marry. But yet, there is no defining difference being made.\r\n\r\nWe can't allow the persistent and continual denial that children aren't going missing from our classrooms and that forced marriages aren't a problem. It is obvious that this prevailing culture of ignorance is a barrier that is a stark endangerment to lives.\r\n\r\nEvery life matters, there can be no segregation of rights, education and life chances. A person is more than just a number. With every life lost there is another generation gone and that is the ultimate cost.\r\n\r\nIt is everyone's right to educated and be protected.",
