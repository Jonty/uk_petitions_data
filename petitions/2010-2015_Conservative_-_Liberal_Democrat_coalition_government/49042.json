Facebook is a site of which anyone can upload anything they like, at any time and share it with anyone. (I'm 15) Here is some rather disturbing content I have come across on Facebook:\r\n\r\n- A grown lady being masturbated by a living fish\r\n- A grown lady having sexual intercourse with a Labrador\r\n- A young boy having sexual intercourse with a goat\r\n\r\nEvery time someone likes, comments or shares these videos they then become visible to all of that persons friends and subscribers (unknowingly)!\r\n\r\nSign this petition so the government can not only recognise this issue but put tighter regulations and act appropriately so we can keep our and our children's newsfeed's free from this kind of content!\r\n\r\nemail 9ohn@live.co.uk for more !",
