        "additional_details": "85 individuals have the same wealth as half the people on our planet, according to an Oxfam report. There are 1,645 billionaires worldwide, with 104 of them residing in the UK. Between these 104 Britons, they have amassed a fortune of \u00a3518 BILLION, while the NHS crumbles, 112070 are homeless, and one in four British children live in poverty. Is this fair?\r\n\r\nExtreme poverty worldwide is also at a critical crossroads, with areas in Africa and the Middle East facing war, extremism, poverty and despair.\r\n\r\nIt is time for our government to take steps to help even the playing field, and introduce a fairer distribution of wealth. If the UK's 104 billionaires are taxed on their fortunes, it would raise \u00a37.77billion, which would go a long way to righting many of the world's wrongs.\r\n\r\nThe request is that the government raises a debate on a billionaire's tax, set at 1.5%.",
