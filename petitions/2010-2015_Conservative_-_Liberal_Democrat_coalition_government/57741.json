By closing the youth club, there will be a number of dis-advantages. Do you want the children of England to be causing trouble when they're bored? Do you want them to stay outside in the freezing cold? Do you want them to not meet new people?!?! SIGN THIS NOW TO GET THE YOUTH CLUBS BACK ON TRACK! For our sake, for the kids sake....",
