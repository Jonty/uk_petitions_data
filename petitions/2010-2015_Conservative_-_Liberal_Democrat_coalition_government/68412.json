        "additional_details": "George Galloway is unfit to represent anyone as an MP.  His recent views on barring all Israeli citizens from Bradford (academics as well as tourists) displays bigotry of the highest order and creates social unrest, tension and division.  He is using his position, from his words, to incite hatred against a particular country and its people.  I want the Government to remove him from his current position of MP for Bradford.\r\n\r\nMP's should be looking for solutions to problems within their own communities and within their own country.  They should not be creating divides between one community and another. No place for bigotry in Britain, especially not coming from MP's.",
