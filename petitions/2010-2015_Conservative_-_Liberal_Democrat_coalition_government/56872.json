I simply think that's wrong.\r\n\r\nCitizens should get more of a say, this is the only place that does that and yet it gets ignored.\r\n\r\nI think whatever gets over the votes scale should be raising a debate in parliment and they should be edging more towards a \"Yeah, let's go for it\" because the majority of society have said so. Doing this would lower everybody's big hate of the government and their stubborn ways.\r\n\r\nI wnat the government to make a bigger deal about these petitions. I want the government to do more of what society wants. I want the government to say yes a lot more to what society wants. ",
