        "additional_details": "This petition is for the trial of a dutch style coffee shop/ take-away in Blackpool for UK residents. This would include the legalization of cannabis up to 5 grams and/or growing 1 plant for personal use.\r\nThis would bring revenue to the area and would drastically cut down costs on local police forces raiding homes.\r\nI have recently been to Amsterdam and i can honestly say i felt alot safer being there with people smoking cannabis than coming home to Blackpool where i was faced with drunk parties on stag and hen do's.\r\nThis is a serious petition and business proposition.",
