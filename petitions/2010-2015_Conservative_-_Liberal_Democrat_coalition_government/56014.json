        "additional_details": "Letting agents and estate agents do not act for either prospective or actual tenants. Letting agents charge a largely invented range of charges to tenants, this is unjust and unfair because letting agents act only for the landlords not the tenants. The OFT is losing sight of this fact by favouring a tariff of charges. We call upon Government to follow Scotland's example and ban ALL tenant charges. This will leave the letting market unaffected and much fairer.",
