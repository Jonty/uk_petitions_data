Unfortunately we have many situations where children are being denied admission to their local school and instead are being forced to travel miles to attend schools in different towns. This affects children's socialization of not having classmates in their community; it negatively impacts on the environment due to increased fuel consumption; and it causes loss of productivity. This is mainly due to schools not having proximity from child's home to school as the main admissions criteria, which is what would make the system fair. To ensure the admissions criteria is fair for everyone, the following needs to be the main criteria:\r\n\r\nProximity from a child\u2019s home to school.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
