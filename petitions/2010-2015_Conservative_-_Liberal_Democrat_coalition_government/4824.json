        "additional_details": "I would like the government to pass a bill to forbid concealing one's face in public.\r\nSome members of the British public find it to be anti-social and threatening.\r\nThe bill would refer neither to Islam nor to veils. It would not be discriminatory because it would apply to everyone, not just Muslims.\r\nExceptions might include motorcycle helmets, or masks for health reasons, fencing, skiing or carnival masks at carnavals\r\nA poll in 2011 indicated that a majority of British people supported banning the burqa in all public places. However, a ban on burqas has been ruled out by the current Conservative-Liberal government and previous Labour governments.\r\n",
