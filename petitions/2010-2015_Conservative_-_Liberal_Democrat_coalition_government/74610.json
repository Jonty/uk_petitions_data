        "additional_details": "In the UK, a criminal convicted of an offence is ordered to pay a \"Victim Surcharge\". This is an amount of money, determined by the sentence, that the convicted person must pay. This money is paid into a pool that victims of crime can claim from.  The absurdity of the law is that parents of children convicted of a crime can become liable for the debt, EVEN IF THE PARENT WAS THE VICTIM OF THECHILD'S CRIME. So, for example, a child assaults their parent, the parent could become liable for the child's victim surcharge.  The law must be changed to ensure parents do not become responsible for their child's debt when it is they who are the victim. ",
