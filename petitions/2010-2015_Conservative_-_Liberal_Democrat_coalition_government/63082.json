        "additional_details": "\r\nUniversity College London\u2019s National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN), is the UK's and Europe\u2019s largest neurological and neurosurgical hospital. For 150 years it has been providing treatment and care for all conditions that affect the brain. It is a globally recognized center for research and training. In October 2012 NHNN enhanced its services to patients through the acquisition and commissioning of a Gamma Knife radiosurgery machine.  On April 1st NHS England informed NHNN that it could no longer treat NHS patients and that all patients waiting for treatment should be transferred to other hospitals. Patients have refused to be transferred and there are currently over 50 waiting for treatment, this is growing due to the specialist nature of the hospital.\r\n\r\nWe call on NHS England to immediately lift its ban on NHS patients being treated with Gamma Knife at University College London\u2019s National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery at Queen Square?\r\n",
