        "additional_details": "More and more people are choosing to undertake cosmetic or other non-essential surgeries, with many travelling abroad for cheaper prices. If these procedures go wrong or problems subsequently develop, it is the NHS that then ends up repairing the damage, and bearing the financial cost. This is unacceptable. This petition is for the  Government to introduce laws requiring the person undertaking a non-essential elective surgery (in the UK or abroad) or a procedure (or normal follow-up care for it) abroad (including EU countries) which the NHS had determined to not be appropriate in their case; to obtain insurance from a reputable UK Insurer prior to the procedure, so that the NHS is re-paid in full. If the person fails to take out insurance, then they are personally liable for the cost and have to repay the full amount-irrespective of income level or lack of assets (in order to deter abuse by those who would be deemed to have an inability to pay) - within 5 years.
