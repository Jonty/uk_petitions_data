It is time that this mistake was corrected with the formal abrogation of the 1783 Peace of Paris and the return of the colonies to the British system of government.\r\n\r\nThis will bring considerable advantages for inhabitants of both the new lands of America and the British Islands. In particular restoring the advantages of European civilisation, in particular free health care and 5 weeks of annual holidays will considerably enhance the American standard of living.\r\n\r\nBy making a first and significant step towards the restoration of the British Empire, this will also create an opportunity to return to the peace and financial stability of the 19th century that British rule of law and responsible fiscal practices provided to the world.\r\n\r\nThe Empire Shall Rise Again!\r\n\r\nGod Save the Queen.",
