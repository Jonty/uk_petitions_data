        "additional_details": "Mr Cameron must NOT let Scotland any chances of seeking independence. The Referandum of Scotland Independence must NOT be held and any attempts of Scotland seeking independence must be prohibited.\r\n\r\nBeing ruled by the Majesty (Queen Elizabeth II) and the Great Britain is your glory, prestige and fortune. See how Ireland did after it seeks independence - Ireland gets few medals in the London Olympics, as compared to the Great Britain which gets some thirty medals - Great Britain is so POWERFUL and it can only remains so by uniting Britain, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Once the United Kingdom is split, Great Britain is no longer \"Great\" but becomes few small and uncorporated nations that can be easily defeated by other countries.\r\n\r\nReferandum is the most stupid thing in the human history because most citizens just care for their own interests and they know nothing about Politics. Their opinion can easily be controlled and manipulated by the devil countries.",
