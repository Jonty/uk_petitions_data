They are liar and they discriminate against other and they don't do their job properly. and also they are extremely rude, and they use false accusation. I want my medical record but the Polish and Hungarian girls who work in reception don't provide my medical record. Also I was working in factories with poles but they were harassing me.\r\nENOUGH IS ENOUGH.\r\nplease send eastern European back\r\nThanks",
