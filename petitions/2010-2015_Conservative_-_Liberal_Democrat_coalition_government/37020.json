        "additional_details": "Rents in London are too high. Even house shares are becoming unaffordable, and the quality of them is sometimes awful. There are professional people being unable to afford one bedroom flats between two people\r\n\r\nThe situation we are in: couple with salary of \u00a325k, and graduate Medical student. Our landlord is not even obliged to fit a smoke alarm because we live in a shared house that was built before 1992. We share a single bathroom between 5. We have 1 shelf in the fridge between 2 people. We cannot afford a one bed flat or even a studio. One of us works 6 days per week, 12 hour days and the other works 7 days a week as a student. We have to pay \u00a3500 per month under these conditions.\r\n\r\nThis cannot go on. People will become homeless. We will become homeless unless we can find a decent place to live because this situation is unbearable, and for people who work so hard, it should not be the case.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of people like us.\r\n\r\nThank you",
