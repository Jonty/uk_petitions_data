After such a period the Blue Badge Holder would have to pay or not return for 24 hours.\r\n2)\tThat Blue Badge Holder parking bays be used only by Blue Badge Holders and anyone not a Blue Badge Holder be given a fixed penalty ticket equal with the local illegal parking ticket issued by the local authority where the offence takes place.\r\n3)\tThat any abuse of a Blue Badge by somebody not entitled to have one be treated as a serious offence subject to a fine of up to Five Hundred Pounds (\u00a3500:00) and subject to Six (6) penalty points on their licence\r\n",
