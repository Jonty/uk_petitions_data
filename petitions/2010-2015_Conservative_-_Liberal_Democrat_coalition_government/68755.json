        "additional_details": "On 23/08/14 Sangita Chatlani, a British citizen, was arrested in Mumbai, India.\r\nWhy?\r\nA former business partner, Mr. Jagdish Sasane, wanted revenge after she filed sexual harassment charges against him in January 2014. Given his financial and political influence, he was able to file a counterclaim against her for fabricated offences including theft and fraud, all of which Ms Chatlani can prove false.\r\n\r\nAfter spending 25-days in a Mumbai jail cell, the widowed mother of 2 has now been released on bail but was told she cannot leave India to be with her kids until the trial is heard. The problem is the date for trial has yet to be set and, by law, may be delayed indefinitely by Mr. Sasane's camp.\r\n\r\nAs well as this, the Mumbai police's reluctance to accept evidence from Ms. Chatlani countering the claims made against her suggests she is unlikely to be afforded due process.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and show your support so the British government can intervene and help us get justice for Sangita.",
