They have proven they are not safe, not able to be responsible and are certainly are no role model for the child/ren  This is clearly in the interest of safeguarding the child. At the moment if a parent was convicted of murder, that parent could still access the child's or childrens' records and refuse to allow the other parent to change the child's or childrens' surname. Where is the safeguarding for the child/ren?",
