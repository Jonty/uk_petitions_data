On Trains competition doesn't happen on intercity routes on the West-Coast mainline for example, and bus competition is non-existant outside certain areas, with apparent cartels seeming to operated on routes and fares. Re-regulate, and if necessary renationalise where a better and cheaper service can be provided in the public sector.",
