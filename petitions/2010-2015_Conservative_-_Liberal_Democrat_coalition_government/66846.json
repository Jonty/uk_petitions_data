        "additional_details": "We the undersigned, call for a judicial review of the unprecedented sentence handed down to Chelsie Lambie for her part in the desecration of an Edinburgh Mosque using bacon. Chelsie insists she is only guilty of taking pictures of the act and whilst this may in hindsight have been an irresponsible act it does not warrant a twelve month custodial sentence which will impact all her future prospects and a custodial sentence is not in the best interests of her child. The sentence is also in contradiction to previous cases of legal precedence in the UK where defendants have desecrated patriotic symbols, burnt flags and incited racial hatred and have only received minimal penalty fines.",
