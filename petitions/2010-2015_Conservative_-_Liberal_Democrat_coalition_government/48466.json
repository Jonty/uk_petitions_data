        "additional_details": "Margaret Thatcher was the finest post-war British Prime Minister. She dragged the UK out of an economic quagmire and instilled a sense of optimism in the British people. She defended our freedoms and our territory in a way no PM since Winston Churchill has.\r\n\r\nWhilst Baroness Thatcher's death is deeply saddening, it is also an opportunity for the British people to remember and recognise this inspirational leader, and to honour her public service and her memory.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons, and many more, Maggie should have a state funeral.",
