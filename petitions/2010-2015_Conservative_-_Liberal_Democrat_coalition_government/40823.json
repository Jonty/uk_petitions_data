        "additional_details": "It has come to my attention that in today's society there are Laws for almost everything, but none for cats.\r\n\r\nThey can roam where they like.\r\nLeave their Faeces in other peoples gardens, homes  play parks etc. which if in contact with can cause Toxoplasmosis.\r\nJump in through neighbours windows roam through their homes and lye on their beds only to give a fright when the home  owner walks in. They urinate in rooms leaving a lasting odour which is extremely hard to eliminate.\r\nThey roam around all night with no curfew  from owner, causing fights with horrific noises.\r\nWhile running through gardens at night that have dogs causing them to react by barking. The dog owners end up with a council letter because their dog barked.\r\nWere is the fairness there????\r\nNot everyone likes cats and do not want them running through their homes.\r\nCats need laws and owners need to take responsibilities by keeping their cats in at night and stopping them from running wild.",
