        "additional_details": "Not a day goes past when Michael give doesn't do something else to ruin the education system, make life harder for good teachers to the point they leave, take good books out of education, fines parents for taking children out of school in term time (which is as much an education as class), and generally damaging our children. He's got no experience in education, so why start at the top? All we ask is for Michael gove to leave, and replaced with someone who understands education and children",
