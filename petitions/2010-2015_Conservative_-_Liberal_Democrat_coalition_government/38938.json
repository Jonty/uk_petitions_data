One example of this is  Dale Cregan, who shot dead two unarmed officers responding to an incident. Had the officers been armed, this might not have happened. countries such as Australia, which have a lower crime rate than the UK, have all their officers armed, so we cannot say that \"only countries with lots of crime have gun-carrying officers\".\r\n\r\nIF YOU HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING WRONG, THEN YOU DO NOT NEED TO FEAR THE ARMED POLICE",
