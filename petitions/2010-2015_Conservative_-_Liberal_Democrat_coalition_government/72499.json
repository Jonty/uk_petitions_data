        "additional_details": "Wheelie bins have been inappropriately introduced in inner city urban areas with no thought as to where they are meant to be kept. Hundreds of streets of terraced houses with little or no front garden or rear access, have ended up with wheelie bins being permanently situated on pavements. These block the pavements for prams and pedestrians, look unbelievably unsightly and are generally an environmental menace. The bins are worse in multi occupancy housing such as student areas, as the bins are regularly full and overflow onto pavements. I implore the Government to introduce funding for local authorities to provide grants to house bins appropriately within or next to properties and to look at alternative rubbish collection options to maybe get rid of the wheelie bins all together.",
