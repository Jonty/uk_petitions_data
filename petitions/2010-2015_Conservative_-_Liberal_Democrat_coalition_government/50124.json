I, like many other ordinary people, cannot believe that the Courts have so little teeth, and would suggest that this situation is reviewed with a view to imposing a prison sentence and/or confiscation order against such offenders. This would renew confidence in the legal system, and stop offenders laughting at the law.\r\n",
