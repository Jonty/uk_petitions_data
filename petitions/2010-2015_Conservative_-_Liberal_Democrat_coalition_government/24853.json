        "additional_details": "Abandon the HST - this country is too small, and who wants to get anywhere any quicker?   Instead put the money into moving fresh water from Scotland via pipe and canal system to the drier part of the UK.   This will help the farmers and keep the cost of farm produce down.   This will stop the country being ravaged,as pipes can be put underground and the canals can be used as an aqueduct or sluice and they are already in place.   Any money left over could be put into improving the railway signal system to allow more trains to run on the track ",
