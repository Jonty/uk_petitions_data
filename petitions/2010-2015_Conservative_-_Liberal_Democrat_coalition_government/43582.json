        "additional_details": "Piers Morgan has irreparably damaged British relations with firearm owning Americans, his condescending and patronizing views on how the United States deals with its own issues is insulting to our friends in the colonies. It is apparent that becoming deeply unpopular with the great and the good of British society and the people was not enough for Mr Morgan and now he has taken it upon himself to not only become unpopular in the United States, but he is dragging the name of the United Kingdom with him. Such a person should be striped of his British passport and should a similar minded petition in the United States be acted upon Mr Morgan could settle on Queen Elizabethland where he will no longer anger another soul except the Argentinians and at last find some civic use in his life.",
