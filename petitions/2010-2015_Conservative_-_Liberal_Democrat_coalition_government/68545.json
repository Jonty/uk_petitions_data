        "additional_details": "The proportion of children born to unmarried mothers equalled 47.5% in 2012 and due to social and economic reasons this number is on the rise.\r\nSince 2003 a father named on the birth certificate has the same parental rights if they are married or not. However, the way in which the courts govern them to provide for for their children differs upon whether he was a husband or a partner. Courts have the power to ensure wives and their children are well provided for. When it comes to unmarried mothers and their children, they are governed by a different set of rules which offer far fewer rights.\r\nThis is a clear case of discrimination. I urge the British justice system to implement equal rights for unmarried mothers as they do married mothers when it comes to the case of family law and child maintenance.",
