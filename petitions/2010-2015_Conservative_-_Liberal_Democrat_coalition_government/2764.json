In future, in line with proposals for other public servants, pensions for occupiers of these posts should be set in line with their career averaged salary during there period as a public servant and as a 1/60th ot 1/80th multiplier of years of service. Members of these posts should also make pension contributions at a similar level to that of civil servants on equivalent 1/60 or 1/80 service multipliers. ",
