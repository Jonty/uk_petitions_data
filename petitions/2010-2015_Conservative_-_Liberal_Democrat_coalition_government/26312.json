        "additional_details": "My point is very simple\u2026.\r\n\r\nThere are now 619,000 millionaires in the UK and 86,000 of them have more than 5 million pounds. This is set to grow by 2020 by another 33% so the UK is obviously a place that the rich want to be. So if we balance a little and we skimmed 5% of their wealth for good causes\u2026.\r\n\r\n27 Billion (@1mill) + 21.5 Billion (>5mill)\r\n\r\nSo we would recoup 48.5 Billion pounds a year and would pay off the deficit in the space of only 4 years with no cuts.\r\n\r\nIf any of the millionaires complain we could just ask them to work more hours, work till they are 68 and have a reduced pension.\r\n\r\nMaybe the coalition MP\u2019s should dig their hands into their own pockets and those of their friends and get the Inland Revenue on the job!\r\n",
