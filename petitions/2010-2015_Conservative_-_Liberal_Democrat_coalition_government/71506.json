        "additional_details": "As a hard working parent and having to work practically all year i find it hard to keep up with the spiraling rising cost of childcare during school half terms and the 6 week summer holiday. I also think that longer term times will enhance children's education furthermore. My suggestion is a 2/3 week summer break, 1 week at Easter. 10 ten days at Christmas and the normal week half terms. Currently children are only at school for 38 weeks of the year, which is by no means a stable form of education for any age. I strongly feel that 44 week a year would be far better both for education and the purse of parents.",
