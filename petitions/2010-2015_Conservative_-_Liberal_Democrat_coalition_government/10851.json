The Highways agency has Traffic Officers patrolling our Motorways and some other major roads such as the A1.\r\n\r\nTo make best use of these officers it would be sensible to give them some limited power whilst on patrol to increase our road safety.\r\n\r\nTraffic officers should be able to stop and issue tickets for speeding, report drivers for dangerous driving, give breath test for anyone they suspect of under the influence alcohol and or drugs and hold them until a police officer arrives to take them to a police station. Hold drivers until a police officer attends who have no MOT and or their vehicle is believed not to be fit for the road. Report people for not having road tax, insurance and a valid MOT certificate\r\n",
