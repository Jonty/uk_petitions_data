        "additional_details": "The right of Israel to exist in the land claimed by the Arab Palestinians is based on solid historical fact and the need for a Jewish nation in the land they were once exiled from has proven itself self evident. To stop further persecution we, the undersigned believe that it is the responsibility of the UK government to support, uphold and help to maintain the State of Israel and assist in destroying any Palestinian nationalist movement while assimilating Arab occupants into other nations or into the Israeli mainstream. This will prevent further conflict as a united front between allies will show that the IDF is a force to be reckoned with, that the Jews will no longer be forced around, and that mass Arab anti-Semitism will no longer be tolerated.",
