Starting last autumn, it is looking at the provision of services within the Morecambe Bay area and where they might be based in future.\r\n\r\nThe future location of the A&E, Maternity and Intensive Care Units that are currently based at Royal Lancaster Infirmary (RLI) is included as part of this review.\r\n\r\nWe want to be clear that the removal, movement or downgrading of A&E, Maternity and Intensive Care Units at the RLI is totally unacceptable. Such a move would not only have a detrimental impact on those needing these services but also their families in times of acute distress.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the Government to ensure that these vital services remain in place for the community that they currently serve.
