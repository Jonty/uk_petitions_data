        "additional_details": "Advertising Gambling is as bad as advertising the sale of illegal Drugs! Gambling, like drugs can ruin lives. Yet day in, day out we see adverts plastered in Newspapers, Magazines and all over the Television. \"Deposit \u00a310 and get \u00a330 to play\" This is the hook that these bookmakers use to reel you in and before you know it, a little bit of excitement can lead to serious problems. I would like the Government to not only look at the advertising of Gambling but ban it completely as they banned the advertising of cigarettes.",
