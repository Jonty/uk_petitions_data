        "additional_details": "At present there is NO charge for causing serious injury while disqualified/uninsured, a death has to occur before someone can be charged with an offence. The only applicable charge is driving while disqualified/uninsured. This would probably only result in a fine. This is totally unacceptable.\r\n\r\nIf someone is disqualified they have already broken the law previously. If serious life threatening or life changing injuries occur there should be a charge which carries a custodial sentence, not just a fine.\r\nWe suggest a sliding scale of up to 9 years imprisonment for the most severe injuries or driving record.",
