        "additional_details": "At present, different authorities are able to decide when their school terms will start and end.  When parents and their school-age children work in different schools in different authorities, this causes major problems when sorting our childcare and also when trying to organise a family holiday outside of term time.\r\n\r\nThis year alone I will have to find 4 weeks of childcare for my son who has different school holidays to me.\r\n\r\nI am petitioning for the government to standardise school term times for all schools and thereby reduce the amount of stress and increased childcare costs that are incurred.\r\n",
