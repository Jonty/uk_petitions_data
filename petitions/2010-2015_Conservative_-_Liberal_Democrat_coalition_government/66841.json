        "additional_details": "With over two centuries of changes in the electoral process and the representation of people since 1800, none has taken into consideration the right of the people who fail to cast their vote because they do not believe in the people on the ballot papers or the political party they represent.\r\nThis petition is to call for a process that allows the voice of disenchanted voters who don't exercise their political civil right to be heard. This will give them the right to soil their ballot paper to indicate their rebellion against political parties and have their votes counted to enforce a re-run of the electoral process; when they have 33.3% of votes cast.\r\nWe expect and want the government to debate a change in the law by amending the 2000 Representation of People Act to allow disenchanted voters' right to be recognised within our current electoral process.",
