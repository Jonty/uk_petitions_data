        "additional_details": "The UK spends over \u00a311Bn on overseas aid, and reports in the press say that in the last quarter of 2014 they had even more money to spend due to some success in the UK economy.\r\nThere seems little accountability for this money and how it's spent, whilst we in the UK are \"cutting back\" it is \"full steam ahead\" in this department.\r\nTo make matters worse, we are actually borrowing this money and paying interest on it. I am not against humanitarian aid, this is money that should be spent. But bankrolling wasteful and foolish projects will do little to help us. There needs to be some common sense applied.\r\nWe spend money on the NHS and treat overseas health tourists, we give people asylum at great cost, are these not \"overseas aid\" items?\r\nThe British people should be allowed a vote on this folly, a very simple referendum would be all that's needed.\r\nPlease support this petition to give as a say on how our money is spent.",
