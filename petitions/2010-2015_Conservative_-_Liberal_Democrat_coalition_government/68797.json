This doesn't happen at present and is forgotten. But by the PM seeing people up close maybe,  just maybe the PM will see common issues that do not effect the higher class.\r\n\r\nPlus being out of their comfort zone will help, as the issues that effect hard working families do not effect them.\r\n\r\nPlease sign, and please believe.",
