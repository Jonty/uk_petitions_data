        "additional_details": "Scientists have been jailed for manslaughter for failing to predict the earthquake which caused much death and devestation in the region of L'Aquila in 2009.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are inherently unpredictable.\r\n\r\nThe ability of scientists to make predictions founded on the scientific method without fear of persecution is essential not only to the principle of freedom of speech, but underpins the advancement of our scientific knowledge. Almost 500 years after the imprisonment of Galileo it is inconceivable that the same thing should be happening in italy today.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the government to urgently contact the italian government to discuss the release of these scientists, and to publicly denounce their imprisionment.",
