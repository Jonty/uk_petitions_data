Richard Rogers is on record as saying that of the #670 million the Millenium Dome cost  only 46 million was spent building it. Our railways are far more expensive than continental ones because the infrastructure building and repair costs many times more. There are 2 possible explanations - incompetence and corruption. If there are more perhaps someone could say. Either way Parliament should be able to debate it and provide an answer. This is, historically, what they exist for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
