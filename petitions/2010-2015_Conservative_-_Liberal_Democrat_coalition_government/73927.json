        "additional_details": "At present, once a student has joined a course at a university, the student is set to be studying the course at that university, from start to end.\r\nShould a student decide that they are unhappy at their university, there is no dedicated transfers system for students to transfer from one university to the other (to the following year of the same course, rather than restarting the course).\r\nThe student would phone each university individually, virtually all universities do not allow direct transfers to the next year of the same course as it is.\r\nOnce a student has joined the university, there is little incentive to ensure the student is happy till the end of the course, the transfer scheme would solve this.\r\nThere will be certain institutions that could standardise all curriculums. Like NICE for Med, IBMS-Biomed, Institute of Physics-Physics etc.\r\nIndia's Smriti Irani has recently decided to follow this overhaul, receiving high praise in doing so.",
