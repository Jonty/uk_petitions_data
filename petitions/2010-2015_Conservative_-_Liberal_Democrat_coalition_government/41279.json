The USA has come on leaps and bounds with regards to its diplomatic relations overseas since Obama came to power. More importantly Romney is sponsored by oil barons, some of which donated $100 million to the romney campaign (I wonder what they get in return for their generosity) The last republican in charge started illegal wars and all in the name of profit (oil) lets not allow history to repeat its self. If the world is to overcome epic struggles and adversity Obama's the Man for the Job and he's just getting started. ",
