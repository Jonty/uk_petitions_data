        "additional_details": "In the current economic climate, and when difficult decisions have to be made by local councils, it is vital we retain proper consultation with local people for whom local employment and tourism may be crucially affected by closures of adult educational establishments, such as Urchfont Manor in Wiltshire.\r\n\r\nThriving adult educational establishments, of which this is one example, attract adults from all sections of the community as part of life time learning are under threat of closure.\r\n\r\nThey continue to contribute to the lifeblood of their communities, in Urchfont's instance, since its inception as the first adult educational centre to be established following WW2 in 1947 - it grows it's own food, provides accommodation, learning and food to the very highest standard by dedicated staff who live locally.   Given more time, and consultation, a solution may make it possible to avoid redundancies in this rural area.\r\n",
