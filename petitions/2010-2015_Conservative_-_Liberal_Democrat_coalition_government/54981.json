        "additional_details": "The proposed development of land to the North of the A264 in Horsham West Sussex will change the very nature of an ancient market town. It will close the strategic gap between Horsham and Crawley. The promised hospital on which it was 'sold' to the people  and so urgently needed, has been dropped in favour of a huge industrial development that is not needed in West Sussex. It has not been properly considered against alternative sites and we demand a local referendum to decide if the people most affected agree to this unwarranted and unnecessary development. ",
