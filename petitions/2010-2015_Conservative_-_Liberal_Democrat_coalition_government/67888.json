Things like name, date of birth, education, details of previous employment, details of a time you faced a challenge, etc.\r\n\r\nMany employers will not accept CVs, insisting that they have the applicant's information in an easily comparable form. But repeatedly rehashing this information for every employer is time consuming.\r\n\r\nA UAF could be submitted digitally or physically. Employers could still be able to ask specific questions in addition to a UAF, but the basics would already be covered.\r\n\r\nA prospective job advert under this system might say \"Please submit a UAF, and 500 words about why you think your skills are apt for this job\".\r\n",
