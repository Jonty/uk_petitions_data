        "additional_details": "The BBC has decided to allow Sky in to broadcast all F1. The BBC wil only have 1/2 the races live, with the rest 'extended highlights' meaning race fans who can't afford Sky will lose out.\r\n\r\nThe majority shareholder of Sky has proved to be woeful, and it's unfair to only give half the races to free to air.\r\n\r\nF1 is a highlight and has always been on free to air TV. The new deal runs for 5 depressing years, but if the government (DCMS) can get F1 added to the 'crown jewels' list, the deal will be illegal and can be renegotiated down the line and prevent tis theft from ever happening again.\r\n\r\nBritain is the biggest stakeholder with F1, with loads of teams/drivers based here, employing thousands of people and millions of fans.\r\n\r\nThis proves F1 needs to be on free to air. It inspires thousands of young people to get into engineering, maths and sport, industries the government are trying to develop, so don't let Sky steal the sport from future generations.",
