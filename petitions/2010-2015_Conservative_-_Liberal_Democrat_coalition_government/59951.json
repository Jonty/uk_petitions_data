        "additional_details": "At present the bar is set too high to sponsor parents to come to the UK. The provisions in Appendix FM for adult dependent relatives at E-ECDR 2.4 and 2.5 require them to demonstrate that they require long term personal care to perform every day tasks and that the care must not be available in the country of origin. We propose that provided it is demonstrated that the parents can be cared for without reliance on public funds then they should be admitted.",
