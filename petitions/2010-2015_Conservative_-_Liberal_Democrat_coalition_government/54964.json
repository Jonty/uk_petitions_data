        "additional_details": "OFQUAL have changed the marking criteria of the GCSE English Language syllabus for pupils mid-way through their course. OFQUAL are penalising pupils and teachers who have undertaken examinations in good faith.\r\n\r\nThis sets a precedent and clearly undermines their stated goal, as quoted from their Vision Statement:-\r\n\r\nThe public confidence objective: to promote public confidence in National Assessment arrangements.\r\n\r\nHow can we have confidence in a system that has been validated but changes the \u201cgoal posts\u201d half way through a cohort.  If changes are required to a syllabus then due process should be followed and the new cohort undertake any changes that have been ratified.\r\n\r\nTherefore this e-petition has been raised so that OFQUAL is not allowed to change marking criteria of GCSE and A Levels mid-course.\r\n",
