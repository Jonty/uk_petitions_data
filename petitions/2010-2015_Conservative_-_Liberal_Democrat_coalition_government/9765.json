        "additional_details": "There should be a program to build more prisons so that anyone who has committed a crime deserving of a prison sentence is imprisoned, and imprisoned for an appropriate length of time to reflect the seriousness of their crime. It seems that too many criminals are spared prison or longer sentencing simply because the prison system cannot cope. Repeat offenders can therefore be given very much longer sentences as they have effectively shown they are incapable of functioning within a civilised society. Also would allow for a policy of no release without genuine remorse for the crime or without an excellent behaviour record whilst inside prison. Finally, would provide many jobs to build and run the prisons.",
