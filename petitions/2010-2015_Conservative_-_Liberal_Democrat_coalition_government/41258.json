        "additional_details": "We as a country are at a worringly low amount of trees, the woodland trust has managed to buy some fields to plant 600,000 trees! Why stop there? At least half of our country should be covered in trees. I propose a buying of fields and tree replacement project by the government getting the public involved. Trees are important to our health, well being and lives, not to mention our precious declining wildlife and could create new job oppotunities for wood industries, environmental studies etc. I also propose a law on banning the cutting down of any tree unless it is a danger to others. This includes back garden trees which make up part of our 13% tree coverage so they therfore are just as valuable as the remaining woodlands. ",
