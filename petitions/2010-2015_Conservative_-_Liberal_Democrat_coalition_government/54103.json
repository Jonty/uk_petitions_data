        "additional_details": "Bradley Manning was sentenced by a US military court to 35 years imprisonment and dishonourably discharged from the US Army on 21st August 2013 for publishing transparency about operations in the Iraq war - he hoped to create a public debate about US foreign policy and conduct on the battlefield. We accept the security issues involved in his disclosure but we urge you to look at the bigger picture - who sent our boys and girls there?\r\nTony Blair actively campaigned for this allegedly illegal war and significantly influenced the US.\r\nWe petition the people of the UK and Her Majesty's Government to support a criminal prosecution against Anthony Charles Lynton Blair (born 6 May 1953) in the International Criminal Court in The Hague or other authority as appropriate.\r\nHistory will eventually reveal the truth - or we can now.\r\nThis petition is open for 12 weeks only... please support it now.\r\n",
