I think this is horrifying when first aid is so simple to learn, and can be taught in between 1-4 days.\r\n\r\nAlthough schools and workplaces should have a first aider on site, There are actually no legal rules to this, even the people appointed to take care of casualties in schools are normally not first aid trained, and it is up to the managers/head teachers to deem what is appropriate, I don't feel they should have a choice and think all teachers/nursery nurses/carers and parents should have to undertake basic first aid training.\r\n\r\nIf you agree, please sign this petition!\r\n\r\nThank you, Erin Hays.",
