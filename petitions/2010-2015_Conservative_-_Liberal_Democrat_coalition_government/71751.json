        "additional_details": "We have one of the shortest holidays in Europe and are still not the 'brightest' country in Europe. This means children are more stressed and the UN convention has said that our children are overworked.\r\n\r\nHolidays also allow children to develop a personality and actually reduce school fees. So, for the above reasons, British students should have a longer summer holiday to rest and enjoy their childhood. This will enable them to develop life skills and interact outside a classroom. It will also give them the rest they need to recooperate and return to school ready and raring to go! Not overworked and stressed as they currently are. ",
