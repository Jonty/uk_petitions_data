        "additional_details": "Dignity and ethics must be maintained in public office.\r\nThe current post holder, John Bercow, has done much to demean his office. He frequently appears to disregard the opinions of the House while challenging democracy itself. He is a loose cannon and should go.\r\n\r\nI would like him removed from office. No speaker should remain in post for more than five years. Parliament should have the right to remove a discredited Speaker.",
