Whether glass ceilings are broken or not, women will always have to put their careers on hold to make babies (evolution requires copulation) and when not making babies, every month women around the world silently put up with something most men couldn't handle. Bleeding for three to five days and not dying 12 times a year is no small achivement, and it's not exactly painless. The fact that the government taxes us for using sanitary products is truly shameless. What other choice do we have? I have no other arguments other than that I am a woman in a bad mood, possibly due to the time of the month, but you should support my campaign to save about \u00a35 a year. Still that is \u00a35 which the government is getting because you are a woman and you bleed. Not fair. Let's break another glass ceiling...",
