        "additional_details": "Nonfeasance in Public Office is the failure to carry out duties.  Essex Council appears to hide between 'targets' instead of addressing failure or unwillingness to grant sufficient planning permission to/ extra 'pitches' for Dale Farm residents.  No other local authority and their constituents should be made to foot the costs caused by planned eviction.  If the authority treated any other racial group in the same manner re targets there would be outrage.  In times of limited resources it is madness to force Travellers into houses others are said to need, when this would potentially increase dependency, at complete odds with aims of Welfare Reform, and destroy their way of life.
