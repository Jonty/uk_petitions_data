        "additional_details": "Stricter Laws need to be put in place for Striking. People are striking more and more recently expecting something to change however this will not happen! The British people say they will lead a peaceful protest but unfortunately there is a small handful of people who create violence on the streets and this is no way to behave. Striking in effect only causes more economic decrease rather than increase. The government cannot say yes to all those that strike otherwise nothing will get done.\r\n\r\nStriking does not work, striking is a waste of the tax payers money and striking ends up in violence whether it was meant to or not. Protect our people, protect our economy. Stop Striking. Introduce Stricter Striking Laws.",
