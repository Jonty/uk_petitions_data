        "additional_details": "To restore the rail link from Aberdeen to the north-east area of Aberdeenshire, this would alleviate the connection from commuters and support the proposed energy corridor. It would also support the transport of white fish and other goods from the region as the major fish infrastructure in the UK is based in this area with Peterhead still the largest pelagic fishing port in Europe. There is also the St. Fergus gas terminal which again is the largest terminal for processing Gas to the UK grid. It would also improve the support to the oil and gas industry given Peterhead is a deep water harbour. It would also assist in the grown of farming which is also a big employer in the region. Key areas to be serviced would be Aberdeen-Ellon-Peterhead-Fraserburgh-Mintlaw-Turrif-Macduff-Newburgh-Cruden Bay-Balmedie-Bridge of Don.",
