Membership of the College would come with QTS / similar appropriate academic qualifications (e.g. MA, PhD, Higher Level Teaching Assistants...).\r\n\r\nPositions within the College would be appointed by ballot among its members, on a 5-year electoral cycle. The remit of the College would be to devise long-term, evidence-based policies, and to implement them in an evidence-based way. This should be done with a view to maximising attainment for all.\r\n\r\nThe leadership of the College would be democratically accountable to its members, as well as to the Secretary of State. However policy-making decisions should remain the remit of the College.",
