        "additional_details": "I, as a citizen of the United Kingdom, do not understand the complexities of the European Union. If you go ahead with a referendum on whether the UK should stay as a member of the EU, something that the majority of British citizens do not understand, I ask that you please hold a referendum stating that people should pay tax that is both representative of their total income, and that also brings the whole population of the United Kingdom above the poverty line (we can, in doing this, lead the way for a positive global change in equality). This is something that I understand and believe should happen. Together we can make this a better world.",
