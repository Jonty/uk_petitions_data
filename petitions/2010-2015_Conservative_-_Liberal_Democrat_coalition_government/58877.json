        "additional_details": "Margaret Moore had her mother removed from her home where Margaret had been a carer to her for many years, a member from Wimbledon Guild came to visit the family home as Guild was closing and wanted to find out Mothers options. Shortly after Margaret Moore was accused of Abuse and Social Work moved in to remove her mother from the property. She has since had a report that shows nothing but lies about Margaret (For 1-  they had never met her to be able to write such lies 2 - her mother had been diagnosed with a mental illness).\r\n\r\nThe treatment Margaret Moore has received is Disgusting, now affecting her health, her home and is not on.  We want her name cleared and her home re-instated to her so she can get on with her life and not lock herself away terrified of what might happen",
