        "additional_details": "I propose we introduce compulsory physical LABOUR in all prisons, a modern equivalent to old school \u2018hard labour\u2019. This could be in many ways that prisoners can do free work for the country, providing a service or goods to benefit society and the economy.\r\n\r\nPrisoners should work a full working week of non-paid labour as part of their sentence, there should be no exception. Luxuries should be removed from everyday living, this is prison, not a holiday camp; rewards may be offered for exceptional positive conduct, but LIMITED.\r\n\r\nThis will give prisoners not only a work ethic but also motivation for positive behaviour, the best kind of rehabilitation a prisoner can hope to be given.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s ensure criminals start to take accountability for their crimes through true consequences, after all, it shouldn\u2019t be an easy life in prison. And if prisoners learn work reaps just rewards then they are far more likely to succeed once released back into our society!!\r\n",
