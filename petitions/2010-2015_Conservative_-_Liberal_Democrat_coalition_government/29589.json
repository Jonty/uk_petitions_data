The restrictions on what an e-petition can contain, such as the names of prisoners convicted in public courts, should be allowed in e-petitions.\r\n\r\nToday I attempted to start a petition about a rapist serving time in a UK prison who has been granted legal aid to ask a court for him to have access to his children by way of prison visits - even though his victim is his ex-wife, the mother of his children.\r\n\r\nI named the convicted prisoner as I had read it in an article in a national magazine article about the victim's opinion. It is nonsensical that I can read the detail in a magazine, but I cannot ask parliament to debate it by using an e-petition. This frustrates free speech.",
