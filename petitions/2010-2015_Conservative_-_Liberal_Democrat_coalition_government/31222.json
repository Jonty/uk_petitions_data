The notes were made using thousands of tonnes of paper.\r\nBy using recylced metals to make new coins and recycled or sustainably sourced paper to produce new bank notes, instead of gathering the materials from new sources the damage to the environment is reduced and it will reduce the need to burn old bank notes and expensively import the minerals needed to create new coins.
