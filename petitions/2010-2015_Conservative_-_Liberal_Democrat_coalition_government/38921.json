Alongside recent findings that Mark Duggan was carrying a loaded Firearm when he was shot by armed Police.\r\n\r\nI feel it is vital now for the Government to debate if all Police should carry a Firearm or Taser  to protect themselves among criminals who are able to get their hands on a range of Firearms ranging in power and firepower.\r\n\r\nThis is a much needed debate for protecting Police Officers and Greater Public.\r\n\r\nFamilies are torn apart when anyone is murdered as a result of Gun Crime or other Weapons related incidents. This is something that needs to be stopped in this Government.\r\n\r\nEnough lives have been lost that of Criminals, Gang Members, School Children & Police Officers. It is time this was stopped!\r\n",
