        "additional_details": "The following issues concerning the new Dart Charge system need to be investigated and speedily resolved:\r\n\r\n- Dart tag accounts cannot be viewed or topped up so people are forced to make pay as you go payments even though their dart tag account may operational. Will refunds be issued since 2 payments are being collected for 1 crossing?\r\n\r\n- Why \u00a310 is held in each standard and commercial account but cannot be used to fund crossings.\r\n\r\n- Incorrect vehicle details are held and vehicles are incorrectly charged for.\r\n\r\n- The website is not fully functional and call centre is severely understaffed, people have resorted to contacting Dart Charge via Facebook.\r\n\r\n- Why are penalty charge notices already operational when the payment system is not fully functional?\r\n\r\n- Why was an expensive customer contact call line set up?\r\n\r\nIt is in the public interest for the government to investigate and compel Sanef Tolling and Dart Charge to resolve the issues.",
