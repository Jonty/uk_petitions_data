        "additional_details": "We call on the government to end the practice of Heterosexual Marriage which has corrupted our pagan heritage of tens of thousands of years and has attempted to re shape the concept of Marriage. Marriage was always based on spiritual connection where gender was irrelevant and partnerships were often not monogamous since then we have seen marriage corrupted by heterosexual monogamous relationships that  are the greatest threat to our country's culture.",
