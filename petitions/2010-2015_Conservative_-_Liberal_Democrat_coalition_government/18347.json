There should be a sliding scale which increases in relation to the amount of offences committed, therefore those who habitually offend get penalised the most.\r\nAt present some people think they are above the law, while others generate enough income to be able to ignore the law - and its fines.  Let's bring these persistent offenders into to reality!\r\n",
