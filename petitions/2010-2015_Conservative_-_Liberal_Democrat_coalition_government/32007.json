        "additional_details": "HMS Plymouth is currently under threat of being scrapped. Various schemes to save her have come to nothing. She is the last surviving warship from the Falklands conflict in 1982 and deserves to be saved for the nation as a memorial to all those lives lost in 1982, particularly as the nation commemorates the 30th anniversay of this conflict this year. Please sign this petition and save this warship as a permanent memorial to the Falklands conflict.",
