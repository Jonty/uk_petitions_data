        "additional_details": "Sign this e-petition if you believe that the government should create a mandatory national service for school leavers, allowing them to opt for either military or civilian based service.\r\nThe civilian service can provide services such as care for the elderly, logistical and labour based support for environmental issues, and undertake the learning of vital skills that may enable them to pursue careers post-service. They could also provide invaluable support to charities.\r\nThose opting for military service, once having received a modified version of basic training, could provide support for emergency services, charity and foreign aid efforts.\r\n\r\nThe cost to the state to support this may perhaps be offset by taking this age group out of the benefits system, and inadvertently reducing crime rates.",
