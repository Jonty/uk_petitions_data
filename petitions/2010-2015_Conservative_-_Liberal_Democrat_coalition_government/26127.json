        "additional_details": "We must bring back bus conductors, the driver has more than enough to focus on with driving safely. Drivers should NOT have to deal with money. this bad because it takes time to deal with peoples money and if there is a long line of people the bus can be late. this would improve timess and also give much needed jobs to older people. so lets kill 3 birds with one stone and go back to what worked. also i think we lost a sort of role model by ending this practice. a nice older Grandmother or Grandfather type, this makes people at ease, possibly making people better behaved on the bus.",
