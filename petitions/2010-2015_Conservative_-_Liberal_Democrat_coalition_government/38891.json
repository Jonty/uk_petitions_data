Define a standard hydroponic farm design based on efficiency / cost per square meter\r\n\r\n2. Proactively make sure that 99% of the farmers in the country will receive a study about the production costs per square meter of each type of vegetable and fruit compared to those of traditional farming\r\n\r\n3. Provide low-cost workshops for 99% of the farmers: how to build and maintain an hydroponic farm\r\n\r\n4. Provide means to upgrade existing farms to hydroponic/aquaponics farms through volunteer unemployed workers, low cost loans, etc.",
