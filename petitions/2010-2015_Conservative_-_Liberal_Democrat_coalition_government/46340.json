Leave the fluoride toothpaste in contact with the teeth for as long as possible.\r\n\r\nA social marketing campaign incorporating mass media adverts in between children\u2019s television programmes could significantly raise awareness of the simple steps that can be taken to reduce dental decay.\r\n",
