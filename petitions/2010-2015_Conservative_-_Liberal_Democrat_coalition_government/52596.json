        "additional_details": "Pelvic Girdle Pain (PGP) is the condition previously known as Symphysis Pubis Dysfunction (SPD). It is most commonly a temporary condition of pregnancy though it can occur following a sports injury. PGP causes severe pain, makes walking difficult, causes great pain and difficulty getting in and out of a car and often requires the use of walking aids. At present some local authorities will provide PGP sufferers with a temporary disabled parking permit to allow them to remain independent until the condition improves, this petition is to ask that ALL local authorities provide this option.",
