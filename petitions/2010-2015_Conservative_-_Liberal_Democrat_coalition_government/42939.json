I am the chair person of \u2018Save Bailiff Bridge\u2019s Village Green Action Group\u2019 we a small West Yorkshire village that has seen its population over doubled in the last 10 years, but now they are trying to take our last and only remaining open green space, taking away our rights to open green space and devastating the green grass, trees and shrubs which in turn will kill off our last vital food chain link that could lead to the loss of our wildlife forever.\r\nIf you could please look at our website (www.save-bailiff-bridge.co.uk ) where hopefully you can find all the information you need?\r\nWhile we are a small group of people we are all volunteers and we have no funding and all costs so far paid out, is from the same few people.\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\nBrian Stewart\r\n.\r\n",
