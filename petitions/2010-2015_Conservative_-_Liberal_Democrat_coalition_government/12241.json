        "action": "Labelling of Palm Oil to Encourage Sustainable Production",
        "additional_details": "Palm oil, once thought to be the solution to our biofuel woes, is now recognised as a serious problem, as various nations cut down valuable forests in order to plant a crop which causes mass desertification in the long term. We, the undersigned, also believe that the Round Table set up to encourage sustainable palm oil production does not go far enough, or investigate those producing the palm oil thoroughly enough to guarantee sustainability. Under this proposal, all products containing palm oil must be labelled with the country of origin of the aforementioned oil, all products containing palm oil must clearly state that the \"vegetable oils\" they contain are palm oil or palm oil based, and the government must try and ensure that alternatives to products containing palm oil are available to consumers. This petition, therefore, is designed to offer consumers the opportunity to make educated choices regarding their economic habits.",
