I also want the people who are responsible for taking or posting the videos to be found and arrested and charged along with the abusers .Also for the children to  be removed into a safe environment. These videos are not only UK based this has been all over the world and something needs to be done. These children are as young as 6 months and they age being beaten, punched and drowned the list goes on. The more videos that are removed there is less chance of  them being promoted also i must stress that these children need to be safe!! our government needs to work with other authorities to protect our future generation.
