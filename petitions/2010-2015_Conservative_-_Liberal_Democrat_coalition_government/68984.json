        "additional_details": "Private companies that supply energy and water (and companies like Network Rail) are able to hide behind \"commercial confidentiality\" when something goes wrong, or people want to know what decisions are being taken for what reasons.  The Freedom of Information Act should apply to them as well with regards to contracts they have won, that - ultimately - the tax-payer is stumping up the cash for.  If the companies want the nice profits, they should have to take a \"burden\" of transparency as well.  And FoIA should also cover Housing Associations, since so many people rely upon them for shelter.",
