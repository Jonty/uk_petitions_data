        "additional_details": "In London it is a nightmare to park or find parking at reasonable prices. Where I live is a restricted zone from Monday-Friday 8:30 - 18:30 or \u00a34 for an hour.. If you park in a residential area in the restricted times or without a paid ticket you will receive a PCN and your car being towed writhin ten minutes of the ticket being put on your vehicle. But it doesn't show anywhere on these signs your car will be towed. I feel a \u00a365 penalty charge is enough to stop people from parking in these areas, let alone being towed and the price going to \u00a3265.\r\nPlease can we get the councils of London to stop towing vehicles unless there is a hazard to other drivers/people, causing a major obstruction or parking on double yellow lines.\r\nIn most residential bays there are no hazards and nobody is necessarily at risk, so why the need for towing?
