The BBFC makes no such distinction and Ofcom should not either.\r\n2/ After 10pm free-to-air adult channels should be permitted to broadcast any cert 18 equivalent content subject to adequate labelling and the ability to block them.\r\nSexual content on sex themed channels has attracted an extremely small number of complaints, the majority from competitors. The serious or widespread offence that Ofcom cites simply does not exist.\r\n3/ After midnight all channels should be permitted to broadcast any cert 18 equivalent content subject to adequate labelling.\r\n4/ After midnight encrypted television channels with age verification should be permitted to show BBFC certificate R18 content and its equivalent.",
