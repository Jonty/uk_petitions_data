        "additional_details": "Children that mess around at school need to be taken out of normal school and sent to a boarding school run by the military.  This ensures that delinquent children do not ruin school for the kids that want to learn.\r\n\r\nNot all children have a stable home environment and parents that care about them.  The army will instil a moral code in these kids and give them a set of values that would not have been given to them at home by their parents.  These kids will learn the core subjects, english, maths, science etc and will spend a lot of their day doing intense physical exercise.  The military school pupils will leave military school at age 16 (the same time that the other children will leave secondary school).\r\n\r\nMilitary school should be seen as an opportunity and not a punishment.  Military school will give dis-advantaged children the opportunity to make something of themselves and make them feel part of a society that they can contribute to.",
