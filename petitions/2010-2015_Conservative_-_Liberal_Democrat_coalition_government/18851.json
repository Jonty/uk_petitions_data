        "additional_details": "It is clear the war on drugs is lost. Continuation of the current policy constitutes allowing criminals to gain massive financial reward to fund other ventures.\r\n\r\nMillions still partake in drug use every week. A new approach is needed to break down the criminal cartels that surround the drug industry.\r\nIn countries where this more lenient approach has been taken (i.e portugal), problematic drug use and hard drug use has decreased and the nation as a whole has seen benefits.\r\n\r\nProhibition does not work and only a more transparent approach will help the situation we are in. Trials in this country where a more lenient approach has been adopted have seen a reduction in crime in the respective areas.\r\n\r\nIt is time to stop being scared of the sensible option. The only real way to take control of our nation\u2019s drug problem is decriminalisation. It is for this reason I ask you to sign this petition to force the government into a reconsideration of their failing policy.\r\n",
