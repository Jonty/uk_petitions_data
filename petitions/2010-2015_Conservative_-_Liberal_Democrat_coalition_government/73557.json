        "additional_details": "The Pure Fun Factory is a privately operated Soft Play Centre serving the communities of Tunbridge Wells and the surrounding area.   The Landlord is seeking planning permission to change the use of the building into an Indoor Climbing Centre as it is more commercially viable for the Landlord than as a Children's Soft Play Centre.   By refusing Planning Permission for Change of Use the existing Soft Play Centre will continue to provide a much needed amenity for the local community.  Please sign our petition to encourage the Local Authority to refuse Planning Consent for Change of Use. ",
