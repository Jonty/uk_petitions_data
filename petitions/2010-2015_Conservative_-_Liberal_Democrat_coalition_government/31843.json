        "additional_details": "We do not agree with the coalition government removing child benefit from some UK families. All families deserve financial help to bring up children. We are now one of the few developed countries who do not pay child benefit to its citizens. Parents who look after children and lose their child benefit are also likely to lose their automatic credit for the state pension. We believe that child benefit should be restored as a universal benefit to all UK families.\r\n",
