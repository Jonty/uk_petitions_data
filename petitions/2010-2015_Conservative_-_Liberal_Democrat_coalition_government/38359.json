        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition to request the governement looks at introducing a variable speed limit on Lake Winderemere. 10 mph within 30 meteres of the shoreline and near the ferry crossing. Other parts of the lake should have designated waterskiing, wakeboarding and other watersports areas with a 30mph speed limit. It would also be good to have designated powerboat areas where there is no limit. All powerboat users should have a minium RYA powerboat level 2 qualification and have appropriate insurance. If registrations are monitored then this would revitalise the economy around Lake Windermere.",
