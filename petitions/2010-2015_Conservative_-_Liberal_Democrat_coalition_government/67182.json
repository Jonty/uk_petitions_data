        "additional_details": "I am a grieving parent of a 16 year boy. My son took his own life. All I want is access to his photos on Facebook to try and give me some closure on this matter. I need as a mother to see my son's last photos before he died. I haven't got any recent one's of him. I just want to see if there is a photo of him smiling and having fun.I am sure there is other parents out there in the same postition as me and my family. I can access his mobile and look at his messsages, but the law NEEDS TO BE CHANGED REGARDING  FACEBOOK ! I want access to his pictures. I am not asking for much.  I hope someone out there will listen to me and change the law regarding this matter, because I feel this is against my human rights as a mother of a child who is now deceased. Will anybody out there read this and make somthing happen ? I am hoping they will read this sign this petition and make something happen. I need to see his photos.",
