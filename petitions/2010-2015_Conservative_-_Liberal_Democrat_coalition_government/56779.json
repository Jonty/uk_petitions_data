This is outside of a lot of people's budgets therefore they do without hence they do not know who is calling. If it was provided free to everyone then the huge number of cold callers and scammers that call would be much less as most people would be discouraged from answering if the number was not recognised.\r\nI would like the government to lobby the telecom providers to supply this service to everyone free of charge.\r\n",
