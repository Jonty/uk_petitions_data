        "additional_details": "I wish for the government to increase the number of beds in specialist spinal units. My father broke his neck last year and went to a trauma centre instead of a specialist spinal unit. At the time of his accident there were 35 patients on the waiting list for the National Spinal Unit at Stoke Mandeville.\r\n\r\nBy not going to a specialist hospital his rehabilitation has taken longer and his outcome is affected, which is actually false economy for the NHS.\r\n\r\nThe poor care he received before going to Stoke Mandeville resulted in him redislocating his neck and the surgery failing. His neck has now fused in a dislocated position and his prognosis is poorer as a result.\r\n\r\nMore beds are desperately needed in specialist spinal  units, so please sign this petition.",
