Bigots that claim hate speeches are their \u201cright\u201d are wrong. Freedom of speech is expressing yourself in good ways. Not spitting venom at people. Everyone should be treated equally. Sexual orientation or the colour of your skin shouldn\u2019t matter. I beg of you to help stop the injustice of verbal and physical bullying stop. Don\u2019t be a sheep and follow those that discriminate against others, change the way people think. Racist remarks are said too often, they aren\u2019t acceptable. Words hurt\u2026 Its necessary we stand up for each other. Show bullies the pain they cause. Sign this petition and stop bullying forever\u2026 If a 14 year old (me) can understand this why can\u2019t you?",
