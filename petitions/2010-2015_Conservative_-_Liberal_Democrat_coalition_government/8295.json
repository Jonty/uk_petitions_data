        "additional_details": "People with food allergies and intolerances aren't always catered for in some restaurants. Staff aren't clued up to the damage gluten can do to a person with Coeliac disease, and menus don't offer a very good choice.\r\nWhile I have nothing against vegetarians, their needs are catered for, and they have better choices on the menu, despite the fact their diet is through choice, not necessity.\r\nEating places should by law be trained and aware of food intolerances and allergies, and provide adequate menus to cater for the ever increasing amount of people suffering ffom them. This would make life so much easier and better,for us, and would probably save the NHS a lot of money from related illnesses caused by food allergies and intolerances.",
