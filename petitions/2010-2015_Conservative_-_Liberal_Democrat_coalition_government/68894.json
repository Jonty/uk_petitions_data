        "additional_details": "In light of the appaling, shocking and truly horrendous events of the past 15 years in Rotherham surely it is only proper that the Police, Social Services and Council Officers are made to account for this truly shocking cover up through a criminal enquiry. These three bodies are supposed to protect us all in society, and this awful exposure on August 26th just simply 'Beggars Belief'. What on earth will come out next?? People need to be prosecuted as criminals if so proven, and have their pensions etc removed. Public Office simply 'MUST' become accountable, or we are all doomed..",
