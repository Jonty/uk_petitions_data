        "additional_details": "Not enough new houses have been built over the last two decades. Those that have been built are of a poor quality. Property prices are so high that young people are unable to buy a house. Rental prices are also high, and there are many badly maintained properties.\r\n\r\nIn response, many people look to the public sector alternative for help. Council houses charge rents that are actually affordable. They are built to a higher standard than many private sector homes. The 'landlord' is democratically accountable. Well run council estates, with active tenants\u2019 associations, are some of the best places to live.\r\n\r\nYet there are long waiting lists for council houses. This is because councils have been discouraged from building. It\u2019s time for the government to remove restrictions on building council houses. If people decide that they want more council homes then to stand in their way is both a failure to respond to genuine need and a breach of democratic principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
