        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to stop the discrimination/penalisation against parents/families who are forced to take their children away in the school holiday's.  I would like them to encourage travel agents to lower their prices during these times instead of them taking advantage of the situation parents are in.  Also I would like taxes on airlines to be reduced as 1/2 of the airline ticket is tax.  Also for travel agents not to abuse the meaning of an adult by changing their definition of an adult to 18 as it is in law rather than creating their own definition of adult at age 12.",
