They are wrong.\r\n\r\nIn poor conditions dipped beams are necessary to ensure other drivers can see a vehicle. Dipped beams should be made mandatory when roads are wet or visibility is reduced to less than 500 metres. Side lights should only be legal when a car is parked or stationary off the main highway.\r\n\r\n",
