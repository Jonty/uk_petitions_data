        "additional_details": "The Sexual Offences Act 2003 defines rape in its first section, which reads:\r\n\r\n\u201c(1)A person (A) commits an offence if\u2014\r\n(a)he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis,\r\n(b)B does not consent to the penetration..\"\r\n\r\nThis means that, under the current law, only men can commit rape. This ignores cases of female perpetrated rape or rape committed with objects.\r\n\r\nThis definition of rape is outdated and not only prevents victims of sexual offenses from receiving true justice but also deters many victims from reporting crimes as they are made to feel like their experience is not taken seriously.\r\n\r\nThis, now decade old, legislation should be expanded so as to reflect our cherished ideals of equality, to fully acknowledge the devastating experiences suffered by this community of victims, both male and female, and give them the respect they so desperately deserve.\r\n",
