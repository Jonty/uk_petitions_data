        "additional_details": "This petition aims to draw attention to the scandalous denial of voting rights to British expatriates who have lived outside the UK for more than fifteen years. The proposed in/out referendum on Britain's membership in the EU would, if the UK would vote to leave, have a great effect on the status of British citizens in the EU.\r\n\r\nIn a referendum of huge political and economic importance and which greatly affects the status of British citizens living in the EU should not everybody, irrespective of how long they have lived abroad, be allowed to voice their opinion?\r\n\r\nI call for the government to abolish the fifteen-year limit on voting rights.\r\n\r\nAmongst other things we could lose the right:\r\n\r\nTo move freely around the European Union and settle anywhere within its territory\r\nTo vote in elections to the European Parliament and in municipal elections\r\nTo petition the European Parliament\r\n\r\nPlease let us have our say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
