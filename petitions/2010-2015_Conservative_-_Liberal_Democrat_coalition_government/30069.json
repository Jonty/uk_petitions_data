In effect, if Rangers or Celtic are relegated or even below sixth place after 33 games, severe financial penalties will arise for all SPL clubs. In short, the contract creates powerful commercial considerations potentially in conflict with the sporting integrity of the competition.\r\n\r\nHMG and the Scottish Government should persuade Sky and ESPN to maintain the value of their offer to the SPL regardless of which teams are in the competition and where they are placed. Beyond demonstrating support by Sky and ESPN to the fundamental sporting integrity of league football in Scotland, this move would also be welcomed by the  customers who watch Scottish football as a step towards a fairer, more competitive and more exciting SPL.
