It pays for the following [1] powered wheelchairs, [2] accessible taxis, [3] motability cars and other special transport so that disabled people can get out and about.\r\n\r\nDisabled people living in state funded residential care homes have only \u00a322 a week  to pay for everything except food and rent. The removal of DLA mobility is totally and truly wrong. We urge David Cameron and this government in power to reconsider abolishing  our essential life-line to the outside world.\r\n\r\nThe government wants to encourage disabled people to be independent, this independence would be totally impossible without dla mobility allowance.\r\nSAVE OUR MOBILITY!",
