        "additional_details": "Tax is to support the country and pay for services we regularly or sometimes use but much of the tax paid by tax payers is not fairly distributed.  Therfore, to improve and increase efficiencey within the UK and give something back to the 'general tax payer' a money match improvement grant should be provided for services with specific providers or governement credible suppliers. e.g. Support for changing windows, doors, heating systems, driveways, gardens etc. With a little support tax payers would be able to afford changes to their homes, lives and as a whole improve the government's green environmental and energy saving targets and plight to make this country the best it can be. The 'general' tax payer doesn't want or expect free money but just some help along the way. Qualifying measures must be in place e.g. must have lived in the UK for at least 8 years and have paid tax for at least 4 of those years.",
