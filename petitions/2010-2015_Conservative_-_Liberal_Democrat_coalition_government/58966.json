Starting at 7am - 6.40pm\r\nthere are a lot of OAP's on our estate that regularly use the bus. Cutting the buses down will make it hard to elderly people to get to town and back and for the safety of all people we need our bus back.\r\nParents that get the bus to school with there children in the morning and home at afternoon will not be able to anymore as there isn't a bus during these times. Early workers and late finishers won't have a bus service either.\r\nWHY should we lose out bus service yet HEMMINGWELL and QUEENSWAY run 7-7pm.\r\nBRING BACK THE BUS! ",
