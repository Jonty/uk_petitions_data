I know we are supposed to be living in the \"modern\" world but so many of these rioters behave worse than wild animals during Pre-historic times.\r\nIt appears, many of the rioters and looters are quite \"image\" conscious, that is why they looted branded goods that they think will improve their image. Think what will happen if they know that if they are caught, they could be paraded in public and what that would do to their image? That should stop a lot of them behaving in terrible manner in future.",
