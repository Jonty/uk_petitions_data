It's such a pain and has resulted in so many cases of people being shortchanged. There have been many cases where people, particuarly vulnerable and elderly people, have lost thousands of pounds because they gave in to a pushy door to door salesman. I want doorstep selling to be illegal. I want the government to make it illegal for people to knock on somebody's door in order to try to sell them something.",
