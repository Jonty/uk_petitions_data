        "additional_details": "We call on the government to bring back the dog license.  The fastest increasing sector of ownership is multiple dog ownership.  Cyclists on cycle paths, often paid for in part by donations from cyclists, are increasingly impeded by dogs on long leads.  Their owners have not contributed to the paths.  The revenue raised from licenses should therefore be ringfenced for shared used path creation.\r\n\r\nPensioners will be exempt from the license for their first dog.",
