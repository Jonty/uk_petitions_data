        "additional_details": "Crawley Council are planning to keep building on the towns parks and green open spaces. They are under pressure to keep building more and more houses but do not understand the depth of feeling in the town against turning our town into a concrete jungle. The people in the town are giving a clear message to the council but the peoples views are being ignored. The council must consider the view of its residents and must consult and obtain approval from the towns people before going ahead with any further infringement of these open spaces. The council need to understand when something like this is not sustainable. Please sign this petition to help save our town and the environment we currently live in. ",
