        "additional_details": "Fitting solar panels to all houses, factories, buildings derelict land etc in the uk would alleviate the need for new nuclear power stations create 1000's of jobs and reduce our dependency on gas and oil. a scheme could be created where home, business owners etc could rent there roof or spare land space out to generate electricity for the grid. As people don't have the dissposable income to purchase expensive solar panels the panels should be fitted for free and the person be given a % of the feed in tarrif as rent which in turn would bring there energy bills down",
