        "additional_details": "The recently introduced English Baccalaureate provides an incentive for school pupils to ensure that they include in their studies GCSE subjects from a narrow range of options.\r\n\r\nIn particular, to obtain the English Baccalaureate, pupils must study either History or Geography. This requirement will encourage pupils not to take Religious Studies to ensure they can include one of those two options.\r\n\r\nWe believe the existence of the Baccalaureate provides perverse incentives for school pupils when choosing their GCSE subjects, to the detriment of Religious Studies in particular and also to others such as Music.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government firstly to include Religious Studies as a humanity for the English Baccalaureate, and secondly to reconsider the benefits and disadvantages of having such a baccalaureate.",
