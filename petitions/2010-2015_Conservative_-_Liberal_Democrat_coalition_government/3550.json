        "additional_details": "Various government policies give money to old people for no good reason, whether they are poor or not - such as winter fuel payments and free bus travel.\r\n\r\nThis is unfair as young people have a very hard time getting jobs, earning money, finding somewhere affordable to live, getting car insurance and so on. Old people have had their whole lives to make money whereas young people are expected to start out with nothing in a society that makes it very difficult to get anywhere.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to make life easier for young people instead, and to abolish subsidies that are awarded based on old age.",
