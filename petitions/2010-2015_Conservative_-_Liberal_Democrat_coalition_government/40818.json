        "additional_details": "The government to pass legislation banning all retailers from selling energy drinks such as Monster, Rockstar, Relentless, Red Bull and others to children under the age of 16 years.\r\nI as a mother of 2 children was disgusted when my son came home from the shop at 7 years old with a can of Rockstar energy drink i immediately took it off him but damage was already done as he had drank most of it on the walk back. It contained 160mg of caffeine in this one can and caused him too become very distressed and agitated he had wide eyes and was shaking and very pale with a very fast heart rate. This is the affect of a drink that has a small warning on the back that says not recommended for children but it is still clearly available to them. The flash styles on these cans are aimed at teenagers and children same with the names. Just think would you give your child a cup of instant coffee which only contains 57mg of caffeine if not than please help with my petition.\r\n",
