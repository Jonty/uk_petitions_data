A rating on a book would at a glance alert an adult to its content. Books can have misleading covers that would not alert anyone to its violent content.\r\n\r\nWe must better protect our children. Teachers give guidance in schools but for busy parents its hard to know if a child is reading something that may not be suitable for them. ",
