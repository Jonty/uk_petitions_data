It is better to refuse a right by a sovereign state onto other states unless it is in the conferring state\u2019s best interest. Grants of rights under EU treaties give the impression that they are for perpetuity. Treaties made by EU states should always have a get-out cause and review date to ensure that any rights conferred to others are not for perpetuity. Under Land Law, the right of private way (easements) over another's land may arise from prescription by twenty years of use of a land by implied easement. What rights is given away by a sovereign state may be returned back to the state, unless it is by military conquest as in 1066 by William the Conquer. ",
