        "additional_details": "We the undersigned urge Her Majesty\u2019s Government, Department for Business Innovation & Skills, to implement a NEW scheme that will allow local councils to bid for funds piloting reward based free town centre parking.\r\n\r\nThe town centre is still the only place in much of the UK where you can have such a range of shops and facilities in one place. However, the explosion of corporate retail parks offering free car parking is an immediate threat to our traditional retail landscape and communities.\r\n\r\nA centrally funded pilot scheme, that allows shoppers who SPEND to benefit from free off street car parking, may give our town centres a fighting chance! The proceeds of growth could enable these schemes to become future self-financing, and help make the UK the best place in Europe to shop.\r\n",
