        "additional_details": "Britain, home to an estimated 400 fighters in Syria and now Iraq, had been emphasizing outreach to universities, religious centres and prisons. On Monday, the government said it hoped to bolster laws to block returning fighters from re-entering the U.K. and strengthen monitoring if they do.\r\nThe concern is that returning fighters will launch attacks at home. Australia draws on lessons from Afghanistan a decade ago, saying of the 25 citizens who returned to Australia after fighting against Western interests there, two-thirds became involved in terrorist activities back home. Some remain in prison.\r\nWe want UK government to revoke the British citizenship to all returning Jihadist fighters regardless which country, countries they've been fighting for and  are returning from.\r\n",
