Opinion polls have shown that not only are these voters still likely to vote UKIP in the 2015 general election, but support has in fact grown since May and it is clear that UKIP now represents even more of the electorate than ever before. Therefore I ask you sign this petition to allow this vast swathe of the country to be represented on this most poignant day.\r\n",
