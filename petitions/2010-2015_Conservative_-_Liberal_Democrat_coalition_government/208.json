Retention of any piece of data cannot be justified by 'potential' use or 'possible' threat or need. Either someone is innocent or they are guilty - but only a UK court should have the power to decide which.\r\n\r\nIndividuals who are found 'Not guilty' in a UK court should have the right to have all records and samples (of any type or form) destroyed in their entirety and it should be a criminal offence for this right to be withheld or ignored.\r\n\r\nThe Freedom Bill promised this right but it is being greatly diluted with exceptions and compromises. There must be no exceptions or exclusions - it should be a black or white situation - Innocent or Guilty.",
