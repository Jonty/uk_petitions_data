        "additional_details": "The government pledged to replace the human rights act with a bill of rights, as part of coming to power. It has failed to do that.  The Human Rights Act has allowed criminals and other ant british/iestablishment figures to use the act to allow them to remain in this country and to override UK Law.  The act also undermines our judicial sytem, which provides legal aid within it for people to raise legitimate issues.  I would like to see the act replaced with a Bill of Rights which would support all sections of our society.  I would also like it to contain points about what is expected of a citizen in order to be protected within that Bill of Rights.  A bit like \"what can I do for my country not just what can my country do for me\"",
