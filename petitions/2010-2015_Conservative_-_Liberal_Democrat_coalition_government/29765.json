It is unworkable and will penalise people who are in rented council/social housing who have spare rooms because children have moved on. It will cause chaos and homelessness, mass evictions. There are not enough smaller properties for people to downsize, the stress on tenants will be unbearable, while they accrue rent arrears, moving costs. People constantly having to move around according to their 'situation' No security. Forcing them into private rented accomodation which is more expensive for smaller properties. There is no logic in this.  That was never the intention of council/social housing. Even housing associations have said that it is unworkable.\r\n\r\n",
