The petition requested that the government set up an inquiry into the existence of god on the basis that if there is no evidence for the existence of god, it makes no sense for religion to have any special say in policy making and implementation.I believe it is absolutely the responsibility of government to make sure that it makes policy on a rational basis and the policy should not therefore have been rejected.",
