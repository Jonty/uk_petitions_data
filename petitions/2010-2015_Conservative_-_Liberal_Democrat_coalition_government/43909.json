The BBC receives money from TV Licence payers within the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThose who do not purchase a TV Licence are harassed, threatened and bullied by the company.  TV Licensing 'Officers' are deployed to addresses that do not have a licence; often scaremongering people into believing that they may go to court, or that TV Licensing may obtain a warrant to search the premises.\r\n\r\nThe BBC and its contractors are private companies and they should not be harassing people into buying a TV Licence if they do not wish to do so.\r\n\r\nTV Licensing should be forced to cease its harassment, campaigns and scaremongering.",
