Morning session which is the most daunting period of the day for any individual in Britain could better exercised with the \"abnormal profits\" by providing the same work placement in other sectors with stipends pay. The employment opportunities could be better viewed as an islamic difference that destiny is given back to the hands of people instead of people chasing after money infact wasting their day without no avail for employment opportunities. A better perspective and the success I found from my indepth research. More Info.",
