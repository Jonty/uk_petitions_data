        "additional_details": "Wycombe District Council published the Local Plan in Febraury 2014.  In it they identify Slate Meadow as a Reserve Site for the creation of homes. In 1990 a planning application (W/90/5423/00) for the site was rejected in part on the grounds that the land is liable to flooding and may i) Likely impede the flow of flood water, ii) restrict the capacity of the flood plain and/or iii) increase the number of people or properties at risk.  Given the significant issues that have arisen locally due to flooding, we ask that the Department remove Slate Meadow from the Reserved List, and prevent Wycombe District Council from considering it for future developments",
