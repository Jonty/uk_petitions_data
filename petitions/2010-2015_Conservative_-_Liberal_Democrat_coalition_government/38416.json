This would be a City with a Government that is capable of delivering Government for all the people that in such a sense the British are, and in a form with which all can be content.  This the present Government for the British does not do. The present British Government\u2019s Idea of Government for the British is Government by the English. The definition of Britishness that it adheres to and insists upon is the lesser and more divisive definition that equates and confuses Englishness with Britishness. In a State with a Capital for the British that adheres to the greater and less divisive definition the present Capital for the British would therefore revert to being simply the Capital of the English.\r\n",
