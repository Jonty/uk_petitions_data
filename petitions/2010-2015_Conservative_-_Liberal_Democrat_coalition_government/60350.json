        "additional_details": "Make the the personal income allowance mean something that is relateable to everyone. Link it to the average minimum wage - \u00a36.31 x 40 per week x 52 weeks per year = \u00a313,125.\r\n\r\nThe personal allwance would then increase on the basis of this calcualtion as and when the minimum wage increases. Ensuring that those on the minimum wage are lifted out of tax.\r\n\r\nFurther, the cap on benefits, pensions etc. can also be linked to this calcualtion as a percentage of the total so that it will always pay to work.\r\n\r\nBy implementing the above proposal we would all truly be in this together as everyone would have a direct link to the minimum wage and therfore a vested interest in it being maintained at a fair level.",
