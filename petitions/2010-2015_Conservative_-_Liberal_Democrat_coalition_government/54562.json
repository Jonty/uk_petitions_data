To bring democracy to the UN voting and power structure will enable international relations to advance from the Cold War era and to allow progress within nations trapped in the battle between the UK, USA and China and Russia, such as Burma and Syria. The list of nations crippled by this power struggle is endless and the continued genocide and oppression witnessed is maintained to a degree by the undemocratic structure of the UN.",
