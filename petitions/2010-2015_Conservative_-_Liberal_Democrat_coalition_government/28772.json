This crisis is being deliberately fueled by a sub-culture of breeders bringing animals into the world with no regard for their futures and many of our inner cities have become an unregistered and unregulated dog and cat producing industry. Such breeders are earning many thousands each year in undeclared income. We call upon the Government to make sale the of puppies and kittens illegal by any means without VAT registration and income received from selling animals to be deducted from state benefits.",
