        "additional_details": "It is time to save our national sport from its inevitable decline. Over the two decades since the establishment of the Premiership, titles, trophies and success have been monopolised by a small number of super rich clubs with extremely wealthy benefactors. The overwhelming majority of English football fans do not support the Manchester, North London and West London cartel. In the 1970s, and 1980s, QPR, Watford, Derby County and the like all challanged for honours. Teams like Aston Villa, Manchester United and Manchester City could actually be relegated. Now, their place at the top table is a fait accompli. It is time that legislation be enacted to force the FA to limit every club's ability to 'buy' titles by spending at a level way beyond their annual income.",
