They will never ever be represented by the Somaliland militia who are killing and prosecuting the SSC people in Bohdleh and Lasanod this week.\r\n\r\nThe people of SCC can't be represented by Somaliland or Puntland but their democratically elected leaders. For the conference to be fruitful Khatumo State leader should be in the conference.\r\n\r\nAll Somali groups should be present in the London meeting including Awdal State.\r\n\r\nIf the British government fails to invite Khatumo State of Somalia leader to the meeting it will indicate that they sided against the people of SSC.\r\n",
