        "additional_details": "Psychic mediums feed off the bereaved and sometimes charge significant amounts of money for doing so. Their 'psychic' skills are scientifically unproven, and they rely on techniques such as 'cold reading' and pre-reading surveys to obtain information on their subjects. We would like to see the law changed to make it illegal for psychic mediums to charge for public and/or private readings/performances. Until such time as these mediums can scientifically prove their abilities, their practices should be treated as fraud. ",
