However anyone from the rest of the UK (England, Wales and Ireland) who wants to go to the same university in Scotland to do the same course would be charged up to \u00a39,000.\r\n\r\nThis surely should be deemed illegal on the grounds that the fees segregate the English, Welsh and Irish into paying over three times the amount for the exact same course and university; and the fees should be changed in accordance to the other fees.
