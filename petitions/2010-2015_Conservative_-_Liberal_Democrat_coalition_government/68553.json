        "additional_details": "This petition is calling for the accession of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United States of America. Joining the United States of America would bring an abrupt end to the recession and boost employment. As the United Kingdom would be part of the United States of America there would be no further need to spend billions on defence, and this money would be better spent on education and health care.",
