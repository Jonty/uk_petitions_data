        "additional_details": "The UK government should remove the Visa requirement for citizens of Serbia. UK citizens are able to visit Serbia visa free, and the UK should reciprocate.The removal of the visa requirement would foster better relations between the countries, and would enable Serbian people with family and friends in the UK to visit more frequently.\r\nThe Visa application process is cumbersome and expensive, and at the very least could be reduced in both complexity and expense, possibly a totally \"on line\" process for applicants with previous Visa's for the UK.",
