Time for it to change.\r\n\r\nIf I ever have a daughter then I want her to dream of growing up to be the next Pamela Cookey, Steph Houghton, Charlotte Edwards or Katie McLean. Just as boys are allowed to dream be of being David Beckham, Stuart Broad or Jonny Wilkinson.\r\n\r\nSadly without the BBC giving women's sports more airtime then I can't see this happening and my daughter would have to grow up wanting to be the next Miley Cyrus.\r\n",
