        "additional_details": "Changes to the application process for Blue Badges are leaving elderly and disabled applicants in the lurch. People with genuine disabilities are being refused Blue Badges for parking\r\nUnder current government legislation, in order to be accepted for the Blue Badge scheme you have to fall into one of the various categories stated in order to be eligible. The new regulations, introduced in January 2012, mean that up to 70% of applicants (both new and existing) now have to be assessed by occupational therapists.  There needs to be less rules and more common sense and allow the occupational therapists to use a degree of discretion instead of ticking boxes\r\nBlue Badges have been abused but we need more latitude with some people who are clearly in difficulty.\r\n\r\n Blue Badge issuance should be referred to a GP/Consultant or other healthcare professional involved in the applicants care",
