        "additional_details": "It is entirely true, there are unproductive workers in businesses up and down the country, from the top of the pay scale to the bottom & in all professions. In the final analysis the inequality of bargaining power is weighed against the employee and in that sense there needs to be protection.  Natural justice demands the accused be given the chance to answer his accusers.  Equality requires that ALL workers have right of redress and access to justice. That includes employers and employees.  DON'T SCRAP these fundamental rights.  If you do, this proposal will increase;\r\n1. Unfair dismissal\r\n2. Negativity in the work place\r\n3. Opportunistic sacking\r\n4. The culture of fear\r\n5. Social unrest\r\n6. The negative effect on the economy\r\n\r\nand destroy employees reputation.\r\n\r\n Given how bankers seem to have avoided dismissal it would be a travisty to enact this illconceived legislative proposal that would have the effect of hurting the most vulnerable in the labour market.\r\n\r\n",
