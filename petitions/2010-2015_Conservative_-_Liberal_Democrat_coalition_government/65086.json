January's polling cost taxpayers \u00a346,550.\r\n\r\nWhitehall have refused to issue the results of the polling amid suggestions that it shows a large majority in favour of independence and therefore damaging to the UK Government's Better Together campaign.\r\n\r\nGiven the taxpayer funded the poll and the people of Scotland deserve to be in possession of the FULL facts as presented by and to the UK Government (a position reinforced by the PM himself) the results of this poll should be published.
