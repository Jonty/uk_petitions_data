        "additional_details": "Rheumatoid {Known as Rheumatoid 'Arthritis'}. Is a very Chronic & Disabling Auto-Immune Disease. There is no Awareness Day for this illness. Rheumatoid sufferers worldwide and myself would like an Awareness Day, to feel counted and recognised for what we are going through. Although there is an Official Arthritis Awareness Day, myself and other Rheumatoid sufferers believe that Rheumatoid is not Arthritis, not even close. Rheumatoid is second to Cancer. We as sufferers would be elated if we could have An Official Rheumatoid Awareness Day.",
