I believe the government should make offenders do some community service, even if minor as the small minority of the young generation are ruining smaller shop's such as ours. We would urge people to sign this to raise the awareness with the government that we should not let people who commit a crime get away with it!\r\nPeople looting in a shop during these riots and people who steel in a shop. What is the difference? The difference is that the offenders who do it day in and day out are getting away with it. Please stop this now!",
