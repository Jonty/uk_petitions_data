        "additional_details": "The current system of Child Maintenance is stacked in favour of the parent with care. A much fairer system needs to be implemented that takes into account the earnings of both parents so that the financial settlements are equal, given equal care of the children. The total income of both parents should be taken into consideration and should include both earnings (possibly earning potential) and Tax Credits. Many parents without care who pay the amount dictated by the CMEC struggle themselves whilst the parent with care gets a substantial boost with Tax Credits as maintenance payments are not taken into account when maintenance is calculated.",
