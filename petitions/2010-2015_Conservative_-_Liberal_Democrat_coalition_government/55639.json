        "action": "The government should not introduce NHS fees to international students",
        "additional_details": "The government is proposing to introduce a charge of at least \u00a3200 for all students coming outside of the EU to study in England to use the NHS. At present all international students here for more than 6 months have free treatment on the NHS.\r\n\r\nStudent safety and well-being is a priority for our Universities. International students should not face added financial worries regarding their healthcare. If the government proposals pass in parliament many international students may avoid healthcare registration due to the added financial pressure.\r\n\r\nThe proposals further discriminate those from countries outside the EU, and doesn't respect the huge net benefit our international students provide (which the department of Business, Innovation and Skills estimates at \u00a37.9bn every year).",
