The cause of this rise is unknown and does not appear to be explained simply by improvements in diagnosis or changes in coding practice.1 The incidence of biliary cancers corresponds to mortality rates as the prognosis from these tumours is very poor.\r\nThere are no tumour markers specific for cholangiocarcinoma.",
