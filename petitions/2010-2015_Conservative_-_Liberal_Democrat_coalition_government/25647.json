        "additional_details": "We call upon the British government to give public recognition, in Parliament, to Hope Not Hate; Unite Against Fascism; Exposing Racism and Intolerance Online; and various other groups and individuals that, since 2009, have stood up to the intimidation of the Far-Right English Defence League (EDL) in order to expose that group\u2019s malicious and divisive behaviour and intentions.\r\n\r\nMany in the above groups have been subjected to threats, harassment and violence by EDL activists and supporters. But, they have not yielded in their opposition to the EDL \u2013 a group that exists as a problem both within its own right and in relation to wider issues.",
