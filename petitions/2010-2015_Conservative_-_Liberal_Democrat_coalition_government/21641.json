On an average net income of a working class individual, the percentage of child care costs can reach up to 80%.\r\n\r\nThis margin has grown increasingly over the years, as the government give hand outs to individuals that can not afford the standard costs of childcare, the provider progressively increases the cost to absorb this so called 'cushioning'.\r\n\r\nIf such costs were restricted then the government would not have to keep paying out tax payers money to help fund willing parents to go to work. Its a vicious cycle of taxation absorption that can be reduced if the government acted with prevention not by throwing away much needed funds in to a now money hungry care service.",
