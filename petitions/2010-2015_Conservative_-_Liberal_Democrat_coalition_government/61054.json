        "additional_details": "With the rising costs of child care for working parents, child minders who do not work for a nursery should not make parents pay for their annual holidays when parents still have to pay but take time off from their employment. It's an unfair practice, many child minders spread the cost of their 4 weeks paid holiday by spreading the cost over the weeks they are working to make it appear that when they are off on holiday that you are not paying them. Self employed people in every over profession don't get paid for holidays so why should child minders. Especial as this affects benefit payments and raises cost to the state. ",
