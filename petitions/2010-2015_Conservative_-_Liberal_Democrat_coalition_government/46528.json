Taxpayers money is used to run and maintain those car parks.\r\n\r\nTaxpayers who have contributed to the purchase and running of their car parks, should not be expected to pay again every time they use them.\r\n\r\nAll car parks under the umbrella of Government owned, are in fact Taxpayer owned and Taxpayers should have a right to free parking on their own land.\r\n\r\nThis would include Municipal, NHS Hospitals & Clinics etc., it would not include privately run car parks on non Government land. It should also include roadside parking in safe permitted areas, as the taxpayer also owns the roads.\r\n\r\nWithout the Taxpayer, Governments have no money of their own. Taxpayers elect Government officials to look after their money and assetts, not overcharge them at every opportunity.\r\n\r\nBan Parking Charges for Taxpayers",
