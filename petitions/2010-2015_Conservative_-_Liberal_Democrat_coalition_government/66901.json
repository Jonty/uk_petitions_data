        "additional_details": "The aim of this petition is to gain enough signatures for Parliament to hold a debate on the restoration of capital punishment in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nWe are forever hearing of serious criminals receiving weak prison sentences and 'special treatment,' but the truth is, the majority of the British public believe that scum like these are not welcome in our society.\r\n\r\nI understand some people are against capital punishment for a number of reasons, but with today's DNA advancements and forensic techniques, it is extremely unlikely to give somebody a false conviction and even if there were to be the odd false conviction, the courts could be held accountable for that.\r\n\r\nIf you believe in a safer Britain with tougher punishments, sign this petition. Just think of the future your children and your grandchildren face and if they were to be victims of a horrendous crime.",
