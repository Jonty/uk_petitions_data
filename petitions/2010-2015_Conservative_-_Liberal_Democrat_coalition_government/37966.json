        "additional_details": "The effect that Mephedrone -  Meow Meow and other designer drugs is having on our communities is catastrophic.  Drugs like Cannabis and Heroin are grown naturally and have some chemicals in them that can be used positively. It is a drug that is made in laboratories mainly in China.  In its production it is made with the sole intention of triggering Neurotransmitters in the brain and getting the user extremely high.  We are already seeing a marked increase in users of Mephedrone being admitted to psychiatric wards and this is only the short term effect.  This drug is as similar to amphetamines as paracetemol is to morphine, yet they are classified as the same.  Dealers of this drug are receiving similar sentences as if they had been caught with cannabis which is also a Class B drug.  Mephedrone is very similar in its strength of addiction as Methamphetamine. We call upon the Government to reclassify Mephedrone to a Class A",
