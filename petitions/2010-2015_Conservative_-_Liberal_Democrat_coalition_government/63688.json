Not only have the MPs - who we put in office - getting an 11% pay rise when most of us are getting nothing, Maria Miller only has to pay back a small percentage of the money she has claimed \"by mistake\".\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of people in this country who are being bullied by the Government's henchmen, namely the occupational health, so called \"experts\",\r\n\r\nIt is time for this persecution of the tax payers, mainly the disabled and those less fortunate, to be debated in Parliament.\r\n\r\nWho will be  held to account for the deaths caused by this outrageous intimidation whilst the MPs go free.\r\n\r\nI am sure, you, like me, would like this Government to stop avoiding the issue and give the answers to which we are entitled.",
