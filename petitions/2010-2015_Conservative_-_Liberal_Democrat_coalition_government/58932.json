        "additional_details": "E-cigarettes present a unique problem for regulators, but the approaches being considered thus far are analogous to trying to fit a square block into a triangular hole. There is no tobacco in e-cigarettes, and current evidence shows that e-cigarettes are comparable in safety to approved smoking cessation products like patches, gums and inhalers. E-cigarettes are orders of magnitude safer than cigarettes, and treating them identically from a regulatory perspective would be absurd and disproportionate. The European Commission\u2019s recent proposal is a prime example of the sort of legislation that threatens a promising ally in the fight against smoking. Reference: http://ecigarettereviewed.com/european-commission-proposes-idiotic-e-cig-legislation/\r\n\r\nWe urge you to: Refuse to classify e-cigarettes as tobacco products; Avoid unnecessary restrictions on advertising; Avoid instituting a nicotine limit; Institute reasonable manufacturing standards.",
