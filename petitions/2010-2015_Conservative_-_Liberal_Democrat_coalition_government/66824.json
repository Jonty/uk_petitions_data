Safe places for women & children are becoming few and far between.\r\n\r\nThe Haven Wolverhampton is facing a large cut to it's funding.\r\n\r\nThis could effect the vital ongoing support The Haven gives to women and children effected by domestic abuse.\r\n\r\nThe Haven gives women & children the opportunity of education, money & debt advice, legal advice and more importantly a safe haven free from Domestic Abuse.\r\n\r\nIt is important that we raise awareness of Domestic Abuse and the impact these possible cuts will have to women & children past, present and future.\r\n",
