        "additional_details": "The majority of the long term unemployed have got themselves into a rut and in many cases are second and third generation long term unemployed. As benefits are so good many do not wish to work and can still avail of holidays, good housing and many other perks at the expense of the taxpayer. To solve this and to encourage a work ethos into the work shy, a form of national service particularly for the young should be introduced as a means of contributing to society, to our hard pressed defence forces, and to introduce discipline into their lives.",
