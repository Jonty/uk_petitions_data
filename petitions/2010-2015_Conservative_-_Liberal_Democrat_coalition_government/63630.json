        "action": "Allow any employee, regardless of length of employment, to have a right to claim unfair dismissal",
        "additional_details": "The current law claims employees can only claim for unfair dismissal if employed for two or more years.  This law, however, leaves employess of less than two years vulnerable to losing their employment without satisfactory cause and can mean employers may bully or force unwanted employees out without due cause, or may not follow proper discilpinery procedures and can leave employees open to allegations not being investigated fairly, abuse, discrimination and bullying.\r\n\r\nI believe all employees, whether employed for 5 minutes or 5 years are entitled to the same treatment any reasons to dismiss an employee should be thoroughly investigated first and the employer must have full evidence and good reason to dismiss the employee.\r\n\r\n",
