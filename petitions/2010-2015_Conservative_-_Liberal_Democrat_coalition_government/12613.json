Government to remove all restrictions on immigration into the UK.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the public services of the UK, paid for by the taxes of the rich should be available to all people, not just those who happen to have been born on this island.\r\n\r\nWe further believe that removing immigration restrictions would allow wages to equalise between countries, ending the unfair situation whereby people in some countries earn less than \u00a31 for a full day's work\r\n\r\nWe further believe that Britain, as a democratic country with international influence has the ability to lead the way internationally and encourage all countries to follow suit by acting unilaterally at first",
