        "additional_details": "The period between Christmas and the fist buds of spring is miserable in Britain and only worsened by Valentine's Day being the only day of celebration before Easter.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned feel there should be a new national festival midway between Christmas and Easter that is really very enjoyable and lifts the spirit. It could be a celebration of multi-cultural Britain with plenty of music, dance, beer, curry and general merry making. It will help make up for the over-commercialisation of Christmas and be a date for us to get together as a Nation and really enjoy ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe may not have the Olympics again within our lifetimes but we can warm our national cockles with a good British knees-up.
