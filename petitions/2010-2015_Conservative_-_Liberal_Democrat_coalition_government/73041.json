        "additional_details": "Students in secondary school should start at 10:00AM in the winter. I strongly believe in this because in the winter students find it harder to get up in the morning as their brain is telling them it's still night because it's dark. Consequently, students have to force themselves to get up in the mornings to get to school on time so that they can get full school hours into the day. However, this often means that the student it tired and therefore unable to concentrate and achieve the level they should be getting. They also get stressed out and start feeling sick. Therefore, school should start at 10:00AM and end at 5:00PM which is still the required amount of time spent at school rather than getting to school at 8:20 and ending at 3:20",
