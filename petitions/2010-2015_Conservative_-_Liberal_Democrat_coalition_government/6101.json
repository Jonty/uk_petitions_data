        "additional_details": "Even in this day and age, children are forced to pray to God in state schools. This doesn't take into account whether the school is affiliated with a church or the child's own religious beliefs. Children should not be forced to pray to a deity which they may not believe in. Freedom of belief should be encouraged in state schools and schools should concentrate on teaching facts and allowing children to become free-thinkers capable of coming to their own conclusions after seeking evidence for themselves.",
