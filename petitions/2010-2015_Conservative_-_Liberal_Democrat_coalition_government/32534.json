We feel that the professionalism of teachers in the Lifelong Learning Sector (which has been so hard to obtain) will be lost.\r\nWe would therefore like the Government to reconsider the content of the report and keep the Regulations in place.\r\nAs the final report is due in July 2012, action needs to be taken quickly.",
