In the current economic climate I can fully understand those who dare not petition, but it is PRECISELY why I am petitioning now for a decent increase.\r\nCarers are the silent ones. We care for loved ones. Often giving up decent careers to do so. Instead of increases we are 'pushed' into working, so that they can pay care assistants to do the very same job whilst we are at work? I guess to them it's called 'Respite'.\r\nPlease review this much-neglected benefit",
