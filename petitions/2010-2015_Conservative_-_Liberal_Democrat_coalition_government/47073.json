With death rates from liver disease rising by 65% over the past 20 years, the Government cannot afford to do nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Government made a clear commitment to introduce a MUP for alcohol in its alcohol strategy published in March 2012. We urge the Government not to backtrack, and to put health and lives first by introducing MUP.",
