        "additional_details": "Donaldson's School for the Deaf, Linlithgow is in need of a new Principal. The school needs fresh ideas and somebody that understands the Deaf community and its culture. We need support to recruit a new principal. Our current one is working to get rid of the qualified staff in order to recruit those that will do as she says. I think it is important to have a principal in place that loves and cares for the children, especially in the environment that Donaldson's offers. Please show your support and help us to get a new principal that we can work with and will appreciate both children and staff.",
