The police has the ipcc that are easy to access whilst the dwp answer to no one.\r\n     We believe this would a great benefit to both Dwp and claimants. At present the DWP has no department dealing or even taking complaints. If there are then not even the employees seem aware of this and it is the cause of frustration in claimant's when they are not able to question or recieve the appropriate answers to a  concern or complaint.\r\n    Isn't it also a cop out for DWP not to have a complaints department and to answer to nobody?
