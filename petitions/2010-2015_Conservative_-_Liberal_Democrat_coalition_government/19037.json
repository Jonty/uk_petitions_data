        "action": "Change the Law on Mental Health Admissions and secure all Units within each establishment",
        "additional_details": "The government need to change the Law with regard to the detainment of Mental Health Patients. High risk assessment needs to be undertaken by qualified specialists in their field. Mental Health patients should NOT be allowed to roam free in our communities. There is not enough being done to protect the public. The recent killing of a Grandmother in Bexleyheath occured after a patient freely walked out of Oxleas Unit, on Baker Road in Woolwich and made her way, unnoticed, to Bexleyheath, Calling the police was too little too late. The route in and out of these secure units need to be a SECURE priority. No patient, with any mental health problems should be free to walk out. The law needs to change. Please support this petition and help us secure the perimeters of these hospitals and ensure public safety by changing the law! We need 100,000 signatures to get this to Parliament.",
