        "additional_details": "As has been proposed to reduce the number of people smoking, the need for plain packaging for high fat & high sugar foods is required to help tackle the rising obesity epidemic in the UK.\r\n\r\nIt is a known fact that pictures of appetising foods can trigger a desire to consume food as it is the trigger for impulse buying.\r\n\r\nCream cakes, chocolate biscuits, bacon products, sweets, cakes, high sugar drinks. whole milk etc should be produced in plain packets with a high calorie warning on the packaging instead. Also fast food outlets should be banned from displaying pictures of meals in their outlets and on their menus and instead, use this space to promote healthy eating with calorie and nutrition information.",
