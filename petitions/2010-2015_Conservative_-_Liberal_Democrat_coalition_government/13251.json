        "additional_details": "Why should young people (16-18) be put on benefits as soon as they leave school? Give them three options:\r\n1) Further education\r\n2) A Government sponsored apprenticeship with any type of business at no cost to the employer\r\n3) Charity service: Working for charities, especially abroad, where they could make a real difference.\r\nInstead of benefits for doing nothing let's see them work for it. And, if none of the above apply there should be a form of national service run by retired soldiers to teach them self reliance and discipline (16-21). This is the only way to tackle gang culture.  ",
