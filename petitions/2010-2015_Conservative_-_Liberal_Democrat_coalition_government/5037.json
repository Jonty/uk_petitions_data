However, campaigners have joined forces with MP David Nuttall to ask Health Secretary Andrew Lansley to reconsider the decision.\r\n\r\nThe shake-up was approved when Greater Manchester had 33,544 live births a year, in 2005. The Office of National Statistics predicted this would reach 33,642 in 2015 but the 2010 figures stand at 37,876. But the Children and Young People\u2019s Network, which is overseeing Making it Better, has said the new system can cope with 41,000 births.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe campaigners have met MP Nuttall and a letter is going to Mr Lansley to request a meeting to discuss the matter, asking him to look again at keeping Bury\u2019s services.\r\n ",
