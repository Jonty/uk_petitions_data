        "additional_details": "In April 2012 the amount of BSOG Bus Operators get back from the Government is being reduced from 80 to 60 per cent. This is already having an effect on Bus Services. The Government should be paying the full amount back to the Bus Companies. It would cost about 200 million pounds each year to do this. Bus Services are vital to the economy, the industry employs thousands of people. Buses are a vital lifeline to disabled  and older people, and they promote social inclusion.   ",
