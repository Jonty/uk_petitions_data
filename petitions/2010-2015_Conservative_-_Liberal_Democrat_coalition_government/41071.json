That is why the Kurds might blame Britain. the Kurds think, Britain should help them to get their own state and it is obvious that the Kurds do not want to stay in Iraq any more. This is because Iraq committed genocide against them such as Halabja (5000 civilian killed by chemical weapons) Anfal campaign (182,000 people killed)",
