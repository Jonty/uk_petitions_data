        "additional_details": "The party-based whip system corrupts the views of MPs, reducing a parliament of over 600 to three shades of party policy, which listens only once every five years to voters.\r\n\r\nReplace the voting system with a one-to-one pledge vote.  A citizen can pledge their vote to any representative, and change their pledge as and when their dissatisfaction with their current representative transpires.  The weight of a MP's vote would be in accordance with the number of pledges held - every vote counts.\r\n\r\nResult - continuous democratic representation and MPs forced to listen to their pledged citizens rather than party systems.  Use technology to bring votes to life and make every voice in this once great country heard.",
