        "additional_details": "All across the Country, thousands of emergency personnel are working to make our lives safe and secure.   We all take these services for granted, and expect them to be there when we dial for assistance.  These people put their lives on hold to serve their communities, often in very dangerous circumstances.   They work tirelessly each and every day to protect us, rescue us and treat us in times of danger, tragedy and accident.\r\n  We have an armed forces day (quite rightly so as well), but in this day and age when life is difficult, our emergency services continue to give their all to keep us safe and to keep danger from society.\r\n  We ask the government to introduce a national Emergency Services Day to acknowledge the sacrifices made by these men and woman in a Red, Blue and Green.\r\nPlease share and sign the petition and let\u2019s see if we can make an Emergency Services Day !\r\nThank you for your support.\r\n\r\n",
