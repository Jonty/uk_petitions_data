For example, a two month sick note lasts for just that unless you happen be the DWP who think that it lasts for two months and four days.\r\n\r\nDWP staff tell you to take a sick note to your local job centre.  What they don't tell you is that you need to make an appointment.  When you query this with them, you are told that your query is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nIf people who are lucky enough to have a job and make the same mistakes as these people make, they would have lost their jobs time and time again.",
