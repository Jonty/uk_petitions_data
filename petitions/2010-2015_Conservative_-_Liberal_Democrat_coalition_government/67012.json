        "additional_details": "The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that the wearing of Face Covering Clothing in Public makes open personal relationships difficult and has upheld the French Governments ban on the wearing of such attire in public. As British Citizens and European Members we deserve the right to know to whom we are speaking and gauge their responses. Furthermore from a security issue identity covering clothing can be used to conceal weapons or true identities in secure areas. This petition urges HM Government to better protect our nation by following the example from France under the ruling from the European Court.",
