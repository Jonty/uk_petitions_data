        "additional_details": "We call on the Inland Revenue to withdraw Stonewall's charitable status and make it pay tax.\r\nThe Stonewall lobbying group, a homosexual activist organization, has wrongly been granted charitable status and avoids paying tax. Under British law, it is not permitted for charities to engage in any sort of political campaigning or lobbying to change laws.\r\n\"It is considered unacceptable for charitable trusts to campaign for political or legal change, although discussing political issues in a neutral manner is acceptable.\"\r\nYet Stonewall has never stopped campaigning on political issues for the last 30 years They state on their own website that they were formed to campaign against Clause 28 of the Local Government Act. That is political and so are all the campaigns they have conducted since then e.g. to lower the age of consent or to advocate homosexual adoption \"rights\".\r\nIt is unfair that they are treated as a charity.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
