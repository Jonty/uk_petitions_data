        "additional_details": "Due to what is classed as the under the carpet swept privatisation of our NHS, it is necessary for the public to be aware of this, and to put their views forward in trying to save the NHS.  With the current economic climate, making cuts is necessary, however privatising one of the good things this country has is not necessary.  By creating this petition I want the Government to take note of it's citizens.  There must be other ways to keep the NHS.  A couple of points that could be taken into consideration that would not only benefit the NHS but also to help on the curb on binge drinking, is to charge for all incidents that are alcohol related.  ie. if an ambulance is called out to someone who is over intoxicated and has fallen, they should be charged.  I could go on, however my point could get lost in the meaning of this petition.",
