        "additional_details": "Currently in the United Kingdom a female cannot be convicted of raping a male under any circumstances. A female over the age of 16 who has sex with a male under the age of 16 is not charged with statutory rape, instead she can only be prosecuted for indecent assault.\r\nI believe that there are many circumstances in which a female can rape a male; if the male is attracted to the female sexually but asks her to stop for any other reasons and she refuses throughout intercourse, if a female drugs a male, and if a female sleeps with a minor.\r\nI am aware that male-to-female rape is far more common than female-to-male rape and that women have a much more difficult time in society than men do, however I believe that for the law to not accept that a woman can rape a man is ridiculous!\r\n",
