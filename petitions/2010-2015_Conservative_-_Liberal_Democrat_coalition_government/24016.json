        "additional_details": "We the undersigned ask that the United Kingdom Government consider the possibility of financial sanctions should any minister for parliament be found guilty of future fraudulent expenses claims.\r\n\r\nEvery parliamentary minister has a responsibility to their constituents, and to the general public as a whole, to display that they are trustworthy and transparent in how they spend money for expenses. Any parliamentary minister who breaks this covenant should be subject to a term of financial sanction deducted from their parliamentary salary and/or future expenses claims.\r\n\r\nMinisters who make fraudulent expenses claims should be seen to be punished, not only by law but through the eyes of the people of this United Kingdom. Such a policy would go a long way to achieving this.",
