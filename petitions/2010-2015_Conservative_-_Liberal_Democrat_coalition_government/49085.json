Where are the articles about doctors, lecturers, engineers, cleaners, waitresses, Au pairs, who serve well Britain and are highly appreciated by neighbours, colleagues and employees?\r\n\r\nThe Romanians are decent and proud people, value their status within the society, many of them are highly skilled and serving well Britain.\r\n\r\nWe ask the media and the government to provide an overarching picture of who we are!
