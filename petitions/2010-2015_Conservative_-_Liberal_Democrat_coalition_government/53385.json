        "additional_details": "The government intends to re-privatise the East Coast rail service in 2015, despite two previous private sector failures.\r\n\r\nThe current government-run service has become a great success, providing a return of \u00a3640m for the taxpayer since 2009, and an excellent service for passengers, with well-staffed comfortable trains, good catering, a popular loyalty rewards scheme, and high customer satisfaction and staff morale.\r\n\r\nBy 2015 Virgin Trains will have operated the West Coast Main Line for 18 years, yet East Coast passengers will have to endure another change of operator, the fourth in 10 years.  This change is unnecessary and disruptive, and will not benefit customers, staff or the taxpayer.\r\n\r\nThe East Coast rail company is only 4 years old and should be allowed many more years to run the service, building on the success achieved so far.\r\n\r\nPlease stop this privatisation and save our rail service.",
