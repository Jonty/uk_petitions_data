        "additional_details": "I would like the government to change the two person lane on the M606 to an all vehicles filter lane as:\r\n\r\nIt is under used and often empty when other lanes are blocked.\r\nIt has made traffic flow worse on the M606 - M62 east-bound approach.\r\nIt discriminates against those of us in business on our own who have to travel but never have a passenger. This government supports small business and yet is making travel for business more difficult.\r\nIt was introduced as a trial and there has been no indication of when this trial will end or any measure of success or failure.\r\nIt discriminates against single people.
