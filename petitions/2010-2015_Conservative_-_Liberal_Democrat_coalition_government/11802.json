        "additional_details": "There is a common perception that there is a significant group of people who have made a career out of claiming benefits and that the state has bred a culture of dependency.\r\nA single payment never exceeding the equivalent of a 40 hour week at the minimum wage, would make a very powerful statement. You can never be better off on benefits compared with someone who is working. If you do not want to develop yourself then you have a very clear idea of what the state will provide to you. No one could ever make the accusation that benefits are the easy option.\r\nThe above measure/policy would ensure that everyone aspires to work and contribute to society. Hard pressed tax payers would have a more natural empathy for unfortunate individuals on benefits and would be more inclined to be more altruistic towards those less fortunate in their community. This would promote more community cohesion, less prejudice and a \u201cbigger\u201d society.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
