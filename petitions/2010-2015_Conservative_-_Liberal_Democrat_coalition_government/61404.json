It is our human rights to buy fresh food that are not full of harmful chemicals that can build up and lead to all sorts of health issues.\r\n\r\nSome foods that are marked as organic by supermarkets still contain synthetic chemicals. Organic produce is a lot more expensive than non-organic products, so it seems to be that only wealthy people can afford such luxuries.\r\n\r\nSurely there needs to be a complete change on the way food is produced, even if this means increased prices at least as a nation we will be healthier.\r\nThe government would save money on healthcare if they banned such toxic chemicals from our foods.
