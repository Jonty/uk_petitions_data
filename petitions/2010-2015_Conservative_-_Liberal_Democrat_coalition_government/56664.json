        "additional_details": "Please do not withdraw the 1% public sector pay rise planned for 2014. Although incremental rises are apparently to continue, many staff have reached the top of the pay scale, and will receive no rise at all, when food, fuel etc prices have increased by 10% or more. Many workers are already feeling the effects of this and the previous years of pay freeze, and this will not go down well after hearing that we are paying for the extortionate fuel bills of MPs, when many of us can no longer afford to heat our houses.",
