Along with reckless trading which was the catalyst for the banking crisis, also bearing in mind that the miss selling of PPI was not a mistake, it was a premeditated act of fraudulent sales to its customers which not one banker has been took to task over !\r\n1/. The infrastructure is there via the Post Office\r\n2/. The staff are available due to bank redundancies\r\n3/. Lenders and savers could be given a fair deal.\r\nOnly meaningful competition will get these banks to put their house in order when dividends start reducing to their shareholders !\r\n",
