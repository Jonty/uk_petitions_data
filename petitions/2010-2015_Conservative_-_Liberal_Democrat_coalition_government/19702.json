        "additional_details": "While energy companies are posting record profits and providing an extremely poor and anti-competitive service to boot, it is RIDICULOUS that they should be able to BLOCK your transfer to another provider in any way, shape or form.\r\n\r\nIf they have a problem with your account, it's not like they can't afford to pursue you for this money like EVERY other company does... through the courts.\r\n\r\nEssentially they can cut off your gas and electricity supply if you disagree with your bill. This empowers them to provide a poor service and charge you anything they like with little financial consequences for their actions.\r\n\r\nWhat's next? Are Morrison's supermarkets going to stop me shopping at Waitrose because I disagreed with a home shopping delivery bill?\r\n\r\nWho allowed them to do this in the first place?",
