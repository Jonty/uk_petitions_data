        "additional_details": "Allowing late opening hours for nightclubs has been a total mistake.\r\n\r\nYoung people are leaving home on a Saturday night and are able to consume alcohol for anything up to eight hours!\r\n\r\nThe consequences of this are frightening, police are overwhelmed with disorder.   Young people fighting, even dying as a result.  We must make a U turn and go back to sensible times, Im sure that most young people would just go to their homes if there is no where else to get another drink!\r\n\r\nPlease sign my petition before we have more deaths due to excess late night drinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
