        "additional_details": "Abu Qatada known al Qeada member, preacher to Richard Reid, spiritual leader of al Qeada in Europe, currently under world wide embargo by EUN Security Council and wanted in USA, JOrdan and numerous European countries. This man entered UK illegally and has been fairly treated up to and beyond his initial arrest shortly after the London bombings in 2005. His sermons were discovered in the residence of the cell leader of the 9-11 attacks. What costs have tax payers covered and will continue to cover once released?  The citizens of UK deserve to have their Human Rights upheld and the signatories on this petition seek his immediate deportation regardless of any other non British courts ruling. He clearly poses a serious threat to the security of this nation. Stop injustice and do the right things or have home live at hime with YOU at YOUR expense.",
