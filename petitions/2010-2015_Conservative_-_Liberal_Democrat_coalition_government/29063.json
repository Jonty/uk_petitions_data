This is following a number of public figures such as former M.P. Anne Widdecombe and the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Carey publicly supporting this type of \"therapy.\" it is the opinion of the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, and the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy that such treatments are not in any way helpful and \"no responsible psychotherapist will attempt to 'convert' a client from homosexuality to heterosexuality.\" However many of the organisations and individuals who practice \"reparative therapy\" are not licenced by or members of any of these groups.\r\nI urge the government to publicly denounce all attempts at homosexual to hetrosexual conversion, conduct research into the effects of such processes and make it a criminal offence to offer this type of quack \"treatment.\"",
