        "additional_details": "Owen Patterson should stand down as a minister if he allows the Development of GMO on British soil. He must come clean via the freedom of information act about the constant lobbying from GMO companies. It has emerged that these efforts are being carried out in partnership with the Agricultural Biotechnology Council, which is financed by GM companies such as Monsanto, Syngenta and Bayer CropScience. Britain has a vibrant farming heritage and does not need these frankinfoods causing biodiversity polution & destruction. Many countries around the world have banned GMO. We Have some of the best farming practices and crops in the world. If Owen Patterson thinks this should be implemented, then lets see if he would be willing to eat GMO foods permanatly for the rest of his life! There is still too much issues regarding the long term safety of GMO for human consuption and longterm  safety for the biodiversity and indiginous crops.   ",
