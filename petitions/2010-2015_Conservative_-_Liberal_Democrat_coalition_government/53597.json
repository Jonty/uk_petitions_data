        "additional_details": "Enfield residents must stand together to stop the closure of Chase Farm Hospital and secure funding to retain and improve what is now considered the worst hospital in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis hospital simply cannot close; it will mean adding to the burden of the over-stretched facilities at Barnet or North Middlesex Hospital. Enfield MUST retain an A&E at Chase Farm to avoid exposing local residents of our densely populated area to health risks.We will see a huge lack in quality healthcare provision, longer waiting times, over-stretched hospital staff and facilities. Waiting times in Chase Farm are currently 3hrs+. Can you imagine how long it will take to be treated in an emergency if you have to travel to Barnet or North Mid, and then wait 3,4, or 5 hours to be seen, then wait for an x-ray or a scan, etc. WE MUST PUT A STOP TO THIS \u2013 ONCE IT IS GONE -THERE IS NO GOING BACK \u2013 MAKE A STAND NOW!!!\r\n",
