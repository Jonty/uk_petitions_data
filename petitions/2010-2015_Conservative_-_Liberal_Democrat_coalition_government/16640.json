        "additional_details": "We the undersigned wish the government to end the iniquitous tax regime in the UK which is over complicated,unfair and holds back economic growth, aspiration and real job creation. We propose a simple flat tax rate of 25% for all money however earned or received over a basic tax free amount of \u00a312,000 per annum. This will remove the lower paid out of the tax system and the more people earn, the more they pay, but at the same rate. In conjunction, all tax relief and most benefits can be scrapped.",
