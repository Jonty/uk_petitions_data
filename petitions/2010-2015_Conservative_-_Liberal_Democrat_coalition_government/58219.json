Informers don't wear uniforms and is likely to be someone who is in your circle of friends or maybe a work colleague?  A habitual criminal can and will use the police to settle a grudge with you as well as making the most of the perks of the job.  I am the youngest of 6 children and not one of us has a criminal record.\r\n\r\nIF AS A LAW ABIDING CITIZEN YOU THINK YOUR SAFE, WHAT IF YOUR WRONG?\r\n\r\nWith all the technology and other techniques available in fighting crime they should totally cease to use criminals in order to get information.  Stop any further abuse of power and don't allow any more lives to be ruined this way.\r\n\r\n",
