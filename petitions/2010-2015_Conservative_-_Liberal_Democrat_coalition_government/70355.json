He put consideration for himself and his personal safety aside and travelled, repeatedly, to what was, arguably, the most dangerous place in the world, simply to help those in need.  In life he helped those who needed help in death he will inspire all of us to be better people and try and put the needs of others above our own.  Alan Henning was a Great British Hero and should be recognised as such!",
