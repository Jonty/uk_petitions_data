We have nuclear submarines and nuclear electric power stations, which will also reduce CO2 emissions. So why not nuclear powered aircraft carriers. Perhaps there is enough time yet during the 'postponement period' to consider this.\r\n\r\nNuclear power on the aircraft carriers (and submarines) will not only run their armaments and propulsion for DECADES without the need for refuel, thus able to go for extended missions - only dependent on the amount of food they have available in stock aboard at the time.\r\n\r\nThe nuclear power will also run kitchen equipment (like ovens, cookers, fridge, freezer), as well as lighting, computers, housekeeping appliances, etc on board ships/submarines.\r\n\r\nSuch aircraft carriers should also be heavy armed for their own self-defence, as well as capable of carrying over 50 aircrafts (apart JFA, also adapted Typhoon Eurofighters, Apache helicopters, etc).",
