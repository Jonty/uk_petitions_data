        "additional_details": "Developing rapport, obtaining informed consent, safeguarding best interest of patients & confidentiality, demonstrating empathy & unconditional positive regard, taking patients\u2019 perspectives should be amongst the important web of prerequisites, knowledge, skills, abilities required of healthcare professionals. Establishing rapport with patients is often the result of the interaction of effective communication, demonstrating empathy, trust, respecting patients\u2019 choice, showing unconditional positive regard, as well as empowering patients to overcome (or cope, minimise) their health problems. Commission on Dignity in Care recently advised HMG that healthcare staff should be recruited for their caring values, not only qualifications. Further training & assessment, as well as changes in person specification during recruitment may be required in this regard.",
