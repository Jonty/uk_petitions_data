        "additional_details": "The British Government must immediately rescind any existing sanctions on foreign countries and impose no further ones. Such measures not only harm the national government in question but also its people. The most infamous example is the United Nations sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s and early part of this century. They had a catastrophic impact on Iraq's population as a whole, resulting in the deaths of around half a million Iraqi children, which can only\r\nbe described as genocide. Tragically, however, no\r\nlessons have been learnt by western governments, as\r\nthe United States and the European Union have\r\nrecently introduced an oil embargo against Syria, even\r\nthough the Syrian political situation is an internal\r\nSyrian matter which warrants no outside interference.\r\nForeign sanctions represent nothing more than\r\nnational chauvinism and phoney moral grandstanding against supposedly inferior nations, which western\r\nregimes are in no position to assert.
