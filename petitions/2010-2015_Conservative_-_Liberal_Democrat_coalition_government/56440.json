        "action": "Divert funds from Renewable Obligations to public green energy infrastructure",
        "additional_details": "Currently, Renewable Obligations are used as incentives for energy suppliers to source renewable energy for their customers from which they can reclaim a premium on however much they sell.  However, I believe this money should kept as a levy on energy companies and put to better use in creating a publicly owned green energy infrastructure.  This will ultimately work towards a part-nationalisation of the green electricity energy sector in the UK.",
