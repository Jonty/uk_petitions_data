It generates dynamism and reduces costs through continual competition.\r\n\r\nI would thus like to propose that the government of the UK be privatised such that the entirely of the government of the UK be retained as an elected body. but that the cost associated with the operation of parliament as a day to day business concern be absorbed and managed efficiently through the private sector, thus minimising for tax-payers the burden of  financing for the day to day operation of government. This would also ensure through competitive market practice the government would operate in the most cost effective manner.. ",
