        "additional_details": "Nearly 100,000 prisoners are spending their days sitting in a cell playing a console game, watching television or playing cards.\r\nSome are trying to improve their physical condition by working out in a gym with the use of sports equipment such as treadmills cross trainers and weights machines.\r\nThe kitchens cook meals for them three times a day with meals sometimes eaten in their cells.\r\n\r\nThe more i think about this it sounds more like a hotel!\r\n\r\nI suggest that prisoners work for their food the same as we do!\r\nBy doing hard labor building more prisons, building community centers & youth clubs, hospitals or mending roads and other jobs to repay the government for their keep & at the same time learning a trade or qualification that may be of use to them once they leave the prison system.\r\n\r\n",
