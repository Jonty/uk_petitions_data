Our organisation specifically focuses on the promotion of involvement of men within ladies football in order to advance and bridge the gap between men and women which still to this do remains both divisive and endemic within today's society. One tackle at a time MILF hopes to inspire more broadly the drive towards gender stratification and with your help we hope to eradicate once and for all this stain which continues to dilute and erode  the moral fibre of our society. It is is I and I, not you and I.",
