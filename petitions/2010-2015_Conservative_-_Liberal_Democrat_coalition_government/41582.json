They must not have a history of scandals nor be investigating areas in which they may be compromised. This is especially the case in Home Affairs and now with tax and child scandals, Public Accounts.\r\nFor the sake of democracy, those wanting to chair these committees must be elected by the public, not appointed by their mates in parliament on the basis that it is now their turn. The current chair people must resign immediately.\r\n",
