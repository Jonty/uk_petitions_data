        "action": "REDUCE ELECTRICITY BILLS BY REFORMING THE SUBSIDIES FOR WIND FARMS",
        "additional_details": "Electricity bills have soared, and more increases are in the pipeline.   This punishes the 6 million people already in fuel poverty, restricts economic growth, and makes British industry less competitive.\r\n\r\nA key factor in this increase is the Renewables Obligation, which indirectly provides more than 40% of the income of wind-farms.  These complex and covert subsidies (most of which go to foreign companies) are paid not by the government, but instead are ENTIRELY financed by increasing the price of our electricity bills.   Climate-change policies have already increased household electricity by at least 14%, and have increased the electricity bills of business by at least 20%.  Even worse, these tariffs are forecast to escalate.\r\n\r\nBy reducing or ending the subsidies for wind-farms, we would benefit the poorest members of society, boost our manufacturing exports and, while doing so, would help protect what remains of our precious countryside.  Please vote for this petition.\r\n",
