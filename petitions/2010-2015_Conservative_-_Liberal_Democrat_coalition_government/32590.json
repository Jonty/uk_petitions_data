It is widely used  worldwide as a frontline attack against metastasised bowel cancer.\r\nHowever, in Wales this drug is not funded and patients either pay for it themselves or else not receive treatment with this potentially life saving drug.\r\nIn April 2011 Mum was diagnosed with bowel cancer that spread to her liver. She desperately needs this drug as she is intolerant to chemotherapy.\r\n50 people a day are diagnosed with cancer in Wales. We would be so grateful if you could help us promote our cause and help us in our fight for access to Avastin.\r\nTogether, with others in need of similar treatment, we are hoping to put pressure on the Welsh Assembly to review their decision and make Avastin more widely available to those who could benefit from it.\r\nThankl you\r\nMary Jones and family",
