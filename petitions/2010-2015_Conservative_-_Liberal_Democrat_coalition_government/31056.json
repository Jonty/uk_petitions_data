        "additional_details": "We petition the government to create an independent report on how innovation can be used to create turnaround and profitability.\r\n\r\nIt is said: the factories are loss making.\r\nThe question must be how can we innovate to make them work, not when do we close. We call for an independent innovation group to be tasked with a turnaround report.\r\n\r\nIt is said: they segregate disabled from society.\r\nIt is not the case. Able bodied should go to these factories, why the other way around?\r\n\r\nIt is said: things will work out:\r\nIt will cause social distress. Mr Gray at the Penzance plant, a health and safety officer, said closure would cause staff \"real problems\" in their lives. He said: \"The trouble is, being disabled ... their only social contact is coming to work\". For many \"it's the only hot meal they get many days as we've a canteen here.\u201d \"They will just fade away, just fade into the background.\"\r\n",
