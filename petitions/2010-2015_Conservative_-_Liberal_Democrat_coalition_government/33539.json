        "additional_details": "Day Nursery wages are not enough. How can a Nursery Assistant aged 21+ be paid minimum wage of \u00a36.08 per hour? People working in shops get paid the same amount or sometimes higher. This needs to change and it must change. Nursery Assistants act as a second parent to many children as well as a Nurse, a Carer, and a Teacher. How can a qualified Nursery Assistant be paid the same minimum wage as those who work on checkouts for example? An increase in childcare wages is urgent.\r\n\r\nIt also must be questioned how carers of the elderly can get \u00a38.00 or more per hour when Childcare workers do the same amount of work but with many children. Children are our future. Let's start acting like it and pay childcare workers the wage they truly deserve.",
