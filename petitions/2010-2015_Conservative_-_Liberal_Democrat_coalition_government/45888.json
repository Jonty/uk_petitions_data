The NHS currently dismiss this issue as cosmetic although it can cause tightness of the neck muscles, facial deformation etc.\r\nPresently the NHS guidelines are to repostion the babies head and keep them off the flat spot and use repostioning techniques. Advise as always varies with postcode and area with severe cases being dismissed as cosmetic, although going on to call it a deformity and parents being forced to take the costly route of private treatment.",
