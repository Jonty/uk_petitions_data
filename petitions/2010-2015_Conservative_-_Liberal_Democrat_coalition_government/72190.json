Without proper controls, it is impossible for local authorities to exercise the existing powers that they have under local bye-laws.\r\n\r\nMature technology exists for dogs to be micro-chipped and this should be mandatory. The vet carrying out the micro-chipping should mandatorily then submit the details of the dog, its micro-chip and the owner, to the local authority in the area where the owner resides.\r\n\r\nThe law should be changed to bring this into force.",
