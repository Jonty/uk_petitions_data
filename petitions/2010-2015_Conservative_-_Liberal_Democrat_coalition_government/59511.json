        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the government to reform the laws of cannabis to bring it in line with laws regarding alcohol and tobacco based on scientific evidence and obvious benefits to society, such as removing the enormous associated black market from criminal hands and regulating the market, to prevent contaminants reaching those who choose to use it, removing the accessibility of cannabis to minors and taxing the market. We petition the government to respect the civil liberties of those who choose to use a drug that has been shown to be far less dangerous to the user and society as currently legal and regulated drugs like alcohol, that currently causes very little harm to society other than consequences of its prohibition such as criminal gangs thriving.",
