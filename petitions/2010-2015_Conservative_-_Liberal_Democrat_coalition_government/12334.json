        "additional_details": "The smoking ban within pubs and clubs is forcing the closure of many of these premises due to lack of customers as they are put off by not being able to smoke indoors. I propose that the government introduce a smoking license that a landlord can purchase allowing smoking within their premises. with this method of giving the choice to the owner it will eliminate the problem of customers being deterred from being within a social enviroment and thus will help the economy recover due to increased spending within smoking premises.",
