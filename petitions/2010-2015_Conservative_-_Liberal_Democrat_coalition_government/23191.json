        "additional_details": "this petition has been started by me because i think that a change in how judgement is based in civil law should be more along the lines of beyond reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nthe law is flawed. if a judgement can be based on probability then it dosnt matter if you are liable or responsible or whether the claimant can prove that you are. the odds are stacked againts you and there is nothing you can do.\r\n\r\nfor example: if you park you car in a parking space with a time limit. the traffic warden sees your car and marks down your tyre valve positions by indicating on a 12hr clock face. you leave the parking space and return outside the permitted time limit. the traffic warden then sees your car for the 2nd time and again marks down your tyre valve position and it is the same as before he will issue a parking ticket. the probability is 144-1. a probability of 144-1 is not enough for anyone to be told they are wrong.",
