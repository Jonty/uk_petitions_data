        "action": "Stop IR35 for pensioner workers not registered for VAT",
        "additional_details": "Some HMG IT projects fail \u2013 costing taxpayers million of pounds. Some of the failure results from IR35 driving independent thoughtful mature business services consultants out of the market, depriving projects of essential mature numerate good sense. It\u2019s time for an HMRC ESC [Extra Statutory Concession] to stop IR35 for all workers older than State Pension Age, if their alleged personal service business has a total annual revenue less than the VAT Registration Level, currently \u00a379,000, & if it\u2019s not registered for VAT. This results in maximum daily rates including expenses less than \u00a3400 a day, which seems reasonable compared with the daily allowances for attendees of the House of Lords, e.g. \u00a3300 a day. Encouraging Old Age Pensioners who wish to work may mean dementia is staved off, resulting in NHS costs savings. The saving of worry for an OAP may be considerable. The direct loss of IR35 revenue \u2013 due to the ESC set out in this e-petition \u2013 to HM Treasury is estimated to be NIL.",
