        "additional_details": "I am asking the government to create a National Emergency Services Day. These people put their lives on hold to serve their communities,often in very dangerous circumstances.\r\nThey work tirelessly each and every day to protect us, rescue us and treat us in times of danger, tragedy and accident. This werk we saw two of these people ambushed,gunned down and killed by an evil monster. They were responding to a call for help and their reward was to be slaughtered.\r\nWe have an armed forces day (quite rightly so as well), but in this day and age when life is difficult our emergency services continue to give their all to keep us safe, well and to keep danger from society.\r\nWe ask the government to introduce a national Emergrncy Serviced Day to acknowledge the sacrifices made by these men and woman in blue,green and red.",
