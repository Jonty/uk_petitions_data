        "additional_details": "We feel the creation of the North East region was poorly handled and inapropriately named but more significantly the borders are all wrong. We would like our region to be restored to closely resemble its historical borders and renamed Northumbria. This would involve the region currently known as North East England expanding to include Cumbria. We are proud of being English, we are proud of being British, we do not want to change that. We merely want recognition of our history, our former kingdom. This accounts for many of the reasons why The North East Devolution Referendum resulted in a NO vote, we do not disagree with the concept of devolution, we disagree with the way it was done and how the EU and UK Governments disected our region so insencitively. Please restore Northumbria.",
