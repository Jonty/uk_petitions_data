        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the government to remove the permit tipping system at Civic Amenity and Tip sites, due to the wholly unfair nature of the system which precludes private owners of 4x4, pick up, small van, minibus and trailered vehicles from receiving the same services as other private vehicle owners. This system is discriminatory to many people who need theses type of vehicles privately, and the system itself can only be seen to encourage illegal fly tipping by people turned away from sites.",
