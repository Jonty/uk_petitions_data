        "additional_details": "As a student Health Visitor at Southampton University.  I find it alarming that soya-based infant formulas do not come with a health warning for all parents to see. 1 to 2% of babies within Britain are fed soya-based formula before six months.  Within soya there is a compound called phytoestrogens, when high levels are ingested there is a potential risk for girls in later life to experience increased duration and discomfort of menstruation.  The evidence also suggests that boys who have vegetarian mothers are five times more likely to have genital abnormalities.  This evidence has been linked to recent experimental work on rodents and marmosets; therefore, further research into the long-term effects of phytoestrogen exposure is needed. Parents need to know the health implications of high levels of phytoestrogen ingested by new born babies.\r\n\r\nSoya milk formulas should be put onto prescription only or a highly visible warning to consult a healthcare professional prior to use.\r\n\r\n",
