        "additional_details": "I am petitioning for the MP wages to be decreased. As of 2010, the annual salary of an MP was at \u00a365,738, totalling over \u00a342,000,000 for the 650 MPs in the house of commons. When you consider that the current minimum wage is at a meagre \u00a36.19 per hour, averaging at around \u00a312,000 per annum for someone in full-time work, it seems unreasonable for MPs to be entitled to this amount when their constituents from low-income families are receiving a comparatively low wage. Even taking into account the current average for all employee's across the UK, at \u00a326,664, it is evident that the wages for an MP is drastically higher than that of a typical constituent. If we were to reduce the current salary to just \u00a350,000 per annum, we could save around \u00a310,000,000 per year to cut the deficit, reduce borrowing and put steps towards improving our economy as a whole, instead of cutting benefits from those who need it the most.",
