        "action": "Cut the abortion limit up to 18 weeks",
        "additional_details": "As a part of our GCSE Citizenship Coursework we need to campaign about the issue that we are interested in. We decided to choose the issue about abortion. We think that previous limit of abortion is too high. We suggest that most acceptable limit would be 18 weeks. However we are completely against abortion but we want to firstly cut the limit by few weeks. We want government to talk about that issue in parliament. Abortion is termination of unborn, innocent human being. Here are some reasons why we want to cut the limit of abortion:\r\n*it affects not just the unborn baby, it also affects the mother's life or health\r\n*fetus at the for example 20 week stage is more developed than fetus in the 18 or 16 weeks\r\n*we believe that life begins at the conception\r\n\r\nIf you agree with us, please sign up about petition, it would be very useful!\r\n",
