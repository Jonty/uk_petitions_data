        "additional_details": "It is clear to anyone dealing with Local Councils for business and domestic matters, that they have been given too much power for their abilities. They do not appear to be able to provide a proportionate response to any area they are responsible for, preferring over complicated, rigid and unworkable processes to something that actually works for the people they serve. I suggest before they are given any more areas of responsibility they are trained in interpreting guidance and implementing policy. I further suggest tests should be imposed for both the executives and the elected members to ensure they have the intellectual capacity to gain a clear understanding of the areas they are expected to manage on our behalf.",
