        "additional_details": "We need a bill passed to give Kinship Carers the same Financial Support, Rights and Practical Support that Foster Carers receive. We go through the same scrutiny, assessments and checks. We have to get approved by the Adoption panel. We get forced to leave our careers/jobs and go on benefits to enable us to have our Grandchildren otherwise they get adopted. As a direct result we are then in serious debt as the monthly Direct Debits cannot be paid, we lose our car and potentially our home that we have worked our entire life for. All because I was doing the right thing for my Grandchild. The Local Authorities don't want to assist financially, so create child poverty and deprivation. Where are their morals and ethics? Anyone could have this happen and I am sure there must be loads of Grandparents who have had a similar experience",
