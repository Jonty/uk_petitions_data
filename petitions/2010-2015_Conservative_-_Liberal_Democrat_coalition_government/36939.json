        "additional_details": "We are concerned that Cambridge City Council are now putting in fencing to the Barnwell Road Common in order to herd cows onto this piece of land.\r\nThis piece of land is very popular with dog walkers as it is one of the few safe places. Most of the dogs walkers meet each other every day. This is not just about \"walking the dogs\", it also serves to increase social interaction.\r\nThere are many other places in Cambridge which already has cows grazing.\r\nWe feel that our views have not been sought during the planning process and that the Council have sought to do this due to the revenue that will be generated.\r\nNeither myself or any other dog walker has had any consultationon the common by the city council, niether has any  information about this plan been provided by the council. We have noticed signs stating that the fencing was being improved. We have been informed by the workmen why the fencing in being improved - to herd the cattle around the football field to the common land.\r\n",
