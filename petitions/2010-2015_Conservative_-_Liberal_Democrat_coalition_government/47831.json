        "additional_details": "On average the wage of an apprentice is \u00a3100 a week however up to 20% of that wage is spent on travelling to their place of work. Having a half fare travel card would make a big difference for an apprentices wage and would encourage more to choose the apprentice route. Many young people are put off the idea of choosing to go down the route of an apprentice as they would not earn very much after paying money towards the likes of travel, food, and other living expenses so I believe a half fare travel cars would make a big difference in encouraging more young people to choose to kick start their career as an apprentice and furthermore helping with the youth employment problems.
