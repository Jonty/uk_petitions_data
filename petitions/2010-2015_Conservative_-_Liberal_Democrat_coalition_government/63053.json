        "action": "Save Blue Mountain Golf and Conference Centre, Binfield - KEEP the legal agreement protecting this land from development",
        "additional_details": "Despite HUGE public opposition, Bracknell Forest Council controversially plans to redevelop land at Blue Mountain, removing a protective legal agreement and covenant signed in 1990, that the land be preserved as a green gap and for recreation as a golf course and conference centre. Many homes on the original site also have reference to this covenant in their own deeds\r\n\r\nThe impact of some 450 homes and 2 schools and moving Bracknell Town football club to this site, PLUS plans for over 2600 homes nearby, will be profound.  Blue Mountain is a thriving sports and conferencing facility \u2013 popular with golfers, the local community and beyond\r\n\r\nWe ask the Secretary of State to use his powers under section 77, Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and agree to call-in any planning application for this site and to appoint an inspector to hold a Public Inquiry on the matter.\r\n\r\nwww.savebluemountain.org\r\n\r\n\r\n",
