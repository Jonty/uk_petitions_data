        "additional_details": "The Barnett formula was quite rightly created many years ago to help the Celtic regions who had been left to decay. However, I beleive the Barnett formula is no longer relevant or necessary as all three Celtic regions have enjoyed vast regeneration, brand new public transport and substantial rebuilding of schools and hospitals. This has happened while budgets covering English public services have been restrained and English people have been denied certain benefits that are enjoyed by their counterparts in other parts of the union. I beleive that given the colossal budget deficit and national debt, this largesse cannot continue and all parts of the union should have their spending brought down to the levels (per head) of England.",
